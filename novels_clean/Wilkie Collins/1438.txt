little wilderness of shingle withered grassthe desolate end of aldborough lonely beginning of slaughden be dull airless evening eastward be gray majesty of sea hushed in breathless calm horizon line invisibly melting into monotonous misty sky idle ship shadowy still on idle water southward high ridge of sea dike grim massive circle of martello tower reared high on mound of grass closed view darkly on lay beyond westward lurid streak of sunset glowed red in dreary heaven blackened fringing tree on far border of great inland marsh turned little gleaming water pool to pool of blood nearer to eye sullen flow of tidal river alde ebbed noiselessly from muddy bank nearer still lonely unprosperous by bleak water side lay lost little port of slaughden with forlorn wharf warehouse of decaying wood few scattered coasting vessel deserted on oozy river shore fall of wave be heard on beach trickling of water bubbled audibly from idle stream now then cry of sea bird rose from region of marsh at interval from farmhouse far in inland waste faint winding of horn to call cattle home traveled mournfully through evening calm magdalen drew hand from captain arm led way to mound of martello tower be weary of walking said let stop rest here seated on slope resting on elbow mechanically pulled up scattered from into air tuft of grass growing under hand after silently occupying in way for minute

marriage voice faltered a began question left unfinished after marriage said will stand in further need of assistance captain stooped a gave that answer looked close at suddenly drew back without uttering word walked away pace sat down again doggedly on grass if magdalen must have seen face in dying light face must have startled for first time probably since boyhood captain wragge have changed color be deadly pale have nothing to say to asked perhaps be waiting to hear what term have to offer be term pay expense here when part on day of marriage take farewell gift away with of two hundred

door with fee in pocket paid from money in own possession certainly how else must pay captain wragge took off hat passed handkerchief over face with air of relief give minute to consider said a many minute a like rejoined reclining on bank in former position returning to former occupation of tearing up tuft of grass flinging out into air captain reflection be not complicated by unnecessary divergence from contemplation of own position to contemplation of magdalen utterly incapable of appreciating injury done by frank infamous treachery to engagementan injury have severed at one cruel blow from aspiration delusion though be have be saving aspiration of lifecaptain wragge accepted simple fact of despair just a found then looked straight to consequence of proposal have made to in prospect before marriage saw nothing more serious involved than practice of deception in important degree differentexcept in end to be attained by itfrom deception vagabond life have long since accustomed to contemplate to carry out in prospect after marriage dimly discerned through ominous darkness of future lurking phantom of terror crime black gulf behind of ruin death man of boundless audacity resource within own mean limit beyond limit captain be a deferentially submissive to majesty of law a most harmless man in existence a cautious in looking after own personal safety a veriest coward that ever walked earth one serious question now filled mind must on term proposed to join conspiracy against noel vanstone up to point of marriage then withdraw from without risk of involving in consequence experience told must certainly ensue strange a may seem decision in emergency be mainly influenced by le person than noel vanstone captain might have resisted money offer magdalen have made to himfor profit of entertainment have filled pocket with more than three time two hundred pound prospect of dealing blow in dark at man who have estimated information at value of five pound note proved too much for caution self control on small neutral ground of self importance best men worst meet on same term captain wragges indignation when saw answer to advertisement stooped to retrospective estimate of own conduct be a deeply offended a sincerely angry a if have made perfectly honorable proposal have be rewarded for by personal insult have be too full of own grievance to keep out of first letter to magdalen have more le forgotten on subsequent occasion when noel vanstones name be mentioned in now finally deciding course must take be not too much to say that motive of money receded for first time in life into second place motive of malice carried day accept term said captain wragge getting briskly on leg again subject of course to condition agreed on between part

hour time have made acquainted with incident have happened in vauxhall walk conclusion captain drew after gaining information be clear easily stated on adverse side of question expressed conviction that mr lecount have certainly detected visitor to be disguised that have never really left room though might have opened shut door that on occasion therefore when magdalen have be betrayed into speaking in own voice mr lecount have heard on favorable side of question be perfectly satisfied that painted face eyelid wig padded cloak have so effectually concealed magdalen identity that might in own person defy housekeeper closest scrutiny so far a matter of appearance be concerned difficulty of deceiving mr lecounts ear a well a eye be readily admitted not so easily to be disposed of looking to fact magdalen on occasion when have forgotten have spoken in heat of anger be of opinion that voice have reasonable chance of escaping detection if carefully avoided outburst of temper for future spoke in more composed ordinary tone mr lecount have not yet heard upon whole captain be inclined to pronounce prospect hopeful if one serious obstacle be cleared away at outsetthat obstacle being

legacy reaching from remote unexpected quarter mr wragges case when married be one of elderly female relative shared favor of fortune on occasion with wife if only keep up domestic appearance happen to know mr wragge will prove second time profitable to on elderly relative death for circumstance must probably long since have transferred wife to care of society at agreeable conviction that if didnt support somebody else must although cant afford to take course see objection to having comfortably boarded lodged out of way for time beingsay at retired farm house in character of lady in infirm mental health must find expense trifling must find relief unutterable what do say will pack up at once take away by next coach replied magdalen firmly poor creature life be hard enough already

manner while magdalen now looked at other be plain at outset that true face figure now saw recalled nothing to mind of false face figure have seen in vauxhall walk disguise have evidently be complete enough even to baffle penetration of mr lecount aunt came here yesterday evening said magdalen found latter part of journey very fatiguing dare say found so too designedly made answer longer than be necessary for purpose of discovering at earliest opportunity effect sound of voice produced on mr lecount housekeeper thin lip maintained motherly smile housekeeper amiable manner lost none of modest deference expression of eye suddenly changed from look of attention to look of inquiry magdalen quietly said few word more then waited again for result change spread gradually over mr lecounts face motherly smile died away amiable manner betrayed slight touch of restraint still sign of positive recognition appeared housekeeper expression remained what have be from firstan expression of inquiry nothing more complained of fatigue sir few minute since said dropping further conversation with magdalen addressing master will go indoors rest proprietor of sea view cottage have hitherto confined to bowing simpering admiring magdalen through half closed eyelid there be mistaking sudden flutter agitation in manner heightened color in wizen little face even reptile temperament of noel vanstone warmed under influence of sex have undeniably appreciative eye for handsome woman magdalen grace beauty be not thrown away on will go indoors sir rest asked housekeeper repeating quest ion not yet

smiled smirked in highest approval of ingenuity of own complimentfrom captain wragge dexterously diverted housekeeper attention by ranging on side of path speaking to at same moment four walked on slowly mr lecount said nothing more kept fast hold of master arm looked across at magdalen with dangerous expression of inquiry more marked than ever in handsome black eye that look be not lost on wary wragge shifted indicative camp stool from left hand to right opened scientific battery on spot busy scene mr lecount said captain politely waving camp stool over sea passing ship greatness of england maamthe true greatness of england pray observe how heavily of vessel be laden be often inclined to wonder whether british sailor be at aware when have got cargo on board of hydrostatic importance of operation that have performed if be suddenly transported to deck of one of ship heaven forbid for suffer at sea if said to member of crew jack have done wonder have grasped theory of floating vesselshow gallant fellow must stare yet on theory jack life depends if load vessel one part more than ought what happens sail past aldborough grant in safety enters thames grant again in safety get on into fresh water a far let say a greenwich anddown go down maam to bottom of river a matter of scientific certainty here paused left mr lecount polite alternative to request explanation with infinite pleasure maam said captain drowning in deepest note of voice feeble treble in noel vanstone paid compliment to magdalen will start if please with first principle body float on surface of water displace a much fluid a be equal in weight to weight of body good have got first principle what do deduce from manifestly that in order to keep vessel above water be necessary to take care that vessel cargo will be of le weight than weight of quantity of waterpray follow hereof quantity of water equal in bulk to part of vessel will be safe to immerse in water now maam salt water be specifically thirty time heavier than fresh river water vessel in german ocean will not sink so deep a vessel in thames consequently when load ship with view to london market have hydrostatically speaking three alternative load with one part le than can carry at sea take one part out at mouth of river do one other a have already have honor of remarkingdown go such said captain shifting camp stool back again from right hand to left in token that joyce be done with for time being such dear madam be theory of floating vessel permit to add in conclusion be heartily welcome to thank sir said mr lecount have unintentionally saddened information have received be not le precious on account be long long ago mr bygrave since have heard addressed in language of science dear husband made companionmy dear husband improved mind a have be trying to improve nobody have taken pain with intellect since many thanks sir kind consideration for be not thrown away sighed with plaintive humility privately opened ear to conversation on other side of minute earlier must have heard master expressing in most flattering term on subject of miss bygraves appearance in sea side costume magdalen have seen captain wragges signal with camp stool have at once diverted noel vanstone to topic of possession by neatly timed question about house at aldborough dont wish to alarm miss bygrave be first word of noel vanstones caught mr lecounts attention there be only one safe house in aldborough house be mine sea may destroy other housesit cant destroy mine father took care of father be remarkable man have house built on pile have reason to believe be strongest pile in england nothing can possibly knock downi dont care what sea doesnothing can possibly knock down then if sea invades said magdalen must run for refuge to noel vanstone saw way to compliment at same moment wary captain saw way to burst of science must almost wish invasion might happen murmured one of gentleman to give happiness of offering refuge must almost swear wind have shifted again exclaimed other where be man can ask oh there be boatman hows wind now norwest by west stillhey southeast by south yesterday eveningha be there anything more remarkable mr lecount than variableness of wind in climate proceeded captain shifting camp stool to scientific side of be there natural phenomenon more bewildering to scientific inquirer will tell that electric fluid abounds in air be principal cause of variableness will remind of experiment of illustrious philosopher who measured velocity of great storm by flight of small feather dear madam grant proposition beg pardon sir said mr lecount kindly attribute to knowledge dont posse proposition regret to say be quite beyond dont misunderstand maam continued captain politely unconscious of interruption remark apply to temperate zone only place on coast beyond tropicsplace where wind blow toward shore in day time toward sea by nightand instantly advance toward conclusive experiment for example know that heat of sun during day rarefies air over land so cause wind challenge to prove escort down kitchen stair with kind permission take largest pie dish out of

disagreeablebut experiment be conclusive shifted camp stool back again looked at mr lecount with ingratiating smile dont find long winded maamdo said in easy cheerful way just a housekeeper be privately opening ear once more to conversation on other side of be amazed sir by range of information replied mr lecount observing captain with perplexitybut thus far with distrust thought eccentric even for englishman possibly little vain of knowledge have at least paid implied compliment of addressing knowledge to herself felt more sensibly from having hitherto found scientific sympathy with deceased husband treated with great respect by people with whom came in contact have extended inquiry sir proceeded after momentary hesitation to late husband branch of science merely ask mr bygrave because though be only woman think might exchange idea with on subject of reptile creation captain wragge be far too sharp to risk ready made science on enemy ground old militia man shook wary head too vast subject maam said for smatterer like life labor of such philosopher a husband mr lecount warn men of intellectual caliber not to measure with giant may inquire proceeded captain softly smoothing way for future intercourse with sea view cottage whether posse scientific memorial of late professor posse tank sir said mr lecount modestly casting eye on ground one of subjectsa little foreign toad tank exclaimed captain in tone of mournful interest toad pardon blunt way of speaking mind maam posse object of public interest a one of public acknowledge curiosity to see mr lecounts smooth cheek colored with pleasure one assailable place in cold secret nature be place occupied by memory of professor pride in scientific achievement mortification at finding little known out of own country be genuine feeling never have captain wragge burned adulterated incense on flimsy altar of human vanity to better purpose than be burning now be very good sir said mr lecount in honoring husband memory honor though kindly treat on footing of equality must not forget fill domestic situation will feel privilege to show relic if will allow to ask master permission first turned to noel vanstone perfectly sincere intention of making proposed request minglingin strange complexity of motif be found so much oftener in woman mind than in manswith jealous distrust of impression magdalen have produced on master may make request sir asked mr lecount after waiting moment to catch fragment of tenderly personal talk might reach after being again neatly baffled by magdalenthanks to camp stool mr bygrave be one of few person in england who appreciate husband scientific labor honor by wishing to see little world of reptile may show to by mean lecount said noel vanstone graciously be excellent creature like to oblige lecounts tank mr bygrave be only tank in englandlecounts toad be oldest toad in world will come drink tea at seven oclock to night will prevail on miss bygrave to accompany want to see house dont think have idea what strong house be come survey premise miss bygrave will have stick rap on wall will go upstairs stamp on floor then will hear what cost eye wrinkled up cunningly at corner slipped tender speech into magdalen ear under cover of predominating voice in captain wragge thanked for invitation come punctually at seven whispered pray wear that charming mr lecounts lip closed ominously set down captain niece a very serious drawback to intellectual luxury of captain society be fatiguing sir said to master be one of bad day let recommend to be careful let beg to walk back having carried point by inviting new acquaintance to tea noel vanstone proved to be unexpectedly docile acknowledged that be little fatigued turned back at once in obedience to housekeeper advice take arm sirtake arm on other side said captain wragge a turned to retrace step party colored eye looked significantly at magdalen while spoke warned not to stretch mr lecounts endurance too far at starting instantly understood in spite of noel vanstones reiterated assertion that stood in need of captain arm placed at once by housekeeper side mr lecount recovered good humor opened conversation with magdalen by making one inquiry of others under existing circumstance be hardest to answer presume mr bygrave be too tired after journey to come out to day said mr lecount will have pleasure of seeing tomorrow probably not replied magdalen aunt be in delicate health complicated case dear madam added captain conscious that mr wragges personal appearance if happened to be seen by accident must offer flattest of possible contradiction to what magdalen have just said of there be remote nervous mischief doesnt express externally must think wife picture of health if looked at yet so delusive be appearance be obliged to forbid excitement see societyour medical attendant regret to say absolutely prohibits very sad said mr lecount poor lady must often feel lonely sir when niece be away from replied captain mr bygrave be naturally domestic woman when be able to employ find unlimited resource in needle thread having reached stage of explanation having purposely skirted a be round confines of truth in event of housekeeper curiosity leading to make private inquiry on subject of mr wragge captain wisely checked fluent tongue from carrying into further detail have great hope from air of place remarked in conclusion iodine a have already observed doe wonder mr lecount acknowledged virtue of iodine in briefest possible form of word withdrew into innermost sanctuary of own thought mystery here said housekeeper to herself lady who look picture of health lady who suffers from complicated nervous malady lady whose hand be steady enough to use needle threadis living mass of contradiction dont quite understand do make long stay at aldborough sir added aloud eye resting for moment in steady scrutiny on captain face depends dear madam on mr bygrave trust will stay through autumn be settled at sea view cottage presume for season must ask master sir be for to decide not for answer be unfortunate one noel vanstone have be secretly annoyed by change in walking arrangement have separated from magdalen attributed that change to meddling influence of mr lecount now took earliest opportunity of resenting on spot have nothing to do with stay at aldborough broke out peevishly know a well a do lecount depends on mr lecount have brother in switzerland went on addressing to captaina brother who be seriously ill if get worse will have to go there to see cant

looking pointedly at magdalen across housekeeper must stay at aldborough through autumn with greatest pleasure with greatest pleasure reiterated repeating word with tender look for magdalen spiteful accent for mr lecount thus far captain wragge have remained silent carefully noting in mind promising possibility of separation between mr lecount master noel vanstones little fretful outbreak have just disclosed to ominous trembling in housekeeper thin lip a master openly exposed family affair before stranger openly set jealously at defiance now warned to interfere if misunderstanding be permitted to proceed to extremity there be chance that invitation for evening to sea view cottage might be put off now a ever equal to occasion captain wragge called useful information once more to rescue under learned auspex of joyce plunged for third time into ocean of science brought up pearl be still haranguing on pneumatics time still improving mr lecounts mind with politest perseverance smoothest flow of languagewhen walking party stopped at noel vanstones door bless soul here be at house sir said captain interrupting in middle of one of graphic sentence wont keep standing moment not word of apology mr lecount beg pray will put curious point in pneumatics more clearly before on future occasion in meantime need only repeat that can perform experiment have just mentioned to own entire satisfaction with bladder exhausted receiver square box at seven oclock evening sirat seven oclock mr lecount have have remarkably pleasant walk most instructive interchange of idea now dear girl aunt be waiting for while mr lecount stepped aside to open garden gate noel vanstone seized opportunity shot last tender glance at magdalen under shelter of umbrella have taken into own hand for express purpose dont forget said with sweetest smile dont forget when come evening to wear that charming hat before must add last word mr lecount glided back to place sheltering umbrella changed hand again immediately excellent morning work said captain wragge a magdalen walked on together to north shingle joyce have three done wonder have secured friendly invitation at first day fishing for paused for answer receiving none observed magdalen more attentively than have observed yet face have turned deadly pale again eye looked out mechanically straight before in heedless reckless despair what be matter asked with greatest surprise be ill made reply hardly seemed to hear be getting alarmed about mr lecount inquired next there be not least reason for alarm may fancy have heard something like voice before face evidently bewilders keep temper keep in dark keep in dark will put two hundred pound into hand before autumn be over waited again for answer again remained silent captain tried for third time in direction did get letter morning went on be there bad news again from home fresh difficulty with sister say nothing about sister broke out passionately be fit to speak of said word at garden gate hurried into house by followed heard door of own room violently shut to violently locked double locked solacing indignation by oath captain wragge sullenly went into one of parlor on ground floor to look after wife room communicated with smaller darker room at back of house by mean of quaint little door with window in upper half of softly approaching door captain lifted white muslin curtain hung over window looked into inner room there be mr wragge with cap on one side shoe down at heel with row of pin between teeth with oriental cashmere robe slowly slipping off table with scissors suspended uncertain in one hand written direction for dressmaking held doubtfully in otherso absorbed over invincible difficulty of employment a to be perfectly unconscious that be at moment object of husband superintending eye under other circumstance must have be soon brought to sense of situation by sound of voice captain wragge be too anxious about magdalen to waste time on wife after satisfying that be safe in seclusion that might be trusted to remain there left parlor after little hesitation in passage stole upstairs listened anxiously outside magdalen door dull sound of sobbinga sound stifled in handkerchief stifled in bed clotheswas caught ear returned at once to ground floor with faint suspicion of truth dawning on mind at last devil take that sweetheart of hers thought captain mr noel vanstone have raised ghost of at starting chapter v when magdalen appeared in parlor shortly before seven oclock not trace of discomposure be visible in manner looked spoke a quietly unconcernedly a usual lowering distrust on captain wragges face cleared away at sight of there have be moment during afternoon when have seriously doubted whether pleasure of satisfying grudge owed to noel vanstone prospect of earning sum of two hundred pound must not be dearly purchased by running risk of discovery to magdalen uncertain temper might expose at hour of day plain proof now before of power of self control relieved mind of serious anxiety mattered little to captain what suffered in privacy of own chamber a long a came out of with face must bear inspection voice betrayed nothing on way to sea view cottage captain wragge expressed intention of asking housekeeper few sympathizing question on subject of invalid brother in switzerland be of opinion that critical condition of gentleman health might exercise important influence on future progress of conspiracy chance of separation remarked between housekeeper master be under existing circumstance chance merited closest investigation if can only get mr lecount out of way at right time whispered captain a opened host garden gate man be caught in minute more magdalen be again under noel vanstones roof time in character of own invited guest proceeding of evening be for most part repetition of proceeding during morning walk noel vanstone vibrated between admiration of magdalen beauty glorification of own possession captain wragges inexhaustible outburst of informationrelieved by delicately indirect inquiry relating to mr lecounts brotherperpetually diverted housekeeper jealous vigilance from dwelling on look language of master so evening passed until ten oclock by time captain ready made science be exhausted housekeeper temper be forcing way to surface once more captain wragge warned magdalen by look in spite of noel vanstones hospitable protest wisely rose to say good night have got information remarked captain on way back mr lecounts brother life at zurich be bachelor posse little money sister be nearest relation if will only be so obliging a to break up altogether will save world of trouble with mr lecount be fine moonlight night looked round at magdalen a said word to see if intractable depression of spirit have seized on again variable humor have changed once more looked about with flaunting feverish gayety scoffed at bare idea of serious difficulty with mr lecount mimicked noel vanstones high pitched voice repeated noel vanstones high flown compliment with bitter enjoyment of turning into ridicule instead of running into house a before sauntered carelessly by companion side humming little snatch of song kicking loose pebble right left on garden walk captain hailed change in a best of good omen thought saw plain sign that family spirit be at last coming back again well said a lit bedroom candle for when meet on parade tomorrow will see a nautical friend say how land lie one thing can tell dear girli have used eye to very little purpose if there be not storm brewing tonight in mr noel vanstones domestic atmosphere captain habitual penetration have not misled a soon a door of sea view cottage be closed on parting guest mr lecount made effort to assert authority magdalen influence be threatening already employed artifice of be mistress to ascertain magdalen true position in noel vanstones estimation tried again again to lure into unconscious confession of pleasure felt already in society of beautiful miss bygrave twined in out of weakness in character a frog eft twined in out of rock work of aquarium made one serious mistake very clever people in intercourse with intellectual inferior be almost universally apt to commitshe trusted implicitly to folly of fool forgot that one of lowest of human qualitiescunningis exactly capacity be often most largely developed in lowest of intellectual nature if have be honestly angry with master must probably have frightened if have opened mind plainly to view must have astonished by presenting chain of idea to limited perception be not strong enough to grasp curiosity must have led to ask for explanation by practicing on curiosity might have have at mercy a be set cunning against fool proved match for noel vanstone to whom large minded motif under heaven be inscrutable mystery saw small minded motive at bottom of housekeeper conduct with a instantaneous penetration a if have be man of highest ability mr lecount left for night foiled knowing be foiledleft with tigerish side of uppermost low lived longing in elegant finger nail to set in master face be not woman to be beaten by one defeat by hundred be positively determined to think think again until have found mean of checking growing intimacy with bygraves at once forever in solitude of own room recovered composure set for first time to review conclusion have gathered from event of day there be something vaguely familiar to in voice of miss bygrave at same time in unaccountable contradiction something strange to a well face figure of young lady be entirely new to be striking face striking figure if have seen either at former period must certainly have remembered miss bygrave be unquestionably stranger yet have got no further than during day must get further now chain of thought broke mind took up fragment formed chain attached to lady who be kept in seclusionto aunt who looked well yet be nervous who be nervous yet able to ply needle thread incomprehensible resemblance to unremembered voice in niece unintelligible malady kept aunt secluded from public view extraordinary range of scientific cultivation in uncle associated with coarseness audacity of manner by mean suggested idea of man engaged in studious pursuitswere member of small family of three what seemed on surface of with question on mind went to bed a soon a candle be out darkness seemed to communicate inexplicable perversity to thought wandered back from present thing to past in spite of brought old master back to life again revived forgotten saying doings in english circle at zurich veered away to old man death bed at brighton moved from brighton to london entered bare comfortless room at vauxhall walk set aquarium back in place on kitchen table put false miss garth in chair by side of shading inflamed eye from light placed anonymous letter letter glanced darkly at conspiracy in hand again brought with into master presence recalled discussion about filling in blank space in advertisement quarrel followed when told noel vanstone that sum have offered be preposterously small revived old doubt have not troubled for week pasta doubt whether threatened conspiracy have evaporated in mere word whether master be likely to hear of again at point thought broke off once more there be momentary blank next instant started up in bed heart beating violently head whirling a if have lost sens with electric suddenness mind pieced together scattered multitude of thought put before plainly under one intelligible form in mastering agitation of moment clapped hand together cried out suddenly in darkness miss vanstone again got out of bed kindled light once more steady a nerve be shock of own suspicion have shaken firm hand trembled a opened dressing case took from little bottle of sal volatile in spite of smooth cheek well preserved hair looked year of age a mixed spirit with water greedily drank wrapping dressing gown round sat down on bedside to get possession again of calmer self be quite incapable of tracing mental process have led to discovery must not get sufficiently far from to see that half formed conclusion on subject of bygraves have ended in making that family object of suspicion to that association of idea have thereupon carried mind back to that other object of suspicion be represented by conspiracy against master that two idea of two separate subject of distrust coming suddenly in contact have struck light be not able to reason back in way from effect to cause must only feel that suspicion have become more than suspicion already conviction must not have be more firmly rooted in mind looking back at magdalen by new light now thrown on mr lecount must fain have persuaded that recognized trace left of false miss garths face figure in graceful beautiful girl who have sat at master table hardly hour sincethat found resemblance now have never thought of before between angry voice have heard in vauxhall walk smooth well bred tone still hung on ear after evening experience downstairs must fain have persuaded that have reached result with undue straining of truth a really knew effort be in vain mr lecount be not woman to waste time thought in trying to impose on accepted inevitable conclusion that guesswork of moment have led to discovery more than that recognized plain truthunwelcome a wasthat conviction now fixed in own mind be thus far unsupported by single fragment of producible evidence to justify to mind of others under circumstance be safe course to take with master if candidly told when met next morning what have passed through mind night knowledge of noel vanstone warned that one of two result must certainly happen must be angry disputatious must ask for proof finding none forthcoming must accuse of alarming without cause to serve own jealous end of keeping magdalen out of house must be seriously startled must clamor for protection of law must warn bygraves to stand on defense at outset if magdalen only have be concerned in plot latter consequence must have assumed no great importance in housekeeper mind seeing deception a now saw be far too clever woman to fail in estimating captain inexhaustible fertility of resource at true value if cant meet impudent villain with plain proof to help thought mr lecount may open master eye to morrow morning mr bygrave will shut up again before night rascal be playing with own card under table will win game to certainty if see hand at starting policy of waiting be so manifestly wise policythe wily mr bygrave be so sure to have provided in case of emergency with evidence to prove identity niece have assumed for purposethat mr lecount at once decided to keep own counsel next morning to pause before attacking conspiracy until must produce unanswerable fact to help master acquaintance with bygraves be only acquaintance of one day standing there be fear of developing into dangerous intimacy if merely allowed to continue for few day more if permanently checked at latest in week time in period what measure must take to remove obstacle now stood in way to provide with weapon now wanted reflection showed three different chance in favorthree different way of arriving at necessary discovery first chance be to cultivate friendly term with magdalen then taking unawares to entrap into betraying in noel vanstones presence second chance be to write to elder miss vanstone to ask with alarming reason for putting question for information on subject of younger sister whereabouts of peculiarity in personal appearance might enable stranger to identify third chance be to penetrate mystery of mr bygraves seclusion to ascertain at personal interview whether invalid lady real complaint might not possibly be defective capacity for keeping husband secret resolving to try three chance in order in be here enumerated to set snare for magdalen on day be now already at hand mr lecount at last took off dressing gown allowed weaker nature to plead with for little sleep dawn be breaking over cold gray sea a lay down in bed again last idea in mind before fell asleep be characteristic of womanit be idea threatened captain have trifled with sacred memory of husband thought professor widow on life honor will make pay for early next morning magdalen began day according to agreement with captain by taking mr wragge out for little exercise at hour when there be fear of attracting public attention pleaded hard to be left at home having oriental cashmere robe still on mind feeling necessary to read direction for dressmaking for hundredth time at least before to use own expression must screw up courage to put scissors into stuff companion must take denial be forced to go out one guileless purpose of life magdalen now led be resolution poor mr wragge must not be made prisoner on account to resolution mechanically clung a last token left by knew better self returned later than usual to breakfast while mr wragge be upstairs straightening from head to foot to meet morning inspection of husband orderly eye while magdalen captain be waiting for in parlor servant came in with note from sea view cottage messenger be waiting for answer note be addressed to captain wragge captain opened note read line dear sir mr noel vanstone desire to write tell that proposes enjoying fine day by taking long drive to place on coast here called dunwich be anxious to know if will share expense of carriage give pleasure of company miss bygraves company on excursion be kindly permitted to be one of party if may say so without impropriety must venture to add that will feel a much pleasure a master if young lady will consent to join propose leaving aldborough punctually at eleven oclock believe dear sir humble servant virginie lecount who be letter from asked magdalen noticing change in captain wragges face a read what do want with at sea view cottage pardon said captain gravely requires consideration let have minute two to think took few turn up down room then suddenly stepped aside to table in corner on writing material be placed be not born yesterday maam said captain speaking jocosely to winked brown eye took up pen wrote answer can speak now inquired magdalen when servant have left room what doe that letter say how have answered captain placed letter in hand have accepted invitation replied quietly magdalen read letter hidden enmity yesterday said open friendship to day what doe mean mean said captain wragge mr lecount be even sharper than thought have found out impossible cried magdalen quite impossible in time cant say how have found out proceeded captain with perfect composure may know more of voice than supposed knew may have thought on reflection rather suspicious family anything suspicious in woman be concerned may have taken mind back to morning call of yours in vauxhall walk way may be meaning of sudden change be clear enough have found out want to put discovery to proof by slipping in awkward question two under cover of little friendly talk experience of humanity have be varied one mr lecount be not first sharp practitioner in petticoat whom have have to deal with world stage dear girl one of scene on little stage be shut in from moment with word took copy of joyce scientific dialogue out of pocket youre done with already friend said captain giving useful information farewell smack with hand locking up in cupboard such be human popularity continued indomitable vagabond putting key cheerfully in pocket yesterday joyce be in to day dont care that for snapped finger sat down to breakfast dont understand said magdalen looking at angrily be leaving to own resource for future dear girl cried captain wragge cant accustom to dash of humor yet have done with ready made science simply because be quite sure that mr lecount have done believing in havent accepted invitation to dunwich make mind easy help have given already count for nothing compared with help be going to give now honor be concerned in bowling out mr lecount last move of hers have made personal matter between woman actually think can take in cried captain striking knife handle on table in transport of virtuous indignation by heaven never be so insulted before in life draw chair in to table dear give minute

from meeting day on parade from carrying unpleasant impression of other into domestic establishment mine allow nothing unpleasant in establishment remarked noel vanstone im masteryou must have noticed that already mr bygraveim master doubt of dear sir to live morning noon night in perpetual exercise of authority be more like life of governor of prison than life of master of household wear tearconsider wear tear strike in light doe said noel vanstone soothed by captain wragges ready recognition of authority dont know that youre not right must take step directly wont be made

have to do be to refer to various consideration with happy choice of language in voice trembled with manly emotion did to perfection for first hour of interview allusion be made to delicate dangerous part of subject captain waited until have composed visitor when result be achieved came smoothly to point in term there be one little difficulty mr vanstone think have overlooked housekeeper recent conduct incline to fear that will view approaching change in life with anything friendly eye probably have not thought necessary yet to inform her of new tie propose to form noel vanstone turned pale

scene must be inevitable result unpleasant scene mr vanstone if opinion of housekeeper sanity be well founded something far more serious if opinion that intellect be unsettled happens to turn out right one dont say isnt opinion too rejoined noel vanstone especially after what have happened to day captain wragge immediately begged to know what event alluded to might be noel vanstone thereupon explainedwith infinite number of parenthesis referring to himselfthat mr lecount have put dreaded question relating to little note in master pocket barely hour since have answered inquiry a mr bygrave have advised on hearing that accuracy of personal description have be fairly put to test have failed in one important particular of mole on neck mr lecount have considered little have then asked

that only responsibility weak man ever accepts be responsibility can be perpetually pointed out to a resting exclusively on own shoulder be accustomed to set face against clandestine proceeding of kind said captain wragge there be exception to strictest rule be bound to admit mr vanstone that position in matter be exceptional position if ever there be one yet course have just proposedhowever unbecoming may think however distasteful may be to myselfwould not only spare very serious embarrassment to say least of must also protect from personal assertion of pecuniary claim on part of housekeeper to have already adverted be desirable result to achieveto say nothing of removal on side of apprehension of annoyance to niece on other hand however marriage solemnized with such privacy a propose must be hasty marriage for a be situated longer delay greater will be risk that secret may escape keeping be not against hasty marriage where mutual flame be fanned by adequate income own be

of truth be anxious to keep from do agree with so far unutterable apprehension closed noel vanstones lip must only reply by inclination of head very good said captain now sir may possibly have observed that be man of very original turn of mind if have not hitherto struck in light may then be necessary to mention that there be subject on persist in thinking for subject of marriage settlement

actual question of magdalen identity untouched to rest satisfied with convincing master of simple factthat young lady who be charming at north shingle disguised woman who have terrified in vauxhall walk be one same person mean of effecting new object be to appearance far le easy of attainment than mean of effecting object mr lecount have just resigned here help be to be expected from others ostensibly benevolent motif must be put forward a blindno appeal must be made to mr pendril to miss garth here housekeeper only chance of success depended in first place on being able to effect stolen entrance into mr bygraves house in second place on ability to discover whether memorable alpaca dress from have secretly cut fragment of stuff happened to form part of miss bygraves wardrobe taking difficulty now before in order a occurred mr lecount first resolved to devote next few day to watching habit of inmate of north shingle from early in morning to late at night to testing capacity of one servant in house to resist temptation of bribe assuming that result proved successful that by money by stratagem gained admission to north shingle without knowledge of mr bygrave niece turned next to second difficulty of twothe difficulty of obtaining access to miss bygraves wardrobe if servant proved corruptible obstacle in direction might be considered a removed beforehand if servant proved

remedy might have failed where be man to be found whose internal policy succumbs to revolution when man be on wrong side of fifty exercise change of place gave captain back into possession of recovered lost sense of flavor of cigar recalled wandering attention to question of approaching absence from aldborough few minute consideration satisfied mind that magdalen outbreak have forced to take course of others on fair review of existing emergency be now most desirable to adopt captain wragges inquiry on evening when magdalen have drunk tea at sea view have certainly informed that housekeeper brother possessed modest competence that sister be nearest living relative that there be unscrupulous cousin on spot who be anxious to usurp place in will properly belonged to mr lecount here be strong motif to take housekeeper to zurich when false report of brother relapse reached england if idea of noel vanstones true position dawned on in meantime who must say whether might not at eleventh hour prefer asserting large pecuniary interest in master to defending small pecuniary interest at brother bedside while question remained undecided plain necessity of checking growth of noel vanstones intimacy with family at north shingle did not admit of doubt of mean of effecting that object none must be le open to suspicion than temporary removal of household from residence at

closed on mr lecount descended from post of observation captain have rightly suspected her of occupying addressed inquiry to master captain have rightly foreseen must follow departure reply received produced one impression on mind at once set down a falsehood returned to own window to keep watch over north shingle more vigilantly than ever to utter astonishment after lapse of le than hour saw empty carriage draw up at mr bygraves door luggage be brought out packed on vehicle miss bygrave appeared took seat in be followed into carriage by lady of great size stature whom housekeeper

creature in be impenetrable mystery to submitting to circumstance with ready resignation captain wragge have not shown on side in similar situation mr lecount wasted time temper in unprofitable guess work left mystery to thicken to clear a future might decide looked exclusively at us to might put morning event in own interest might have become of family at north shingle servant be left behind

little a landlord of master plan must say about be that have not be dismissed that be to await receipt of note recalling when necessary to situation at north shingle not having expected to find better

miss bygraves wardrobe be known only to young lady to aunt in second place housekeeper ascertained that true reason of mr bygraves rigid seclusion be to be found in simple fact that be little better than idiot that husband be probably ashamed of allowing to be seen in public apparently trivial discovery enlightened mr lecount on very important point have be previously involved in doubt be now satisfied that likeliest way to obtaining private investigation of magdalen wardrobe lay through deluding imbecile lady not through bribing ignorant servant having reached that conclusionpregnant with coming assault on weakly fortified discretion of poor mr wraggethe housekeeper cautiously abstained from exhibiting longer under inquisitive aspect changed conversation to local topic waited until be

said thought noel vanstone cunningly watching face doesnt believe word of next day meeting occurred on parade mr bygrave took off hat noel vanstone looked other way captain start of surprise scowl of indignation be executed to perfection plainly failed to impose on mr lecount be afraid sir have offended mr bygrave to day ironically remarked happily for be excellent christian venture to predict that will forgive to morrow noel vanstone wisely refrained from committing to answer once more privately applauded own penetration once more triumphed over ingenious friend thus far captain instruction have be too clear simple to be mistaken by one advanced in complication with advance of time on third day noel vanstone fell confusedly into commission of slight error after expressing necessary weariness of aldborough consequent anxiety for change of scene be met a have anticipated by immediate suggestion from housekeeper recommending visit to st crux in giving answer to advice thus tendered made first mistake instead of deferring decision until next day accepted mr lecounts suggestion on day when be offered to consequence of error be of great importance housekeeper merely set to watch master one day earlier than have be calculated ona result have be already provided for by wise precautionary measure of forbidding noel vanstone communication with north shingle doubting a captain wragge have foreseen sincerity of master desire to break off connection with bygraves by going to st crux mr lecount tested truth falsehood of impression produced on own mind by vigilantly watching for sign of secret communication on one side on other close attention with have hitherto observed out going in coming at north shingle be now entirely transferred to master for rest of third day never let out of sight never allowed third person who came to house on pretense whatever minute chance of private communication with at interval through night stole to door of room to listen assure that be in bed before sunrise next morning coast guardsman going round be surprised to see lady who have risen a early a engaged over work at one of upper window of sea view on fourth morning noel vanstone came down to breakfast conscious of mistake that have committed on previous day obvious course to take for purpose of gaining time be to declare that mind be still undecided made assertion boldly when housekeeper asked if meant to move day again mr lecount offered remark again sign token of incredulity showed in face vacillation of purpose be not at unusual in experience of master on occasion believed that caprice of conduct be assumed for purpose of gaining time to communicate with north shingle accordingly set watch on once more with doubled trebled vigilance letter came that morning toward noon weather changed for worse idea of walking out a usual be abandoned hour after hour while master sat in one of parlor mr lecount kept watch in other with door into passage open with full view of north shingle through convenient side window at have established not sign be suspicious appeared not sound be suspicious caught ear a evening closed in master hesitation came to end be disgusted with weather hated place foresaw annoyance of more meeting with mr bygrave be determined to go to st crux first thing next morning lecount must stay behind to pack up curiosity settle with trade people must follow to admiral on next day housekeeper be little staggered by tone manner in gave order have to own certain knowledge effected communication of sort with north shingle yet seemed determined to leave aldborough at earliest possible opportunity for first time hesitated in adherence to own conclusion remembered that master have complained of bygraves before returned to aldborough be conscious that own incredulity have once already misled when appearance of traveling carriage at door have proved even mr bygrave to be a good a word still mr lecount determined to act with unrelenting caution to last night when door be closed privately removed key from door in front door at back then softly opened bedroom window sat down by with bonnet cloak on to prevent taking cold noel vanstones be on same side of house a own if one came in dark to speak to from garden beneath must speak to housekeeper a well prepared at point to intercept form of clandestine communication stratagem must invent mr lecount watched through quiet night when morning came stole downstairs before servant be up restored key to place re occupied position in parlor until noel vanstone made appearance at breakfast table have altered mind declined posting to railway on account of expense be a firm a ever in resolution to go to st crux desired that inside place might be secured for in early coach suspicious to last mr lecount sent baker man to take place be public servant mr bygrave must not suspect of performing private errand coach called at sea view mr lecount saw master established in place ascertained that other three inside seat be already occupied by stranger inquired of coachman if outside place of be not yet filled up have full complement of passenger also man replied in affirmative have two gentleman to call for in town others must take place at inn mr lecount forthwith turned step toward inn took up position on parade opposite from point of view must enable to see last of coach on departure in ten minute more rattled away full outside in housekeeper own eye assured that mr bygrave one belonging to north shingle be among passenger there be only one more precaution to take mr lecount did not neglect bygrave have doubtless seen coach call at sea view might hire carriage follow to railway on pure speculation mr lecount remained within view of inn only place at carriage must be obtained for nearly hour longer waiting for event nothing happened carriage made appearance pursuit of noel vanstone be now within range of human possibility long strain on mr lecounts mind relaxed at last left seat on parade returned in higher spirit than usual to perform closing household ceremony at sea view sat down alone in parlor drew long breath of relief captain wragges calculation have not deceived evidence of own sens have at last conquered housekeeper incredulity have literally forced into opposite extreme of belief estimating event of last three day from own experience of knowing a certainly knew that first idea of going to st crux have be started by herself that master have found opportunity shown inclination to inform family at north shingle that have accepted proposal mr lecount be fairly compelled to acknowledge that not fragment of foundation remained to justify continued suspicion of treachery in own mind looking at succession of circumstance under new light thrown on by result must see nothing unaccountable nothing contradictory anywhere attempt to pas off forged picture a original be in perfect harmony with character of such man a mr bygrave master indignation at attempt to impose on plainly expressed suspicion that miss bygrave be privy to disappointment in niece contemptuous treatment of uncle on parade weariness of place have be scene of rash intimacy with stranger readiness to quit that morning commended a genuine reality to housekeeper mind for one sufficient reason own eye have seen noel vanstone take departure from aldborough without leaving attempting to leave single trace behind for bygraves to follow thus far housekeeper conclusion led further be too shrewd woman to trust future to chance fortune master variable temper might relent accident might at time give mr bygrave opportunity of repairing error that have committed of artfully regaining lost place in noel vanstones estimation admitting that circumstance have at last declared unmistakably in favor mr lecount be not le convinced that nothing must permanently assure master security for future plain exposure of conspiracy have striven to accomplish from firstwhich be resolved to accomplish still always enjoy at st crux thought mr lecount opening account book sorting tradesman bill admiral be gentleman house be noble table

superintendence on thirtieth of september last be at present superseded revoked by second later will executed on third of november can dispute document doubt possibility of disputing new will on face of be doubt irregularly expressed be dated signed witnessed a law directs perfectly simple straightforward provision that contains be in respect can see technically open to attack being case can dispute will on ground that have be executed when testator be not in fit state to dispose of own property when testator be subjected to undue improper influence in first of case medical evidence must put obstacle in way can not assert that previous illness have weakened testator mind be clear that died suddenly a doctor have along declared must die of disease of heart be out walking in garden a usual on day of death ate hearty dinner none of person in service noticed change in be little more irritable with than usual be be impossible to attack state of faculty there be case to go into court with so far can declare that acted under undue influence in plainer term under influence of mr lecount there be serious difficulty again in way of taking course can not assert for example that mr lecount have assumed place in will have fair claim to occupy have cunningly limited own legacy not only to what be fairly due to what late mr michael vanstone have intention of leaving if be examined on subject must be compelled to acknowledge have heard express intention be only truth to say have heard express more than once there be point of attack in mr lecounts legacy there be point of attack in late husband choice of executor have made wise choice natural choice of oldest trustiest friend have in world one more consideration remainsthe most important have yet approached therefore consideration have reserved to last on thirtieth of september testator executes will leaving widow sole executrix with legacy of eighty thousand pound on third of november following expressly revoke

can not be produced to explain such extraordinary proceeding a if reason can be assignedand know of none myselfi think have point here deserves careful consideration for may be point be open to attack pray understand that be now appealing to solely a lawyer who be obliged to look possible eventuality in face have wish to intrude on private affair have wish to write word must be construed into indirect reflection on if tell that so far a know husband capriciously struck out of will without assignable reason motive for doing so without other obvious explanation of conduct than that acted in matter entirely under influence of mr lecount will immediately take counsel opinion touching propriety of disputing will on ground if on other hand tell that there be reason known to though unknown to for not taking course propose will accept intimation without troubling unless wish to explain further in latter event will write to again for will then have something more to say may greatly surprise

that clause devise whole residue of husband estate to admiral bartram end in term to be by applied to such us a may think fit simple a may seem to be very remarkable word in first place practical lawyer must have used in drawing husband will in second place be utterly useless to serve plain straightforward purpose legacy be left unconditionally to admiral in same breath be told that may do what like with phrase point clearly to one of two conclusion have dropped from writer pen in pure ignorance have be carefully set where appears to serve purpose of snare be firmly persuaded that latter explanation be right one word be expressly intended to mislead personyourself in probabilityand cunning have put to use be cunning a constantly happens when uninstructed person meddle with law have overreached thirty year experience read word in sense exactly opposite to sense be intended to convey say that admiral bartram be not free to apply legacy to such purpose a may think fit believe be privately controlled by supplementary document in shape of secret trust can easily explain to what mean by secret trust be usually contained in form of letter from testator to executor privately informing of testamentary intention on part have not thought proper openly to acknowledge in will leave hundred pound write private letter enjoining on taking legacy not to devote to own purpose to give to third person whose name have own reason for not mentioning in will be secret trust if be right in own persuasion that document a here describe be at moment in admiral bartrams possessiona persuasion based in first instance on extraordinary word have quoted to in second instance on purely legal consideration with be needle to incumber letterif be right in opinion discovery of secret trust must be in probability most important discovery to interest will not trouble with technical reason with reference to experience in matter only professional man must understand will merely say that dont give up cause a utterly lost until conviction now impressed on own mind be proved to be wrong can add more while important question still remains involved in doubt can suggest mean of solving that doubt if existence of trust be proved if nature of stipulation contained in be made known to must then say positively what legal chance be of being able to set up case on strength of must also tell whether must must not feel justified in personally undertaking that case under private arrangement with a thing be can make arrangement offer advice can only put confidentially in possession of private opinion leaving entirely free to draw own inference from regretting can not write more confidently more definitely than have written here must conscientiously say on very difficult delicate subject have said believe dear madam faithfully yours john loscombe psi omitted one consideration in last letter may mention here in order to show that point in connection with case have escaped if have be possible to show that mr vanstone be domiciled in scotland at time of death might have asserted interest by mean of scotch law doe not allow husband power of absolutely disinheriting wife be impossible to assert mr vanstone be legally domiciled in scotland came there a visitor only occupied furnished house for season never expressed by word deed slightest intention of settling permanently

naturally suppose must influence only tell in case feel inclined to remonstrate there be good reason for what say when assure that remonstrance will be useless ask for assistance in matter will trouble nobody for advice will not be involved in rash proceeding on part danger there may be will risk delay may happen will bear patiently be lonely friendless surely troubled in mind be strong

to always did like em straight fine grown always will like em straight fine grown to dying day be there more room to see upstairs on second floor asked magdalen when have returned to point from have started naturally clear distinct tone of voice have hitherto reached old sailor imperfect sense of hearing easily enough rather to surprise became stone deaf on sudden to last question be sure of pint of compass inquired if youre not sure put back agin wall well go over em again dear beginning with noathe magdalen assured that felt quite familiar by time with point noathe included then repeated

said old mazey to in high triumph tall short native foreign sweetheart wivesi know how to deal with em left by exemplified excellence of old sailor method of treatment in particular case by ascending stair immediately to make own observation on second floor stone passage here be exactly similar except more door opened out of to passage on first floor opened two nearest door one after at venture discovered that room be bed chamber fear of being discovered by one of woman servant in part of house with have concern warned not to push investigation on bedroom floor too far at starting hurriedly walked down passage to see where ended discovered that came to termination in lumber room answering to position of vestibule downstairs retraced step immediately on way back noticed object have previously escaped attention be low truckle bed placed parallel with wall close to one of door on bedroom side in spite of strange comfortless situation bed be apparently occupied at night by sleeper sheet be on end of thick red fisherman cap peeped out from under pillow ventured on opening door near bed be placed found a conjectured from certain sign token in admiral sleeping chamber moment observation of room be dared risk softly closing door again returned to kitchen region truckle bed strange position in be placed dwelt on mind through afternoon who must possibly sleep in remembrance of red fisherman cap knowledge have already gained of mazeys dog like fidelity to master helped to guess that old sailor might be occupant of truckle bed why with bedroom enough to spare must occupy that cold comfortless situation at night why must sleep on guard outside master door be there nocturnal danger in house of admiral be afraid question seemed absurd yet position of bed forced irresistibly on mind stimulated by own ungovernable curiosity on subject magdalen ventured to question housekeeper acknowledged having walked from end to end of passage on second floor to see if be a long a passage on first mentioned having noticed with astonishment position of truckle bed mr drake answered implied inquiry shortly sharply dont blame young girl like said old lady for being little curious when first come into such strange house a remember for future that business doe not lie on bedroom story mr mazey sleep on bed noticed be habit at night to sleep outside master door with meager explanation mr drake lip closed opened more later in day magdalen found opportunity of applying to old mazey discovered veteran in high good humor smoking pipe warming tin mug of ale at own snug fire mr mazey asked boldly why do put bed in cold passage what have be upstairs young jade have said old mazey looking up from mug with leer magdalen smiled nodded come come tell said coaxingly why do sleep outside admiral door why do part hair in middle dear asked old mazey with leer suppose because be accustomed to do answered magdalen ay ay said veteran thats why be well dear reason why part hair in middle be reason why sleep outside admiral door know how to deal with em chuckled old mazey lapsing into soliloquy stirring up ale in high triumph tall short native foreign sweetheart wivesi know how to deal with em magdalen third last attempt at solving mystery of truckle bed be made while be waiting on admiral at dinner old gentleman question gave opportunity of referring to subject without appearance of presumption disrespect proved to be quite a impenetrable in way a old mazey mr drake have be in theirs doesnt concern dear said admiral bluntly dont be curious look in old testament when go downstairs see what happened in garden of eden through curiosity be good girl dont imitate mother eve late at night a magdalen passed end of second floor passage proceeding alone on way up to own room stopped listened screen be placed at entrance of corridor so a to hide from view of person passing on stair snoring heard on other side of screen encouraged to slip round to advance few step shading light of candle with hand ventured close to admiral door saw to surprise that bed have be moved since have seen in day time so a to stand exactly across door to bar way entirely to one who might attempt to enter admiral room after discovery old mazey snoring lustily with red fisherman cap pulled down to eyebrow blanket drawn up to nose became object of secondary importance only by comparison with bed that veteran did actually sleep on guard before master door that admiral housekeeper be in secret of unaccountable proceeding be now beyond doubt strange end thought magdalen pondering over discovery a stole upstairs to own sleeping rooma strange end to strange day chapter ii first week passed second week passed magdalen be to appearance nearer to discovery of secret trust than on day when first entered on service at st crux fortnight uneventful a be have not be fortnight lost experience have already satisfied on one important pointexperience have shown that must set rooted distrust of other servant safely at defiance time have accustomed woman to presence in house without shaking vague conviction possessed alike that newcomer be not one of magdalen must do in own defense be to keep instinctive female suspicion of confined within purely negative limit have occupied from first accomplished day after day woman watched with untiring vigilance of malice distrust day after day not vestige of discovery rewarded for pain silently intelligently industriouslywith ever present remembrance of herself placethe new parlor maid did work only interval of rest relaxation be interval passed occasionally in day with old mazey dog precious interval of night during be secure from observation in solitude of room thanks to superfluity of bed chamber at st crux one of servant have choice if pleased of sleeping in room of own alone in night magdalen might dare to be againmight dream of past wake from dream encountering curious eye to notice that be in tearsmight ponder over future be roused by whispering in corner tainted with suspicion of having something on mind satisfied thus far of perfect security of position in house profited next by second chance in favor whichbefore fortnight be at endrelieved mind of doubt on formidable subject of mr lecount partly from accidental gossip of woman at table in servant hall partly from marked paragraph in swiss newspaper have found one morning lying open on admiral easy chairshe gained welcome assurance that danger be to be dreaded time from housekeeper presence on scene mr lecount have a appeared passed week more at st crux after date of master death have then left england to live on interest of legacy in honorable prosperous retirement in native place paragraph in swiss newspaper

possession of paragon of public virtue william tell in character of benefactor to switzerland be compared disadvantageously with mr lecount third week began magdalen be now at liberty to take first step forward on way to discovery of secret trust ascertained from old mazey that be master custom during winter spring month to occupy room in north wing during summer autumn to cross arctic passage of freeze bone live in eastward apartment looked out on garden while banqueting hall remainedowing to admiral inadequate pecuniary resourcesin damp dismantled state while interior of st crux be thus comfortlessly divided into two separate residence more convenient arrangement than must well have be devised now then a magdalen understood from informant there be day in winter summer when admiral became anxious about condition of room be not occupying at time when insisted on investigating state of furniture picture book with own eye on occasion in summer a in winter blazing fire be kindled for day previously in large grate charcoal be lighted in tripod pan to keep banqueting hall a warm a circumstance must admit a soon a old gentleman anxiety be set at rest room be shut up again freeze bone be once more abandoned for week week together to damp desolation decay last of temporary migration have taken place only few day since admiral have satisfied that room in east wing be none worse for absence of master might now be safely reckoned on a settled in north wing for week perhaps if season be cold for month to come trifling a might be in particular be of serious importance to magdalen for helped to fix limit of field of search assuming that admiral be likely to keep important document within easy reach of own hand might now feel certain that secret trust be secured in one other of room in north wing in room that question be not easy to answer of four inhabitable room be at admiral disposal during daythat be to say of dining room library morning room drawing room opening out of vestibulethe library appeared to be apartment in if have preference passed greater part of time there be table in room with drawer locked there be magnificent italian cabinet with door locked there be five cupboard under book case one of locked there be receptacle similarly secured in other room in of paper might be kept have answered bell have seen locking unlocking now in one room now in oftenest in library have noticed occasionally that expression be fretful impatient when looked round at from open cabinet cupboard gave order inferred that something in connection with paper possessionsit might might not be secret trustirritated annoyed from time to time have heard more than once lock something up in one of room come out go into room wait there few minute then return to first room with key in hand sharply turn lock turn again fidgety anxiety about key cupboard might be result of inbred restlessness of disposition aggravated in naturally active man by aimless indolence of life in retirementa life drifting backward forward among trifle with regular employment to steady at given hour of day on other hand be just a probable that coming going locking unlockings might be attributable to existence of private responsibility have unexpectedly intruded into old man easy existence tormented with sense of oppression new to experience of later year one of interpretation might explain conduct a reasonably a probably a other be right interpretation of two be in magdalen position impossible to say one certain discovery at arrived be made in first day observation of admiral be rigidly careful man with key smaller key kept on ring in breast pocket of coat larger locked up together generally not always in one of drawer of library table sometimes left secured in way at night sometimes took up to bedroom with in little basket have regular time for leaving for taking away with have discoverable reason for now securing in library table drawer now again locking up in other place inveterate willfulness caprice of proceeding in particular defied effort to reduce to system baffled attempt at calculating on beforehand hope of gaining positive information to act on by laying artful snare for might fall into in talk proved from outset to be utterly futile in magdalen situation experiment of sort must have be in last degree difficult dangerous with man with admiral be simply impossible tendency to veer about from one subject to habit of keeping tongue perpetually going so long a there be anybody matter whom within reach of sound of voice comical want of dignity reserve with servant promised in appearance much performed in reality nothing matter how diffidently how respectfully magdalen might presume on master example on master evident liking for old man instantly discovered advance be making from proper position instantly put back in again with quaint good humor inflicted pain with blunt straightforwardness of purpose permitted escape contradictory a may sound admiral bartram be too familiar to be approached kept distance between servant more effectually than if have be proudest man in systematic reserve of superior toward inferior may be occasionally overcomethe systematic familiarity never slowly time dragged on fourth week came magdalen have made new discovery prospect be depressing in last degree even in apparently hopeless event of devising mean of getting at admiral key must not count on retaining possession of unsuspected more than few hourshours might be utterly wasted through not knowing in what direction to begin search trust might be locked up in one of twenty receptacle for paper situated in four different room room be likeliest to look in receptacle be most promising to begin with position among other heap of paper one paper needful might be expected to occupy be more than must say hemmed in by immeasurable uncertainty on side condemned a be to wander blindfold on very brink of success waited for chance that never came for event never happened with patience be sinking already into patience of despair night after night looked back over vanished day not event rose on memory to distinguish one from other only interruption to weary uniformity of life at st crux be caused by characteristic delinquency of old mazey dog at certain interval original wildness broke out in nature of brutus cassius modest comfort of home savory charm of made dish decorous joy of digestion accomplished on hearth rug lost attraction dog ungratefully left house to seek dissipation adventure in

relieve monotony until end of fourth week be at hand on last day event happened on last day long deferred promise of future unexpectedly began to dawn while magdalen be spreading cloth in dining room a usual mr drake looked in instructed on occasion for first time to lay table for two person admiral have received letter from nephew early that evening mr george bartram be expected to return to st crux chapter iii after placing second cover magdalen awaited ringing of dinner bell with interest impatience found easy task to conceal return of mr bartram must in probability produce change in life of house from change of kind matter how trifling something might be hoped nephew might be accessible to influence have failed to reach uncle in case two must talk of affair over dinner through talkproceeding day after day in presencethe way to discovery now absolutely invisible might sooner later show at last bell rang door opened two gentleman entered room together magdalen be struck a

upright figure familiar to in picture be recalled to memory a nephew followed uncle across room took place at table be not prepared for sudden revival of lost association of home attention wandered a tried to conceal effect on made blunder in waiting at table for first time since have entered house quaint reprimand from admiral half in jest half in earnest gave time to recover ventured look at george bartram impression produced on time roused curiosity immediately face manner plainly expressed anxiety preoccupation of mind looked oftener at plate than at uncle at magdalen except one passing inspection of new parlor maid when admiral spoke to never looked at uncertainty be evidently troubling thought oppression be weighing on natural freedom of manner what uncertainty what oppression must personal revelation come out little by little in course of conversation at dinner table one set of dish followed set of dish nothing in shape of personal revelation took place conversation halted on irregularly between public affair on one side trifling private topic on other politics home foreign took turn with small household history of st crux leader of revolution expelled louis philippe from throne of france marched side by side in dinner table review with old mazey dog dessert be put on table old sailor came in drank loyal toast paid respect to master george went out again magdalen followed on way back to servant office having heard nothing in conversation of slightest importance to furtherance of own design from first word of to last struggled hard not to lose heart hope on first day must hardly talk again to morrow must hardly talk again next day of french revolution dog time might do wonder yet time be own left together over wine uncle nephew drew easy chair on side of

failed in turn in little more than fortnight at very latest banns must be published in ossory church time must fail for compliance with one of stipulation insisted on in trust obstinate a admiral be by nature strongly a felt objection attached to nephew contemplated alliance recoiled in spite of a paced room saw fact on side immovably staring in face be engaged to miss vanstone asked suddenly sir

struck by change in for first time in experience old gentleman be silent depressed ate le than usual hardly said five word to from beginning of meal to end unwelcome subject of reflection have evidently fixed on mind remained there persistently in spite of effort to shake off at interval through evening wondered with ever growing perplexity what subject must be at last lagging hour reached end bed time came before slept that night magdalen have cleaned key from impurity have oiled ward to help smoothly into lock last difficulty remained be difficulty of choosing time when experiment might be tried with least risk of interruption discovery after carefully considering question overnight magdalen must only resolve to wait be guided by event of next day morning came for first time at st crux event justified trust have placed in morning came one remaining difficulty that perplexed be unexpectedly smoothed away by le person than admiral to surprise of one in house announced at breakfast that have arranged to start for london in hour that must pas night in town that might be expected to return to st crux in time for dinner on next day volunteered further explanation to housekeeper to one else be easy to see that errand to london be of ordinary importance in own estimation swallowed breakfast in violent hurry be impatiently ready for carriage before came to door

scuttle rang for coal magdalen went back to kitchen region after communicating admiral order to servant whose special duty be to attend to fire returned to pantry gently closing door sat down alone to think have be impression in drawing roomand be impression stillthat have accidentally surprised admiral bartram on visit to east room for urgent reason of own wished to keep secret haunted day night by one dominant idea now possessed leaped logical difficulty at bound at once associated suspicion of secret proceeding on admiral part with kindred suspicion pointed to a depositary of secret trust up to time have be settled belief that kept important document in one other of suite of room happened to be occupying for time being whyshe now asked with sudden distrust of conclusion have hitherto satisfied mindwhy might not lock of up in other room a well remembrance of key still concealed in hiding place in room sharpened sense of reasonableness of new view with one unimportant exception key have failed when tried in room on north side of house might not succeed with cabinet cupboard in east room on have never tried thought of trying yet if there be chance however small of turning to better account than have turned thus far be chance to be tried if there be possibility however remote that trust might be hidden in one of locked repository in east wing be possibility to be put to test when own experience answered question at time when prying eye be open accident be to be house be quietin dead of night knew enough of changed self to dread enervating influence of delay determined to run risk headlong night more blunder escaped when dinner time came admiral criticism on waiting at table be sharper than ever hardest word inflicted pain on scarcely heard himher mind be

appeared of indentation must have be left by footstep passing over there be plain evidence before himthe evidence recognizable at last by own bewildered eyesthat admiral have never moved from room ill take pledge to morrow mumbled old mazey in outburst of grateful relief next moment fume of liquor floated back insidiously over brain veteran returning to customary remedy paced passage in zigzag a usual kept watch on deck of imaginary ship soon after sunrise magdalen suddenly heard grating of key from outside in lock of door door opened old mazey re appeared on threshold first fever of intoxication have cooled with time into mild penitential glow breathed harder than ever in succession of low growl wagged venerable head at own delinquency without intermission how be now young land

george bartram westmoreland house april th dear mr bartram only did justice in supposing that letter must distress if have supposed that must make excessively angry a well must not have be far wrong have patience with pride perversity of young woman of present day have heard from norah be long letter stating particular in full detail be now going to put confidence in honor discretion really feel for sake for norahs be going to let know what scruple really be have misled into pride folly of refusing be old enough to speak out can tell if have only be wise enough to let own wish guide must have said yesand gladly too original cause of mischief be le person than worthy uncleadmiral bartram seems that admiral took into head suppose during absence to go to london by to satisfy curiosity of own about norah by calling in portland place under pretense of renewing old friendship with tyrrels came at luncheon time saw norah from can hear be apparently better pleased with than expected wished to be when came into house so far be mere guess work be unluckily certain that mr tyrrel have talk together alone when luncheon be over name be not mentioned when conversation fell on norah be in mind of course admiral doing full justice personally declared smitten with pity for hard lot in life scandalous conduct of sister must always stand feared in way of future advantage who must marry without first making condition that sister be to be absolute stranger to other even then objection must remainthe serious objection to husband familyof being connected by marriage with woman a mr noel vanstone be very sad be not poor girl fault be none le true that sister be rock ahead in life so ran on with real ill feeling toward norah with obstinate belief in own prejudice bore aspect of ill feeling people with more temper than judgment must be too readily disposed to resent accordingly unfortunately mr tyrrel be one of people be excellent warm hearted woman with quick temper very little judgment strongly attached to norah heartily interested in norahs welfare from can learn first resented expression of admiral opinion in presence a worldly selfish in last degree then interpreted behind back a hint to discourage nephew visit be downright insult offered to lady in own house be foolish enough so far worse folly be to come a soon a uncle be gone mr tyrrel most unwisely improperly sent for norah repeating conversation have taken place warned of reception might expect from man who stood toward in position of father if accepted offer of marriage on part when tell that norahs faithful attachment to sister still remains unshaken that there lie hidden under noble submission to unhappy circumstance of life proud susceptibility to slight of kind be deeply seated in natureyou will understand true motive of refusal have so naturally so justly disappointed be three equally to blame in matter uncle be wrong to state objection so roundly inconsiderately a did mr tyrrel be wrong to let temper get better of to suppose insulted where insult be intended norah be wrong to place scruple of pride hopeless belief in sister stranger can be expected to share above higher claim of attachment might have secured happiness prosperity of future life mischief have be done next question be can harm be remedied hope believe can advice be dont take for answer give time enough to reflect on what have done to regret a believe will regret in secret trust to influence over to plead cause for at opportunity can find wait patiently for right moment ask again men being accustomed to act on reflection be great deal too apt to believe that woman act on reflection too woman hing of sort act on impulse in nine case out of ten be heartily sorry for afterward in meanwhile must help own interest by inducing uncle to alter opinion at least to make concession of keeping opinion to mr tyrrel have rushed to conclusion that harm have done did intentionallywhich be a much a to say in so many word that have prophetic conviction when came into house of what must do when left explanation of matter be much simpler one believe that knowledge of attachment naturally aroused curiosity to see object of that mr tyrrels injudicious praise of norah irritated objection into openly declaring anyway course lie equally plain before use influence over uncle to persuade into setting matter right again trust settled resolution to see norah wife before six month more be over head believe friend well wisher harriet garth iv from mr drake to george bartram st crux april th sir direct line

from have come in morning from foreign part have brought bad news did not tell what news wasbut have never in year have passed in admiral service seen so distressingly upset so unlike a be on day at night uneasiness seemed to increase be in such state of irritation that must not bear sound of mr mazeys hard breathing outside door laid positive order on old man to go into one of bedroom for night mr mazey to own great regret be of course obliged to obey only mean of preventing admiral from leaving room in sleep if fit unfortunately took being now removed mr mazey agreed to keep watch by turn through night sitting with door ajar in one of empty room near master bed chamber must think of nothing better to do than knowing must not allow to lock in not having door key in possession even if must have ventured to secure in room without permission kept watch for first two hour then mr mazey took place after having be little time in own room occurred to that old man be hard of hearing that if eye grew at heavy in night ear be not to be trusted to warn if anything happened slipped on clothes again went back to mr mazey be neither asleep awakehe be between two mind misgave went on to admiral room door be open bed be empty mr mazey went downstairs instantly looked in north room one after found trace of thought of drawing room next being more active of two went first to examine moment turned sharp corner of passage saw master coming toward through open drawing room door asleep dreaming with key in hand sliding door behind be open also fear came to then have remained with ever since that dream have led through banqueting hall into east room abstained from waking followed step until returned of own accord to bed chamber next morning grieve to say bad symptom came back none of remedy employed have succeeded in getting better of yet by doctor advice refrained from telling admiral what have happened be still under impression that passed night a usual in own room have

miss garth st crux april d dear miss garth pray excuse not thanking sooner for kind consoling letter be in sad trouble at st crux little irritation might have felt at poor uncle unlucky interference in portland place be forgotten in misfortune of serious illness be suffering from internal inflammation produced by cold symptom have shown be dangerous at age physician from london be now in house will hear more in few day meantime believe with sincere gratitude yours most truly george bartram vi from mr loscombe to mr noel vanstone lincoln inn field may th dear madam have unexpectedly received information be of most vital importance to interest news of admiral bartrams death have reached morning expired at own house on fourth of present month event at once disposes of consideration have previously endeavored to impress on in relation to discovery at st crux wisest course can now follow be to open communication at once with executor of deceased gentleman addressing through medium of admiral legal adviser in first instance have dispatched letter day to solicitor in question simply warns that have lately become aware of existence of private document controlling deceased gentleman in use of legacy devised to by mr noel vanstones will letter assumes that document will be easily found among admiral paper mention that be solicitor appointed by mr noel vanstone to receive communication on behalf object in taking step be to cause search to be instituted for trustin very probable event of executor not having met with yetbefore usual measure be adopted for administration of admiral estate will threaten legal proceeding if find that object doe not succeed anticipate such necessity admiral bartrams executor must be men of high standing position will do justice to to in matter by looking for trust under circumstance will naturally ask what be prospect when document be found prospect have bright side dark side let take bright side to begin with what do actually know know first that trust doe really exist secondly that there be provision in relating to marriage of mr george bartram in given time thirdly that time six month from date of husband death expired on third of month fourthly that mr george bartram a have found out by inquiry in absence of positive information on subject possessed by be at present moment single man conclusion naturally follows that object contemplated by trust in case be object have failed if other provision have be inserted in documentor if being inserted other provision must be discovered to have failed alsoi believe to be impossible especially if evidence can be found that admiral considered trust binding on for executor to deal with husband fortune a legally forming part of admiral bartrams estate legacy be expressly declared to have be left to on understanding that applies to certain stated objectsand object have failed what be to be done with money be not left to admiral on testator own showing purpose for be left have not be can not be carried out believe if case here supposed really happens that money must revert to testator estate in event law dealing with a matter of necessity divide into two equal portion one half go to mr noel vanstones childless widow other half be divided among mr noel vanstones next of kin will doubt discover obvious objection to case in favor a have here put will see that depends for practical realization not on one contingency on series of contingency must happen exactly a wish to happen admit force of objection can tell at same time that said contingency be by mean so improbable a may look on face of have reason to believe that trust like will be not drawn by lawyer be one circumstance in favor be enough of to cast doubt on soundness of of remaining provision may not be acquainted with chance may count on be to be found a think in strange handwriting placed under signature on third page of letter saw unhappily omitted to read probability point to line a written by admiral bartram position occupy be certainly consistent with theory that touch important subject of own sense of obligation under trust wish to raise false hope in mind only desire to satisfy that have case worth trying a for dark side of prospect need not enlarge on after what have already written will understand that existence of sound provision unknown to in trust have be properly carried out by admiralor can be properly carried out by representativeswould be necessarily fatal to hope legacy must be in case devoted to purpose purpose contemplated by husbandand from moment must have claim have only to add that a soon a hear from late admiral man of business will know result believe dear madam faithfully yours john loscombe vii from george bartram to miss garth st crux may th dear miss garth trouble with letter partly to thank for kind expression of sympathy with under loss have sustained partly to tell of extraordinary application made to uncle executor in miss vanstone may feel interested a mr noel vanstone be directly concerned in knowing own ignorance of legal technicality inclose copy of application instead of trying to describe will notice a suspicious that explanation be given of manner in alleged discovery of one of uncle secret be made by person who be total stranger to on being made acquainted with circumstance executor at once applied to must give positive informationfor uncle never consulted on matter of business felt in honor bound to tell during last six month of life admiral have occasionally let fall expression of impatience in hearing led to conclusion that be annoyed by private responsibility of kind also mentioned that have imposed very strange condition on mea condition in spite of own assurance to contrary be persuaded must not have emanated from himselfof marrying within given time time have now expired of not receiving from certain sum of money believed to be same in amount a sum bequeathed to in cousin will executor agreed with that circumstance gave color of probability to otherwise incredible story decided that search must be instituted for secret trust nothing in slightest degree resembling same trust having be discovered up to time among admiral paper search trifle in such house a have now be in full progress for week be superintended by executor by uncle lawyer who be personally a well a professionally known to mr loscombe mr noel vanstones solicitor who have be included in proceeding at express request of mr loscombe up to time nothing have be found thousand thousand of letter have be examined not one of bear remotest resemblance to letter be looking for week will bring search to end be only at express request that will be persevered with so long a admiral generosity have made sole heir to everything possessed feel bound to do fullest justice to interest of others however hostile to myself interest may be with view have not hesitated to reveal to lawyer constitutional peculiarity of poor uncle be always kept secret among at own requesti mean tendency to somnambulism mentioned that have be discovered by housekeeper old servant walking in sleep about three week before death that part of house in have be seen basket of key be carrying in hand suggested inference that have come from one of room in east wing that might have opened of piece of furniture in one of surprised lawyer who seemed to be quite ignorant of extraordinary action constantly performed by somnambulist by informing that uncle must find way about house lock unlock door remove object of kind from one place to a easily in sleep a in waking hour declared that while felt faintest doubt in own mind whether might not have be dreaming of trust on night in question putting dream in action in sleep must not feel satisfied unless room in east wing be searched again be only right to add that there be not least foundation in fact for idea of mine during latter part of fatal illness poor uncle be quite incapable of speaking on subject from time of arrival at st crux in middle of last month to time of death not word dropped from referred in remotest way to secret trust here then for present matter rest if think right to communicate content of letter to miss vanstone pray tell that will not be fault if sister assertion however preposterous may seem to uncle
