suspicious eye fixed on unpleasantly when handed card be shown into morning room exactly like other morning room in country house after long delay doctor came in with scientific butcher sleeve on arm apron tied round portly waist apologized for coming down in working dress said everything be civil proper about pleasure of unexpectedly seeing again so soon there be something rather preoccupied thought in brightly resolute eye of naturally attributed to engrossing influence of scientific inquiry be evidently not at taken in by story about coming to barkingham to fish saw a well a did that

seen gentleman angling from meadow bank about quarter of mile below flower garden risked everything in usual venturesome way asked if must show where place be in case called next morning with fishing rod looked dutifully at father smiled nodded inestimable parent on rising to take leave be rather curious to know whether must offer bed in house not detected direction of thought in face manner apologized for not having bed to offer spare room in house being occupied by chemical assistant by lumber of laboratory even while be speaking few word alicia face changed just a have seen change at first interview downcast gloomy expression overspread again father eye wandered toward when mine did suddenly assumed same distrustful look remembered detecting in under similar circumstance at duskydale what must mean doctor shook hand with in hall leaving workman like footman to open door stopped to admire fine pair of stag antler footman coughed impatiently still lingered hearing doctor footstep ascending stair suddenly stopped then there be low heavy clang like sound of closing door made of iron of other unusually strong material then total silence interrupted by impatient cough from workman like footman after thought wisest proceeding must be to go away before mysterious attendant be driven to practical extremity between thought of alicia inquisitive yearning to know more about doctor experiment passed rather restless night at inn next morning found lovely mistress of destiny with softest of shawl on shoulder brightest of parasol in hand smart little straw hat of day before on head ready to show way to fishing place if must be sure beforehand that page must only be read by person actually occupied in making of love oldest longest established of branch of manufacturing industry must go into very tender interesting particular on subject of first day fishing under adorable auspex of alicia a can not hope for wholly sympathetic audience a there may be monk misogynist political economist other professedly hard hearted person present among whom now address think best to keep to safe generality to describe love making in a few sentence a vast though soft importance of subject will allow to use let confess then that assumed character of fastidious angler managed to be week in discovering right place to fish in always be unnecessary to say under alicia guidance went up stream down stream on one side crossed bridge went up stream down stream on other got into punt went up stream with great difficulty down stream with great ease landed on little island walked round inspected stream attentively from central point of view found island damp went back to bank up stream over bridge down stream again then for first time sweet girl turned

turned away inquiringly up stream be angel of patience kindness still looking for fishing place be up stream after smiled shook head when asked question brown eye suddenly stole look at must hold out no longer in one breathless moment caught hold of hand in one stammering sentence asked if must be wife tried faintly to free hand gave up attempt smiled made effort to look grave gave up too sighed suddenly checked suddenly said nothing perhaps ought to have taken answer for granted least business like man that ever lived becomes eminently practical character in matter of love repeated question

of mine rose with tear in eye have offended said when asked question turned to again held out hand with such frank fearless kindness that almost fell on knee to thank for might hope ever to hear say yes to question have asked on riverbank sighed bitterly turned again toward red brick house be there family reason against saying yes anything must not inquire into opposition to be dreaded from father moment mentioned father shrank away from burst into violent fit of cry speak of again said in broken voice must must ah say word more about be not distressed with be not fault say anything leave quiet for minute will soon be better leave quiet dried eye directly with shiver a if be cold took arm led back to house gate then feeling must not go in to lunch a usual after what have happened

to bear to amuse with book music flower thus far chatted about quite freely when tried even in vaguest manner to lead into discussing cause of strangely secluded life looked so distressed became so suddenly silent that naturally refrained from saying word on topic one conclusion however felt tolerably sure that have drawn correctly from what said father conduct toward though not absolutely blamable grossly neglectful on point have still never be of nature to make ardently fond of performed ordinary parental duty rigidly respectably enough have apparently not cared to win filial love daughter must have bestowed on more affectionate man when after reflecting on what alicia have told began to call to mind what have be able to observe for found ample material to excite curiosity in relation to doctor if not distrust have already described how heard clang of heavy door on occasion of first visit to red brick house next day when doctor again took leave of in hall hit on plan for
