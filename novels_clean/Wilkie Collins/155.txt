now writing ofthere came letter from highly respectable clergyman to lady communicated two wonderful thing in way of family news first that colonel have forgiven sister on death bed second that have forgiven everybody else have made most edifying end have myself in spite of bishop clergy unfeigned respect for church be firmly persuaded at same time that devil remained in undisturbed possession of honourable john that last abominable act in life of abominable man be saving presence to take clergyman in be sum total of what have to tell mr franklin remarked that listened more more eagerly longer went on also that story of colonel being sent away from sister door on occasion of niece birthday seemed to strike mr franklin like shot have hit mark though didnt acknowledge saw that have made uneasy plainly enough in face have said say betteredge remarked turn now before however tell what discovery have made in london how came to be mixed up in matter of diamond want to know one thing look old friend a if didnt quite understand object to be answered by consultation of ours do look belie sir said look on occasion at rate tell truth in case say mr franklin suppose put up to point of view before go further see three very serious question involved in colonel birthday gift to cousin rachel follow carefully betteredge count off on finger if will help say mr franklin with certain pleasure in showing how clear headed must be reminded wonderfully of old time when be boy question first be colonel diamond object of conspiracy in india question second have conspiracy followed colonel diamond to england question third did colonel know conspiracy followed diamond have purposely left legacy of trouble danger to sister through innocent medium of sister child be what be driving at betteredge dont let frighten be very well to say that have frightened if be right here be quiet english house suddenly invaded by devilish indian diamondbringing after conspiracy of living rogue set loose on by vengeance of dead man there be situation a revealed to in mr franklin last word who ever heard like of itin nineteenth century mind in age of progress in country rejoices in blessing of british constitution nobody ever heard like of consequently nobody can be expected to believe will go on with story however in spite of when get sudden alarm of sort have got now nine time out of ten place feel in be stomach when feel in stomach attention wanders begin to fidget fidgeted silently in place on sand mr franklin noticed contending with perturbed stomach mindwhich please mean same thingand checking just a be starting with part of story said to sharply what do want what did want didnt tell ill tell in confidence wanted whiff of pipe turn at robinson crusoe chapter vi keeping private sentiment to myself respectfully requested mr franklin to go on mr franklin replied dont fidget betteredge went on young gentleman first word informed that discovery concerning wicked colonel diamond have begun with visit have paid before came to to family lawyer at hampstead chance word dropped by mr franklin when two be alone one day after dinner revealed that have be charged by father with birthday present to be taken to miss rachel one thing led to ended in lawyer mentioning what present really be how friendly connexion between late colonel mr blake senior have taken rise fact here be really so extraordinary that doubt if can trust own language to do justice to prefer trying to report mr franklin discovery a nearly a may be in mr franklin own word remember time betteredge said when father be trying to prove title to unlucky dukedom well be also time when uncle herncastle returned from india father discovered that brother in law be in possession of certain paper be likely to be of service to in lawsuit called on colonel on pretence of welcoming back to england colonel be not to be deluded in way want something said must never have compromised reputation by calling on father saw that one chance for be to show hand admitted at once that wanted paper colonel asked for day to consider answer answer came in shape of most extraordinary letter friend lawyer showed colonel began by saying that wanted something of father that begged to propose exchange of friendly service between fortune of war be expression used have placed in possession of one of largest diamond in world have reason to believe that precious jewel be safe in house in quarter of globe occupied together under alarming circumstance have determined to place diamond in keeping of person that person be not expected to run risk might deposit precious stone in place especially guarded set apartlike banker jeweller strongroomfor safe custody of valuable of high price main personal responsibility in matter be to be of passive kind be to undertake either by by trustworthy representativeto receive at prearranged address on certain prearranged day in year note from colonel simply stating fact that be living man at date in event of date passing over without note being received colonel silence might be taken a sure token of colonel death by murder in case in other certain sealed instruction relating to disposal of diamond deposited with be to be opened followed implicitly if father chose to accept strange charge colonel paper be at disposal in return be letter what did father do sir asked do say mr franklin ill tell what did brought invaluable faculty called common sense to bear on colonel letter whole thing declared be simply absurd somewhere in indian wandering colonel have picked up with wretched crystal took for diamond a for danger of being murdered precaution devised to preserve life piece of crystal be nineteenth century man in sens have only to apply to police colonel have be notorious opium eater for year past if only way of getting at valuable paper possessed be by accepting matter of opium a matter of fact father be quite willing to take ridiculous responsibility imposed on more readily that involved trouble to diamond sealed instruction went into banker strongroom colonel letter periodically reporting living man be received opened by family lawyer mr bruff a father representative sensible person in similar position must have viewed matter in other way nothing in world betteredge be probable unless appeal to own trumpery experience only believe in romance when see in newspaper be plain to from mr franklin thought father notion about colonel hasty wrong what be own private opinion about matter sir asked let finish story of colonel first say mr franklin there be curious want of system betteredge in english mind question old friend be instance of when be not occupied in making machinery be mentally speaking most slovenly people in universe so much thought to myself for foreign education have learned that way of girding at in france suppose mr franklin took up lost thread went on father said got paper wanted never saw brother in law again from that time year after year on prearranged day prearranged letter came from colonel be opened by mr bruff have seen letter in heap of written in same brief business like form of word sirthis be to certify that be still living man let diamond be john herncastle be ever wrote that came regularly to day until six eight month since when form of letter varied for first time ran now sirthey tell be dying come to help to make will mr bruff went found in little suburban villa surrounded by own ground in have lived alone ever since have left india have dog cat bird to keep company human being near except person who came daily to do house work doctor at bedside will be very simple matter colonel have dissipated greater part of fortune in chemical investigation will began ended in three clause dictated from bed in perfect possession of faculty first clause provided for safe keeping support of animal second founded professorship of experimental chemistry at northern university third bequeathed moonstone a birthday present to niece on condition that father must act a executor father at first refused to act on second thought however gave way partly because be assured that executorship must involve in trouble partly because mr bruff suggested in rachel interest that diamond might be worth something after did colonel give reason sir inquired why left diamond to miss rachel not only gave reasonhe have reason written in will said mr franklin have got extract will see presently dont be slovenly minded betteredge one thing at time have heard about colonel will now must hear what happened after colonel death be formally necessary to have diamond valued before will must be proved jeweller consulted at once confirmed colonel assertion that possessed one of largest diamond in world question of accurately valuing presented serious difficulty size made phenomenon in diamond market colour placed in category by to add to element of uncertainty there be defect in shape of flaw in very heart of stone even with last serious draw back however lowest of various estimate given be twenty thousand pound conceive father astonishment have be within hair breadth of refusing to act a executor of allowing magnificent jewel to be lost to family interest took in matter now induced to open sealed instruction have be deposited with diamond mr bruff showed document to with other paper suggests to mind clue to nature of conspiracy threatened colonel life then do believe sir said that there be conspiracy not possessing father excellent common sense answered mr franklin believe colonel life be threatened exactly a colonel said sealed instruction a think explain how be that died after quietly in bed in event of death by violence be to say in absence of regular letter from at appointed date father be then directed to send moonstone secretly to amsterdam be to be deposited in city with famous diamond cutter be to be cut up into from four to six separate stone stone be then to be sold for what must fetch proceeds be to be applied to founding of professorship of experimental chemistry colonel have since endowed by will now betteredge exert sharp wit of yours observe conclusion to colonel instruction point instantly exerted wit be of slovenly english sort consequently muddled until mr franklin took in hand pointed out what ought to see remark say mr franklin that integrity of diamond a whole stone be here artfully made dependent on preservation from violence of colonel life be not satisfied with saying to enemy dread kill meand will be nearer to diamond than be now be where cant get at itin guarded strongroom of bank say instead kill meand diamond will be diamond no longer identity will be destroyed what doe that mean here have a thought flash of wonderful foreign brightness know said mean lowering value of stone cheating rogue in way nothing of sort say mr franklin have inquired about that flawed diamond cut up must actually fetch more than diamond a now be for plain reasonthat from four to six perfect brilliants might be cut from must be collectively worth more money than largebut imperfect single stone if robbery for purpose of gain be at bottom of conspiracy colonel instruction absolutely made diamond better worth stealing more money must have be got for disposal of in diamond market must have be infinitely easier if have passed through hand of workman of amsterdam lord bless sir burst out what be plot then plot organised among indian who originally owned jewel say mr franklina plot with old hindoo superstition at bottom of be opinion confirmed by family paper have about at moment saw now why appearance of three indian juggler at house have presented to mr franklin in light of circumstance worth noting dont want to force opinion on mr franklin went on idea of certain chosen servant of old hindoo superstition devoting through difficulty danger to watching opportunity of recovering sacred gem appears to to be perfectly consistent with everything that know of patience of oriental race influence of oriental religion then be imaginative man butcher baker tax gatherer be not only credible reality in existence to mind let guess have made at truth in matter go for what be worth let get on to only practical question that concern doe conspiracy against moonstone survive colonel death did colonel know when left birthday gift to niece began to see lady miss rachel at end of now not word said escaped be not very willing when discovered story of moonstone said mr franklin to be mean of bringing here mr bruff reminded that somebody must put cousin legacy into cousin handsand might a well do a anybody else after taking diamond out of bank fancied be followed in street by shabby dark complexioned man went to father house to pick up luggage found letter there unexpectedly detained in london went back to bank with diamond thought saw shabby man again taking diamond once more out of bank morning saw man for third time gave slip started before recovered trace of by morning instead of afternoon train here be with diamond safe soundand what be first news meet find three strolling indian have be at house that arrival from london something be expected to have about be two special object of investigation to when believe to be alone dont waste time word on pouring ink into boy hand telling to look in for man at distance for something in man pocket thing have often seen done in east be hocus pocus in opinion a be in yours present question for to decide be whether be wrongly attaching meaning to mere accident whether really have evidence of indian being on track of moonstone moment be removed from safe keeping of bank seemed to fancy dealing with part of inquiry looked at other then looked at tide oozing in smoothly higher higher over shivering sand what be thinking of say mr franklin suddenly be thinking sir answered must like to shy diamond into quicksand settle question in way if have got value of stone in pocket answered mr franklin say so betteredge in go curious to note when mind anxious how very far in way of relief very small joke will go found fund of merriment at time in notion of making away with miss rachel lawful property getting mr blake a executor into dreadful troublethough where merriment be be quite at loss to discover now mr franklin be first to bring talk back to talk proper purpose took envelope out of pocket opened handed to paper inside betteredge said must face question of colonel motive in leaving legacy to niece for aunt sake bear in mind how lady verinder treated brother from time when returned to england to time when told must remember niece birthday read that gave extract from colonel will have got by while write word copy a follows for benefit thirdly lastly give bequeath to niece rachel verinder daughter only child of sister julia verinder widowif mother said julia verinder will be living on said rachel verinders next birthday after deaththe yellow diamond belonging to known in east by name of moonstone subject to condition that mother said julia verinder will be living at time hereby desire executor to give diamond by own hand by hand of trustworthy representative whom will appoint into personal possession of said niece rachel on next birthday after death in presence if possible of sister said julia verinder desire that said sister may be informed by mean of true copy of third last clause of will give diamond to daughter rachel in token of free forgiveness of injury conduct towards have be mean of inflicting on reputation in lifetime especially in proof pardon a becomes dying man insult offered to a officer gentleman when servant by order closed door of house against on occasion of daughter birthday more word followed providing if lady be dead if miss rachel be dead at time of testator decease for diamond being sent to holland in accordance with sealed instruction originally deposited with proceeds of sale be in case to be added to money already left by will for professorship of chemistry at university in north handed paper back to mr franklin sorely troubled what to say to up to moment own opinion have be a know that colonel have died a wickedly a have lived dont say copy from will actually converted from opinion only say staggered well say mr franklin now have read colonel own statement what do say in bringing moonstone to aunt house be serving vengeance blindfold be vindicating in character of penitent christian man seems hard to say sir answered that died with horrid revenge in heart horrid lie on lip god alone know truth dont ask mr franklin sat twisting turning extract from will in finger a if expected to squeeze truth out of in manner altered quite remarkably at same time from being brisk bright now became most unaccountably slow solemn pondering young man question have two side said objective side subjective side be to take have have german education a well a french one of two have be in undisturbed possession of a supposed up to time now a well a must make out other be taking place be one of rule in life never to notice what dont understand steered middle course between objective side subjective side in plain english stared hard said nothing let extract inner meaning of say mr franklin why did uncle leave diamond to rachel why didnt leave to aunt thats not beyond guessing sir at rate said colonel herncastle knew lady well enough to know that must have refused to accept legacy came to from how did know rachel might not refuse to accept too be there young lady in existence sir who must resist temptation of accepting such birthday present a moonstone thats subjective view say mr franklin doe great credit betteredge to be able to take subjective view there mystery about colonel legacy be not accounted for yet how be to explain only giving rachel birthday present conditionally on mother being alive dont want to slander dead man sir answered if have purposely left legacy of trouble danger to sister by mean of child must be legacy made conditional on sister being alive to feel vexation of oh thats interpretation of motive be subjective interpretation again have ever be in germany betteredge sir whats interpretation if please can see say mr franklin that colonel object may quite possibly have beennot to benefit niece whom have never even seenbut to prove to sister that have died forgiving to prove very prettily by mean of present made to child there be totally different explanation from yours betteredge taking rise in subjective objective point of view from can see one interpretation be just a likely to be right a other having brought matter to pleasant comforting issue mr franklin appeared to think that have completed be required of laid down flat on back on sand asked what be to be done next have be so clever clear headed before began to talk foreign gibberish have so completely taken lead in business up to present time be quite unprepared for such sudden change a now exhibited in helpless leaning upon be not till later that learnedby assistance of miss rachel who be first to make discoverythat puzzling shift transformation in mr franklin be due to effect on of foreign training at age when be of most apt to take colouring in form of reflection from colouring of other people have be sent abroad have be passed on from one nation to before there be time for anyone colouring more than to settle on firmly a consequence of have come back with so many different side to character more le jarring with other that seemed to pas life in state of perpetual contradiction with must be busy man lazy man cloudy in head clear in head model of determination spectacle of helplessness together have french side german side italian sidethe original english foundation showing through now then a much a to say here be sorely transmogrified a see there something of left at bottom of still miss rachel used to remark that italian side of be uppermost on occasion when unexpectedly gave in asked in nice sweet tempered way to take own responsibility on shoulder will do injustice think if conclude that italian side of be uppermost now isnt business sir asked to know what to do next surely cant be mine mr franklin didnt appear to see force of questionnot being in position at time to see anything sky over head dont want to alarm aunt without reason said dont want to leave without what may be needful warning if be in place betteredge tell in one word what must do in one word told wait with heart say mr franklin how long proceeded to explain a understand sir said somebody be bound to put plaguy diamond into miss rachel hand on birthdayand may a well do a very good be twenty fifth of may birthday be on twenty first of june have got close on four week before let wait see what happens in time let warn lady not a circumstance direct perfect betteredge a far a go say mr franklin between birthday whats to be done with diamond what father did with to be sure sir answered father put in safe keeping of bank in london put in safe keeping of bank at frizinghall frizinghall be nearest town bank of england wasnt safer than bank there if be sir added must ride straight away with to frizinghall before lady come back prospect of doing somethingand what be more of doing that something on horsebrought mr franklin up like lightning from flat of back sprang to foot pulled up without ceremony on to mine betteredge be worth weight in gold said come along saddle best horse in stable directly here god bless be original english foundation of showing through foreign varnish at last here be master franklin remembered coming out again in good old way at prospect of ride reminding of good old time saddle horse for must have saddled dozen horse if must only have ridden went back to house in hurry have fleetest horse in stable saddled in hurry mr franklin rattled off in hurry to lodge cursed diamond once more in strongroom of bank when last of horse hoof on drive when turned about in yard found be alone again felt half inclined to ask if hadnt woke up from dream chapter vii while be in bewildered frame of mind sorely needing little quiet time by to put right again daughter penelope got in way just a late mother used to get in way on stair instantly summoned to tell have passed at conference between mr franklin under present circumstance one thing to be done be to clap extinguisher upon penelope curiosity on spot accordingly replied that mr franklin have talked of foreign politics till must talk no longer have then mutually fallen asleep in heat of sun try sort of answer when wife daughter next worry with awkward question at awkward time depend on natural sweetness of woman for kissing making up again at next opportunity afternoon wore on lady miss rachel came back needle to say how astonished be when heard that mr franklin blake have arrived have gone off again on horseback needle also to say that asked awkward question directly that foreign politics falling asleep in sun wouldnt serve second time over with being at end of invention said mr franklin arrival by early train be entirely attributable to one of mr franklin freak being asked upon that whether galloping off again on horseback be of mr franklin freak said yes be slipped out of iti think very cleverlyin way having got over difficulty with lady found more difficulty waiting for when went back to own room in came penelopewith natural sweetness of womento kiss make up again andwith natural curiosity of womento ask question time only wanted to tell be matter with second housemaid rosanna spearman after leaving mr franklin at shivering sand rosanna appeared have returned to house in very unaccountable state of mind have turned if penelope be to be believed colour of rainbow have be merry without reason sad without reason in one breath asked hundred of question about mr franklin blake in breath have be angry with penelope for presuming to suppose that strange gentleman must posse interest for have be surprised smiling scribbling mr franklin name inside workbox have be surprised again cry looking at deformed shoulder in glass have mr franklin known anything of other before today quite impossible have heard anything of other impossible again must speak to mr franklin astonishment a genuine when saw how girl stared at penelope must speak to girl inquisitiveness a genuine when asked question about mr franklin conference between conducted in way be tiresome enough until daughter suddenly ended by bursting out with what thought most monstrous supposition have ever heard in life father say penelope quite seriously there only one explanation of rosanna have fallen in love with mr franklin blake at first sight have heard of beautiful young lady falling in love at first sight have thought natural enough housemaid out of reformatory with plain face deformed shoulder falling in love at first sight with gentleman who come on visit to mistress house match that in way of absurdity out of story book in christendom if can laughed till tear rolled down cheek penelope resented merriment in rather strange way never knew cruel before father said very gently went out girl word fell upon like splash of cold water be savage with for feeling uneasy in moment have spoken thembut so be will change subject if please be sorry drifted into writing about not without reason a will see when have gone on together little longer evening came dressing bell for dinner rang before mr franklin returned from frizinghall took hot water up to room expecting to hear after extraordinary delay that something have happened to great disappointment doubt to yours also nothing have happened have not met with indian going returning have deposited moonstone in bankdescribing merely a valuable of great priceand have got receipt for safe in pocket went downstairs feeling that be rather flat ending after excitement about diamond earlier in day how meeting between mr franklin aunt cousin went off be more than can tell must have given something to have waited at table that day in position in household waiting at dinner except on high family festival be letting down dignity in eye of other servantsa thing lady considered quite prone enough to do already without seeking occasion for news brought to from upper region that evening came from penelope footman penelope mentioned that have never known miss rachel so particular about dressing of hair have never seen look so bright pretty a did when went down to meet mr franklin in drawing room footman report be that preservation of respectful composure in presence of better waiting on mr franklin blake at dinner be two

nothing sat down looking dead tired talking on birthday occasion have suppose be too much for lady turning round to wish good night looked hard at wicked colonel legacy shining in daughter dress rachel asked where be going to put diamond tonight miss rachel be in high good spirit just in humour for talking nonsense perversely persisting in a if be sense may sometimes have observed in young girl when be highly wrought up at end of exciting day first declared didnt know where to put diamond then said on dressing table of course along with other thing then remembered that diamond might take to shining of with awful moony light in darkand must terrify in dead of night then bethought of indian cabinet stood in sitting room instantly made up mind to put indian diamond in indian cabinet for purpose of permitting two beautiful native production to admire other having let little flow of nonsense run on a far a point mother interposed stopped dear indian cabinet have lock to say lady good heaven mamma cried miss rachel be hotel be there thief in house without taking notice of fantastic way of talking lady wished gentleman good night next turned to miss rachel kissed why not let keep diamond for tonight asked miss rachel received proposal a might ten year since have received proposal to part from new doll lady saw there be reasoning with night come into room rachel first thing tomorrow morning said will have something to say to with last word left slowly thinking own thought to appearance not best pleased with way by be leading miss rachel be next to say good night

near old oak frame hold large looking glass saw reflected in slyly slipping locket mr franklin have given to out of bosom of dress showing to for moment with smile certainly meant something out of common before tripped off to bed incident staggered little in reliance have previously felt on own judgment began to think that penelope might be right about state of young lady affection after a soon a miss rachel left eye to see with mr franklin noticed variable humour shifting about everything have shifted about indian already betteredge said im half inclined to think took mr murthwaite too seriously when have talk in shrubbery wonder whether have be trying of traveller tale on do really mean to let dog loose ill relieve of collar sir answered leave free to take turn in night if smell reason for right say mr franklin well see what be to be done tomorrow be not at disposed to alarm aunt betteredge without very pressing reason for good night looked so worn pale a nodded to took candle to go upstairs ventured to advise having drop of brandy water by way of night cap mr godfrey walking towards from other end of hall backed pressed mr franklin in friendliest manner to take something before went to bed only note trifling circumstance because after have seen heard that day pleased to observe two gentleman be on just a good term a ever warfare of word heard by penelope in drawing room rivalry for best place in miss rachel good grace seemed to have set serious difference between there be good tempered men of world there be certainly merit in people of station that be not nearly so quarrelsome among other a people of station at mr franklin declined brandy water went upstairs with mr godfrey room being next door to other on landing however either cousin persuaded veered about changed mind a usual perhaps may want in night called down to send up brandy water into room sent up samuel with brandy water then went out unbuckled dog collar lost head with astonishment on being set loose at time of night jumped upon like couple of puppy however rain soon cooled down again lapped drop of water crept back into kennel a went into house noticed sign in sky betokened break in weather for better for present still poured heavily ground be in perfect sop samuel went over house shut up a usual examined everything trusted nothing to deputy on occasion be safe fast when rested old bone in bed between midnight one in morning worry of day have be little too much for suppose at rate have touch of mr franklin malady that night be sunrise before fell off at last into sleep time lay awake house be a quiet a grave not sound stirred splash of rain sighing of wind among tree a breeze sprang up with morning about half past seven woke opened window on fine sunshiny day clock have struck eight be just going out to chain up dog again when heard sudden whisking of petticoat on stair behind turned about there be penelope flying down after like mad father screamed come upstairs for god sake diamond be gone be out of mind asked gone say penelope gone nobody know how come up see dragged after into young lady sitting room opened into bedroom there on threshold of bedroom door stood miss rachel almost a white in face a white dressing gown clothed there also stood two door of indian cabinet wide open one of drawer inside be pulled out a far a must go look say penelope saw miss rachel put diamond into drawer last night went to cabinet drawer be empty be true miss asked with look be not like with voice be not like own miss rachel answered a daughter have answered diamond be gone having said word withdrew into bedroom shut locked door before knew way to turn next lady came in hearing voice in daughter sitting room wondering what have happened news of loss of diamond seemed to petrify went straight to miss rachel bedroom insisted on being admitted miss rachel let in alarm running through house like fire caught two gentleman next mr godfrey be first to come out of room did when heard what have happened be to hold up hand in state of bewilderment didnt say much for natural strength of mind mr franklin whose clear head have confidently counted on to advise seemed to be a helpless a cousin when heard news in turn for wonder have have good night rest at last unaccustomed luxury of sleep have a said apparently stupefied however when have swallowed cup of coffeewhich always took on foreign plan hour before ate breakfasthis brain brightened clear headed side of turned up took matter in hand resolutely cleverly much a follows first sent for servant told to leave lower door window with exception of front door have opened exactly a have be left when locked up over night next proposed to cousin to to make quite sure before took further step that diamond have not accidentally dropped somewhere out of sightsay at back of cabinet down behind table on cabinet stood having searched in place found nothinghaving also questioned penelope discovered from more than little have already told memr franklin suggested next extending inquiry to miss rachel sent penelope to knock at bedroom door lady answered knock closed door behind moment after heard locked inside by miss rachel mistress came out among looking sorely puzzled distressed loss of diamond seems to have quite overwhelmed rachel said in reply to mr franklin shrink in strangest manner from speaking of even to be impossible can see for present having added to perplexity by account of miss rachel lady after little effort recovered usual composure acted with usual decision suppose there be help for said quietly suppose have alternative to send for police first thing for police to do added mr franklin catching up be to lay hand on indian juggler who performed here last night lady mr godfrey not knowing what mr franklin knew started looked surprised cant stop to explain now mr franklin went on can only tell that indian have certainly stolen diamond give letter of introduction say addressing lady to one of magistrate at frizinghallmerely telling that represent interest wish let ride off with instantly chance of catching thief may depend on not wasting one unnecessary minute nota bene whether be french side english right side of mr franklin seemed to be uppermost now only question be how long must last put pen ink paper before aunt who a appeared to wrote letter wanted little unwillingly if have be possible to overlook such event a loss of jewel worth twenty thousand pound believewith lady opinion of late brother distrust of birthday giftit must have be privately relief to to let thief get off with moonstone scot free went out with mr franklin to stable took opportunity of asking how indian whom suspected of course a shrewdly a did must possibly have got into house one of might have slipped into hall in confusion when dinner company be going away say mr franklin fellow may have be under sofa while aunt rachel be talking about where diamond be to be put for night must only have to wait till house be quiet there must be in cabinet to be have for taking with word called to groom to open gate galloped off seemed certainly to be only rational explanation how have thief contrived to make escape from house have found front door locked bolted a have left at night when went to open after getting up a for other door window there be still safe fast to speak for dog too suppose thief have got away by dropping from one of upper window how have escaped dog have come provided for with drugged meat a doubt crossed mind dog came galloping at round corner rolling other over on wet grass in such lively health spirit that be with small difficulty brought to reason chained up again more turned over in mind le satisfactory mr franklin explanation appeared to be have breakfastswhatever happens in house robbery murder doesnt matter must have breakfast when have done lady sent for found compelled to tell have hitherto concealed relating to indian plot being woman of high courage soon got over first startling effect of what have to communicate mind seemed to be far more perturbed about daughter than about heathen rogue conspiracy know how odd rachel be how differently behaves sometimes from other girl lady said to have never in experience seen so strange so reserved a be now loss of jewel seems almost to have turned brain who must have thought that horrible diamond must have laid hold on in so short time be certainly strange taking toy trinket in general miss rachel be nothing like so mad after a most young girl yet there be still locked up inconsolably in bedroom be fair to add that be not only one of in house who be thrown out of regular groove mr godfrey for instancethough professionally sort of consoler generalseemed to be at loss where to look for own resource having company to amuse getting chance of trying what experience of woman in distress must do towards comforting miss rachel wandered hither thither about house garden in aimless uneasy way be in two different mind about what became to do after misfortune have happened to ought to relieve family in present situation of responsibility of a guest ought to stay on chance that even humble service might be of use decided ultimately that last course be perhaps most customary considerate course to take in such very peculiar case of family distress a be circumstance try metal man be really made of mr godfrey tried by circumstance showed of weaker metal than have thought to be a for woman servant excepting rosanna spearman who kept by herselfthey took to whispering together in corner staring at nothing suspiciously a be manner of weaker half of human family when anything extraordinary happens in house acknowledge to have be fidgety ill tempered cursed moonstone have turned upside down little before eleven mr franklin came back resolute side of have to appearance given way in interval since departure under stress have be laid on have left at gallop came back to at walk when went away be made of iron when returned be stuffed with cotton a limp a limp must be well say lady be police coming yes say mr franklin said must follow in fly superintendent seegrave of local police force two of men mere form case be hopeless have indian escaped sir asked poor ill used indian have be most unjustly put in prison say mr franklin be a innocent a babe unborn idea that one of be hidden in house have ended like rest of idea in smoke be proved say mr franklin dwelling with great relish on own incapacity to be simply impossible after astonishing by announcing totally new turn in matter of moonstone young gentleman at aunt request took seat explained appeared that resolute side of have held out a far a frizinghall have put whole case plainly before magistrate magistrate have at once sent for police first inquiry instituted about indian showed that have not so much a attempted to leave town further question addressed to police proved that three have be seen returning to frizinghall with boy on previous night between ten elevenwhich regard being have to hour distance also proved that have walked straight back after performing on terrace later still at midnight police having occasion to search common lodging house where lived have seen three again little boy with a usual soon after midnight have safely shut up house plainer evidence than in favour of indian there must not well be magistrate said there be not even case of suspicion against so far a be just possible when police came to investigate matter discovery affecting juggler might be made must contrive by committing a rogue vagabond to keep at disposal under lock key for week have ignorantly done something forget what in town barely brought within operation of law human institution justice included will stretch little if only pull right way worthy magistrate be old friend of lady indian be committed for week a soon a court opened that morning such be mr franklin narrative of event at indian clue to mystery of lost jewel be now to appearance clue have broken in hand if juggler be innocent who in name of wonder have taken moonstone out of miss rachel drawer ten minute later to infinite relief superintendent seegrave arrived at house reported passing mr franklin on terrace sitting in sun suppose with italian side of uppermost warning police a went by that investigation be hopeless before investigation have begun for family in situation superintendent of frizinghall police be most comforting officer must wish to see mr seegrave be tall portly military in manner have fine commanding voice mighty resolute eye grand frock coat buttoned beautifully up to leather stock im man want be written over face ordered two inferior police men about with severity convinced that there be trifling with began by going round premise outside in result of investigation proving to that thief have broken in upon from outside that robbery consequently must have be committed by person in house leave to imagine state servant be in when official announcement first reached ear superintendent decided to begin by examining boudoir that done to examine servant next at same time posted one of men on staircase led to servant bedroom with instruction to let nobody in house pas till further order at latter proceeding weaker half of human family went distracted on spot bounced out of corner whisked upstairs in body to miss rachel room rosanna spearman being carried away among time burst in on superintendent seegrave looking equally guilty summoned to say of suspected at once mr superintendent proved equal to occasion looked at with resolute eye cowed with military voice now then woman go downstairs again everyone of wont have here look say mr superintendent suddenly pointing to little smear of decorative painting on miss rachel door at outer edge just under lock look what mischief petticoat of of have done already clear out clear out rosanna spearman who be nearest to nearest to little smear on door set example of obedience slipped off instantly to work rest followed out superintendent finished examination of room making nothing of asked who have first discovered robbery daughter have first discovered daughter be sent for mr superintendent proved to be little too sharp with penelope at starting now young woman attend to mind speak truth penelope fired up instantly ive never be taught to tell lie mr policemanand if father can stand there hear accused of falsehood thieving own bedroom shut against character taken away be poor girl have left he not good father take for timely word from put justice penelope on pleasanter footing together question answer went swimmingly ended in nothing worth mentioning daughter have seen miss rachel put diamond in drawer of cabinet last thing at night have gone in with miss rachel cup of tea at eight next morning have found drawer open empty upon that have alarmed houseand there be end of penelope evidence mr superintendent next asked to see miss rachel penelope mentioned request through door answer reached by same road have nothing to tell policemani cant see anybody experienced officer looked equally surprised offended when heard that reply told young lady be ill begged to wait little see later thereupon went downstairs again be met by mr godfrey mr franklin crossing hall two gentleman being inmate of house be summoned to say if must throw light on matter of knew anything about have heard suspicious noise during previous night have heard nothing pattering of rain have lying awake longer than of heard nothing either nothing released from examination mr franklin still sticking to helpless view of difficulty whispered to that man will be of earthly use to superintendent seegrave be as released in turn mr godfrey whispered to meevidently most competent person betteredge have greatest faith in many men many opinion a one of ancient said before time mr superintendent next proceeding took back to boudoir again with daughter at heel object be to discover whether of furniture have be moved during night out of customary placehis previous investigation in room having apparently not gone quite far enough to satisfy mind on point while be still poking about among chair table door of bedroom be suddenly opened after having denied to everybody miss rachel to astonishment walked into midst of of own accord took up garden hat from chair then went straight to penelope with question mr franklin blake sent with message to morning yes miss wished to speak to didnt yes miss where be now hearing voice on terrace below looked out of window saw two gentleman walking up down together answering for daughter said mr franklin be on terrace miss without word without heeding mr superintendent who tried to speak to pale a death wrapped up strangely in own thought left room went down to cousin on terrace showed want of due respect showed breach of good manner on part for life of couldnt help looking out of window when miss rachel met gentleman outside went up to mr franklin without appearing to notice mr godfrey who thereupon drew back left by what said to mr franklin appeared to be spoken vehemently lasted for short time judging by what saw of face from window seemed to astonish beyond power of expression while be still together lady appeared on terrace miss rachel saw few last word to mr franklinand suddenly went back into house again before mother came up with lady surprised noticing mr franklin surprise spoke to mr godfrey joined spoke also mr franklin walked away little between two telling have happened suppose for stopped short after taking few step like person struck with amazement have just seen a much a when door of sitting room be opened violently miss rachel walked swiftly through to bedroom wild angry with fierce eye flaming cheek mr superintendent once more attempted to question turned round on at bedroom door have not sent for cried out vehemently dont want diamond be lost neither anybody else will ever find with word went in locked door in face penelope standing nearest to heard burst out cry moment be alone again in rage one moment in tear next what did mean told superintendent meant that miss rachel temper be upset by loss of jewel being anxious for honour of family distressed to see young lady forget herselfeven with police officerand made best excuse must accordingly in own private mind be more puzzled by miss rachel extraordinary language conduct than word can tell taking what have said at bedroom door a guide to guess by must only conclude that be mortally offended by sending for police that mr franklin astonishment on terrace be caused by having expressed to a person chiefly instrumental in fetching police to effect if guess be right whyhaving lost diamondshould object to presence in house of very people whose business be to recover for how in heaven name must know that moonstone must never be found again a thing stood at present answer to question be to be hoped for from anybody in house mr franklin appeared to think point of honour to forbear repeating to servanteven to so old servant a waswhat miss rachel have said to on terrace mr godfrey who a gentleman relative have be probably admitted into mr franklin confidence respected confidence a be bound to do lady who be also in secret doubt who alone have access to miss rachel owned openly that must make nothing of madden when talk of diamond mother influence failed to extract from word more than here be then at dead lock about miss racheland at dead lock about moonstone in first case lady be powerless to help in second a will presently judge mr seegrave be fast approaching condition of superintendent at wit end having ferreted about over boudoir without making discovery among furniture experienced officer applied to to know whether servant in general be be not acquainted with place in diamond have be put for night knew where be put sir said to begin with footman knew alsofor be present in hall when be talking about where diamond be to be kept that night daughter knew a have already told samuel may have mentioned thing to other servantsor other servant may have heard talk for through side door of hall might have be open to back staircase for can tell everybody in house may have known where jewel be last night answer presenting rather wide field for mr superintendent suspicion to range over tried to narrow by asking about servant character next thought directly of rosanna spearman be place wish to direct suspicion against poor girl whose honesty have be above doubt a long a have known matron at reformatory have reported to lady a sincerely penitent thoroughly trustworthy girl be superintendent business to discover reason for suspecting firstand then not till then must be duty to tell how came into lady service people have excellent character said have deserved trust mistress have placed in after that there be one thing left for mr seegrave to donamely to set to work tackle servant character one after be examined one after proved to have nothing to sayand said so far a woman be concerned at great length with very angry sense of embargo laid on bedroom rest of being sent back to place downstairs penelope be then summoned examined separately second time daughter little outbreak of temper in boudoir readiness to think suspected appeared to have produced unfavourable impression on superintendent seegrave seemed also to dwell little on mind that have be last person who saw diamond at night when second questioning be over girl came back to in frenzy there be doubt of longerthe police officer have almost a good a told be thief must scarcely believe taking mr franklin view to be quite such as a though said nothing eye with looked at daughter be not very pleasant eye to see laughed off with poor penelope a something too ridiculous to be treated seriouslywhich certainly be secretly be afraid be foolish enough to be angry too be little tryingit be indeed girl sat down in corner with apron over head quite broken hearted foolish of will say might have waited till openly accused well being man of just equal temper admit still mr superintendent might have rememberednever mind what might have remembered devil take next last step in investigation brought matter a say to crisis officer have interview at be present with lady after informing that diamond must have be taken by somebody in house requested permission for men to search servant room box on spot good mistress like generous high bred woman be refused to let be treated like thief will never consent to make such return a said for owe to faithful servant who be employed in house mr superintendent made bow with look in direction said plainly why employ if be to tie hand in way a head of servant felt directly that be bound in justice to party not to profit by mistress generosity gratefully thank ladyship said ask permission to do what be right in matter by giving up key when gabriel betteredge set example say stopping superintendent seegrave at door rest of servant will follow promise there be key to begin with lady took by hand thanked with tear in eye lord what must not have given at moment for privilege of knocking superintendent seegrave down a have promised for other servant followed lead sorely against grain of course taking view took woman be sight to see while police officer be rummaging among thing cook looked a if must grill mr superintendent alive on furnace other woman looked a if must eat when be done search over diamond sign of diamond being found of course anywhere superintendent seegrave retired to little room to consider with what be to do next men have now be hour in house have not advanced one inch towards discovery of how moonstone have be taken of whom be to suspect a thief while police officer be still pondering in solitude be sent for to see mr franklin in library to unutterable astonishment just a hand be on door be suddenly opened from inside out walked rosanna spearman after library have be swept cleaned in morning first second housemaid have business in room at later period of day stopped rosanna spearman charged with breach of domestic discipline on spot what might want in library at time of day inquired mr franklin blake dropped one of ring upstairs say rosanna have be into library to give to girl face be in flush a made that answer walked away with toss of head look of self importance be quite at loss to account for proceeding in house have doubtless upset woman servant more le none of have gone clean out of natural character a rosanna to appearance have now gone out of hers found mr franklin writing at library table asked for conveyance to railway station moment entered room first sound of voice informed that now have resolute side of uppermost once more man made of cotton have disappeared man made of iron sat before again going to london sir asked going to telegraph to london say mr franklin have convinced aunt that must have cleverer head than superintendent seegraves to help have got permission to despatch telegram to father know chief commissioner of police commissioner can lay hand on right man to solve mystery of diamond talking of mystery by bye say mr franklin dropping voice have word to say to before go to stable dont breathe word of to anybody a yet rosanna spearmans head be not quite right be afraid know more about moonstone than ought to know can hardly tell whether be more startled distressed at hearing say that if have be younger might have confessed a much to mr franklin when be old acquire one excellent habit in case where dont see way clearly hold tongue came in here with ring dropped in bedroom mr franklin went on when have thanked of course expected to go instead of stood opposite to at table looking at in oddest mannerhalf frightened half familiari couldnt make out be strange thing about diamond sir said in curiously sudden headlong way said yes be wondered what be coming next upon honour betteredge think must be wrong in head said will never find diamond sir will person who took itill answer for actually nodded smiled at before must ask what meant heard step outside suppose be afraid of catching here at rate changed colour left room what on earth doe mean must not bring to tell girl story even then must have be almost a good a telling that be thief besides even if have made clean breast of even supposing be thief reason why must let out secret to mr franklin of people in world must have be still a far to seek a ever cant bear idea of getting poor girl into scrape merely because have flighty way with talk very strangely mr franklin went on yet if have said to superintendent what said to fool a be im afraid stopped there left rest unspoken best way sir said will be for to say two word privately to mistress about at first opportunity lady have very friendly interest in rosanna girl may only have be forward foolish after when there mess of kind in house sir woman servant like to look at gloomy sideit give poor wretch kind of importance in own eye if there anybody ill trust woman for prophesying that person will die if jewel lost trust for prophesying that will never be found again view be bound to say thought probable view on reflection seemed to relieve mr franklin mightily folded up telegram dismissed subject on way to stable to order pony chaise looked in at servant hall where be at dinner rosanna spearman be not among on inquiry found that have be suddenly taken ill have gone upstairs to own room to lie down curious looked well enough when saw last remarked penelope followed out dont talk in way before rest of said only make harder on rosanna than ever poor thing be breaking heart about mr franklin blake here be view of girl conduct if be possible for penelope to be right explanation of rosannas strange language behaviour might have be in didnt care what said so long a must surprise mr franklin

occupied in making away with in convenient place on lonely bit of beach ahead of have traced evening to fishing village to one particular cottage may possibly have to visit before go back stopped in cottage for time came out with a believe something hidden under cloak cloak on woman back be emblem of charityit cover multitude of sin saw set off northward along coast after leaving cottage be sea shore here considered fine specimen of marine landscape mr betteredge answered yes a shortly a might be taste differ say sergeant cuff looking at from point of view never saw marine landscape admired le if happen to be following person along sea coast if person happens to look round there isnt scrap of cover to hide anywhere have to choose between taking rosanna in custody on suspicion leaving for time being with little game in own hand for reason wont trouble with decided on making sacrifice rather than give alarm a soon a tonight to certain person who will be nameless between came back to house to ask to take to north end of beach by way sandin respect of printing off people footstepsis one of best detective officer know if dont meet with rosanna spearman by coming round on in way sand may tell what have be at if light only last long enough here be sand if will excuse suggesting itsuppose hold tongue let go first if there be such thing known at doctor shop a detective fever that disease have now got fast hold of humble servant sergeant cuff went on between hillock of sand down to beach followed with heart in mouth waited at little distance for what be to happen next a turned out found standing nearly in same place where rosanna spearman have be talking together when mr franklin suddenly appeared before on arriving at house from london while eye be watching sergeant mind wandered away in spite of to what have passed on former occasion between rosanna declare almost felt poor thing slip hand again into mine give little grateful squeeze to thank for speaking kindly to declare almost heard voice telling again that shivering sand seemed to draw to against own will whenever went outalmost saw face brighten again a brightened when first set eye upon mr franklin coming briskly out on from among hillock spirit fell lower lower a thought of thingsand view of lonesome little bay when looked about to rouse only served to make feel more uneasy still last of evening light be fading away over desolate place there hung still awful calm heave of main ocean on great sandbank out in bay be heave made sound inner sea lay lost dim without breath of wind to stir patch of nasty ooze floated yellow white on dead surface of water scum slime shone faintly in certain place where last of light still caught on two great spit of rock jutting out north south into sea be now time of turn of tide even a stood there waiting broad brown face of quicksand began to dimple quiverthe only moving thing in horrid place saw sergeant start a shiver of sand caught eye after looking at for minute so turned came back to treacherous place mr betteredge said sign of rosanna spearman anywhere on beach look where may took down lower on shore saw for that footstep mine be only footstep printed off on sand how doe fishing village bear standing where be now asked sergeant cuff cobbs hole answered that being name of place bear a near a may be due south saw girl evening walking northward along shore from cobbs hole said sergeant consequently must have be walking towards place be cobbs hole on other side of point of land there can get to itnow low waterby beach answered yes to question if youll excuse suggesting well step out briskly said sergeant want to find place where left shore before get dark have walked must say couple of hundred yard towards cobbs hole when sergeant cuff suddenly went down on knee on beach to appearance seized with sudden frenzy for saying prayer there something to be said for marine landscape here after remarked sergeant here be woman footstep mr betteredge let call rosannas footstep until find evidence to contrary that cant resist very confused footstep will please to observepurposely confused must say ah poor soul understands detective virtue of sand a well a do hasnt be in rather too great hurry to tread out mark thoroughly think have here one footstep going from cobbs hole here be going back to isnt that toe of shoe pointing straight to water edge dont see two heel mark further down beach close at water edge also dont want to hurt feeling im afraid rosanna be sly look a if have determined to get to place have just come from without leaving mark on sand to trace by will say that walked through water from point till got to ledge of rock behind came back same way then took to beach again where two heel mark be still left yes well say that seems to fit in with notion that have something under cloak when left cottage not something to destroyfor in case where must have be need of precaution to prevent tracing place at walk ended something to hide be think better guess of two perhaps if go on to cottage may find out what that something be at proposal detective fever suddenly cooled dont want said what good can do longer know mr betteredge said sergeant more virtue discover modestyoh dear how rare modesty be in world how much of rarity posse if go alone to cottage people tongue will be tied at first question put to if go with go introduced by justly respected neighbour flow of conversation be necessary result strike in light how doe strike not having answer of needful smartness a ready a must have wished tried to gain time by asking what cottage wanted to go to on sergeant describing place recognised a cottage inhabited by fisherman named yolland with wife two grown up child son daughter if will look back will find that in first presenting rosanna spearman to notice have described a occasionally varying walk to shivering sand by visit to friend of hers at cobbs hole friend be yollandsrespectable worthy people credit to neighbourhood rosannas acquaintance with have begun by mean of daughter who be afflicted with misshapen foot who be known in part by name of limping two deformed girl have suppose kind of fellow feeling for other anyway yollands rosanna always appeared to get on together at few chance have of meeting in pleasant friendly manner fact of sergeant cuff having traced girl to cottage set matter of helping inquiry in quite new light rosanna have merely gone where be in habit of going to show that have be in company with fisherman family be a good a to prove that have be innocently occupied so far at rate must be doing girl service therefore instead of injury if allowed to be convinced by sergeant cuff logic professed convinced by accordingly went on to cobbs hole seeing footstep on sand a long a light lasted on reaching cottage fisherman son proved to be out in boat limping lucy always weak weary be resting on bed upstairs good mr yolland received alone in kitchen when heard that sergeant cuff be celebrated character in london clapped bottle of dutch gin couple of clean pipe on table stared a if must never see enough of sat quiet in corner waiting to hear how sergeant must find way to subject of rosanna spearman usual roundabout manner of going to work proved on occasion to be more roundabout than ever how managed be more than must tell at time more than can tell now be certain began with royal family primitive methodist price of fish got from that in dismal underground way to loss of moonstone spitefulness of first house maid hard behaviour of woman servant generally towards rosanna spearman having reached subject in fashion described a making inquiry about lost diamond partly with view to find partly for purpose of clearing rosanna from unjust suspicion of enemy in house in about quarter of hour from time when entered kitchen good mr yolland be persuaded that be talking to rosannas best friend be pressing sergeant cuff to comfort stomach revive spirit out of dutch bottle being firmly persuaded that sergeant be wasting breath to purpose on mr yolland sat enjoying talk between much a have sat in time enjoying stage play great cuff showed wonderful patience trying luck drearily way way firing shot after shot a be at random on chance of hitting mark everything to rosannas credit nothing to rosannas be how ended try a might with mr yolland talking nineteen to dozen placing most entire confidence in last effort be made when have looked at watch have got on leg previous to taking leave will now

be going to leave cry mr yolland nota benei translate mr yolland out of yorkshire language into english language when tell that accomplished cuff be now then puzzled to understand until helped will draw own conclusion a to what state of mind must be if reported in native tongue rosanna spearman going to leave pricked up ear at that seemed strange to say least of that must have given warning in first place to lady to certain doubt came up in mind whether sergeant cuff last random shot might not have hit mark began to question whether share in proceeding be quite a harmless one a have thought might be in way of sergeant business to mystify honest woman by wrapping round in network of lie be duty to have remembered a good protestant that father of lie be deviland mischief devil be never far apart beginning to smell mischief in air tried to take sergeant cuff out sat down again instantly asked for little drop of comfort out of dutch bottle mr yolland sat down opposite to gave nip went on

afraid be innocently cause of disturbance betteredge sir cant explain say mr franklin if girl be concerned in loss of diamond do really believe be on point of confessing everythingto of people in worldnot two minute since looking towards swing door a said last word fancied saw opened little way from inner side be there anybody listening door fell to before must get to looking through moment after thought saw tail of sergeant cuff respectable black coat disappearing round corner of passage knew a well a did that must expect more help from now that have discovered turn investigation be really taking under circumstance be quite in character to help to do by underground way not feeling sure have really seen sergeantand not desiring to make needle mischief where heaven know there be mischief enough going on alreadyi told mr franklin that thought one of dog have got into houseand then begged to describe what have happened between rosanna be passing through hall sir asked did meet accidentally when spoke to mr franklin pointed to billiard table be knocking ball about said trying to get miserable business of diamond out of mind happened to look upand there stood rosanna spearman at side of like ghost stealing on in way be so strange that hardly knew what to do at first seeing very anxious expression in face asked if wished to speak to answered yes if dare knowing what

in refusing to listen to if be really bent on speaking to be awkward position dare say got out of awkwardly enough said to dont quite understand be there anything want to do mind betteredge didnt speak unkindly poor girl cant help being uglyi felt that at time cue be still in hand went on knocking ball about to take off awkwardness of thing a turned out only made matter worse still im afraid mortified without meaning suddenly turned away look at billiard ball heard say anything rather than look at before must stop have left hall be not quite easy about betteredge must mind telling rosanna meant unkindness have be little hard on perhaps in own thoughtsi have almost hoped that loss of diamond might be traced to not from ill will to poor girl stopped there going back to billiard table

painful matter for to speak of for to hear there mistress stopped once more may possibly make le painful to to good servant friend here said if set example of speaking boldly on side suspect miss verinder of deceiving by secreting diamond for purpose of own be that true quite true lady very well now before begin have to tell a miss verinders mother that be absolutely incapable of doing what suppose to have done knowledge of character date from day two since knowledge of character date from beginning of life state suspicion of a strongly a pleaseit be impossible that can offend by doing so be sure beforehand that with experience circumstance have fatally misled in case mind be in possession of private information be a absolutely shut out of daughter confidence a be one reason for speaking positively be reason have heard already know child turned to gave hand kissed in silence may go on said facing sergeant again a steadily a ever sergeant cuff bowed mistress have produced one effect on hatchet face softened for moment a if be sorry for a to shaking in own conviction be plain to see that have not moved by single inch settled in chair began vile attack on miss rachel character in word must ask ladyship said to look matter in face from point of view a well a from yours will please to suppose coming down here in place with experience will allow to mention very briefly what experience have be mistress signed to that must do sergeant went on for last twenty year said have be largely employed in case of family scandal acting in capacity of confidential man one result of domestic practice have bearing on matter now in hand be result may state in two word be well within experience that young lady of rank position do occasionally have private debt dare not acknowledge to nearest relative friend sometimes milliner jeweller be at bottom of sometimes money be wanted for purpose dont suspect in case wont shock by mentioning bear in mind what have said ladyand now let see how event in house have forced back on own experience whether liked not considered with for moment went onwith horrid clearness obliged to understand with abominable justice favoured nobody first information relating to loss of moonstone said sergeant came to from superintendent seegrave proved to complete satisfaction that be perfectly incapable of managing case one thing said struck a worth listening to be thisthat miss verinder have declined to be questioned by have spoken to with perfectly incomprehensible rudeness contempt thought curiousbut attributed mainly to clumsiness on superintendent part might have offended young lady after put by in mind applied single handed to case ended a be aware in discovery of smear on door in mr franklin blake evidence satisfying that same smear loss of diamond be piece of same puzzle so far if suspected anything suspected that moonstone have be stolen that one of servant might prove to be thief very good in state of thing what happens miss verinder suddenly come out of room speaks to observe three suspicious appearance in young lady be still violently agitated though more than four twenty hour have passed since diamond be lost treat a have already treated superintendent seegrave be mortally offended with mr franklin blake very good again here say to be young lady who have lost valuable jewela young lady also a own eye ear inform who be of impetuous temperament under circumstance with character what doe do betrays incomprehensible resentment against mr blake mr superintendent myselfotherwise very three people who have in different way be trying to help to recover lost jewel having brought inquiry to pointthen lady not till then begin to look back into own mind for own experience own experience explains miss verinders otherwise incomprehensible conduct associate with other young lady know of tell have debt darent acknowledge must be paid set asking whether loss of diamond may not meanthat diamond must be secretly pledged to pay be conclusion experience draw from plain fact what doe ladyship experience say against have said already answered mistress circumstance have misled said nothing on side robinson crusoegod know howhad got into muddled old head if sergeant cuff have found at moment transported to desert island without man friday to keep company ship to take offhe must have found exactly where wished to be nota benei be average good christian when dont push christianity too far rest of youwhich be great comfortare in respect much same a be sergeant cuff went on right wrong lady said having drawn conclusion next thing to do be to put to test suggested to ladyship examination of wardrobe in house be mean of finding article of dress have in probability made smear be mean of putting conclusion to test how did turn out ladyship consented mr blake consented mr ablewhite consented miss verinder alone stopped whole proceeding by refusing point blank that result satisfied that view be right one if ladyship mr betteredge persist in not agreeing with must be blind to what happened before very day in hearing told young lady that leaving house a thing be then must put obstacle in way of recovering jewel saw yourselves that drove off in face of statement saw that so far from forgiving mr blake for having done more than rest of to put clue into hand publicly insulted mr blake on step of mother house what do thing mean if miss verinder be not privy to suppression of diamond what do thing mean time looked way be downright frightful to hear piling up proof after proof against miss rachel to know while one be longing to defend that there be disputing truth of what said be thank god constitutionally superior to reason enabled to hold firm to lady view be view also roused spirit made put bold face on before sergeant cuff profit good friend beseech by example will save from many trouble of vexing sort cultivate superiority to reason see how pare claw of sensible people when try to scratch for own good finding made remark that mistress made remark sergeant cuff proceeded lord how did enrage to notice that be not in least put out by silence there be case lady a stand against miss verinder alone said next thing be to put case a stand against miss verinder deceased rosanna spearman taken together will go back for moment if please to daughter refusal to let wardrobe be examined mind being made up after circumstance have two question to consider next first a to right method of conducting inquiry second a to whether miss verinder have accomplice among female servant in house after carefully thinking over determined to conduct inquiry in what must call at office highly irregular manner for reason have family scandal to deal with be business to keep within family limit le noise made fewer stranger employed to help better a to usual course of taking people in custody on suspicion going before magistrate rest of itnothing of sort be to be thought of when ladyship daughter be a believed at bottom of whole business in case felt that person of mr betteredges character position in houseknowing servant a did having honour of family at heartwould be safer to take a assistant than other person whom must lay hand on must have tried mr blake a wellbut for one obstacle in way saw drift of proceeding at very early date with interest in miss verinder mutual understanding be impossible between trouble ladyship with particular to show have kept family secret within family circle be only outsider who know itand professional existence depends on holding tongue here felt that professional existence depended on not holding tongue to be held up before mistress in old age a sort of deputy policeman be once again more than christianity be strong enough to bear beg to inform ladyship said that never to knowledge helped abominable detective business in way from first to last summon sergeant cuff to contradict if dare having given vent in word felt greatly relieved ladyship honoured by little friendly pat on shoulder looked with righteous indignation at sergeant to see what thought of such testimony a that sergeant looked back like lamb seemed to like better than ever lady informed that might continue statement understand said that have honestly done best in what believe to be interest be ready to hear what have to say next what have to say next answered sergeant cuff relates to rosanna spearman recognised young woman a ladyship may remember when brought washing book into room up to time be inclined to doubt whether miss verinder have trusted secret to anyone when saw rosanna altered mind suspected at once of being privy to suppression of diamond poor creature have met death by dreadful end dont want ladyship to think now shes gone be unduly hard on if have be common case of thieving must have given rosanna benefit of doubt just a freely a must have given to of other servant in house experience of reformatory woman be that when tried in serviceand when kindly judiciously treatedthey prove in majority of case to be honestly penitent honestly worthy of pain taken with be not common case of thieving be casein mindof deeply planned fraud with owner of diamond at bottom of holding view first consideration naturally presented to in connection with rosanna be must miss verinder be satisfied begging ladyship pardon with leading to think that moonstone be merely lost must go step further delude into believing that moonstone be stolen in latter event there be rosanna spearmanwith character of thiefready to hand person of others to lead ladyship off to lead off on false scent be possible asked that must put case against miss rachel rosanna in more horrid point of view than be possible a will now see have reason for suspecting deceased woman said appears to to have be stronger still who must be very person to help miss verinder in raising money privately on diamond rosanna spearman young lady in miss verinders position must manage risky matter a by go between must have who so fit ask again a rosanna spearman ladyship deceased housemaid be at top of profession when be thief have relation to certain knowledge with one of few men in london in money lending line who must advance large sum on notable jewel a moonstone without asking awkward question insisting on awkward condition bear in mind lady now let show how suspicion have be justified by rosannas own act by plain inference to be drawn from thereupon passed whole of rosannas proceeding under review be already a well acquainted with proceeding a be will understand how unanswerably part of report fixed guilt of being concerned in disappearance of moonstone on memory of poor dead girl even mistress be daunted by what said now made answer when have done didnt seem to matter to sergeant whether be answered not on went devil take just a steady a ever having stated whole case a understand said have only to tell ladyship now what propose to do next see two way of bringing inquiry successfully to end one of way look upon a certainty other admit be bold experiment nothing more ladyship will decide will take certainty first mistress made sign to take own way choose for thank said sergeant well begin with certainty a ladyship be so good a to leave to whether miss verinder remains at frizinghall whether return here propose in case to keep careful watch on proceedingson people see on ride walk may take on letter may write receive what next asked mistress will next answered sergeant request ladyship leave to introduce into house a servant in place of rosanna spearman woman accustomed to private inquiry of sort for whose discretion can answer what next repeated mistress next proceeded sergeant last propose to send one of brother officer to make arrangement with money lender in london whom mentioned just now a formerly acquainted with rosanna spearmanand whose name address ladyship may rely on have be communicated by rosanna to miss verinder dont deny that course of action be now suggesting will cost money consume time result be certain run line round moonstone draw line closer closer till find in miss verinders possession supposing decides to keep if debt press decides on sending away then have man ready meet moonstone on arrival in london to hear own daughter made subject of such proposal a stung mistress into speaking angrily for first time consider proposal declined in particular said go on to other way of bringing inquiry to end other way said sergeant going on a easy a ever be to try bold experiment to have alluded think have formed pretty correct estimate of miss verinders temperament be quite capable according to belief of committing daring fraud be too hot impetuous in temper too little accustomed to deceit a habit to act hypocrite in small thing to restrain under provocation feeling in case have repeatedly got beyond control at very time when be plainly interest to conceal be on peculiarity in character now propose to act want to give great shock suddenly under circumstance will touch to quick in plain english want to tell miss verinder without word of warning of rosannas deathon chance that own better feeling will hurry into making clean breast of doe ladyship accept alternative mistress astonished beyond power of expression answered on instant yes do pony chaise be ready said sergeant wish ladyship good morning lady held up hand stopped at door daughter better feeling will be appealed to a propose said claim right a mother of putting to test myself

last train leaf for london tonight with stepped into chaise taking rein drove off to frizinghall chapter xxii mistress having left have leisure to think of sergeant cuff found sitting in snug corner of hall consulting memorandum book curling up viciously at corner of lip making note of case asked said sergeant looking to see what next professional engagement be oh said think over then here think answered sergeant cuff that lady verinder be one of cleverest woman in england also think rose much better worth looking at than diamond where be gardener mr betteredge there be getting word more out

meantime be business to find out whether mr franklin persisted in resolution to leave by afternoon train after having be informed of conference in lady room of how have ended immediately decided on waiting to hear news from frizinghall very natural alteration in planswhich with ordinary people must have led to nothing in particularproved in mr franklin case to have one objectionable result left unsettled with legacy of idle time on hand in so doing let out foreign side of character one on top of like rat out of bag now a italian englishman now a german englishman now a french englishman drifted in out of sitting room in house with nothing to talk of miss rachel treatment of with nobody to address to found for example in library sitting under map of modern italy quite unaware of other method of meeting trouble except method of talking about have several worthy aspiration betteredge what be to do with now be full of dormant good quality if rachel must only have helped to bring out be so eloquent in drawing picture of own neglected merit so pathetic in lamenting over when be done that felt quite at wit end how to console when suddenly occurred to that here be case for wholesome application of bit of robinson crusoe hobbled out to own room hobbled back with immortal book nobody in library map of modern italy stared at stared at map of modern italy tried drawing room there be handkerchief on floor to prove that have drifted in there be empty room to prove that have drifted out again tried dining room discovered samuel with biscuit glass of sherry silently investigating

crusoe in be firmly persuaded explanation might have be found if have only searched long enough for mr franklin shut up robinson crusoe floundered into german english gibberish on spot why not look into said a if have personally objected to looking into why devil lose patience betteredge when patience be thats wanted to arrive at truth dont interrupt rachel conduct be perfectly intelligible if will only do common justice to take objective view first subjective view next objective subjective view to wind up with what do know know that loss of moonstone on thursday morning last threw into state of nervous excitement from have not recovered yet do mean to deny objective view so far very well thendont interrupt now being in state of nervous excitement how be to expect that must behave a might otherwise have behaved to of people about arguing in way from within outwards what do reach reach subjective view defy to controvert subjective view very well thenwhat follows good heaven objective subjective explanation follows of course rachel properly speaking be not rachel somebody else do mind being cruelly treated by somebody else be unreasonable enough betteredge can hardly accuse of then how doe end end in spite of confounded english narrowness prejudice in being perfectly happy comfortable wheres sherry head be by time in such condition be not quite sure whether be own head mr franklin in deplorable state contrived to do what take to have be three objective thing got mr franklin sherry retired to own room solaced with most composing pipe of tobacco ever remember to have smoked in life dont suppose however be quit of mr franklin on such easy term a drifting again out of morning room into hall found way to office next smelt pipe be instantly reminded that have be simple enough to give up smoking for miss rachel sake in twinkling of eye burst in on with cigar case came out strong on one everlasting subject in neat witty unbelieving french way give light betteredge be conceivable that man can have smoked a long a have without discovering that there be complete system for treatment of woman at bottom of cigar case follow carefully will prove in two word choose cigar try disappoints what do do upon that throw away try now observe application choose woman try break heart fool take lesson from cigar case throw away try shook head at wonderfully clever dare say own experience be dead against in time of late mr betteredge said felt pretty often inclined to try philosophy mr franklin law insists on smoking cigar sir when have once chosen pointed that observation with wink mr franklin burst out laughingand be a merry a cricket until next new side of character turned up in due course so thing went on with young master so while sergeant

gentleman at club have passed over manner in person have remarked that be more than twenty one have pecuniary interest in aunt will tone in alluded to dear mr godfrey be too much for forbearance feeling bound after what have passed in presence afternoon to assert innocence of admirable friend found called in questioni own to having also felt bound to include in accomplishment of righteous purpose stinging castigation in case of mr bruff live very much out of world said dont posse advantage sir of belonging to club happen to know story to allude also know that viler falsehood than story never be told yes yes miss clackyou believe in friend natural enough mr godfrey ablewhite wont find world in general quite so easy to convince a committee of charitable lady appearance be dead against be in house when diamond be lost be first person in house to go to london afterwards be ugly circumstance maam viewed by light of later event ought know to have set right before went farther ought to have told that be speaking in ignorance of testimony to mr godfreys innocence offered by only person who be undeniably competent to speak from positive knowledge of subject ala temptation to lead lawyer artfully on to own discomfiture be too much for asked what meant by later eventswith appearance of utmost innocence by later event miss clack mean event in indian be concerned proceeded mr bruff getting more more superior to poor longer went on do indian do moment be let out of prison at frizinghall go straight to london fix on mr luker what follows mr luker feel alarmed for safety of valuable of great price have got in house lodge privately under general description in banker strongroom wonderfully clever of indian be just a clever on side have suspicion that valuable of great price be being shifted from one place to hit on singularly bold complete way of clearing suspicion up whom do seize search not mr luker onlywhich must be intelligible enoughbut mr godfrey ablewhite a well why mr ablewhites explanation be that acted on blind suspicion after seeing accidentally speaking to mr luker absurd dozen other people spoke to mr luker that morning why be not followed home too decoyed into trap plain inference be that mr ablewhite have private interest in valuable a well a mr luker that indian be so uncertain a to of two have disposal of that there be alternative to search public opinion say that miss clack public opinion on occasion be not easily refuted said last word looking so wonderfully wise in own worldly conceit really to shame be spoken must not resist leading little farther still before overwhelmed with truth dont presume to argue with clever lawyer like said be quite fair sir to mr ablewhite to pas over opinion of famous london police officer who investigated case not shadow of suspicion rested upon anybody miss verinder in mind of sergeant cuff do mean to tell miss clack that agree with sergeant judge nobody sir offer opinion commit enormity maam judge sergeant to have be utterly wrong offer opinion that if have known rachel character a know must have suspected everybody in house admit that have faultsshe be secret willed odd wild unlike other girl of age true a steel high minded generous to fault if plainest evidence in world pointed one way if nothing rachel word of honour pointed other must take word before evidence lawyer a be strong language miss clack mean must object to illustrate meaning mr bruff so may be sure understand suppose found miss verinder quite unaccountably interested in what have happened to mr ablewhite mr luker suppose asked strangest question about dreadful scandal displayed most ungovernable agitation when found out turn be taking suppose anything please miss clack wouldnt shake belief in rachel verinder by hair breadth be so absolutely to be relied on a so absolutely to be relied on a then permit to inform mr bruff that mr godfrey ablewhite be in house not two hour since that entire innocence of concern in disappearance of moonstone be proclaimed by miss verinder in strongest language ever heard used by young lady in life enjoyed triumphthe unholy triumph fear must admitof seeing mr bruff utterly confounded overthrown by few plain word from started to foot stared at in silence kept seat undisturbed related whole scene a have occurred what do say about mr ablewhite now asked with utmost possible gentleness a soon a have done if rachel have testified to innocence miss clack dont scruple to say that believe in innocence a firmly a do have be misled by appearance like rest of world will make best atonement can by publicly contradicting scandal have assailed friend wherever meet with in meantime allow to congratulate on masterly manner in have opened full fire of battery on at moment when least expected must have done great thing in profession maam if have happened to be man with word turned away from began walking irritably up down room must see plainly that new light have thrown on subject have greatly surprised disturbed certain expression dropped from lip a became more more absorbed in own thought suggested to mind abominable view that have hitherto taken of mystery of lost moonstone have not scrupled to suspect dear mr godfrey of infamy of stealing diamond to attribute rachel conduct to generous resolution to conceal crime on miss verinders own authoritya perfectly unassailable authority a be aware in estimation of mr explanation of circumstance be now shown to be utterly wrong perplexity into have plunged high legal authority be so overwhelming that be quite unable to conceal from notice what case heard say to stopping at window in walk drumming on glass with finger not only defies explanation even beyond conjecture there be nothing in word made reply at needful on partand yet answered seems hardly credible must not have be able to let mr bruff alone even now seems almost beyond mere mortal perversity must have discovered in what have just said new opportunity of making personally disagreeable to butah friend nothing be beyond mortal perversity anything be credible when fallen nature get better of pardon for intruding on reflection said to unsuspecting mr bruff surely there be conjecture to make have not occurred to yet maybe miss clack own dont know what be before be so fortunate sir a to convince of mr ablewhites innocence mentioned a one of reason for suspecting that be in house at time when diamond be lost permit to remind that mr franklin blake be also in house at time when diamond be lost old worldling left window took chair exactly opposite to mine looked at steadily with hard vicious smile be not so good lawyer miss clack remarked in meditative manner a supposed dont know how to let well alone be afraid fail to follow mr bruff said modestly wont do miss clackit really wont do second time franklin blake be prime favourite of mine a be well aware doesnt matter ill adopt view on occasion before have time to turn round on youre quite right maam have suspected mr ablewhite on ground abstractedly justify suspecting mr blake too very goodlets suspect together quite in character will say to be capable of stealing moonstone only question be whether be interest to do so mr franklin blake debt remarked be matter of family notoriety mr godfrey ablewhites debt have not arrived at stage of development yet quite true there happen to be two difficulty in way of theory miss clack manage franklin blake affair beg to inform that vast majority of creditor knowing father to be rich man be quite content to charge interest on debt to wait for money there be first difficultywhich be tough enough will find second tougher still have on authority of lady verinder herself that daughter be ready to marry franklin blake before infernal indian diamond disappeared from house have drawn on put off again with coquetry of young girl have confessed to mother that loved cousin franklin mother have trusted cousin franklin with secret so there be miss clack with creditor content to wait with certain prospect before of marrying heiress by mean consider scoundrel tell if please why must steal moonstone human heart be unsearchable said gently who be to fathom in other word maamthough hadnt shadow of reason for taking diamondhe might have taken nevertheless through natural depravity very well say did why devil beg pardon mr bruff if devil referred to in manner must leave room beg pardon miss clackill be more careful in choice of language for future meant to ask be whyeven supposing did take diamondshould franklin blake make most prominent person in house in trying to recover may tell cunningly did that to divert suspicion from answer that have need to divert suspicionbecause nobody suspected first steal moonstone without slightest reason through natural depravity then act part in relation to loss of jewel there be not slightest necessity to act lead to mortally offending young lady who must otherwise have married be monstrous proposition be driven to assert if attempt to associate disappearance of moonstone with franklin blake miss clack after what have passed here today between two dead lock in case be complete rachel own innocence be a mother know a know beyond doubt mr ablewhites innocence be equally certainor rachel must never have testified to franklin blake innocence a have just seen unanswerably asserts on one hand be morally certain of thing on other hand be equally sure that somebody have brought moonstone to london that mr luker banker be in private possession of at moment what be use of experience what be use of person experience in case a that baffle baffle baffle everybody nonot everybody have not baffled sergeant cuff be about to mention with possible mildness with necessary protest against being supposed to cast slur upon rachelwhen servant came in to say that doctor have gone that aunt be waiting to receive stopped discussion mr bruff collected paper looking little exhausted by demand conversation have made on took up bag full of precious publication feeling a if must have gone on talking for hour proceeded in

contribution to shocking story of moonstone plain disclosure not only of turn suspicion took even of name of person on whom suspicion rested at time when indian diamond be believed to be in report of conversation in library with mr bruff appeared to to be exactly what be wanted to answer purposewhile at same time possessed great moral advantage of rendering sacrifice of sinful self esteem essentially necessary on part have be obliged to acknowledge that fallen nature got better of in making that humiliating confession get better of fallen nature moral balance be restored spiritual atmosphere feel clear once more dear friend may go on again chapter iv signing of will be much shorter matter than have anticipated be hurried over to thinking in indecent haste samuel footman be sent

take first place in present narrative tracing way back along chain of event from one end to other find necessary to open scene oddly enough a will think at bedside of excellent client friend late sir john verinder sir john have shareperhaps rather large shareof more harmless amiable of weakness incidental to humanity among may mention a applicable to matter in hand invincible reluctanceso long a enjoyed usual good healthto face responsibility of making will lady verinder exerted influence to rouse to sense of duty in matter exerted influence admitted justice of viewsbut went further than until found afflicted with illness ultimately brought to grave then be sent for at last to take client instruction on subject of will proved to be simplest instruction have ever received in whole of professional career sir john be dozing when entered room roused at sight of how do do mr bruff said shant be very long about then ill go to sleep again looked on with great interest while collected pen ink paper be ready asked bowed took dip of ink waited for instruction leave everything to wife said sir john thats turned round on pillow composed to sleep again be obliged to disturb be to

properly administering trust in experience of fair sex not one in thousand of be competent to do in ten minute sir john will be drawn executed sir john good man be finishing interrupted nap lady verinder amply justified confidence husband have placed in in first day of widowhood sent for made will view took of position be so thoroughly sound sensible be relieved of necessity for advising responsibility began ended with shaping instruction into proper legal form before sir john have be fortnight in grave future of daughter have be most wisely most affectionately provided for will remained in fireproof box at office through more year than like to reckon up be not till summer of eighteen hundred forty eight found occasion to look at again under very melancholy circumstance at date have mentioned doctor pronounced sentence on poor lady verinder be literally sentence of death be first person whom informed of situation found anxious to go over will again with be impossible to improve provision relating to daughter in lapse of time wish in regard to certain minor legacy left to different relative have undergone modification became necessary to add three four codicil to original document having done at once for fear of accident obtained ladyship permission to embody recent instruction in second will object be to avoid certain inevitable confusion repetition now disfigured original document to own truth grated sadly on professional sense of fitness of thing execution of second will have be described by miss clack who be so obliging a to witness so far a regarded rachel verinders pecuniary interest be word for word exact counterpart of first will only change introduced related to appointment of guardian to certain provision concerning that appointment be made under advice on lady verinders death will be placed in hand of proctor to be proved a phrase be in usual way in about three week from timeas well a can rememberthe first warning reached of something unusual going on under surface happened to be looking in at friend proctor office observed that received with appearance of greater interest than usual have news for said what do think heard at doctor common morning lady verinders will have be asked for examined already be news indeed there be absolutely nothing must be contested in will there be nobody must think of who have slightest interest in examining will perhaps do well if explain in place for benefit of few people who dont know already that law allows will to be examined at doctor common by anybody who applies on payment of shilling fee did hear who asked for will asked yes clerk have hesitation in telling mr smalley of firm of skipp smalley asked for will have not be copied yet into great folio register so there be alternative to depart from usual course to let see original document looked over carefully made note in pocket book have idea of what wanted with shook head will find out answered before be day older with went back at once to own office if other firm of solicitor have be concerned in unaccountable examination of deceased client will might have found difficulty in making necessary discovery have hold over skipp smalley made course in matter comparatively easy one common law clerk most competent excellent man be brother of mr smalley owing to sort of indirect connection with skipp smalley have for year past picked up crumb fell from table in shape of case brought to office for various reason did not think while to undertake professional patronage be in way of importance to firm intended if necessary to remind of patronage on present occasion moment got back spoke to clerk after telling what have happened sent to brother office with mr bruffs compliment must be glad to know why messrs skipp smalley have found necessary to examine lady verinders will message brought mr smalley back to office in company with brother acknowledged that have acted under instruction received from client then put to whether must not be breach of professional confidence on part to say more have smart discussion upon that be right doubt be wrong truth be be angry suspiciousand insisted on knowing more worse still declined to consider additional information offered a secret placed in keeping claimed perfect freedom to use own discretion worse even than took unwarrantable advantage of position choose sir said to mr smalley between risk of losing client business risk of losing mine quite indefensible admitan act of tyranny nothing le like other tyrant carried point mr smalley chose alternative without moment hesitation smiled resignedly gave up name of client mr godfrey ablewhite be enough for mei wanted to know more having reached point in narrative now becomes necessary to place reader of linesso far a lady verinders will be concernedon footing of perfect equality in respect of information with let state then in fewest possible word rachel verinder have nothing life interest in property mother excellent sense long experience have combined to relieve of responsibility to guard from danger of becoming victim in future of needy unscrupulous man husband if married must raise sixpence on property in land on property in money must have house in london in yorkshire to live in must have handsome incomeand be when came to think over what have discovered be sorely perplexed what to do next hardly week have passed since have heard to surprise distress of miss verinders proposed marriage have sincerest admiration affection for have be inexpressibly grieved when heard that be about to throw away on mr godfrey ablewhite now here be manwhom have always believed to be smooth tongued impostorjustifying very worst that have thought of plainly revealing mercenary object of marriage on side what of thatyou may replythe thing be done day granted dear sir must think of quite a lightly a do if thing be done let say with own sister first consideration now naturally occurred to be must mr godfrey ablewhite hold to engagement after what lawyer have discovered for depended entirely on pecuniary position of knew nothing if position be not desperate one must be well worth while to marry miss verinder for income alone if on other hand stood in urgent need of realising large sum by given time then lady verinders will must exactly meet case must preserve daughter from falling into scoundrel hand in latter event there must be need for to distress miss rachel in first day of mourning for mother by immediate revelation of truth in former event if remained silent must be conniving at marriage must make miserable for life doubt ended in calling at hotel in london at knew mr ablewhite miss verinder to be staying informed that be going to brighton next day that unexpected obstacle prevented mr godfrey ablewhite from accompanying at once proposed to take place while be only thinking of rachel verinder be possible to hesitate when actually saw mind be made up directly come what might of to tell truth found opportunity when be out walking with on day after arrival may speak to asked about marriage engagement yes said indifferently if have nothing more interesting to talk about will forgive old friend servant of family miss rachel if venture on asking whether heart be set on marriage be marrying in despair mr bruffon chance of dropping into sort of stagnant happiness may reconcile to life strong language suggestive of something below surface in shape of romance have own object in view declined a lawyer say to pursue question into side issue mr godfrey ablewhite can hardly be of way of thinking said heart must be set on marriage at rate say so suppose ought to believe must hardly marry after what have owned to unless be fond of poor thing bare idea of man marrying for own selfish mercenary end have never entered head task have set began to look like harder task than have bargained for sound strangely went on in old fashioned ear what sound strangely asked to hear speak of future husband a if be not quite sure of sincerity of attachment be conscious of reason in own mind for doubting astonishing quickness of perception detected change in voice manner when put question warned have be speaking along with ulterior object in view stopped taking arm out of mine looked searchingly in face mr bruff said have something to tell about godfrey ablewhite tell knew well enough to take at word told put arm again into mine walked on with slowly felt hand tightening grasp mechanically on arm saw getting paler paler a went onbut not word passed lip while be speaking when have done still kept silence head drooped little walked by side unconscious of presence unconscious of everything about lostburied might almost sayin own thought made attempt to disturb experience of disposition warned on a on former occasion to give time first instinct of girl in general on being told of anything interest be to ask multitude of question then to run off talk over with favourite friend rachel verinders first instinct under similar circumstance be to shut up in own mind to think over by absolute self dependence be great virtue in man in woman have serious drawback of morally separating from mass of sex so exposing to misconstruction by general opinion strongly suspect myself of thinking a rest of world think in matterexcept in case of rachel verinder self dependence in character be one of virtue in estimation partly doubt because sincerely admired liked partly because view took of connexion with loss of moonstone be based on own special knowledge of disposition badly a appearance might look in matter of diamondshocking a undoubtedly be to know that be associated in way with mystery of undiscovered thefti be satisfied nevertheless that have done nothing unworthy of because be also satisfied that have not stirred step in business without shutting up in own mind thinking over first have walked on for nearly mile must say before rachel roused suddenly looked up at with faint reflection of smile of happier timesthe most irresistible smile have ever seen on woman face owe much already to kindness said feel more deeply indebted to now than ever if hear rumour of marriage when get back to london contradict at once on authority have resolved to break engagement asked can doubt returned proudly after what have told dear miss rachel be very youngand may find more difficulty in withdrawing from present position than anticipate have onei mean lady of coursewhom must consult one answered distressed did indeed distress to hear say that be so young so lonelyand bore so well impulse to help got better of sense of own unfitness might have felt under circumstance stated such idea on subject a occurred to on spur of moment to best of ability have advised prodigious number of client have dealt with exceedingly awkward difficulty in time be first occasion on have ever found advising young lady how to obtain release from marriage engagement suggestion offered amounted briefly to recommended to tell mr godfrey ablewhiteat private interview of coursethat have to certain knowledge betrayed mercenary nature of motive on side be then to add that marriage after what have discovered be simple impossibilityand be to put to whether thought wisest to secure silence by falling in with view to force by opposing to make motive under be acting generally known if attempted to defend to deny fact be in event to refer to miss verinder listened attentively till have done then thanked very prettily for advice informed at same time that be impossible for to follow may ask said what objection see to following hesitatedand then met with question on side suppose be asked to express opinion of mr godfrey ablewhites conduct began what must call must call conduct of meanly deceitful man mr bruff have believed in man have promised to marry man how can tell be mean how can tell have deceived how can disgrace in eye of world after have degraded by ever thinking of a husband if say what tell to say to himi be owning have degraded to face cant do after what have passed between cant do that shame of must be nothing to shame of must be unendurable to here be of marked peculiarity in character disclosing to without reserve here be sensitive horror of bare contact with anything mean blinding to consideration of what owed to herself hurrying into false position might compromise in estimation of friend up to time have be little diffident about propriety of advice have given to after what have just said have sort of doubt that be best advice must have be offered felt sort of hesitation in pressing on again only shook head repeated objection in other word have be intimate enough with to ask to be wife have stood high enough in estimation to obtain consent cant tell to face that be most contemptible of living creature after dear miss rachel remonstrated equally impossible for to tell that withdraw from engagement without giving reason for will say have thought over that be satisfied will be best for of if part more than more have thought of what may say on side may say what plea be impossible not to admire delicacy resolution be equally impossible not to feel that be putting in wrong entreated to consider own position reminded that must be exposing to most odious misconstruction of motif cant brave public opinion said at command of private feeling can answered have done already what do mean have forgotten moonstone mr bruff have not braved public opinion there with own private reason for answer silenced for moment set trying to trace explanation of conduct at time of loss of moonstone out of strange avowal have just escaped might perhaps have done when be younger certainly couldnt do now tried last remonstrance before returned to house be just a immovable a ever mind be in strange conflict of feeling about when left that day be obstinate be wrong be interesting be admirable be deeply to be pitied made promise to write to moment have news to send went back to business in london with mind exceedingly ill at ease on evening of return before be possible for to receive promised letter be surprised by visit from mr ablewhite elder be informed that mr godfrey have got dismissaland have accepted itthat very day with view already took of case bare fact stated in word have underlined revealed mr godfrey ablewhites motive for submission a plainly a if have acknowledged needed large sum of money needed by given time rachel income must have helped to anything else must not help here rachel have accordingly released without encountering moment serious opposition on part if be told that be mere speculation ask in turn what other theory will account for giving up marriage must have maintained in splendour for rest of life exultation might otherwise have felt at lucky turn thing have now taken be effectually checked by what passed at interview with old mr ablewhite came of course to know whether must give explanation of miss verinders extraordinary conduct be needle to say be quite unable to afford information wanted annoyance thus inflicted following on irritation produced by recent interview with son threw mr ablewhite off guard look language convinced that miss verinder must find merciless man to deal with when joined lady at brighton next day have restless night considering what ought to do next how reflection ended how thoroughly well founded distrust of mr ablewhite proved to be be item of information a be told have already be put tidily in proper place by exemplary person miss clack have only to addin completion of miss verinder found quiet repose sadly needed poor thing in house at hampstead honoured by making long stay wife daughter be charmed with when executor decided on appointment of new guardian feel sincere pride pleasure in recording that guest family parted like old friend on side chapter ii next thing have to do be to present such additional information a posse on subject of moonstone to speak more correctly on subject of indian plot to steal diamond little have to tell be a think have already said of importance nevertheless in respect of bearing very remarkably on event be still to come about week ten day after miss verinder have left one of clerk entered private room at office with card in hand informed that gentleman be below who wanted to speak to looked at card there be foreign name written on have escaped memory be followed by line written in english at bottom of card remember perfectly well recommended by mr septimus luker audacity of person in mr lukers position presuming to recommend anybody to took so completely by surprise sat silent for moment wondering whether own eye have not deceived clerk observing bewilderment favoured with result of own observation of stranger who be waiting downstairs here rather remarkable looking man sir so dark in complexion that set down in office for indian something of sort associating clerk idea with line inscribed on card in hand thought possible that moonstone might be at bottom of mr lukers recommendation of stranger visit at office to astonishment of clerk at once decided on granting interview to gentleman below in justification of highly unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity thus made permit to remind anybody who may read line living person in england at rate can claim to have have intimate connexion with romance of indian diamond a mine have be be trusted with secret of colonel herncastles plan for escaping assassination received colonel letter periodically reporting living man drew will leaving moonstone to miss verinder persuaded executor to act on chance that jewel might prove to be valuable acquisition to family lastly combated mr franklin blake scruple induced to be mean of transporting diamond to lady verinders house if anyone can claim prescriptive right of interest in moonstone in everything connected with think be hardly to be denied that be man moment mysterious client be shown in felt inner conviction be in presence of one of three indiansprobably of chief be carefully dressed in european costume swarthy complexion long lithe figure grave graceful politeness of manner be enough to betray oriental origin to intelligent eye that looked at pointed to chair begged to be informed of nature of business with after first apologisingin excellent selection of english wordsfor liberty have taken in disturbing indian produced small parcel outer covering of be of cloth of gold removing second wrapping of silken fabric placed little box casket on table most beautifully richly inlaid in jewel on ebony ground have come sir said to ask to lend money leave a assurance to that debt will be paid back pointed to card apply to rejoined at mr lukers recommendation indian bowed may ask how be that mr luker did not advance money that require mr luker informed sir that have money to lend so recommended to come to indian in turn pointed to card be written there said briefly answered thoroughly to purpose if moonstone have be in possession oriental gentleman must have murdered be well aware without moment hesitation at same time barring slight drawback be bound to testify that be perfect model of client might not have

be trusted like other men in profession with money to lend never lend to stranger never lend on security a have produced far from attempting a other people must have done to induce to relax own rule indian only made bow wrapped up box in two covering without word of protest rosethis admirable assassin rose to go moment have answered will condescension towards stranger excuse asking one question said before take leave bowed on side only one question at parting average in experience be fifty supposing sir have be possible customary for to lend money said in what space of time must have be possible customary for to pay back according to usual course pursued in country answered must have be entitled to pay money back if liked in one year time from date at be first advanced to indian made

conclusion in reference to otherwise incomprehensible visitor who have favoured with call face voice mannerwhile be in companywere under such perfect control that set scrutiny at defiance have given one chance of looking under smooth outer surface of for that have not shown slightest sign of attempting to fix anything have said to in mind until mentioned time at be customary to permit earliest repayment on part of debtor of money have be advanced a loan when gave that piece of information looked straight in face while be speaking for first time inference drew from wasthat have special

brought to proved to be from le person mr septimus luker asked pardon in term of sickening servility assured that must explain matter to satisfaction if must honour by consenting to personal interview made unprofessional sacrifice to mere curiosity honoured by making appointment at office for next day mr luker be in respect inferior creature to indianhe be so vulgar so ugly so cringing so prosythat be quite unworthy of being reported at length in page substance of what have to tell may be fairly stated a follows day before have received visit of indian mr luker have be favoured with call from accomplished gentleman in spite of european disguise mr luker have instantly identified visitor with chief of three indian who have formerly annoyed by loitering about house who have left alternative to consult magistrate from startling discovery have rushed to conclusion naturally enough own that must certainly be in company of one of three men who have blindfolded gagged robbed of banker receipt result be that became quite paralysed with terror that firmly believed last hour have come on side indian preserved character of perfect stranger produced little casket made exactly same application have afterwards made to a speediest way of getting rid of mr luker have at once declared that have money indian have thereupon asked to be informed of best safest person to apply to for loan wanted mr luker have answered that best safest person in such case be usually respectable solicitor asked to name individual of character profession mr luker have mentioned mefor one simple reason in extremity

at moment of quitting mr lukers house yes indian have put precisely same question to mr luker at parting have put to receiving of course same answer a answer have given what did mean mr lukers explanation gave assistance towards solving problem own unaided ingenuity consulted next proved quite unequal to grapple with difficulty have dinner engagement that evening went upstairs in very genial frame of mind little suspecting that way to dressing room way to discovery meant on particular occasion one same thing chapter iii prominent personage among guest at dinner party found to be mr murthwaite on appearance in england after wandering society have be greatly interested in traveller a man who have passed through many dangerous adventure who have escaped to tell tale have now announced intention of returning to scene of exploit of penetrating into region left still unexplored magnificent indifference to placing safety in peril for second time revived flagging interest of worshipper in hero law of chance be clearly against escaping on occasion be not day that can meet eminent person at dinner feel that there be reasonable prospect of news of murder being news that hear of next when gentleman be left by in dining room found sitting next to mr guest present being english be needle to say that a soon a wholesome check exercised by presence of lady be removed conversation turned on politics a necessary result in respect to absorbing national topic happen to be one of most un english englishman living a general rule political talk appears to to be of talk most dreary most profitless glancing at mr murthwaite when bottle have made first round of table found that be apparently of way of thinking be doing very dexterouslywith possible consideration for feeling of hostbut be not le certain that be composing for nap struck a experiment worth attempting to try whether judicious allusion to subject of moonstone must keep awake if did to see what thought of last new complication in indian conspiracy a revealed in prosaic precinct of office if be not mistaken mr murthwaite began be acquainted with late lady verinder took interest in strange succession of event ended in loss of moonstone eminent traveller did honour of waking up in instant asking who be informed of professional connection with herncastle family not forgetting curious position have occupied towards colonel diamond in bygone time mr murthwaite shifted round in chair so a to put rest of company behind conservative liberal alike concentrated whole attention on plain mr bruff of gray inn square have heard anything lately of indian asked have reason to believe answered that one of have interview with in office yesterday mr murthwaite be not easy man to astonish that last answer of mine completely staggered described what have happened to mr luker what have happened to myself exactly a have described here be clear that indian parting inquiry have object added why must be so anxious to know time at borrower of money be usually privileged to pay money back be possible that dont see motive mr bruff be ashamed of stupidity mr murthwaitebut certainly dont see great traveller became quite interested in sounding immense vacuity of dulness to lowest depth let ask one question said in what position doe conspiracy to seize moonstone now stand cant say answered indian plot be mystery to indian plot mr bruff can only be mystery to because have never seriously examined will run over together from time when drew colonel herncastles will to time when indian called at office in position may be of very serious importance to interest of miss verinder that must be able to take clear view of matter in case of need tell bearing that in mind whether will penetrate indian motive for whether wish to save trouble of making inquiry into be needle to say that thoroughly appreciated practical purpose now saw that have in view that first of two alternative be alternative chose very good said mr murthwaite will take question of age of three indian first can testify that look much about same ageand can decide for whether man whom saw be be not in prime of life not forty think idea too will say not forty now look back to time when colonel herncastle came to england when be concerned in plan adopted to preserve life dont want to count year will only say be clear that present indian at age must be successor of three other indian high caste brahmin of mr bruff when left native country who followed colonel to shore very well present men of ours have succeeded to men who be here before if have only done that matter must not have be worth inquiring into have done more have succeeded to organisation predecessor established in country dont start organisation be very trumpery affair according to idea have doubt must reckon up a including command of money service when needed of shady sort of englishman who life in byway of foreign life in london lastly secret sympathy of such few men of own country formerly at least of own religion a happen to be employed in ministering to of multitudinous want of great city nothing very formidable a see worth notice at starting because may find occasion to refer to modest little indian organisation a go on having now cleared ground be going to ask question expect experience to answer be event gave indian first chance of seizing diamond understood allusion to experience first chance got replied be clearly offered to by colonel herncastles death must be aware of death suppose a matter of course a matter of course death a say gave first chance up to time moonstone be safe in strongroom of bank drew colonel will leaving jewel to niece will be proved in usual way a lawyer can be at loss to know what course indian must take under english advice after that must provide with copy of will from doctor common said exactly one other of shady englishman to whom have alluded must get copy have described that copy must inform that moonstone be bequeathed to daughter of lady verinder that mr blake elder person appointed by be to place in hand will agree with that necessary information about person in position of lady verinder mr blake must be perfectly easy information to obtain one difficulty for indian must be to decide whether must make attempt on diamond when be in course of removal from keeping of bank whether must wait until be taken down to yorkshire to lady verinders house second way must be manifestly safest wayand there have explanation of appearance of indian at frizinghall disguised a juggler waiting time in london be needle to say have organisation at disposal to keep informed of event two men must do one to follow anybody who went from mr blake house to bank one to treat lower men servant with beer to hear news of house commonplace precaution must readily inform that mr franklin blake have be to bank that mr franklin blake be only person in house who be going to visit lady verinder what actually followed upon discovery remember doubt quite a correctly a do remembered that franklin blake have detected one of spy in streetthat have in consequence advanced time of arrival in yorkshire by hoursand thanks to old betteredges excellent advice have lodged diamond in bank at frizinghall before indian be so much a prepared to see in neighbourhood perfectly clear so far indian being ignorant of precaution thus taken how be that have made attempt on lady verinders house in must have supposed diamond to be through whole of interval elapsed before rachel birthday in putting difficulty to mr murthwaite thought right to add have heard of little boy drop of ink rest of that explanation based on theory of clairvoyance be explanation must carry conviction with to mind to mine said mr murthwaite clairvoyance in case be simply development of romantic side of indian character must be refreshment encouragement to menquite inconceivable grant to english mindto surround wearisome perilous errand in country with certain halo of marvellous supernatural boy be unquestionably sensitive subject to mesmeric influenceand under influence have doubt reflected what be already in mind of person mesmerising have tested theory of clairvoyanceand have never found manifestation get beyond point indian dont investigate matter in way indian look upon boy a seer of thing invisible to eyesand repeat in marvel find source of new interest in purpose unites only notice a offering curious view of human character must be quite new to have nothing to do with clairvoyance with mesmerism with anything else be hard of belief to practical man in inquiry that be now pursuing object in following indian plot step by step be to trace result back by rational mean to natural cause have succeeded to satisfaction so far not doubt of mr murthwaite be waiting however with anxiety to hear rational explanation of difficulty have just have honour of submitting to mr murthwaite smiled easiest difficulty to deal with of said permit to begin by admitting statement of case a perfectly correct one indian be undoubtedly not aware of what mr franklin blake have done with diamondfor find making first mistake on first night of mr blake arrival at aunt house first mistake repeated certainly mistake of allowing to be surprised lurking about terrace at night by gabriel betteredge however have merit of seeing for that have taken false stepfor a say again with plenty of time at disposal never came near house for week afterwards why mr murthwaite thats what want to know why because indian mr bruff ever run unnecessary risk clause drew in colonel herncastles will informed didnt that moonstone be to pas absolutely into miss verinders possession on birthday very well tell be safest course for men in position to make attempt on diamond while be under control of mr franklin blake who have shown already that must suspect outwit to wait till diamond be at disposal of young girl who must innocently delight in wearing magnificent jewel at possible opportunity perhaps want proof theory be correct take conduct of indian a proof appeared at house after waiting week on miss verinders birthday be rewarded for patient accuracy of calculation by seeing moonstone in bosom of dress when story of colonel diamond later in evening felt so sure about risk mr franklin blake have run must have certainly attacked if have not happened to ride back to lady verinders in company of other people be so strongly convinced of worse risk still in store for miss verinder recommended following colonel plan destroying identity of gem by having cut into separate stone how extraordinary disappearance night made advice useless utterly defeated hindoo plotand how further action on part of indian be paralysed next day by confinement in prison a rogue vagabondsyou know a well a do first act in conspiracy close there before go on to second may ask whether have met difficulty with explanation be satisfactory to mind of practical man be impossible to deny that have met difficulty fairly thanks to superior knowledge of indian characterand thanks to not having have hundred of other will to think of since colonel herncastles time so far so good resumed mr first chance indian have of seizing diamond be chance lost on day when be committed to prison at frizinghall when did second chance offer second chance offered itselfas be in condition to provewhile be still in confinement took out pocket book opened at particular leaf before went on be staying resumed with friend at frizinghall at time day two before indian be set free on monday think governor of prison came to with letter have be left for indian by one mr macann of whom have hired lodging in lived have be delivered at mr macanns door in ordinary course of post on previous morning prison authority have noticed that postmark be lambeth that address on outside though expressed in correct english be in form oddly at variance with customary method of directing letter on opening have found content to be written in foreign language rightly guessed at a hindustani object in coming to be of course to have letter translated to took copy in pocket book of original of translationand there be at service handed open pocket book address on letter be first thing copied be written in one paragraph without attempt at punctuation thus to three indian men living with lady called macann at frizinghall in yorkshire hindoo character followed english translation appeared at end expressed in mysterious word in name of regent of night whose seat be on antelope whose arm embrace four corner of earth brother turn face to south come to in street of many noise lead down to muddy river reason be own eye have seen there letter ended without date signature handed back to mr murthwaite owned that curious specimen of hindoo correspondence rather puzzled can explain first sentence to said conduct of indian will explain rest god of moon be represented in hindoo mythology a four armed deity seated on antelope one of title be regent of night here then to begin with be something look suspiciously like indirect reference to moonstone now let see what indian did after prison authority have allowed to receive letter on very day when be set free went at once to railway station took place in first train started for london thought pity at frizinghall that proceeding be not privately watched after lady verinder have dismissed police officer have stopped further inquiry into loss of diamond one else must presume to stir in matter indian be free to go to london to london went what be next news heard of mr bruff be annoying mr luker answered by loitering about house at lambeth did read report of mr lukers application to magistrate yes in course of statement referred if remember to foreign workman in employment whom have just dismissed on suspicion of attempted theft whom also distrusted a possibly acting in collusion with indian who have annoyed inference be pretty plain mr bruff a to who wrote that letter puzzled just now a to of mr lukers oriental treasure workman have attempted to steal inference a hastened to acknowledge be too plain to need being pointed out have never doubted that moonstone have found way into mr lukers hand at time mr murthwaite alluded to only question have be how have indian discovered circumstance question most difficult to deal with of a have thought have now received answer like rest lawyer a be began to feel might trust mr murthwaite to lead blindfold through last winding of labyrinth along have guided thus far paid compliment of telling found little concession very graciously received will give piece of information in turn before go on said somebody must have taken moonstone from yorkshire to london somebody must have raised money on must never have be in mr lukers possession have there be discovery made of who that person be none that know of there be story be there not about mr godfrey ablewhite be told be eminent philanthropistwhich be decidedly against to begin with heartily agreed in with mr murthwaite at same time felt bound to inform without be needle to say mentioning miss verinders name that mr godfrey ablewhite have be cleared of suspicion on evidence must answer for a entirely beyond dispute very well said mr murthwaite quietly let leave to time to clear matter up in meanwhile mr bruff must get back again to indian on account journey to london simply ended in becoming victim of defeat loss of second chance of seizing diamond be mainly attributable a think to cunning foresight of mr lukerwho doesnt stand at top of prosperous ancient profession of usury for nothing by prompt dismissal of man in employment deprived indian of assistance confederate must have rendered in getting into house by prompt transport of moonstone to banker took conspirator by surprise before be prepared with new plan for robbing how indian in latter case suspected what have done how contrived to posse of banker receipt be event too recent to need dwelling on let be enough to say that know moonstone to be once more out of reach deposited under general description of valuable of great price in banker strong room now mr bruff what be third chance of seizing diamond when will come a question passed lip penetrated motive of indian visit to office at last see exclaimed indian take for granted a do that moonstone have be pledged want to be certainly informed of earliest period at pledge can be redeemedbecause will be earliest period at diamond can be removed from safe keeping of bank told must find out for mr bruff if only gave fair chance in year from time when moonstone be pledged indian will be on watch for third chance mr lukers own lip have told how long will have to wait respectable authority have satisfied that mr luker have spoken truth when do suppose at rough guess that diamond found way into money lender hand towards end of last june answered a well a can reckon be now in year forty eight very good if unknown person who have pledged moonstone can redeem in year jewel will be in person possession again at end of june forty nine will be thousand of mile from england english news at date may be worth while to take note of to arrange to be in london at time think something serious will happen said think will be safer answered among fiercest fanatic of central asia than must be if crossed door of bank with moonstone in pocket indian have be defeated twice running mr bruff firm belief that wont be defeated third time be last word said on subject coffee came in guest rose dispersed about room joined lady of dinner party upstairs made note of date may not be amiss if close narrative by repeating that note

done just a be bidding farewell happened to glance towards book newspaper stall there be mr candy remarkable looking assistant again speaking to keeper of stall eye met at same moment ezra jennings took off hat to returned salute got into carriage just a train started be relief to mind suppose to dwell on subject appeared to be personally of sort of importance to at event began momentous journey back be to take to mr bruff wonderingabsurdly enough admitthat must have seen man with piebald hair twice in one day hour at arrived in london precluded hope of finding mr bruff at place of business drove from railway to private residence at hampstead disturbed old lawyer dozing alone in dining room with favourite pug dog on lap bottle of wine at elbow will best describe effect story produced on

first examined nightgown then devoted to reading of rosanna spearmans letter reading completed mr bruff addressed for first time since have be shut up together in seclusion of own room franklin blake said old gentleman be very serious matter in more respect than one in opinion concern rachel quite a nearly a concern extraordinary conduct be mystery now belief have stolen diamond have shrunk from reasoning own way fairly to revolting conclusion have forced on nevertheless resolution to obtain personal interview with rachel rested really truly on ground just stated by mr bruff first step to take in investigation lawyer proceeded be to appeal to rachel have be silent time from motif who know character can readily understand be impossible after what have happened to submit to silence longer must be persuaded to tell must be forced to tell on what ground base belief that took moonstone chance be that whole of case serious a seems now will tumble to piece if can only break through rachel inveterate reserve prevail upon to speak out be very comforting opinion for said own must like to know must like to know how can justify interposed mr bruff can tell in two minute understand in first place look at matter from lawyer point of view question of evidence with very well evidence break down at outset on one important point on what point will hear admit that mark of name prof nightgown to be yours admit that mark of paint prof nightgown to have made smear on rachel door what evidence be there to prove that be person who wore on night when diamond be lost objection struck more forcibly that reflected objection have felt a to pursued lawyer taking up rosanna spearmans confession can understand that letter be distressing one to can understand that may hesitate to analyse from purely impartial point of view be not in position can bring professional experience to bear on document just a must bring to bear on other without alluding to woman career a thief will merely remark that letter prof to have be adept at deception on own showing argue from that be justified in suspecting of not having told whole truth wont start theory at present a to what may may not have done will only say that if rachel have suspected on evidence of nightgown only chance be ninety nine to hundred that rosanna spearman be person who showed to in case there be woman letter confessing that be jealous of rachel confessing that changed rose confessing that saw glimpse of hope for herself in prospect of quarrel between rachel dont stop to ask who took moonstone a mean to end rosanna spearman must have taken fifty moonstonesi only say that disappearance of jewel gave reclaimed thief who be in love with opportunity of setting rachel at variance for rest of life have not decided on destroying then remember having opportunity distinctly assert that be in character in position at time to take do say to such suspicion answered crossed own mind a soon a opened letter exactly when have read letter pitied poor creature couldnt find in heart to suspect doe credit dear sirdoes credit suppose turn out that did wear nightgown what then dont see how fact can be proved said mr bruff assuming proof to be possible vindication of innocence must be easy matter wont go into now let wait see whether rachel hasnt suspected on evidence of nightgown only good god how coolly talk of rachel suspecting broke out what right have to suspect on evidence of being thief very sensible question dear sir rather hotly putbut well worth considering for what puzzle puzzle too search memory tell did

relieved put down hat drew chair nearer to mine thats settled said now about futureyour future mean to mind result of extraordinary turn matter have now taken be briefly in first place be sure that rachel have told whole truth a plainly a word can tell in second placethough know that there must be dreadful mistake somewherewe can hardly blame for believing to be guilty on evidence of own sens backed a evidence have be by circumstance appear on face of to tell dead against there interposed dont blame rachel said only regret that must not prevail on to speak more plainly to at time might a well regret rachel be not somebody else rejoined mr bruff even then doubt if girl of delicacy whose heart have be set on marrying must have brought to charge to face with being thief anyhow be not in rachel nature to do in very different matter to matter of yourswhich placed however in position not altogether unlike position towards youi happen to know that be influenced by similar motive to

to come come mr franklin view of case have be proved to be wrong admitbut a thing be now advice may be worth having for tell plainly will be wasting time cudgelling brain to purpose if attempt to try back unravel frightful complication from beginning let close mind resolutely to happened last year at lady verinders country house let look to what can discover in future instead of to what can not

towards end of month tooand something serious may come of come of doesnt matter to except a may help to lay hand on mysterious somebody who pawned diamond that person may rely on be responsible dont pretend to know how for position in stand at moment that person alone can set right in rachel estimation cant deny said that plan propose meet difficulty in way be very daring very ingenious very new have objection to make yes objection be that proposal obliges to wait granted a reckon time requires to wait about fortnightmore be so very long life time mr bruff in such situation a mine existence will be simply unendurable to unless do something towards clearing character at once well well understand have thought yet of what can do have thought of consulting sergeant cuff have retired from police useless to expect sergeant to help know where to find can try try said mr bruff after moment consideration case have assumed extraordinary aspect since sergeant cuff time that may revive interest in inquiry try let hear result in meanwhile continued rising if make discovery between end of month be free to try on side what can be done by keeping lookout at bank certainly answeredunless relieve of necessity for trying experiment in interval mr bruff smiled took up hat tell sergeant cuff rejoined that say discovery of truth depends on discovery of person who pawned diamond let hear what sergeant experience say to so parted early next morning set forth for little town of dorkingthe place of sergeant cuff retirement a indicated to by betteredge inquiring at hotel received necessary direction for finding sergeant cottage be approached by quiet bye road little way out of town stood snugly in middle of own plot of garden ground protected by good brick wall at back side by high quickset hedge in front gate ornamented at upper part by smartly painted trellis work be locked after ringing at bell peered through trellis work saw great cuff favourite flower everywhere blooming in garden clustering over door looking in at window far from crime mystery of great city illustrious thief taker be placidly living out last sybarite year of life smothered in rose decent elderly woman opened gate to at once annihilated hope have built on securing assistance of sergeant cuff have started only day before on journey to ireland have gone there on business asked woman smiled have only one business now sir said thats rose great man gardener in ireland have found out something new in growing of rosesand mr cuff away to inquire into do know when will be back quite uncertain sir mr cuff said must come back directly be away time just according a found new discovery worth nothing worth looking into if have message to leave for ill take care sir that get gave card having first written on in pencil have something to say about moonstone let hear from a soon a get back that done there be nothing left to submit to circumstance return to london in irritable condition of mind at time of be now writing abortive result of journey to sergeant cottage simply aggravated restless impulse in to be doing something on day of return from dorking determined that next morning must find bent on new effort at forcing way through obstacle from darkness to light what form be next experiment to take if excellent betteredge have be present while be considering question if have be let into secret of thought must no doubt have declared that german side of be on occasion uppermost side to speak seriously be perhaps possible that german training be in degree responsible for labyrinth of useless speculation in now involved for greater part of night sat smoking building up theory one more profoundly improbable than when did get to sleep waking fancy pursued in dream rose next morning with objective subjective subjective objective inextricably entangled together in mind began day be to witness next effort at practical action of kind by doubting whether have sort of right on purely philosophical ground to consider sort of thing diamond included a existing at how long might have remained lost in mist of own metaphysics if have be left to extricate be impossible for to say a event proved accident came to rescue happily delivered happened to wear that morning same coat have worn on day of interview with rachel searching for something else in one of pocket came upon crumpled piece of paper taking out found betteredges forgotten letter in hand seemed hard on good old friend to leave without reply went to writing table read letter again letter have nothing of slightest importance in be not always easy letter to answer betteredges present effort at corresponding with came within category mr candy assistant otherwise ezra jennings have told master that have seen mr candy in turn wanted to see say something to when be next in neighbourhood of frizinghall what be to be said in answer to must be worth paper be written on sat idly drawing likeness from memory of mr candy remarkable looking assistant on sheet of paper have vowed to dedicate to betteredgeuntil suddenly occurred to that here be irrepressible ezra jennings getting in way again threw dozen portrait at least of man with piebald hair hair in case remarkably like into waste paper basketand then there wrote answer to betteredge be perfectly commonplace letterbut have one excellent effect on effort of writing few sentence in plain english completely cleared mind of cloudy nonsense have filled since previous day devoting once more to elucidation of impenetrable puzzle own position presented to now tried to meet difficulty by investigating from plainly practical point of view event of memorable night being still unintelligible to looked little farther back searched memory of earlier hour of birthday for incident might prove of assistance to in finding clue have anything happened while rachel be finishing painted door later when rode over to frizinghall afterwards when went back with godfrey ablewhite sister later again when put moonstone into rachel hand later still when company came assembled round dinner table memory disposed of string of question readily enough until came to last looking back at social event of birthday dinner found brought to standstill at outset of inquiry be not even capable of accurately remembering number of guest who have sat at same table with to feel completely at fault here to conclude thereupon that incident of dinner might especially repay trouble of investigating formed part of same mental process in case believe other people in similar situation must have reasoned a did when pursuit of own interest cause to become object of inquiry to ourselves be naturally suspicious of what dont know once in possession of name of person who have be present at dinner resolvedas mean of enriching deficient resource of own memoryto appeal to memory of rest of guest to write down that must recollect of social event of birthday to test result thus obtained by light of what have happened afterwards when company have left house last newest of many contemplated experiment in art of inquirywhich betteredge must probably have attributed to clear headed french side of being uppermost for momentmay fairly claim record here on own merit unlikely a may seem have now actually groped way to root of matter at last wanted be hint to guide in right direction at starting before day have passed over head that hint be given by one of company who have be present at birthday feast with plan of proceeding now have in view be first necessary to posse complete list of guest must easily obtain from gabriel betteredge determined to go back to yorkshire on day to begin contemplated investigation next morning be just too late to start by train left london before noon there be alternative to wait nearly three hour for departure of next train be there anything must do in london might usefully occupy interval of time thought went back again obstinately to birthday dinner though have forgotten number in many case name of guest remembered readily enough that by far larger proportion of came from frizinghall from neighbourhood larger proportion be not few of be not regular resident in country be one of few mr murthwaite be godfrey ablewhite be third mr bruffno called to mind that business have prevented mr bruff from making one of party have lady be present whose usual residence be in london must only remember miss clack a coming within latter category however here be three of guest at rate whom be clearly advisable for to see before left town drove off at once to mr bruffs office not knowing address of person of whom be in search thinking probable that might put in way of finding mr bruff proved to be too busy to give more than minute of valuable time in minute however contrived to disposein most discouraging mannerof question have to put to in first place considered newly discovered method of finding clue to mystery a something too purely fanciful to be seriously discussed in second third fourth place mr murthwaite be now on way back to scene of past adventure miss clack have suffered loss have settled from motif of economy in france mr godfrey ablewhite might might not be discoverable somewhere in london suppose inquired at club suppose excused mr bruff if went back to business wished good morning field of inquiry in london being now so narrowed a only to include one necessity of discovering godfreys address took lawyer hint drove to club in hall met with one of member who be old friend of cousin who be also acquaintance of own gentleman after enlightening on subject of godfreys address told of two recent event in life be of importance in have not previously reached ear appeared that godfrey far from being discouraged by rachel withdrawal from engagement to have made matrimonial advance soon afterwards to young lady reputed to be great heiress suit have prospered marriage have be considered a settled certain thing here again engagement have be suddenly unexpectedly broken offowing be said on occasion to serious difference of opinion between bridegroom lady father on question of settlement a compensation for second matrimonial disaster godfrey have soon afterwards found object of fond pecuniary remembrance on part of one of many admirer rich old ladyhighly respected at mother small clothes conversion society great friend of miss clack to whom left nothing mourning ringhad bequeathed to admirable meritorious godfrey legacy of five thousand pound after receiving handsome addition to own modest pecuniary resource have be heard to say that felt necessity of getting little respite from charitable labour that doctor prescribed run on continent a likely to be productive of much future benefit to health if wanted to see must be advisable to lose time in paying contemplated visit went then there to pay visit same fatality have made just one day too late in calling on sergeant cuff made again one day too late in calling on godfrey have left london on previous morning by tidal train for dover be to cross to ostend servant believed be going on to brussels time of return be rather uncertain might be sure must be away at least three month went back to lodging little depressed in spirit three of guest at birthday dinnerand three exceptionally intelligent peoplewere out of reach at very time when be most important to be able to communicate with last hope now rested on betteredge on friend of late lady verinder whom might still find living in neighbourhood of rachel country house on occasion travelled straight to frizinghallthe town being now central point in field of inquiry arrived too late in evening to be able to communicate with betteredge next morning sent messenger with letter requesting to join at hotel at earliest convenience having taken precautionpartly to save time partly to accommodate betteredgeof sending messenger in fly have reasonable prospect if delay occurred of seeing old man within le than two hour from time when have sent for during interval arranged to employ in opening contemplated inquiry among guest present at birthday dinner who be personally known to who be easily within reach be relative ablewhites mr candy doctor have expressed special wish to see doctor lived in next

when entered room shook hand with eye be dim hair have turned completely grey face be wizen figure have shrunk looked at once lively rattlepated humorous little doctorassociated in remembrance with perpetration of incorrigible social indiscretion innumerable boyish jokesand saw nothing left of former self old tendency to vulgar smartness in dress man be wreck clothes jewelleryin cruel mockery of

commonplace word with needle hurry eagerness with curiosity to know what have brought to yorkshire be perfectlyi might say childishlyincapable of concealing from notice with object have in view have of course foreseen necessity of entering into sort of personal explanation before must hope to interest people mostly stranger to in doing best to assist inquiry on journey to frizinghall have arranged what explanation be to beand seized opportunity now offered to of trying effect of on mr candy be in yorkshire other day be in yorkshire again now on rather romantic errand said be matter mr candy in late lady verinders friend took interest remember mysterious loss of indian diamond now nearly year since circumstance have lately happened lead to hope that may yet be foundand be interesting a one of family in recovering among obstacle in way there be necessity of collecting again evidence be discovered at time more if possible there be peculiarity in case make desirable to revive recollection of everything happened in house on evening of miss verinders birthday venture to appeal to late mother friend who be present on occasion to lend assistance of memory have got a far a in rehearsing explanatory phrase when be suddenly checked by seeing plainly in mr candy face that experiment on be total failure little doctor sat restlessly picking at point of finger time be speaking dim watery eye be fixed on face with expression of vacant wistful inquiry very painful to see what be thinking of be impossible to divine one thing clearly visible be that have failed after first two three word in fixing attention only chance of recalling to appeared to lie in changing subject tried new topic immediately so much said gaily for what brings to frizinghall now mr candy turn sent message by gabriel betteredge left off picking at finger suddenly brightened up yes yes yes exclaimed eagerly thats sent message betteredge duly communicated by letter went on have something to say to next time be in neighbourhood well mr candy here be here be echoed doctor betteredge be quite right have something to say to that be message betteredge be wonderful man what memory at age what memory dropped back into silence began picking at finger again recollecting what have heard from betteredge about effect of fever on memory went on with conversation in hope might help at starting long time since met said last saw other at last birthday dinner poor aunt be ever to give thats cried mr candy birthday dinner started impulsively to foot looked at deep flush suddenly overspread faded face abruptly sat down again a if conscious of having betrayed weakness must fain have concealed be plain pitiably plain that be aware of own defect of memory that be bent on hiding from observation of friend thus far have appealed to compassion only word have just saidfew a wereroused curiosity instantly to highest pitch birthday dinner have already become one event in past at looked back with strangely mixed feeling of hope distrust here be birthday dinner unmistakably proclaiming a subject on mr candy have something important to say to attempted to help out once more time own interest be at bottom of compassionate motive hurried on little too abruptly to end have in view nearly year now said since sat at pleasant table have made memorandumin diary otherwiseof what wanted to say to mr candy understood suggestion showed that understood a insult require memorandum mr blake said stiffly enough be not such very old man yetand memory thank god be to be thoroughly depended on be needle to say declined to understand that be offended with wish must say same of memory answered when try to think of matter be year old seldom find remembrance a vivid a must wish to be take dinner at lady verinders for instance mr candy brightened up again moment allusion passed lip ah dinner dinner at lady verinders exclaimed more eagerly than ever have got something to say to about eye looked at again with painful expression of inquiry so wistful so vacant so miserably helpless to see be evidently trying hard trying in vain to recover lost recollection be very pleasant dinner burst out suddenly with air of saying exactly what wanted to say very pleasant dinner mr blake wasnt nodded smiled appeared to think poor fellow that have succeeded in concealing total failure of memory by well timed exertion of own presence of mind be so distressing that at once shifted talkdeeply a be interested in recovering lost remembranceto topic of local interest here got on glibly enough trumpery little scandal quarrel in town of a much a month old appeared to recur to memory readily chattered on with something of smooth gossiping fluency of former time there be moment even in full flow of talkativeness when suddenly hesitatedlooked at for moment with vacant inquiry once more in eyescontrolled himselfand went on again submitted patiently to martyrdom be surely nothing le than martyrdom to man of cosmopolitan sympathy to absorb in silent resignation news of country town until clock on chimney piece told that visit have be prolonged beyond hour having now right to consider sacrifice a complete rose to take leave a shook hand mr candy reverted to birthday festival of own accord be so glad have met again said have on mindi really have on mind mr blake to speak to about dinner at lady verinders know pleasant dinnerreally pleasant dinner now wasnt on repeating phrase seemed to feel hardly a certain of having prevented from suspecting lapse of memory a have felt on first occasion wistful look clouded face again after apparently designing to accompany to street door suddenly changed mind rang bell for servant remained in drawing room went slowly down doctor stair feeling disheartening conviction that really have something to say be vitally important to to hear that be morally incapable of saying effort of remembering that wanted to speak to be too evidently only effort that enfeebled memory be now able to achieve just a reached bottom of stair have turned corner on way to outer hall door opened softly somewhere on ground floor of house gentle voice said behind be afraid sir find mr candy sadly changed turned round found face to face with ezra jennings chapter ix doctor pretty housemaid stood waiting for with street door open in hand pouring brightly into hall morning light fell full on face of mr candy assistant when turned looked at be impossible to dispute betteredges assertion that appearance of ezra jennings speaking from popular point of view be against gipsy complexion fleshless cheek gaunt facial bone dreamy eye extraordinary parti coloured puzzling contradiction between face figure made look old young togetherwere more le calculated to produce unfavourable impression of on stranger mind yetfeeling a certainly didit be not to be denied that ezra jennings made inscrutable appeal to sympathy found impossible to resist while knowledge of world warned to answer question have put acknowledging that did indeed find mr candy sadly changed then to proceed on way out of housemy interest in ezra jennings held rooted to place gave opportunity of speaking to in private about employer for have be evidently on watch be walking way mr jennings said observing that held hat in hand be going to call on aunt mr ablewhite ezra jennings replied that have patient to see that be walking way left house together observed that pretty servant girlwho be smile amiability when wished good morning on way outreceived modest little message from ezra jennings relating to time at might be expected to return with pursed up lip with eye ostentatiously looked anywhere rather than look in face poor wretch be evidently favourite in house out of house have betteredges word for that be unpopular everywhere what life thought to a descended doctor doorstep having already referred to mr candy illness on side ezra jennings now appeared determined to leave to to resume subject silence said significantly turn now too have reason for referring to doctor illness readily accepted responsibility of speaking first judging by change see in began candy illness must have be far more serious than have supposed be almost miracle said ezra jennings that lived through be memory never better than have found today have be trying to speak to of something happened before be taken ill asked assistant observing that hesitated yes memory of event at past time be hopelessly enfeebled said ezra jennings be almost to be deplored poor fellow even wreck of remains while remembers dimly plan that formedthings here there that have to say do before illnesshe be perfectly incapable of recalling what plan be what thing be that have to say do be painfully conscious of own deficiency painfully anxious a must have seen to hide from observation if must only have recovered in complete state of oblivion a to past must have be happier man perhaps must be happier added with sad smile if must completely forget there be event surely in men life replied memory of must be unwilling entirely to lose be hope to be said of most men mr blake be afraid can not truly be said of have reason to suppose that lost remembrance mr candy tried to recoverwhile be speaking to just nowwas remembrance be important to that must recall in saying word have touched of own accord on very point upon be anxious to consult interest felt in strange man have impelled in first instance to give opportunity of speaking to reserving what might have to say on side in relation to employer until be first satisfied that be person in whose delicacy discretion must trust little that have said thus far have be sufficient to convince be speaking to gentleman have what may venture to describe a unsought self possession be sure sign of good breeding not in england only everywhere else in civilised world object have in view in putting question that have just addressed to felt doubt be justifiedso farin answering without reserve believe have strong interest said in tracing lost remembrance mr candy be unable to recall may ask whether can suggest to method by might assist memory ezra jennings looked at with sudden flash of interest in dreamy brown eye mr candy memory be beyond reach of assistance said have tried to help often enough since recovery to be able to speak positively on point disappointed owned confess led to hope for le discouraging answer than said ezra jennings smiled may not perhaps be final answer mr blake may be possible to trace mr candy lost recollection without necessity of appealing to mr candy indeed be indiscretion on part to ask how by mean only difficulty in answering question be difficulty of explaining may trust to patience if refer once more to mr candy illness if speak of time without sparing certain professional detail pray go on have interested already in hearing detail eagerness seemed to amuseperhaps might rather say to please smiled again have by time left last house in town behind ezra jennings stopped for moment picked wild flower from hedge by roadside how beautiful be said simply showing little nosegay to how few people in england seem to admire a deserve have not always be in england said be born partly brought up in one of colony father be englishman motherwe be straying away from subject mr blake be fault truth be have association with modest little hedgeside flowersit doesnt matter be speaking of mr candy to mr candy let return connecting few word about thus reluctantly escaped with melancholy view of life led to place condition of human happiness in complete oblivion of past felt satisfied that story have read in face be in two particular at least story that really told have suffered a few men suffer there be mixture of foreign race in english blood have heard dare say of original cause of mr candy illness resumed night of lady verinders dinner party be night of heavy rain employer drove home through in gig reached house wetted to skin found urgent message from patient waiting for most unfortunately went at once to visit sick person without stopping to change clothes be professionally detained that night by case at distance from frizinghall when got back next morning found mr candy groom waiting in great alarm to take to master room by time mischief be done illness have set in illness have only be described to in general term a fever said can add nothing will make description more accurate answered ezra jennings from first to last fever assumed specific form sent at once to two of mr candy medical friend in town physician to come give opinion of case agreed with that looked serious strongly dissented from view took of treatment differed entirely in conclusion drew from patient pulse two doctor arguing from rapidity of beat declared that lowering treatment be only treatment to be adopted on side admitted rapidity of pulse also pointed to alarming feebleness a indicating exhausted condition of system a showing plain necessity for administration of stimulant two doctor be for keeping on gruel lemonade barley water so on be for giving champagne brandy ammonia quinine serious difference of opinion a see difference between two physician of established local repute stranger who be only assistant in house for first few day have choice to give way to elder better patient steadily sinking time made second attempt to appeal to plain undeniably plain evidence of pulse rapidity be unchecked feebleness have increased two doctor took offence at obstinacy said mr jennings manage case manage be to be said gentleman give five minute to consider plain question will have plain reply when time expired be ready with answer said positively refuse to try stimulant treatment refused in so many word mean to try at once gentlementry mr jennings withdraw from case sent down to cellar for bottle of champagne administered tumbler full of to patient with own hand two physician took up hat in silence left house have assumed serious responsibility said in place be afraid must have shrunk from in place mr blake must have remembered that mr candy have taken into employment under circumstance made debtor for life in place must have seen sinking hour by hour must have risked anything rather than let one man on earth who have befriended die before eye dont suppose have sense of terrible position in have placed there be moment when felt misery of friendlessness peril of dreadful responsibility if have be happy man if have led prosperous life believe must have sunk under task have imposed on have happy time to look back at past peace of mind to force into contrast with present anxiety suspenseand held firm to resolution through took interval in middle of day when patient condition be at best for repose needed for rest of four twenty hour a long a life be in danger never left bedside towards sunset a usual in such case delirium incidental to fever came on lasted more le through night then intermitted at terrible time in early morningfrom two oclock to fivewhen vital energy even of healthiest of be at lowest be then that death gather in human harvest most abundantly be then that death fought fight over bed must have man who lay on never hesitated in pursuing treatment on have staked everything when wine failed tried brandy when other stimulant lost influence doubled dose after interval of suspensethe like of hope to god will never feel againthere came day when rapidity of pulse slightly appreciably diminished better still there came also change in beatan unmistakable change to steadiness strength then knew that have saved then own broke down laid poor fellow wasted hand back on bed burst out cry hysterical relief mr blakenothing more physiology say say truly that men be born with female constitutionsand be one of made that bitterly professional apology for tear speaking quietly unaffectedly a have spoken throughout tone manner from beginning to end showed to be especially almost morbidly anxious not to set up a object of interest to may well ask why have wearied with detail went on be only way can see mr blake of properly introducing to have to say next now know exactly what position be at time of mr candy illness will more readily understand sore need have of lightening burden on mind by giving at interval sort of relief have have presumption to occupy leisure for year past in writing book addressed to member of professiona book on intricate delicate subject of brain nervous system work will probably never be finished will certainly never be published have none le be friend of many lonely hour helped to while away anxious timethe time of waiting nothing elseat mr candy bedside told be delirious think mentioned time at delirium came on yes well have reached section of book at time touched on same question of delirium wont trouble at length with theory on subjecti will confine to telling only what be present interest to know have often occurred to in course of medical practice to doubt whether can justifiably inferin case of deliriumthat loss of faculty of speaking connectedly implies of necessity loss of faculty of thinking connectedly a well poor mr candy illness gave opportunity of putting doubt to test understand art of writing in shorthand be able to take down patient wandering exactly a fell from lipsdo see mr blake what be coming to at last saw clearly waited with breathless interest to hear more at odds end of time ezra jennings went on reproduced shorthand note in ordinary form of writingleaving large space between broken phrase even single word a have fallen disconnectedly from mr candy lip then treated result thus obtained on something like principle one adopts in putting together child puzzle be confusion to begin with may be brought into order shape if can only find right way acting on plan filled in blank space on paper with what word phrase on side of suggested to a speaker meaning altering over over again until addition followed naturally on spoken word came before fitted naturally into spoken word came after result be that not only occupied in way many vacant anxious hour arrived at something be a seemed to confirmation of theory held in plainer word after putting broken sentence together found superior faculty of thinking going on more le connectedly in patient mind while inferior faculty of expression be in state of almost complete incapacity confusion one word interposed eagerly did name occur in of wandering will hear mr blake among written proof of assertion have just advancedor ought to say among written experiment tending to put assertion to proofthere be one in name occurs for nearly whole of one night mr candy mind be occupied with something between have got broken word a dropped from lip on one sheet of paper have got link of own discovering connect word together on sheet of paper product a arithmetician must say be intelligible statementfirst of something actually done in past secondly of something mr candy contemplated doing in future if illness have not got in way stopped question be whether doe doe not represent lost recollection vainly attempted to find when called on morning not doubt of answered let go back directly look at paper quite impossible mr blake why put in position for moment said ezra jennings must disclose to person what have dropped unconsciously from lip of suffering patient helpless friend without first knowing that there be necessity to justify in opening lip felt that be unanswerable here tried to argue question nevertheless conduct in such delicate matter a describe replied must depend greatly on whether disclosure be of nature to compromise friend not have disposed of necessity for considering side of question long since said ezra jennings note included anything mr candy might have wished to keep secret note have be destroyed manuscript experiment at friend bedside include nothing now must have hesitated to communicate to others if have recovered use of memory in case have reason to suppose that note contain something actually wished to say to yet hesitate yet hesitate remember circumstance under obtained information posse harmless a be can not prevail upon to give up to unless first satisfy that there be reason for doing so be so miserably ill mr blake be so helplessly dependent upon be too much to ask if request only to hint to what interest be in lost recollectionor what believe that lost recollection to be to have answered with frankness language manner claimed from must have be to commit to openly acknowledging be suspected of theft of diamond strongly a ezra jennings have intensified first impulsive interest have felt in have not overcome unconquerable reluctance to disclose degrading position in stood took refuge once more in explanatory phrase with have prepared to meet curiosity of stranger time have reason to complain of want of attention on part of person to whom addressed ezra jennings listened patiently even anxiously until have done be sorry to have raised expectation mr blake only to disappoint said throughout whole period of mr candy illness from first to last not one word about diamond escaped lip matter with heard connect name have can assure discoverable relation with loss recovery of miss verinders jewel arrived a said word at place where highway along have be walking branched off into two road one led to mr ablewhites house other to moorland village two three mile off ezra jennings stopped at road led to village way lie in direction said be really truly sorry mr blake that can be of use to voice told that spoke sincerely soft brown eye rested on for moment with look of melancholy interest bowed went without word on way to village for minute more stood watched walking farther farther away from carrying farther farther away with now firmly believed to be clue of be in search turned after walking on little way looked back seeing still standing at place where have parted stopped a if doubting whether might not wish to speak to again there be time for to reason out own situationto remind be losing opportunity at what might be turning point of life to flatter nothing more important than own self esteem there be only time to call back first to think afterwards suspect be one of rashest of existing men called backand then said to now there be help for must tell truth retraced step directly advanced along road to meet mr jennings said have not treated quite fairly interest in tracing mr candy lost recollection be not interest of recovering moonstone serious personal matter be at bottom of visit to yorkshire have one excuse for not having dealt frankly with in matter be more painful to than can say to mention to anybody what position really be ezra jennings looked at with first appearance of embarrassment have seen in yet have right mr blake wish said to intrude into private affair allow to ask pardon on side for having most innocently put to painful test have perfect right rejoined to fix term on feel justified in revealing what heard at mr candy bedside understand respect delicacy influence in matter how can expect to be taken into confidence if decline to admit into mine ought to know will know why be interested in discovering what mr candy wanted to say to if turn out to be mistaken in anticipation if prove unable to help when be really aware of what want will trust to honour to keep secretand something tell that will not trust in vain stop mr

intermittent jingle of tuneless piano in neighbouring house forced now again on ear in other place everyday sound might have spoken pleasantly of everyday world outside here came in a intruder on silence nothing human suffering have privilege to disturb looked at mahogany instrument case at huge roll of lint occupying place of own on bookshelf shuddered inwardly a thought of sound familiar appropriate to everyday use of ezra jennings room make apology mr blake for place in be receiving said be only room in house at hour of day in can feel quite sure of being left undisturbed here be paper ready for here be two book to may have occasion to refer before have done bring chair to table will be able to consult together drew up to table ezra jennings handed manuscript note consisted of two large folio leaf of paper one leaf contained writing only covered surface at interval other presented writing in red black ink completely filled page from top to bottom in irritated state of curiosity at moment laid aside second sheet of paper in despair have mercy on said tell what be to expect before attempt to read willingly mr blake do mind asking one two more question ask anything like looked at with sad smile on lip kindly interest in soft brown eye have already told said that have neverto knowledgetasted opium in life to knowledge repeated will understand directly why speak with reservation let go on be not aware of ever having taken opium at time last year be suffering from nervous irritation slept wretchedly at night on night of birthday however there be exception to ruleyou slept soundly be right so far quite right can assign cause for nervous suffering want of sleep can assign cause old betteredge made guess at cause remember be hardly worth mentioning pardon anything be worth mentioning in case a betteredge attributed sleeplessness to something to what to leaving off smoking have be habitual smoker yes did leave off habit suddenly yes betteredge be perfectly right mr blake when smoking be habit man must have common constitution who can leave off suddenly without temporary damage to nervous system sleepless night be accounted for to mind next question refers to mr candy do remember having entered into anything like dispute with birthday dinner afterwardson subject of profession question instantly awakened one of dormant remembrance in connection with birthday festival foolish wrangle took place on occasion between mr candy will be found described at much greater length than deserves in tenth chapter of betteredges narrative detail there presented of disputeso little have thought of afterwardsentirely failed to recur to memory must now recall must tell ezra jennings be that have attacked art of medicine at dinner table with sufficient rashness sufficient pertinacity to put even mr candy out of temper for moment also remembered that lady verinder have interfered to stop dispute that little doctor have made up again a child say have become a good friend a ever before shook hand night there be one thing more said ezra jennings be very important must know have reason for feeling special anxiety about diamond at time last year have strongest reason for feeling anxiety about diamond knew to be object of conspiracy be warned to take measure for miss verinders protection a possessor of stone be safety of diamond subject of conversation between other person immediately before retired to rest on birthday night be subject of conversation between lady verinder daughter took place in hearing yes ezra jennings took up note from table placed in hand mr blake said if read note now by light question answer have thrown on will make two astounding discovery concerning will findfirst that entered miss verinders sitting room took diamond in state of trance produced by opium secondly that opium be given to by mr candywithout own knowledgeas practical refutation of opinion have expressed to at birthday dinner sat with paper in hand completely stupefied try forgive poor mr candy said assistant gently have done dreadful mischief own have done innocently if will look at note will see thatbut for illnesshe must have returned to lady verinders morning after party must have acknowledged trick that have played miss verinder must have heard of miss verinder must have questioned truth have laid hidden for year must have be discovered in day began to regain self possession mr candy be beyond reach of resentment said angrily trick that played be not le act of treachery for may forgive will not forget medical man commits that act of treachery mr blake in course of practice ignorant distrust of opium in england be by mean confined to lower le cultivated class doctor in large practice find now then obliged to deceive patient a mr candy deceived dont defend folly of playing trick under circumstance only plead with for more accurate more merciful construction of motif how be done asked who gave laudanum without knowing be not able to tell nothing relating to part of matter dropped from mr candy lip through illness perhaps own memory may point to person to be suspected be useless in case to pursue inquiry laudanum be secretly given to in way let leave there go on to matter of more immediate importance read note if can familiarise mind with what have happened in past have something very bold very startling to propose to relates to future last word roused looked at paper in order in ezra jennings have placed in hand paper contained smaller quantity of writing be uppermost of two on disconnected word fragment of sentence have dropped from mr candy in delirium appeared a follows mr franklin blake agreeable down peg medicine confesses sleep at night tell out of order medicine tell groping in dark mean one same thing company at dinner table say groping after sleep nothing medicine say leading blind know what mean witty night rest in spite of teeth want sleep lady verinders medicine chest five twenty minim without knowing tomorrow morning well mr blake medicine today never without out mr candy excellent without down on truth something besides excellent dose of laudanum sir bed what medicine now there first of two sheet of paper came to end handed back to ezra jennings be what heard at bedside said literally exactly what heard answeredexcept that repetition be not transferred here from short hand note reiterated certain word phrase dozen time over fifty time over just a attached more le importance to idea represented repetition in sense be of assistance to in putting together fragment dont suppose added pointing to second sheet of paper claim to have reproduced expression mr candy must have used if have be capable of speaking connectedly only say have penetrated through obstacle of disconnected expression to thought be underlying connectedly time judge for turned to second sheet of paper now knew to be key to first once more mr candy wandering appeared copied in black ink interval between phrase being filled up by ezra jennings in red ink reproduce result here in one plain form original language interpretation of coming close enough together in page to be easily compared verified mr franklin blake be clever agreeable want taking down peg when talk of medicine confesses that have be suffering from want of sleep at night tell that nerve be out of order that ought to take medicine tell that taking medicine groping in dark mean one same thing before company at dinner table say to be groping after sleep nothing medicine can help to find say to have heard of blind leading blind now know what mean wittybut can give night rest in spite of teeth really want sleep lady verinders medicine chest be at disposal give five twenty minim of laudanum tonight without knowing then call tomorrow morning well mr blake will try little medicine today will never sleep without itthere be out mr candy have have excellent night rest without then come down on with truth have have something besides excellent night rest have dose of laudanum sir before went to bed what do say to art of medicine now admiration of ingenuity have woven smooth finished texture out of ravelled skein be naturally first impression felt on handing manuscript back to ezra jennings modestly interrupted first few word in sense of surprise expressed by asking if conclusion have drawn from note be also conclusion at own mind have arrived do believe a believe said that be acting under influence of laudanum in doing that did on night of miss verinders birthday in lady verinders house be too ignorant of influence of laudanum to have opinion of own answered can only follow opinion feel convinced that be right very well next question be be convinced be convincedhow be to carry conviction to mind of other people pointed to two manuscript lying on table between ezra jennings shook head useless mr blake quite useless a stand now for three unanswerable reason in first place note have be taken under circumstance entirely out of experience of mass of mankind against to begin with in second place note represent medical metaphysical theory against once more in third place note be of making there be nothing assertion to contrary to guarantee that be not fabrication remember what told on moorand ask what assertion be worth note have one value looking to verdict of world outside innocence be to be vindicated show how can be done must put conviction to proofand be man to prove how asked leaned eagerly nearer to across table divided be willing to try bold experiment will do anything to clear of suspicion rest on now will submit to personal inconvenience for time to inconvenience matter what may be will be guided implicitly by advice may expose to ridicule of fool may subject to remonstrance of friend whose opinion be bound to respect tell what to do broke out impatiently come what may ill do will do mr blake answered will steal diamond unconsciously for second time in presence of witness whose testimony be beyond dispute started to foot tried to speak must only look at believe can be done went on will be doneif will only help try to compose yourselfsit down hear what have to say to have resumed habit of smoking have seen that for how long have resumed for nearly year do smoke more le than did more will give up habit again suddenly mindas gave up before began dimly to see drift will give up from moment answered if same consequence follow followed last june said ezra jenningsif suffer once more a suffered then from sleepless night will have gained first step will have put back again into something assimilating to nervous condition on birthday night if can next revive nearly revive domestic circumstance surrounded if can occupy mind again with various question concerning diamond formerly agitated will have replaced a nearly a possible in same position physically morally in opium found last year in case may fairly hope that repetition of dose will lead in greater lesser degree to repetition of result there be proposal expressed in few hasty word will now see what reason have to justify in making turned to one of book at side opened at place marked by small slip of paper dont suppose that be going to weary with lecture on physiology said think bound to prove in justice to of be not asking to try experiment in deference to theory of own devising admitted principle recognised authority justify in view take give five minute of attention will undertake to show that science sanction proposal fanciful a may seem here in first place be physiological principle on be acting stated by le person than dr carpenter read for handed slip of paper have marked place in book contained few line of writing a follows there seems much ground for belief sensory impression have once be recognised by perceptive consciousness be registered so to speak in brain may be reproduced at subsequent time although there may be consciousness of existence in mind during whole intermediate period be plain so far asked ezra jennings perfectly plain pushed open book across table to pointed to passage marked by pencil line now said read that account of case hasas believea direct bearing on own position on experiment be tempting to try observe mr blake before begin that be now referring to one of greatest of english physiologist book in hand be doctor elliotsons human physiology case doctor cite rest on well known authority of mr combe passage pointed out to be expressed in term dr abel informed say mr combe of irish porter to warehouse who forgot when sober what have done when drunk being drunk again recollected transaction of former state of intoxication on one occasion being drunk have lost parcel of value in sober moment must give account of next time be intoxicated recollected that have left parcel at certain house there being address on have remained there safely be got on calling for plain again asked ezra jennings a plain a need be put back slip of paper in place closed book be satisfied have not spoken without good authority to support asked if not have only to go to bookshelf have only to read passage can point out to be quite satisfied said without reading word more in case may return to own personal interest in matter be bound to tell that there be something to be said against experiment a well a for if must year exactly reproduce in case condition a existed last year be physiologically certain that must arrive at exactly same result thisthere be denying itis simply impossible can only hope to approximate to condition if dont succeed in getting nearly enough back to what be venture of ours will fail if do succeedand be hopeful of successyou may at least so far repeat proceeding on birthday night a to satisfy reasonable person that be guiltless morally speaking of theft of diamond believe mr blake have now stated question on side of a fairly a can within limit have imposed on if there be anything have not made clear to tell what isand if can enlighten will all that have explained to said understand perfectly own be puzzled on one point have not made clear to yet what be point dont understand effect of laudanum on dont understand walking downstairs along corridor opening shutting drawer of cabinet going back again to own room be active proceeding thought influence of opium be first to stupefy then to send to sleep common error about opium mr blake be at moment exerting intelligence such a be in service under influence of dose of laudanum ten time larger than dose mr candy administered to dont trust to authorityeven on question come within own personal experience anticipated objection have just made have again provided with independent testimony will carry due weight with in own mind in mind of friend handed second of two book have by on table there said be far famed confession of english opium eater take book away with read at passage have marked will find that when de quincey have committed what call debauch of opium went to gallery at opera to enjoy music wandered about london market on saturday night interested in observing little shift bargaining of poor in providing sunday dinner so much for capacity of man to occupy actively to move about from place to place under influence of opium be answered so far said be not answered yet a to effect produced by opium on myself will try to answer in few word said ezra jennings action of opium be comprised in majority of case in two influencesa stimulating influence first sedative influence afterwards under stimulating influence latest most vivid impression left on mindnamely impression relating to diamondwould be likely in morbidly sensitive nervous condition to become intensified in brain must subordinate to judgment will exactly a ordinary dream subordinate to judgment will little by little under action apprehension about safety of diamond might have felt during day must be liable to develop from state of doubt to state of certaintywould impel into practical action to preserve jewelwould direct step with motive in view into room enteredand must guide hand to drawer of cabinet until have found drawer held stone in spiritualised intoxication of opium must do later a sedative action began to gain on stimulant action must slowly become inert stupefied later still must fall into deep sleep when morning came effect of opium have be slept off must wake a absolutely ignorant of what have done in night a if have be living at antipode have made tolerably clear to so far have made so clear said that want to go farther have shown how entered room how came to take diamond miss verinder saw leave room again with jewel in hand can trace proceeding from moment can guess what did next be very point be coming to rejoined be question with whether experiment propose a mean of vindicating innocence may not also be made mean of recovering lost diamond a well when left miss verinders sitting room with jewel in hand went back in probability to own room yes what then be possible mr blakei dare not say morethat idea of preserving diamond led by natural sequence to idea of hiding diamond that place in hid be somewhere in bedroom in event case of irish porter may be case may remember under influence of second dose of opium place in hid diamond under influence of first be turn now to enlighten ezra jennings stopped before must say more be speculating said on result can not possibly take place diamond be at moment in london started looked at in great surprise in london repeated how did get to london from lady verinders house nobody know removed with own hand from miss verinders room how be taken out of keeping have idea how be taken out of keeping did see when woke in morning have miss verinder recovered possession of mr blake there seems to be something here want clearing up may ask how know that diamond be at moment in london have put precisely same question to mr bruff when made first inquiry about moonstone on return to england in answering ezra jennings accordingly repeated what have heard from lawyer own lipsand what be already familiar to reader of page showed plainly that be not satisfied with reply with deference to said with deference to legal adviser maintain opinion expressed just now rest be well aware on mere assumption pardon for reminding that opinion also rest on mere assumption a well view took of matter be entirely new to waited anxiously to hear how must defend assume pursued ezra jennings that influence of opiumafter impelling to posse of diamond with purpose of securing safetymight also impel acting under same influence same motive to hide somewhere in own room assume that hindoo conspirator must by possibility commit mistake indian went to mr lukers house after diamondand therefore in mr lukers possession diamond must be have evidence to prove that moonstone be taken to london at cant even guess how by whom be removed from lady verinders house have evidence that jewel be pledged to mr luker declares that never heard of moonstone banker receipt acknowledges nothing deposit of valuable of great price indian assume that mr luker be lyingand assume again that indian be right say in differing with isthat view be possible what more mr blake logically legally can be said for yours be put strongly there be denying that be put truly a well confess stagger replied do object to writing to mr bruff telling what have said on contrary will be glad if will write to mr bruff if consult experience may see matter under new light for present let return to experiment with opium have decided that leave off habit of smoking from moment from moment be first step next step be to reproduce a nearly a can domestic circumstance surrounded last year how be to be done lady verinder be dead rachel so long a suspicion of theft rested on be parted irrevocably godfrey ablewhite be away travelling on continent be simply impossible to reassemble people who have inhabited house when have slept in last statement of objection did not appear to embarrass ezra jennings attached very little importance said to reassembling same peopleseeing that must be vain to expect to reassume various position have occupied towards in past time on other hand considered essential to success of experiment must see same object about have surrounded when be last in house above thing said must sleep in room slept in on birthday night must be furnished in same way stair corridor miss verinders sitting room must also be restored to what be when saw last be absolutely necessary mr blake to replace article of furniture in part of house may now be put away sacrifice of cigar will be useless unless can get miss verinders permission to do who be to apply to for permission asked be not possible for to apply quite out of question after what have passed between on subject of lost diamond can see write to a thing be now ezra jennings paused considered for moment may ask delicate question said signed to to go on be right mr blake in fancying from one two thing have dropped from that felt common interest in miss verinder in former time quite right be feeling returned be do think miss verinder must be likely to feel strong interest in attempt to prove innocence be certain of in case will write to miss verinderif will give leave telling of proposal that have made to telling of everything have passed between today be needle to say that eagerly accepted service have offered to will have time to write by today post said looking at watch dont forget to lock up cigar when get back to hotel will call tomorrow morning hear how have passed night rose to take leave of attempted to express grateful sense of kindness really felt pressed hand gently remember what told on moor answered if can do little service mr blake will feel like last gleam of sunshine falling on evening of long clouded day parted be then fifteenth of june event of next ten dayseveryone of more le directly connected with experiment of be passive objectare placed on record exactly a happened in journal habitually kept by mr candy assistant in page of ezra jennings nothing be concealed nothing be forgotten let ezra jennings tell how venture with opium be tried how ended fourth narrative extracted from journal of ezra jennings june with interruption from patient interruption from pain finished letter to miss verinder in time for today post failed to make a short letter a must have wished think have made plain leaf entirely mistress of own decision if consent to assist experiment consent of own free will not a favour to mr franklin blake to june throse late after dreadful night vengeance of yesterday opium pursuing through series of frightful dream at one time be whirling through empty space with phantom of dead friend enemy together at one beloved face will never see again rose at bedside hideously phosphorescent in black darkness glared grinned at slight return of old pain at usual time in early morning be welcome a change dispelled visionsand be bearable because did that bad night made late in morning before must get to mr franklin blake found stretched on sofa breakfasting on brandy soda water dry biscuit be beginning a well a must possibly wish said miserable restless night total failure of appetite morning exactly what happened last year when gave up cigar sooner be ready for second dose of laudanum better will be pleased will have on earliest possible day answered in meantime must be a careful of health a can if allow to become exhausted will fail in way must get appetite for dinner in other word must get ride walk morning in fresh air will ride if can find horse here by bye wrote to mr bruff yesterday have written to miss verinder yesby last night post very good will have news worth hearing to tell other tomorrow dont go yet have word to say to appeared to think yesterday that experiment with opium be not likely to be viewed very favourably by of friend be quite right call old gabriel betteredge one of friend will be amused to hear that protested strongly when saw yesterday have done wonderful number of foolish thing in course of life mr franklin top there be betteredges opinion will make allowance for prejudice be sure if happen to meet left mr blake to go round among patient feeling better happier even for short interview have have with be secret of attraction that there be for in man doe only mean that feel contrast between frankly kind manner in have allowed to become acquainted with merciless dislike distrust with be met by other people be there really something in answer to yearning have for little human sympathythe yearning have survived solitude persecution of many year seems to grow keener keener a time come nearer nearer when will endure feel no more how useless to ask question mr blake have given new interest in life let be enough without seeking to know what new interest be june thbefore breakfast morning mr candy informed that be going away for fortnight on visit to friend in south of england gave a many special direction poor fellow about patient a if still have large practice possessed before be taken ill practice be worth little enough now other doctor have superseded nobody who can help will employ be perhaps fortunate that be to be away just at time must have be mortified if have not informed of experiment be going to try with mr blake hardly know what undesirable result might not have happened if have taken into confidence better a be unquestionably better a be post brought miss verinders answer after mr candy have left house charming letter give highest opinion of there be attempt to conceal interest that feel in proceeding tell in prettiest manner that letter have satisfied of mr blake innocence without slightest need so far a be concerned of putting assertion to proof even upbraids herselfmost undeservedly poor thingfor not having divined at time what true solution of mystery might really be motive underlying proceeds evidently from something more than generous eagerness to make atonement for wrong have innocently inflicted on person be plain that have loved throughout estrangement between in more than one place rapture of discovering that have deserved to be loved break way innocently through stoutest formality of pen ink even defies stronger restraint still of writing to stranger be possible ask in reading delightful letter that of men in world be chosen to be mean of bringing two young people together again own happiness have be trampled under foot own love have be torn from will live to see happiness of others be of makinga love renewed be of bringing back oh merciful death let see before arm enfold before voice whisper to rest at last there be two request contained in letter one of prevents from showing to mr franklin blake be authorised to tell that miss verinder willingly consent to place house at disposal said be desired to add more so far be easy to comply with wish second request embarrasses seriously not content with having written to mr betteredge instructing to carry out whatever direction may have to give miss verinder asks leave to assist by personally superintending restoration of own sitting room only wait word of reply from to make journey to yorkshire to be present a one of witness on night when opium be tried for second time here again there be motive under surface here again fancy that can find out what have forbidden to tell mr franklin blake be a interpret eager to tell with own lip before be put to test be to vindicate character in eye of other people understand admire generous anxiety to acquit without waiting until innocence may may not be proved be atonement that be longing to make poor girl after having innocently inevitably wronged thing can not be done have sort of doubt that agitation meeting between must produce on sidesreviving dormant feeling appealing to old memory awakening new hopeswould in effect on mind of mr blake be almost certainly fatal to success of experiment be hard enough a thing be to reproduce in condition a existed nearly a existed last year with new interest new emotion to agitate attempt must be simply useless yet knowing can not find in heart to disappoint must try if can discover new arrangement before post time will allow to say yes to miss verinder without damage to service have bound to render to mr franklin blake two oclocki have just returned from round of medical visit having begun of course by calling at hotel mr blake report of night be same a before have have interval of broken sleep more feel le today having slept after yesterday dinner after dinner sleep be result doubt of ride advised to take fear will have to curtail restorative exercise in fresh air must not be too well must not be too ill be case a sailor must say of very fine steering have not heard yet from mr bruff found eager to know if have received answer from miss verinder told exactly what be permitted to tell more be quite needle to invent excuse for not showing letter told bitterly enough poor fellow that understood delicacy disinclined to produce consent of course a matter of common courtesy common justice said keep own opinion of wait to see result be sorely tempted to hint that be now wronging a have wronged on reflection shrank from forestalling in double luxury of surprising forgiving visit be very short one after experience of other night have be compelled once more to give up dose of opium a necessary result agony of disease be in have got upper hand again felt attack coming on left abruptly so a not to alarm distress only lasted quarter of hour time left strength enough to go on with work five oclocki have written reply to miss verinder arrangement have proposed reconciles interest on side if will only consent to after first stating objection that there be to meeting between mr blake before experiment be tried have suggested that must so time journey a to arrive at house privately on evening when make attempt travelling by afternoon train from london must delay arrival until nine oclock at hour have undertaken to see mr blake safely into bedchamber so to leave miss verinder free to occupy own room until time come for administering laudanum when have be done there can be objection to watching result with rest of on next morning will show mr blake if like correspondence with will satisfy in way that be acquitted in estimation before question of innocence be put to proof in sense have written to be can do today tomorrow must see mr betteredge give necessary direction for re opening house june thlate again in calling on mr franklin blake more of horrible pain in early morning followed time by complete prostration for hour foresee in spite of penalty exacts from that will have to return to opium for hundredth time if have only to think of must prefer sharp pain to frightful dream physical suffering exhaust if let sink may end in becoming useless to mr blake at time when want most be nearly one oclock before must get to hotel today visit even in shattered condition proved to be most amusing onethanks entirely to presence on scene of gabriel betteredge found in room when went in withdrew to window looked out while put first customary question to patient mr blake have slept badly again felt loss of rest morning more than have felt yet asked next if have heard from mr bruff letter have reached that morning mr bruff expressed strongest disapproval of course friend client be taking under advice be mischievousfor excited hope might never be realised be quite unintelligible to mind except that looked like piece of trickery akin to trickery of mesmerism clairvoyance like unsettled miss verinders house must end in unsettling miss verinder have put case without mentioning name to eminent physician eminent physician have smiled have shaken head have saidnothing on ground mr bruff entered protest left there next inquiry related to subject of diamond have lawyer produced evidence to prove that jewel be in london lawyer have simply declined to discus question be satisfied that moonstone have be pledged to mr luker eminent absent friend mr murthwaite whose consummate knowledge of indian character one must deny be satisfied also under circumstance with many demand already made on must decline entering into dispute on subject of evidence time must show mr bruff be willing to wait for time be quite plaineven if mr blake have not made plainer still by reporting substance of letter instead of reading what be actually writtenthat distrust of be at bottom of having foreseen that result be mortified surprised asked mr blake if friend protest have shaken answered emphatically that have not produced slightest effect on mind be free after to dismiss mr bruff from considerationand did dismiss accordingly pause in talk between followedand gabriel betteredge came out from retirement at window can favour with attention sir inquired addressing to be quite at

bed fretfully wondering why influence of laudanum have not begun to assert yet to tell in present humour that more fidgeted wondered longer must delay result for be now waiting must have be simply useless wiser course to take be to dismiss idea of opium from mind by leading insensibly to think of something else with view encouraged to talk to contriving so to direct conversation on side a to lead back again to subject have engaged earlier in eveningthe subject of diamond took care to revert to portion of story of moonstone related to transport of from london to yorkshire to risk mr blake have run in removing from bank at frizinghall to unexpected appearance of indian at house on evening of birthday purposely assumed in referring to event to have misunderstood much of what mr blake have told few hour since in way set talking on subject with be now vitally important to fill mindwithout allowing to suspect be making talk for purpose little by little became so interested in putting right that forgot to fidget in bed mind be far away from question of opium at important time when eye first told that opium be beginning to lay hold on brain looked at watch wanted five minute to twelve when premonitory symptom of working of laudanum first showed to at time unpractised eye must have detected change in a minute of new morning wore away swiftly subtle progress of influence began to show more plainly sublime intoxication of opium gleamed in eye dew of stealthy perspiration began to glisten on face in five minute more talk still kept up with failed in coherence held steadily to subject of diamond ceased to complete sentence little later sentence dropped to single word then there be interval of silence then sat up in bed then still busy with subject of diamond began to talk againnot to to that change told that first stage in experiment be reached stimulant influence of opium have got time now be twenty three minute past twelve next half hour at most must decide question of whether must must not get up from bed leave room in breathless interest of watching unutterable triumph of seeing first result of experiment declare in manner nearly at time have anticipatedi have

cabinet drawer doesnt lock sat down on side of bed anybody might take said rose again restlessly reiterated first word how do know indian may be hidden in house waited again drew back behind half curtain of bed looked about room with vacant glitter in eye be breathless moment there be pause of sort pause in action of opium pause in action of brain who must tell everything depended now on what did next laid down again on bed horrible doubt crossed mind be possible that sedative action of opium be making felt already be not in experience that must do what be experience where opium be concerned there be probably two men in existence on whom drug act in exactly same manner be constitutional peculiarity in feeling influence in new way be to fail on very brink of success no got up again abruptly how devil be to sleep said with on mind looked at light burning on table at head of bed after moment took candle in hand blew out second candle burning behind closed curtain drew back
