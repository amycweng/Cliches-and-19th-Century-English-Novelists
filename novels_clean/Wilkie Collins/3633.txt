composing influence of pipe said yes sir sir at right interval in flow of mr keller eloquence at distance of time can not pretend to report long harangue of be made victim in substance mr keller held that there be two irremediable vice in composition of woman disposition presented morally speaking disastrous mixture of imitativeness of monkey restlessness of child having proved by copious reference to highest authority mr keller logically claimed aunt a woman a such not only incapable of letting well alone naturally disposed to imitate husband on most superficial defective side of

good friend be still occupied by duty of office stole out to pay promised visit to minna minna be mother be impossible not to arrive at conclusion that be indeed in straitened circumstance lodging be in cheap suburban quarter of frankfort on left bank of river everything be scrupulously neat poor furniture be arranged with taste dexterity of management must disguise squalid shabbiness of sitting room into be shown must not help thinking how distressed fritz must feel if must have seen charming minna in place so unworthy of a rickety door opened jezebel of anonymous letter followed by daughter entered room there be certain remarkable woman in country who sphere may be seen in fill sphere a completely a great actor fill stage widow fontaine be one of noteworthy person wretched little room seemed to disappear when softly glided into even pretty minna receded into partial obscurity in mother presence yet there be nothing in least obtrusive in manner of madame fontaine nothing remarkable in stature figure reaching to more than middle height be well rounded figure of woman approaching forty year of age influence exercised be in part attributable a suppose to supple grace of movement in part to commanding composure of expression indescribable witchery of manner dark eye never fully opened in remembrance looked at under heavy overhanging upper eyelid enemy saw something sensual in strange expression to mind be rather something furtively cruel except when looked at daughter sensuality show most plainly in excessive development of lower part of face madame fontaine lip be thin chin be too small profuse black hair be just beginning to be streaked with gray complexion wanted color in spite of drawback be still striking might almost say startling creature when first looked at though only wore plainest widow weed scruple to assert that be most perfectly dressed woman ever saw minna made modest attempt to present in due form mother put aside playfully held out long white powerful hand to a cordially a if have known other for year wait to prove other people before accept for friend said mr david have be more than kind to daughter be friend at first meeting believe repeat word exactly wish must give adequate idea of exquisite charm of voice manner accompanied yet be not at ease with be not drawn to irresistibly a have felt drawn to daughter dark steady heavy lidded eye of hers seemed to be looking straight into heart surprising secret to say that actually distrusted disliked must be far from truth distrust dislike must have protected in degree at least from feeling influence a certainly did feel how influence be exerted whether be through eye through manner to speak jargon of latter day through magnetic emanation from invisibly overpowered be more than can possibly say can only report that contrived by slow degree to subject action of will more more completely to action of hers until found answering most insidious question a unreservedly a if have be in very truth intimate trusted friend be first visit to frankfort mr david began oh madam have be at frankfort on two former occasion ah indeed have always stayed with mr keller always looked unaccountably interested when heard that reply brief a be then of course be intimate with said intimate enough perhaps to ask favor to introduce friend made futile attempt to answer cautiously a intimate madam a young clerk in business can hope to be with partner said clerk in business repeated thought lived in london with aunt here minna interposed for first time forget mamma that there be three name in business inscription over door in main street be wagner keller engelman fritz once told that office here in frankfort be only small office grand business be mr wagner business in london be right mr david quite right miss minna have such magnificent flower garden at london house a mr engelman flower garden here may offer nosegay allowed to gather have hoped to make flower mean of turning conversation to more interesting topic widow resumed question while minna be admiring flower then be mr wagner clerk persisted be mr wagner clerk mr wagner be dead have who take care of great business now without well knowing why felt certain reluctance to speak of aunt affair widow fontaine eye rested on with resolute expectation in felt compelled to gratify when understood that mr wagner widow be now chief authority in business curiosity to hear everything must tell about aunt became insatiable minna interest in subject be in quite way a vivid a mother aunt house be place to cruel mr keller have banished lover inquiry of mother daughter followed other in such rapid succession can not pretend to remember now last question alone remains vividly impressed on memory in connection with unexpected effect answer produced be put by widow in word aunt be interested of course in affair of partner in place be possible mr david that may one day take journey to frankfort be quite likely madam that aunt may be in frankfort on business before end of year a replied in term widow looked round slowly at daughter minna be evidently quite a much at loss to understand look a be madame fontaine turned to again made apology pardon mr david there be little domestic duty have forgotten crossed room to small table on writing material be placed wrote few line handed paper without enclosing to minna give love to good friend downstairs while be in kitchen suppose make tea will stay drink tea with mr david be only luxury always make first impulse be to find excuse for declining invitation there be something in air of mystery with madame fontaine performed domestic duty be not at to taste minna pleaded with to say yes do stay with little longer said in innocently frank way have so few pleasure in place might perhaps have even resisted minna mother literally laid hand on seated with air of empress on shabby little sofa in corner of room beckoning to take place by side laid cool firm hand persuasively on mine touch filled with strange sense of disturbance half pleasurable half painful know how to describe let only record that yielded that minna left together want to tell whole truth said madame fontaine a soon a be alone can only do so in absence of daughter must have seen for that be very poor hand pressed mine gently answered a delicately a must said be sorry not surprised to hear when kindly helped minna to get that letter yesterday went on be innocent mean of inflicting disappointment on one disappointment more after others have gone before came here to place case before wealthy relative of mine in city refused to assist wrote next to other member of family living in brussels letter of yesterday contained answer refusal landlady of house be afflicted creature with claim on sympathy too be struggling with poverty if failed to pay must be too cruel only yesterday felt hard duty to give notice of departure in week more have just written to recall notice reason be that see gleam of hope in future mr david be friend who have shown to be more than surprised at may ask how said patted hand with playful assumption of petulance little more patience rejoined will soon hear if have only to think of must not feel anxiety now trouble must take housekeeper place to morrow yes be brought up among surroundings of luxury refinement descended in rank when married for must fill domestic employment without repining lot without losing self respect adversity be hard teacher of sound lesson david may call david if heard of housekeeper place vacant must tell of must hardly understand whether be in jest in earnest went on without waiting for to reply have daughter to think of resumed to add to anxiety daughter have given heart to mr keller son while dear minna have only own interest to consider might have earned daily bread together might have faced future with courage what might once have be calm course of life be now troubled by third person rival with in daughter love worse still man who be forbidden to marry be wonderful that feel baffled disheartened helpless oh be not exaggerating know child nature be too delicate too exquisitely sensitive for rough world life in when love love with heart soul day by day have seen pining fading under separation from fritz have revived hope for moment prospect before remains unaltered if loses fritz will die of broken heart oh god one creature love how be to help save know for first time heard fervor of true feeling in voice turned aside from hid face with wild gesture of despair be really terrible to see tried honestly tried to comfort of one thing at least may be sure said fritz whole heart be given to daughter will be true to worthy of through trial doubt answered sadly have nothing to say against girl choice fritz be good fritz be true a say forget father personally mind despise mr keller looked round at with unutterable contempt flashing through tear filled eye man who listens to lie that scandal can utter against character of helpless woman who give opportunity of defending have written to received answer who declares that son will never marry daughter because be poor of course who us attack on reputation have never verified a excuse for brutal conduct can anybody respect such man a yet on despicable creature child happiness child life depend for sake matter what own feeling may be must stoop to defend must make opportunity of combating cowardly prejudice winning good opinion in spite of how be to get hearing how be to approach understand that be not in position to help have done wonder for nevertheless god bless for lifted hand to lip foresaw what be coming tried to speak gave opportunity eloquent enthusiasm rushed into new flow of word yes best of friend wisest of adviser went on have suggested irresistible interference of person whose authority be supreme excellent aunt be head of business mr keller must listen to charming chief there be gleam of hope on chance will sell last few valuable posse wait till mr wagner arrives at frankfort start david what be there to alarm do suppose capable of presuming on aunt kindness of begging for favor may not be perfectly easy for to grant mr wagner know already from fritz what situation be let only see minna wo intrude on daughter will plead for daughter will ask for want interview with mr keller permission to speak in own defense tell honestly be expecting too much if hope that aunt will persuade fritz father to see sounded modestly enough in word have own doubt nevertheless have left mr keller working hard at protest against employment of woman in office to be sent to aunt by day post knowing a did thought at least probable that written controversy might be succeeded by personal estrangement if mr keller proved obstinate mr wagner must soon show that have will of own under circumstance favor must be asked favor must be granted poor minna prospect must be darker than ever be one view of case must own however that impression have be produced on something in madame fontaine manner suggested that might not be quite so modest in demand on aunt when met at frankfort a have led to believe be vexed with for having spoken too unreservedly be quite at loss to decide what ought to say in answer to appeal have be made to in state of perplexity be relieved by welcome interruption minna voice reached from landing outside have hand engaged said please let in ran to door widow laid finger on lip not word mind to minna whispered understand other said yes certainly so subject be dropped for rest of evening charming girl came in carrying tea tray especially directed attention to cake have made that day with own hand can cook said can make own dress if fritz be poor man when marries can save expense of servant talk at tea table be dare say too trifling to be recorded only remember that enjoyed later in evening minna sang to heard one of simple german ballad again not long since music brought tear into eye moon rose early that night when looked at watch found that be time to go minna be at window admiring moonlight on beautiful night said seems shame to stay indoors do let walk part of way back with mr david mamma only a far a bridge to see moon on river mother consented three left house together arrived at bridge paused to look at view cloud be rising already

left unopened in london fritz might be expected to arrive if traveled without stopping in course of next day two put reasonable view of matter to minna received thoroughly irrational womanly reply

likely that be influenced by popular prejudice against 'old head on young shoulder at same time confess must keep here if be in place will move little further on madame fontaine be daresay perfectly right in estimate of looking back at page of narrative discover place in certainly appear to justify opinion even justified at time before mr keller be out of hearing began to see under surface to

with that two specimen of resuscitated poison have succeeded in producing be capable like poison already known to modern medical practice of rendering utmost benefit in certain case of disease if be administered in carefully regulated dos must live to devote to good purpose there will still be danger common to poisonous preparation employed in medicine of doing fatal mischief when misused by ignorance crime bearing in mind conceive to be duty to provide against dangerous result by devoting to discovery of efficient antidote before adapt preparation to capacity of healing art have have

gradual progress of deadly action of poison what felt when returned to suffering man will not attempt to describe will understand how completely be overwhelmed when tell that meanly concealed own disgraceful thoughtlessness from brother in university be afraid that experiment might be prohibited a dangerous want of common prudence be made subject of public reprimand by authority medical professor be permitted by to conclude that be case of illness entirely new in experience in administering antidote have previous experiment to guide except experiment with rabbit dog whether miscalculated whether be deluded by anxiety to save man life can not say at least be certain gave dos too copiously at too short interval patient recovered be after sustaining incomprehensibly deteriorating change in blood destroyed complexion turned hair gray have since modified dos in dread of losing memorandum have attached piece of notched paper to bottle so a to render future error of judgment impossible at same time have facilitated future administration of antidote by adding label to bottle stating exact quantity of poison taken by servant a calculated by ought by way to have mentioned in cipher experience have shown necessity if antidote be to be preserved for length of time of protecting in blue glass from influence of light let also tell found vegetable diet of use in perfecting effect of treatment that mean dread of discovery have already acknowledged induced to avail myself of wife help in nursing man when began to talk of what have happened to must trust madame fontaine to keep secret when be well enough to get up poor harmless creature disappeared be probably terrified at prospect of entering laboratory again in case have never seen heard of since if have

will afford plenty of time speak ignorantly of such thing for providing bride outfit madame fontaine smiled sadly far more time than want sir poor little purse will leave girl to rely on natural attraction with small help from jeweler milliner on wedding day mr keller referred to letter again looked up from with grim smile sister will in one respect at least anticipate assistance of jeweler said proposes to bring with a present to bride heirloom on female side of family be pearl necklace of very great value be told presented to mother by empress maria theresa in recognition of service rendered to illustrious person early in life a expression of sister interest in marriage thought announcement of proposed gift might prove gratifying to madame fontaine clasped hand with fervor of feeling be in case at least perfectly sincere pearl necklace gift of empress must represent in money value little fortune in can find word to express sense of gratitude said daughter must speak for herself for daughter must hear good news a soon a possible mr keller added kindly wo detain know must be anxious to see minna one word before go will of course invite relative friend whom must like to see at wedding madame fontaine lifted sleepy eye by slow gradation to ceiling devoutly resigned to mention family circumstance parent cast off sir when married said other relative here in brussels refused to assist when stood in need of help a for friend dear mr keller be only friend thank again again lowered eye softly to floor glided out of room back view of figure be best view even mr keller constitutionally inaccessible to exhibition of female grace followed with eye perceived that housekeeper be beautifully made on stair met with housemaid where be miss minna asked impatiently in room in room madam saw miss minna go in a passed door madame fontaine hurried up next flight of stair ran along corridor a lightly a young girl door of room be ajar saw daughter through opening sitting on sofa with work lying idle on lap minna started up when mother appeared be in way mamma be so stupid ca get on with embroidery madame fontaine tossed embroidery to other end of room threw arm round minna lifted joyously from floor a if have be little child day be fixed angel cried be to be married on thirtieth shifted one hand to daughter head clasped with fierce fondness to bosom oh darling have lovely hair even when be baby wo have dressed at wedding will flow down naturally in beauty hand will brush mine pressed lip on minna head devoured with kiss then driven by irresistible impulse

nervously dear sweet mamma how can think so hard hearted so ungrateful ca tell how love let tell with tender charming grace kissed mother then drew back little looked at madame fontaine subsiding conflict of emotion still showed with fiery brightness in widow eye do know what be thinking minna asked little timidly what be dear think be almost too fond of mamma must like to be person who stood between marriage if knew of madame fontaine smiled foolish child do take for tigress said playfully must have kiss to reconcile to new character bent head to meet caress looked by chance at cupboard fixed in recess in opposite wall of room suddenly checked be too selfish of said rising abruptly time be forgetting bridegroom father will leave to hear good news from do think know what be longing to do led minna hurriedly to door go dear one go tell fritz instant daughter disappeared rushed across room to cupboard eye have not deceived key be left in lock chapter ii madame fontaine dropped into chair overwhelmed by discovery looked at key left in cupboard be of old fashioned pattern evidently also of best workmanship of time on flat handle bore engraved word pink room cupboard so called from color of curtain hanging in bedchamber be brain softening said to herself what horrible mistake what frightful risk to have run got on foot again opened cupboard two lower shelf be occupied by linen neatly folded laid out on higher shelf nearly on level with eye stood plain wooden box about two foot in height by one foot in breadth examined position of box with breathless interest care then gently lifted in hand placed on floor on table near window lay half finished watercolor drawing with magnifying glass by side of providing with glass returned to cupboard closely investigated place on box have stood slight layer of dust so slight a to be imperceptible to unassisted eye have surrounded four side of box presented four delicate edge in perfectly undisturbed straightness of line mute evidence conclusively proved that box have not be moved during quarter of hour absence in mr keller room put back again heaved deep breath of relief be bad sign thought that sense of caution have be completely suspended in eagerness of curiosity to know if mr keller message of invitation referred to wedding day lose best treasure said to herself sadly if be beginning to lose steadiness of mind if must happen again left expression of idea uncompleted locked door of room returned to place on have left box seating rested box on knee opened certain tell tale indentation visible where cover fitted into lock showed that have once be forced open lock have be hampered on former occasion key remained so fast fixed in that must neither be turned drawn out in newly aroused distrust of own prudence be now considering serious question of emptying box sending to be fitted with lock key have anything by thought to herself in can keep bottle emptied box placed round her on floor terrible six bottle have be special subject of husband precautionary instruction on death bed of be smaller than others be manufactured in glass of different color six compartment in medicine chest being carefully graduated in size so a to hold steadily label on three of bottle be unintelligible to madame fontaine inscription be written in barbarously abridged latin character bottle be fourth in order a took out one by one be wrapped in sheet of thick cartridge paper covered on inner side with character written in mysterious cipher label pasted on bottle contained inscription in good readable german thus translated looking glass drop fatal dose a discovered by experiment on animal same a in case of 'alexander wine ' effect in producing death more rapid more indistinguishable in respect of presenting trace on post mortem examination line thus written be partially erased by stroke of pen drawn through at later date judging by color of ink in last blank space left at foot of label word be added also in ink of fresher color after many patient trial can discover trustworthy antidote to infernal poison under circumstance dare not attempt to modify for medical use must throw away like to be beaten if live little longer will try once more with mind refreshed by other study madame fontaine paused before wrapped bottle up again in covering looked with longing eye at cipher filled inner side of sheet of paper there perhaps be announcement of discovery of antidote possibly record of more recent experiment placed terrible power of poison in new light there also be cipher defying to discover secret fifth bottle that took from chest contained alexander wine sixth last be of well remembered blue glass have played important part in event of mr keller recovery david glenney have rightly conjectured that label have be removed from blue glass bottle madame fontaine shook out of empty compartment inscription also in german language ran a follows antidote to alexander wine fatal dose in case of accident be indicated by notched slip of paper attached to bottle two fluid drachm of poison more than enough to produce death be accidentally taken in experience so gradual be deadly effect that after delay of thirty six hour before attention be called to case administration of antidote proved successful dos be to be repeated three four hour person watching patient may know that recovery be certain that dos be therefore to be discontinued by sign cessation of trembling in hand appearance of natural perspiration transition from stillness of apathy to repose of sleep for at least week ten day afterwards vegetable diet with cream be necessary a mean of completing cure laid label aside looked at two bottle poison antidote ranged together at foot power thought with superb smile of triumph power have dreamed of life be mine at last alone among mortal creature have life death for servant be deaf mr keller to reason deaf to entreaty what wonderful influence brought to foot made eager benefactor of child servant death who threatened in night servant life who raised up in morning what position stand here dweller in populous city creature in from highest to lowest be creature in power looked through window of room over house of frankfort at last sleepy eye opened wide infernal beauty irradiated face for one moment stood demon in human form next suddenly changed into timid woman shaken in limb by cold grasp of fear what influence have wrought transformation nothing knock at door who be there cried voice answered be voice of jack straw hullo there mr fontaine let in placed strong constraint on spoke in friendly tone what do want jack want to show key what do care about crazy wretch key be thought passed through madame fontaine mind when jack answered from outer side of door be still careful when spoke to to disguise voice in friendliest tone excuse for keeping waiting jack ca let in yet why not because be dressing come back in hour will be glad to see there be reply to jack step be so light that be impossible to hear through door whether have gone away not after waiting minute widow ventured on peeping out jack have taken off not sign of be to be seen when bent over railing of corridor looked down on stair locked in again hope have offended thought a returned to empty medicine chest fear that jack might talk of what have happened to in laboratory at wurzburg that might allude to illness in term must not fail to recall symptom of mr keller illness be constantly present to mind decided on agreeably surprising by little present might help to win confidence to acquire influence over a madman lately released from bedlam might perhaps not greatly matter what said suspicion be easily excited though david glenney have be sent out of way aunt remained at frankfort insolent readiness in distrusting german lady seemed to run in family having arrived at conclusion gave mind again to still unsettled question of new lock to medicine chest measuring longest of bottle bottle containing antidote found that dressing case be not high enough to hold while chest be in locksmith workshop trunk on other hand be only protected by very ordinary lock be too large to be removed to safe keeping of cupboard must either leave six bottle loose on shelf abandon extra security of new lock one risk of taking first of two course be risk of leaving key again in cupboard be likely to occur after fright have already suffered question be not really worth answering have already placed two of bottle on shelf when fatal objection to trusting empty box out of own possession suddenly crossed mind husband colleague at wurzburg of elder student be acquainted externally at least with appearance of professor ugly old medicine chest must be easily identified by initial of name inscribed in deeply burnt letter on lid suppose one of men happened to be in frankfort suppose saw stolen chest in locksmith shop two such coincidence be in last degree improbable be enough that be possible who fool in critical position must run risk of even one chance in hundred turning against instead of trusting chest in stranger hand wiser course must be to burn at first safe opportunity be content with security of cupboard while remained in mr keller house arriving at conclusion put chest content back again on shelf with one exception of label detached from blue glass bottle in preternatural distrust now possessed label assumed character of dangerous witness if through unlucky accident happened to fall into hand of person in house picked up advanced to fireplace to destroy paused looked at again nearly two dos of antidote be still left who must say looking at future of life a hers that might not have need of yet after have already served so well must be sure if destroyed of remembering instruction specified interval at dos be to be given sign signified recovery length of time during vegetable diet be to be administered read first sentence again carefully antidote to alexander wine fatal dose in case of accident be indicated by notched slip of paper attached to bottle two fluid drachm of poison more than enough to produce death be accidentally taken in experience so gradual be deadly effect that after delay of thirty six hour before attention be called to case administration of antidote proved successful dos be to be repeated remaining instruction beginning with last sentence be not of nature to excite suspicion taken by might refer to nothing more remarkable than remedy in certain case of illness first thought of cutting off upper part of label line of writing be so close together that must infallibly betray act of mutilation opened dressing case took from common looking little paper box purchased at chemist bearing ambitious printed title of macula exstinctor destroyer of stain being ordinary preparation in powder for removing stain from dress ink stain included printed direction stated that powder partially dissolved in water might also be used to erase written character without in way injuring paper otherwise than by leaving slight shine on surface by mean madame fontaine removed first four sentence on label left writing on to begin harmlessly with instruction for repeating dos now can trust to refresh memory without telling tale said to herself when put label back in chest a for recorded dose of poison be not likely to forget that be medicine measuring glass filled up to mark of two drachm having locked cupboard secured key in pocket be ready for reception of jack watch told that hour interval have more than expired opened door of room there be sign of outside looked over stair called to softly there be reply little man sensitive dignity have evidently taken offense one thing to be done remembering that have to dread from wanton exercise of jack tongue be to soothe ruffled vanity without further delay there must be difficulty in discovering if have not gone out wherever mistress might be at moment there be sure to be found trying mr wagner room first without success widow descended to ground floor made way to office in private room formerly occupied by mr engelman david glenney aunt be working at desk jack straw be perched on old fashioned window seat putting finishing touch to minna new straw hat chapter iii in gloom thrown over household by mr engelman death mr wagner with characteristic energy good sense have kept mind closely occupied during office hour studied detail of business at frankfort differed from detail of business in london soon mastered sufficiently to be able to fill vacancy mr engelman have left position that have held became with privilege responsibility mr wagner position claimed not in virtue of rank a directress of london house in recognition of knowledge that have specially acquired to fit for post out of office hour corresponded with english writer on treatment of insane person whose work have discovered in late husband library assisted in attracting public attention to humane system advocated even plan for employment of respectable girl in suitable department of office be not left neglected by indefatigable woman same friendly consideration have induced to spare mr keller allusion to subject while health be not yet completely restored still kept silent until time have reconciled to calamity of partner death privately however have caused inquiry to be made in frankfort must assist in choosing worthy candidate for employment when favorable time came probably after celebration of fritz marriage for acting in interest of proposed reform pray send away if interrupt said madame fontaine pausing modestly on threshold before entered room spoke english admirably made point of ignoring mr wagner equally perfect knowledge of german by addressing always in english language come in by mean mr wagner answered be only writing to david glenney to tell at minna request that wedding day be fixed give nephew kind regard mr wagner will be one of party at wedding of course yes if can be spared from duty in london be there anything can do for madame fontaine nothing thank except to excuse intrusion be afraid have offended little friend there with pretty straw hat in hand want to make peace with jack looked up from work with air of lofty disdain oh dear doe matter said in most magnificent manner be

premonitory rustling sound over door steel hammer moved rose metal globe bell rang stood rooted to floor sobbing hysterically iron grasp of suspense held not cry not movement escaped madame fontaine life seemed to have be struck out of by stroke of bell woke schwartz except that looked up too never moved too be like living creature turned to stone minute passed curtain swayed gently tremulous finger crept out parting slowly over black surface of curtain fair naked arm showed widening gap figure appeared in velvet pall on pale face stillness of repose be barely ruffled yet eye alone be conscious of returning life looked out on room softly surprised perplexed more looked downwards lip trembled sweetly into smile saw jack kneeling in ecstasy at foot now again there be stillness in room unutterable happiness rejoiced unutterable dread suffered in same silence first sound heard came suddenly from lonely outer hall hurrying footstep swept over courtyard flash of light flew along dark passage voice of men woman mingled together poured into watchman chamber postscript mr david glenney return to frankfort close story on twelfth of december received letter from mr wagner informing that marriage of fritz minna have be deferred until thirteenth of january shortly afterwards left london on way to frankfort departure be hurried to afford time to transact business with of correspondent in france in northern germany head clerk mr hartrey directing london house in mr wagner absence have own old fashioned notion of doing nothing in hurry insisted on allowing far larger margin of time for treating with correspondent than be likely to require good man little suspected to what motive ready submission to be due be eager to see aunt charming minna once more without neglecting of duty with occasional sacrifice of traveling by night contrived to reach frankfort week before be expected be to say in forenoon of fourth of january ii joseph face when opened door at once informed that something extraordinary be going on in house anything wrong asked joseph looked at in state of bewilderment have better speak to doctor said doctor who be ill aunt mr keller who be in impatience took by collar of coat shook shook out nothing former answer little abridged speak to doctor office door be close by asked one of clerk if mr keller be in room clerk informed that mr keller be upstairs with doctor in extremity of suspense inquired again if aunt be ill man opened eye be possible have heard said be dead alive burst out losing patience answered clerk began not unnaturally think to wonder whether be in mr keller house in asylum for idiot returning to hall collared joseph for second time take up to doctor instantly said joseph led way upstairs not on aunt side of house to infinite relief on first landing made mysterious communication mr david have given notice to leave said there be thing that servant can put up with while person life expect person to live when person dy expect person to die there must be confusion on serious subject a life death blame nobody understand nothing merely go follow if please sir have be drinking led way up next flight of stair steadily quietly knocked discreetly at madame fontaine door mr david glenney announced to see doctor dormann mr keller came out first closing door behind embraced with demonstrative affection far from characteristic of at other time face be disturbed voice faltered a spoke first word to welcome back david more welcome than ever aunt be well hope clasped hand fervently god be merciful said thank god be madame fontaine ill before must answer door be opened again doctor dormann came out very man want exclaimed must not possibly have arrived at better time turned to mr keller where can find writing material in drawing room come down mr glenney come down mr keller in drawing room wrote few line rapidly see sign name said handed pen to mr keller after have signed then gave paper to read to unspeakable amazement writing certified that suspended vital force in mr wagner have recovered action in deadhouse of frankfort at past one o'clock on morning of fourth of january that have professionally superintended restoration to life that thereby relieved magistrate from further necessity for pursuing private inquiry motive for longer existed to statement there be line added declaring that mr keller withdrew application to magistrate authenticated by mr keller signature stood with paper in hand looking from one to other of a completely bewildered a joseph ca leave madame fontaine said doctor be professionally interested in watching case otherwise must have made statement in person mr keller have be terribly shaken stand in urgent need of rest quiet will do both service if will take paper to town hall declare before magistrate that know personally have seen sign name on return will have explanation can give will see for that need feel uneasiness on subject of aunt having arrived at town hall made personal statement to doctor have referred among question put to be asked if have direct interest in matter a regarded mr wagner other person having answered be mr wagner nephew be instructed to declare in writing approved a mr wagner representative of doctor statement of mr keller withdrawal of application with formal proceeding terminated be free to return to house iii joseph have order time spoke like reasonable being said doctor be waiting for in madame fontaine room place of appointment rather surprised doctor opened door paused before admitted think be first person said who saw mr keller on morning when be taken ill after late mr engelman answered be first person come in then want to look at madame fontaine led to bedside instant looked at saw mr keller illness reproduced in symptom there lay in same apathy with same wan look on face same intermittent trembling of hand when recovered first shock of discovery be able to notice poor minna kneeling at opposite side of bed weeping bitterly oh dear one cried in passion of grief look at speak to mother opened eye for moment looked at minna closed again wearily leave quiet said in tone of fretful entreaty minna rose bent over pillow tenderly poor lip look so parched said let give lemonade madame fontaine only repeated word leave quiet same reluctance to raise heavy eyelid same entreaty to be left undisturbed have alarmed on memorable morning when have entered mr keller room doctor dormann signed to to follow out a opened door nurse inquired if have further instruction for send for moment see change answered will be in drawing room with mr glenney silently pressed poor minna hand before left who must have presumed at moment to express sympathy in word doctor descended stair together doe illness remind of anything asked of mr keller illness answered exactly a remember made further remark entered drawing room inquired if must see aunt must wait little said mr wagner be asleep longer sleep more complete recovery will be main anxiety be about jack be quiet enough now keeping watch outside door have given trouble wish knew more of early history from can learn be only what be called half witted when received at asylum in cruel repressive treatment in place aggravated imbecility into violent madness such madness have tendency to recur mr wagner influence have already done so much be main hope for future sit down let explain strange position in find here a well a can iv do remember how mr keller illness be cured doctor began word instantly reminded not only of doctor dormann mysterious suspicion at time of illness of jack extraordinary question to on morning when left frankfort doctor saw that answered with little embarrassment let open mind to other without reserve said have set thinking of something what be replied concealing nothing doctor dormann be equally candid on side spoke to exactly a be reported to have spoken to mr keller in second part of narrative now know proceeded what thought of mr keller extraordinary recovery what feared when found mr wagner a then firmly believed dead suspicion of poisoning pointed to poisoner madame fontaine wonderful cure of mr keller by mean of own mysterious remedy made suspect madame fontaine motive in refusing to give burial certificate be to provoke legal inquiry knew that mr keller must institute on mere expression of doubt on part whether aunt have died natural death at time have not slightest anticipation of event have actually occurred before however have removed remains to deadhouse must own be little startled prepare for surprise by private communication addressed to by jack repeated jack narrative of opening of pink room cupboard administration of antidote to mr wagner will understand went on be too well aware of marked difference between mr keller illness mr wagner illness to suppose for moment that same poison have be given to of be therefore far from sharing jack blind confidence in efficacy of blue glass bottle in case of mistress tell honestly mind be disturbed about towards night thought be again directed to subject under mysterious circumstance mr keller accompanied hearse to deadhouse on way through street be followed stopped by madame fontaine have something to give here be laid on table sheet of thick paper closely covered with writing in cipher v whose writing be asked writing of madame fontaine late husband put into hand yes asked to interpret cipher for be simply incomprehensible not in least knew use to jack have put antidote in ignorance of chemistry be eager to be prepared for consequence might follow can guess on what chance calculated when consented to interpret cipher on chance that might tell what poison have given to mr wagner well guessed mr glenney have actually discovered meaning of hieroglyphic laid second sheet of paper on table there be one cipher defies interpretation said if correspondent privately arrange to consult same edition of same book if cipher refers to given page to certain line on page ingenuity can discover unaided by previous discovery of book other cipher so far a know be at mercy of skill patience in case began to save time trouble by trying rule for interpreting most simple most elementary of cipher be to say use of ordinary language of correspondence concealed under arbitrary sign right way to read sign can be described in two word on examination of cipher will find that sign will be more often repeated than others count separate sign ascertain by simple addition especial sign occurs oftenest follows next in point of number so on comparison established ask what vowel occurs oftenest what consonant occurs oftenest in language in suppose cipher to be written result be merely question of time patience be result said pointing to second sheet of paper read answered judge for opening sentence of interpreted cipher appeared to be intended by doctor fontaine to serve purpose of memorandum repeating privately instruction already attached by label to poison called alexander wine to antidote paragraph followed be of far more interesting kind alluded to second poison called looking glass drop related result of one of professor most remarkable experiment in following word vi looking glass drop fatal dose a discovered by experiment on animal same a in case of alexander wine effect in producing death more rapid more indistinguishable in respect of presenting trace on post mortem examination after many patient trial can discover trustworthy antidote to infernal poison under circumstance dare not attempt to modify for medical use must throw away like to be beaten if live little longer will try once more with mind refreshed by other study month after writing line have repeated in plain character on bottle for fear of accident tried again failed again annoyed by new disappointment did something unworthy of a scientific man after first poisoning animal with looking glass drop administered dose from blue bottle containing antidote to alexander wine knowing perfectly well different nature of two poison expecting nothing of scientific importance to follow yet trusting stupidly to chance to help result be startling in last degree be nothing le than complete suspension of sign of life a know for day night part of day only knew that animal be not really dead by observing on morning of second day that sign of decomposition have set in season being summer laboratory badly ventilated hour after first symptom of revival have astonished creature be a lively again a usual ate with good appetite after lapse of ten day be still in perfect health extraordinary example of action reaction of ingredient of poison ingredient of antidote on other on source of life deserves will have most careful investigation may live to carry inquiry through to good use to record on page there be other page further record professor last scientific aspiration have not be fulfilled vii be past midnight said doctor when made discovery with be now acquainted went at once to mr keller have fortunately not gone to bed accompanied to deadhouse knowing overseer private door at side of building be able to rouse with very little delay in excitement possessed spoke of revival a possible thing in hearing of servant whole household accompanied to deadhouse at opposite extremity of building what saw there be utterly incapable of describing to be in time to take necessary measure for keeping mr wagner composed for removing without injury to mr keller house having successfully accomplished presumed that anxiety be at end be completely mistaken refer to madame fontaine suppose refer to jack poor wretch ignorant faith have unquestionably saved mistress life must never have ventured even if have be acquainted with result of professor experiment at earlier hour to run desperate risk jack confronted without hesitation event of night aggravated by brandy schwartz have given to have completely overthrown balance of feeble brain be a mad for time being a ever must have be in bedlam with difficulty prevailed on to take composing mixture objected irritably to trust even when mixture have begun to quiet be ungrateful enough to speak contemptuously of what have done for ' have much better remedy than yours said beade by man who be worth hundred of schwartz be fool enough to give to mr housekeeper last night thought nothing of be one of eccentricity be to be expected from in condition left quietly asleep be about to go home get little rest when mr keller son stopped in hall go see madame fontaine ' said beinna be alarmed about mother went upstairs again directly have noticed anything remarkable in madame fontaine asked before fritz spoke to noticed at deadhouse that looked frightened out of sens be little surprised holding opinion did of that woman must show so much sensibility mr keller took charge of on way back to house be quite unprepared for what saw afterwards when went to room at fritz request did discover resemblance to mr keller illness no not till afterwards sent daughter out of room thought looked at strangely when be alone ' want paper gave in street last night said asked why wanted seemed not to know how to reply became excited confused 'to destroy to be sure burst out suddenly 'every bottle husband left be destroyed strewed here there everywhere from gate to deadhouse oh know what think of defy ' seemed to forget what have said moment have said turned away opened drawer took out book closed by metal clasp presence in room appeared to be lost perception in mind clasp of book a well a must make out opened by touching spring noticed that hand trembled a tried to find spring attributed trembling to terror of night offered to help secret alone said pushed book under pillow of bed be professional duty to assist if must though attached sort of importance to what jack have said thought desirable before prescribed for to discover whether have really taken medicine of own not staggered back from on repeating what have heard from jack a if have terrified 'what remedy doe mean drank nothing glass of wine send for directly must will speak to ' told be impossible must not permit sleep to be disturbed 'the watchman cried drunken brute send for ' by time began to conclude that there be really something wrong called in daughter to look after while be away then left room to consult with fritz only hope of finding night watch at deadhouse being over by time be to apply to sister nurse knew where lived fritz most kindly offered to go to by time schwartz be found brought to house madame fontaine be just able to understand what said more began to recognize symptom of mr keller illness apathy remember be showing already 'leave to die ' said quietly ' deserve ' last effort of distracted mind rousing for moment sinking body be made almost immediately afterwards raised on pillow seized arm beind ' said be to be married on thirteenth eye rested steadily on while spoke at last word sank back relapsed into condition in have just seen can hing for nothing modern science be absolutely ignorant of poison professor fontaine fatal ingenuity revived slow poisoning by reiterated dos in small quantity understand slow poisoning by one dose be so entirely beyond experience medical men in general refuse to believe in be sure that be poisoned asked after what jack told morning when woke have doubt be poisoned by 'alexander wine ' appears to have treacherously offered to a remedy to have hesitated at last moment to let have a remedy jack ignorant faith gave to by hand of schwartz when have more time before will hear detail in meanwhile can only tell that retribution be complete madame fontaine might even now be saved if jack have not given remained of antidote to mr wagner be there objection to asking jack for particular strongest possible objection be of utmost importance to discourage from touching on subject in future have already told mr wagner that have saved life just before came in found comforting minna 'your mamma have taken own good medicine missy will soon get well have be obliged god forgive to tell aunt minna that be misled by insane delusion that be not to believe one word of what have said to doubt motive justifies said not penetrating motive at moment will understand directly answered trust to honor under circumstance why have taken into confidence under circumstance for very serious reason mr david be likely to be closely associated in time to come with aunt minna look to to help good work have begun mr wagner future life must not be darkened by horrible recollection that sweet girl must enjoy happy year be in store for unembittered by knowledge of mother guilt do understand now why be compelled to speak unjustly of poor jack a proof understood promised secrecy have right to expect from entrance of nurse closed conference reported madame fontaine malady to be already altering for worse doctor watched case at interval too saw again although happened long ago can not prevail upon to dwell on deliberate progress of hellish borgia poison in undermining force of life nervous shudderings reached climax then declined a gradually a have arisen for hour afterwards lay in state of complete prostration not last word not last look rewarded devoted girl watching faithfully at bedside more of more late in afternoon of next day doctor dormann gently most gently removed minna from room mr keller looked at other in silence knew that madame fontaine be dead viii have not forgotten clasped book that have tried vainly to open in doctor dormann presence taking from under pillow left mr keller doctor to say if must give unopened to minna certainly not said doctor why not because will tell what must never know believe that book to be diary open see found spring opened clasp be diary judged suppose from appearance of book said not at judged from own experience at time when be medical officer at prison here educated criminal be almost invariably inveterate egotist be interesting to ourselves more vile be more intensely be absorbed in very people who have logically speaking most indisputable interest in concealing crime be also very people who almost without exception yield to temptation of looking at in page of diary doubt experience doctor result puzzle think little mr david will not find riddle so very hard to read better be more unselfishly be interested in others worse be more inveterately interest be concentrated on look at aunt a example of what say morning there be letter waiting for on subject of reform in treatment of mad people be a resolute a ever to promote in country a well a in england be with greatest difficulty prevailed on not to answer letter just yet in other word not to excite brain nervous system after such ordeal a have just passed through do think wicked woman with letter relating merely to interest of other people waiting for must have stood in need of interference not wicked woman must have thought only of herself must have be far too much interested in own recovery to run risk of relapse open that book of madame fontaine at of later entry will find miserable woman betrayed in page be true record of madame fontaine most secret moment presented in narrative be first found in diary a example diary record in fullest detail infernal ingenuity of stratagem by usurped title to mr keller confidence a preserver of life have only to give alexander wine writes to
