love poor dear own sweet girl suppose that be parting kiss will see again often often will see again at aunt at sign from mr troy robert took isabel arm in led away tommie watching from chair lifted little white muzzle a playfellow looked back on passing doorway long melancholy farewell howl of dog be last sound isabel miller heard a left house part second discovery chapter viii on day after isabel departure diligent mr troy set forth for head office in whitehall to consult police on question of missing money have previously sent information of robbery to bank of england have also advertised loss in daily newspaper air be so pleasant sun be so bright that determined on proceeding to destination on foot be hardly out of sight of own office when be overtaken by friend who be also walking in direction of whitehall gentleman be person of considerable worldly wisdom experience have be officially associated with case of striking notorious crime in government have assistance to discover punish criminal opinion of person in position might be of greatest value to mr troy whose practice a solicitor have thus far never brought into collision with thief mystery accordingly decided in isabel interest on confiding to friend nature of errand to police concealing name concealing nothing else described what have happened on previous day at lady lydiard house then put question plainly to companion what must do in place in place friend answered quietly must not waste time money in consulting police not consult police exclaimed mr troy in amazement surely have not made understood be going to head office have got letter of introduction to chief inspector in detective department be afraid omitted to mention that doe make difference proceeded other a coolly a ever have asked for advice give advice tear up letter of introduction stir step further in direction of whitehall mr troy began to understand believe in detective police said who can believe in who read newspaper remembers what read friend rejoined fortunately for detective department public in general forgets what read go to club look at criminal history of own time recorded in newspaper crime be more le mystery will see that mystery police discover be almost without exception mystery made penetrable by commonest capacity through extraordinary stupidity exhibited in mean taken to hide crime on other hand let guilty man woman be resolute intelligent person capable of setting wit fairly against wit of police in other word let mystery really be mystery cite case if can really difficult perplexing case in criminal have not escaped mind charge police with neglecting work doubt do best take greatest pain in following routine to have be trained be misfortune not fault that there be man of superior intelligence among mean man who be capable in great emergency of placing above conventional method following new way of own there have be such men in police men naturally endowed with faculty of mental analysis can decompose mystery resolve into component part find clue at bottom matter how remote from ordinary observation may be men have died have retired one of must have be invaluable to in case have just mentioned to a thing be unless be wrong in believing in young lady innocence person who have stolen that bank note will be easy person to find in opinion there be only one man now in london who be likely to be of slightest assistance to be not in police who be asked mr troy old rogue who be once in branch of legal profession friend answered may perhaps remember name call 'old sharon ' what scoundrel who be struck off roll of attorney year since be still alive alive prospering life in court lane running out of long acre offer advice to person interested in recovering missing object of sort whether have lost wife lost cigar case old sharon be equally useful to have inbred capacity for reading riddle right way in case of mystery great small in short posse exactly analytical faculty to alluded just now have address at office if think worth while to try who can trust such man mr troy objected must be sure to deceive be entirely mistaken since be struck off roll old sharon have discovered that straight way be on whole best way even in man own interest consultation fee be guinea give signed estimate beforehand for supplementary expense may follow can tell be of course strictly between ourselves that authority at office took advice in government case puzzled police approached of course through person who be to be trusted to represent without betraying source from instruction be derived found old rascal advice well worth paying for be quite likely that may not succeed so well in case try police by mean if fail why there be sharon a last resort arrangement commended to mr troy professional caution went on to whitehall tried detective police at once adopted obvious conclusion to person of ordinary capacity conclusion that isabel be thief acting on conviction authority sent experienced woman from office to lady lydiard house to examine poor girl clothes ornament before be packed up sent after to aunt search led to nothing only object of value be discovered have be present from lady lydiard jeweler milliner bill be among paper found in desk not sign of secret extravagance in dress be to be seen anywhere defeated so far police proposed next to have isabel privately watched there might be prodigal lover somewhere in background with ruin staring in face unless must raise five hundred pound lady lydiard who have only consented to search under stress of persuasive argument from mr troy resented ingenious idea a insult declared that if isabel be watched girl must know of instantly from own lip police listened with perfect resignation decorum politely shifted ground certain suspicion remarked always rested in case of sort on servant must ladyship object to private inquiry into character proceeding of servant ladyship instantly objected in most positive term thereupon inspector asked for minute private conversation with mr troy thief be certainly member of lady lydiard household functionary remarked in politely positive way if ladyship persists in refusing to let make necessary inquiry hand be tied case come to end through fault of ours if ladyship change mind perhaps will drop line sir to that effect good morning so experiment of consulting police came to untimely end one result obtained be expression of purblind opinion by authority of detective department pointed to isabel to one of servant a undiscovered thief thinking matter over in retirement of own office not forgetting promise to isabel to leave mean untried of establishing innocence mr troy must see one alternative left to

lavinia hardyman be a person in society know married rather late in life to general drumblade be saying great deal be not saying too much to describe mr drumblade a most mischievous woman of age in england scandal be breath of life to place people in false position to divulge secret destroy character to undermine friendship aggravate enmity be source of enjoyment from dangerous woman drew inexhaustible fund of good spirit made brilliant light in social sphere be one of privileged sinner of modern society worst mischief that must work be ascribed to exuberant vitality have that ready familiarity of manner be in class so rarely discovered to be insolence in disguise power of easy self assertion found people ready to accept on own term wherever went be one of big overpowering woman with blunt manner voluble tongue goggle eye who carry everything before highest society modestly considered in danger of being dull in absence of mr drumblade even hardyman who saw a little of a possible whose frankly straightforward nature recoiled by instinct from contact with sister must think of fitter person to make miss pink reception agreeable to while be devoting own attention to niece mr drumblade accepted position thus offered with most amiable readiness in own private mind placed interpretation on brother motif did grossest injustice believed that hardyman design on isabel contemplated most profligate result to assist purpose while girl nearest relative be supposed to be taking care of be mr drumblade idea of fun worst enemy admitted that honorable lavinia have

before horse have be passed under review hardyman isabel be out of sight mr drumblade miss pink be lost in intricacy of stable excessively stupid of have better go back establish comfortably in parlor
