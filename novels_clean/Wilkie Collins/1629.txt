confused innocent indifference tried patience sorely memory went back to past time recalled ill placed passion of youth cruel injury inflicted on pride be roused be making ridiculous vehement throbbing of heart almost suffocated there sat wondering at odd behavior even girl be a cold blooded a rest of sex that angry thought gave back self control made excuse with easy politeness of man of world beg pardon miss emily be considering how to put what have to say in fewest plainest word let try if can do if mr rook have merely asked whether father mother be living must have attributed question to commonplace curiosity of gossiping woman have thought more of actually did say be 'perhaps can tell if miss emily father ' there checked suddenly altered question in way miss emily parent be living ' may be making mountain out of molehill thought at time think still that have special interest in inquiring after father not wishing to notice for reason of own changed form of question so

guilty of presumption if offer to be of small service to one of pupil there embarrassment mastered despised not only for yielding to own weakness for faltering like fool in expression of simple request next word died away on lip time emily understood subtle penetration have long since led to discovery of secret overpowered thus far by absorbing interest of moment now recovered activity in instant remembered that alban motive for cautioning in coming intercourse with mr rook be not merely friendly motive might have actuated in case of one of other girl at same time quickness of apprehension warned not to risk encouraging persistent lover by betraying embarrassment on side be evidently anxious to be present in interest at interview with mr rook why not must reproach with

of people in time know human nature help with word of advice emily forgot that be in love with forgot everything effect produced by locket on mr rook vaguely alarming conclusion to pointed in fervor of anxiety took alban arm a familiarly a if have be brother be gentle be considerate tried earnestly to compose can hing to good purpose said unless begin by thinking quietly pardon for saying so be needlessly exciting there be reason for excitement of be necessarily ignorant memory of night interview with miss jethro have inevitably intensified suspicion inspired by conduct of mr rook in le than twenty four hour emily have seen two woman shrinking from secret remembrance of father might well be guilty remembrance innocently excited by how have injured of what infamy on part did beloved stainless memory remind who must fathom mystery of doe mean cried looking wildly in alban compassionate face must have formed idea of own what doe mean come sit down miss emily will try if can find out what mean together returned to shady solitude under tree away in front of house distant grating of carriage wheel told of arrival of miss ladd guest of speedy beginning of ceremony of day must help other alban resumed when first spoke of mr rook mentioned miss cecilia wyvil a person who knew something about have objection to tell what may have heard in way in complying with request emily necessarily repeated what cecilia have told francine when two girl have met that morning in garden alban now knew how emily have obtained employment a sir jervis secretary how mr mr rook have be previously known to cecilia father a respectable people keeping inn in own neighborhood finally how have be obliged to begin life again in domestic service because terrible event of murder have given inn bad name have driven away customer on whose encouragement business depended listening in silence alban remained silent when emily narrative have come to end have nothing to say to asked be thinking over what have just heard answered emily noticed certain formality in tone manner disagreeably surprised seemed to have made reply a mere concession to politeness while be thinking of something else really interested have disappointed in way asked on contrary have interested want to be quite sure that remember exactly what have said mentioned think that friendship with miss cecilia began here at school yes in speaking of murder at village inn told that crime be committed have forgotten how long ago manner still suggested that be idly talking about what have told while more important subject for reflection be in possession of mind know said anything about time have passed since crime be committed answered sharply what doe murder matter to think cecilia told happened about four year since excuse for noticing mr morris seem to have interest of own to occupy attention why must say so plainly when came out here must not have asked to help in case since poor father death have be used to fight through trouble by rose looked at proudly next moment eye filled with tear in spite of resistance alban took hand dear miss emily said distress have not done justice interest only be in mind answering in term have not spoken a frankly a usual have only told part of truth hearing that woman whom have just left have be landlady of inn that murder have be committed under roof be led to ask if explanation might be found in circumstance of otherwise incomprehensible effect produced on mr rook by inscription on locket in pursuit of inquiry there have arisen in mind monstrous suspicion pointed to mr rook impelled to ascertain date at murder have be committed if discovery encouraged further investigation to find out next manner in mr brown have died thus far what progress have made have discovered that date of mr brown death inscribed on locket date of crime committed at inn approached other nearly enough to justify further investigation in meantime have succeeded in keeping object concealed from emily have perfectly succeeded hearing declare that interest only have occupied mind poor girl innocently entreated to forgive little outbreak of temper if have more question to ask mr morris pray go on promise never to think unjustly of again went on with uneasy conscience for seemed cruel to deceive even in interest of truth still went on suppose assume that woman have injured father in way said be right in believing that be in character to forgive injury entirely right in case death may have left mr rook in position to be called to account by who owe duty to memory mean surviving member of family there be two of mr morris aunt there be executor aunt be only executor father sister presume yes may have left instruction with might be of greatest use to will write to day find out emily replied have already planned to consult aunt added thinking again of miss jethro if aunt have not received positive instruction alban continued may

house yes in own house word closed alban lip investigation so carefully so delicately conducted have failed to serve useful purpose have now ascertained manner of mr brown death place of mr brown death be a far from confirming suspicion of mr rook a ever chapter xi drawing master confession be there nothing else can suggest emily asked nothing at present if aunt fails have other hope have hope in mr rook alban answered see surprise really mean what say sir jervis housekeeper be excitable woman be fond of wine there be always weak side in character of such person a if wait for chance turn to right use when come may yet succeed in making betray emily listened to in bewilderment talk a if be sure of help in future said have forgotten leave school to day never to return in hour more will be condemned to long journey in company of horrible creature with life to look forward to in same house with among stranger miserable prospect hard trial of girl courage be not mr morris will at least

disgraced teacher to other woman waited eagerly to hear more there be nothing to be heard at most interesting moment silence remained undisturbed in fervor of anxiety to set doubt at rest emily faith in own good resolution began to waver temptation to say something might set aunt talking again be too strong to be resisted if remained at bedside despairing of herself rose turned to door in moment passed while crossed room very word occurred to must suit purpose cheek be hot with shame hesitated looked back at bed word passed lip sara be only one of woman name said do like other name rapidly

regretfully alluded to time emily held firmly by resolution bound to respect helpless position of aunt speediest way of summoning mr ellmother must be to ring bell a touched handle faint cry of suffering from bed called back oh so thirsty murmured failing voice so thirsty parted curtain shrouded lamplight just showed green shade over miss letitia eye hollow cheek below arm laid helplessly on bed clothes oh aunt know voice know emily let kiss dear useless to plead with useless to kiss only reiterated word so thirsty so thirsty emily raised poor tortured body with patient caution spared pain put glass to aunt lip drank lemonade to last drop refreshed for moment spoke again spoke to visionary servant of delirious fancy while rested in emily arm for god sake take care how answer if question if knew what know be men ever ashamed have vile woman vile woman voice sinking gradually dropped to whisper next few word escaped be muttered inarticulately little by little false energy of fever be wearing out lay silent still to look at now be to look at image of death once more emily kissed closed curtain rang bell mr ellmother failed to appear emily left room to call arrived at top of kitchen stair noted slight change door below have heard banged on first entering aunt room now stood open called to mr ellmother strange voice answered accent be soft courteous presenting strongest imaginable contrast to harsh tone of miss letitia crabbed old maid be there anything can do for miss person making polite inquiry appeared at foot of stair plump comely woman of middle age looked up at young lady with pleasant smile beg pardon emily said have intention of disturbing called to mr ellmother stranger advanced little way up stair answered mr ellmother be not here do expect back soon excuse miss expect back at do mean to say that have left house yes miss have left house chapter xiv mr mosey emily first act after discovery of mr ellmother incomprehensible disappearance be to invite new servant to follow into sitting room can explain began miss may ask if have come here by mr ellmother invitation by mr ellmother request miss can tell how came to make request with pleasure miss perhaps a find here stranger to yourself in place of customary servant ought to begin by giving reference perhaps if will be so kind by mentioning name emily added thank for reminding miss name be elizabeth mosey be well known to gentleman who attends miss letitia dr allday will speak to character also to experience a nurse if must be in way satisfactory to give second reference quite needle mr mosey permit to thank again miss be at home evening when mr ellmother called at lodging say ' have come here elizabeth to ask favor of for old friendship sake ' say bey dear pray command whatever may be ' if seems rather hasty answer to make before knew what favor be might ask to bear in mind that mr ellmother put to 'for old friendship sake ' alluding to late husband to business carried on at time through fault of ours got into difficulty person whom have trusted proved unworthy not to trouble further may say at once must have be ruined if old friend mr ellmother have not come forward trusted with saving of lifetime money be paid back again before husband death consider think wo consider that obligation be paid back too prudent not prudent there be nothing mr ellmother can ask of that be not willing to do if have put in awkward situation deny that look so be only excuse miss that can make for conduct mr mosey be too fluent too fond of hearing sound of own eminently persuasive voice making allowance for little drawback impression that produced be decidedly favorable however rashly might have acted motive be beyond reproach having said kind word to effect emily led back to main interest of narrative did mr ellmother give reason for leaving aunt at time a asked very word said to miss what did say by way of reply burst out cry thing have never known to do before in experience of twenty year really asked to take place here at moment notice be just what did mr mosey answered have need to tell be astonished lip spoke for doubt be hard woman in speech manner admit there be more feeling in than must suppose 'if be good friend take for ' say ' ask for reason be doing what be forced on doing with heavy heart ' in place miss must have insisted on explaining after that one thing naturally wanted to know be if must speak to lady in position of mistress here before ventured to intrude mr ellmother understood that be duty to help in particular poor aunt being out of question mentioned how did speak of in angry way indeed quite contrary say 'you will find miss emily at cottage be miss letitia niece everybody like everybody be right ' really said that be word what be more gave message for at parting 'if miss emily be surprised ' be how put 'give duty good wish tell to remember what said when took place at aunt bedside ' presume to inquire what mean said mr mosey respectfully ready to hear what meant if emily must only be so good a to tell deliver message miss a be delivered to after mr ellmother went way went mine do know where went miss have nothing more to tell nothing more except that gave direction of course about nursing took down in writing will find in proper place with prescription medicine acting at once on hint emily led way to aunt room miss letitia be silent when new nurse softly parted curtain looked in drew together again consulting watch mr mosey compared written direction with medicine bottle on table set one apart to be used at appointed time nothing so far to alarm whispered look sadly pale tired miss might advise to rest little if there be change mr mosey for better worse of course will let know certainly miss emily returned to sitting room not to rest after that have heard to think amid much that be unintelligible certain plain conclusion presented to mind after what doctor have already said to emily on subject of delirium generally mr ellmother proceeding became intelligible proved that knew by experience perilous course taken by mistress wandering thought when expressed in word explained concealment of miss letitia illness from niece a well a reiterated effort of old servant to prevent emily from entering bedroom event have just happened be to say mr be sudden departure from cottage be not only of serious importance in pointed to startling conclusion faithful maid have left mistress whom have loved served sinking under fatal illness have put woman in place careless of what woman might discover by listening at bedside rather than confront emily after have be within hearing of aunt while brain of suffering woman be deranged by fever there be state of case in plain word in what frame of mind have mr ellmother adopted desperate course of action to use own expression have deserted miss letitia with heavy heart to judge by own language addressed to mr mosey have left emily to mercy of stranger animated nevertheless by sincere feeling of attachment respect that fear have taken for granted suspicion emily have not felt discovery emily have a yet not made in way modified serious nature of inference conduct justified disclosure woman dreaded who must doubt now directly threatened emily peace of mind there be disguising innocent niece be associated with act of deception have be until day undetected secret of aunt aunt maid in conclusion in only be to be found rational explanation of mr ellmother choice placed between alternative of submitting to discovery by emily of leaving house poor miss letitia writing table stood near window of sitting room shrinking from further pursuit of thought might end in disposing mind to distrust of dying aunt emily looked round in search of employment sufficiently interesting to absorb attention writing table reminded that owed letter to cecilia helpful friend have surely first claim to know why have failed to keep engagement with sir jervis redwood after mentioning telegram have followed mr rook arrival at school emily letter proceeded in term a soon a have in degree recovered informed mr rook of aunt serious illness although carefully confined to commonplace expression of sympathy must see that be equally relief to of to feel that be prevented from being traveling companion suppose have taken capricious dislike to mr rook that be in way to blame for unfavorable impression have produced on will make plain when meet in meanwhile need only tell gave letter of explanation to present to sir jervis redwood also informed of address in london adding request that must forward letter in case have written to before receive line kind mr alban morris accompanied to railway station arranged with guard to take special care of on

nurse at door chapter xv emily may say word mr mosey inquired entered room pale trembling seeing that ominous change emily dropped back into chair dead said faintly mr mosey looked at in vacant surprise wish to say miss that aunt have frightened even that vague allusion be enough for emily need say more replied know too well how aunt mind be affected by fever confused frightened a be mr mosey still found relief in customary flow of word many many person have nursed in fever announced many many person have heard say strange thing never yet miss in experience tell of emily interposed oh must tell in own interest miss emily in own interest wo be inhuman enough to leave alone in house to night if delirium go on must ask to get nurse shocking suspicion be lying in wait for in bedroom

'if miss emily asks question know nothing about if be frightened know nothing about if burst into fit of cry be dreadful to see pity poor thing take notice very well sound like speaking out doe nothing of sort mr ellmother warns to expect other there be one horrid thing heard mind over over again at aunt bedside that doe not prepare for horrid thing be murder at last word mr mosey dropped voice to whisper waited to see what effect have produced sorely tried already by cruel perplexity of position emily courage failed to resist first sensation of horror aroused in by climax of nurse hysterical narrative encouraged by silence mr mosey went on lifted one hand with theatrical solemnity luxuriously terrified with own horror inn miss emily lonely inn somewhere in country comfortless room at inn with makeshift bed at one end of makeshift bed at other give word of honor be how aunt put spoke of two men next two men asleep understand in two bed think called 'gentlemen ca be sure must deceive know must deceive for world miss letitia muttered mumbled poor soul own be getting tired of listening when burst out plain again in one horrid word oh miss be impatient interrupt emily did interrupt nevertheless in degree at least have recovered more of said wo hear word more mr mosey be too resolutely bent on asserting own importance by making most of alarm that have suffered to be repressed by ordinary method of remonstrance without paying slightest attention to what emily have said went on again more loudly more excitably than ever listen miss listen dreadful part of be to come have heard about two gentleman yet one of be murdered what do think of other heard aunt say in so many word committed crime did miss letitia fancy be addressing lot of people when be nursing called out like person making public proclamation when be in room 'whoever be good people say ' hundred pound reward if find runaway murderer search everywhere for poor weak womanish creature with

helpless young lady be anticipation how have be fulfilled have be treated like mad woman in state of revolt how dare assault asked piteously ought to be ashamed of god know meant well be not first person emily answered quietly releasing who have done wrong with best intention did duty miss when told what aunt said forgot duty when listened to what aunt said allow to explain not word more on subject will pas between remain here if please have something to suggest in own interest wait compose purpose have taken foremost place in emily mind rested on firm foundation of love pity for aunt now that have regained power to think felt hateful doubt pressed on by mr mosey disclosure having taken for granted that there be foundation in truth for what have heard in aunt room must reasonably resist conclusion that there must be foundation in truth for what mr mosey have heard under similar circumstance there be one way of escaping from dilemma emily deliberately took turned back on own conviction persuaded that have be in wrong when have attached importance to anything that aunt have said under influence of delirium having adopted conclusion resolved to face prospect of night solitude by death bed rather than permit mr mosey to have second opportunity of drawing own inference from what might hear in miss letitia room do mean to keep waiting much longer miss not moment
