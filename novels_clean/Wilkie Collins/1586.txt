ca argue with sir patrick yourselves said want to do one two three chorus answered yes wo do one two three chorus asked why because answered geoffrey be wrong sir patrick right not astonishment only downright stupefaction struck deputation from garden speechless without saying word more to of person standing near geoffrey walked straight up to sir patrick arm chair personally addressed satellite

be something not only in shamelessness of declaration in fierce pleasure that speaker seemed to feel in making struck circle of listener sir patrick included with momentary chill in midst of silence sixth guest appeared on lawn stepped into library silent resolute unassuming elderly man who have arrived day before on visit to windygates who be well known in out of london a one of first consulting surgeon of time discussion going on asked be in way there be discussion be agreed cried geoffrey answering boisterously for rest more merrier sir after glance at surgeon suddenly checked on point of advancing to inner part of room remained standing at window beg pardon said sir patrick addressing to geoffrey with grave dignity be quite new in arnold experience of be not agreed decline mr delamayn to allow to connect with expression of feeling on part a have just heard language have used leaf alternative to meet statement of what suppose to have said by statement of what really did say be not fault if discussion in garden be revived before audience in room be looked a spoke to arnold blanche from to surgeon standing at window surgeon have found occupation for completely isolated among rest of guest keeping own face in shadow be studying geoffrey face in full flood of light fell on with steady attention must have be generally remarked if eye have not be turned toward sir patrick at time be not easy face to investigate at moment while sir patrick have be speaking geoffrey have seated near window doggedly impenetrable to reproof of be object in impatience to consult one authority competent to decide question of arnold position toward anne have sided with sir patrick a mean of ridding of unwelcome presence of friend have defeated own purpose thanks to own brutish incapability of bridling in pursuit of whether be now discouraged under circumstance whether be simply resigned to bide time till time came be impossible judging by outward appearance to say with heavy dropping at corner of mouth with stolid indifference staring dull in eye there sat man forearmed in own obstinate neutrality against temptation to engage in conflict of opinion be to come sir patrick took up newspaper have brought in from garden looked once more to see if surgeon be attending to no surgeon attention be absorbed in own subject there be in same position with mind still hard at work on something in geoffrey at once interested puzzled that man be thinking to have come here morning after traveling from london night doe ordinary fatigue explain what see in face little discussion in garden resumed sir patrick answering blanche inquiring look a bent over began dear in paragraph here announcing mr delamayn forthcoming appearance in foot race in neighborhood of london hold very unpopular opinion a to athletic display be so much in vogue in england just now be possible that may have expressed opinion little too strongly in heat of discussion with gentleman who be opposed to doubt conscientiously opposed on question low groan of protest rose from one two three in return for little compliment sir patrick have paid to how about rowing running ending in old bailey gallows said that sir know did two choral gentleman looked at other agreed with prevalent sentiment came to think smith yes jones certainly came to that only two men who still cared nothing about be geoffrey surgeon there sat first stolidly neutral indifferent alike to attack defense there stood second pursuing investigation with growing interest in of man who be beginning to see way to end hear defense gentleman continued sir patrick a courteously a ever belong remember to nation especially claim to practice rule of fair play must beg to remind of what said in garden started with concession admitted a person of smallest sense must admit that man will in great majority of case be fitter for mental exercise if wisely combine physical exercise along with whole question between two be question of proportion degree complaint of present time be that present time doe see popular opinion in england seems to to be not only getting to consider cultivation of muscle a of equal importance with cultivation of mind to be actually extending in practice if not in theory to absurd dangerous length of putting bodily training in first place of importance mental training in second to take case in point can discover enthusiasm in nation thing like so genuine thing like so general a enthusiasm excited by university boat race again see athletic education of yours made matter of public celebration in school college ask unprejudiced witness to tell excites most popular enthusiasm get most prominent place in public journal exhibition indoors on prize day of what boy can do with mind exhibition out of door on sport day of what boy can do with body know perfectly well performance excites loudest cheer occupies prominent place in newspaper a necessary consequence confers highest social honor on hero of day murmur from one two three have nothing to say to sir have own way so far ratification of agreement with prevalent opinion between smith jones very good pursued sir patrick be of one mind a to way public feeling set if be feeling to be respected encouraged show national advantage have resulted from where be influence of modern outburst of manly enthusiasm on serious concern of life how have improved character of people at large be of individually readier than ever be to sacrifice own little private interest to public good be dealing with serious social question of time in conspicuously determined downright definite way be becoming visibly indisputably purer people in code of commercial moral be there healthier higher tone in public amusement faithfully reflect in country public taste produce affirmative answer to question rest on solid proof will accept present mania for athletic sport a something better than outbreak of insular boastfulness insular barbarity in new form question question in general cry from one two three question question in meek reverberation from smith jones be question rejoined sir patrick admit existence of public feeling ask what good doe do what harm doe do from one two three hear hear from smith jones be fair challenge replied sir patrick be bound to meet on new ground wo point gentleman by way of answer to coarseness can see growing on national manner to deterioration appears to to be spreading more more widely in national taste may tell with perfect truth that be too old man to be fair judge of manner taste have got beyond standard will try issue a now stand between on abstract merit only assert that state of public feeling doe practically place physical training in estimation above moral mental training be positively bad dangerous state of feeling in that encourages inbred reluctance in humanity to submit to demand moral mental cultivation must inevitably make on be a boy naturally most ready to do to try how high can jump to try how much can learn training come easiest to a young man training teach to handle oar training teach to return good for evil to love neighbor a myself of two experiment of two training ought society in england to meet with warmest encouragement doe society in england practically encourage a matter of fact what did say just now from one two three remarkably well put from smith jones said admitted sir patrick that man will go better to book for healthy physical exercise say again provided physical exercise be restrained within fit limit when public feeling enters into question directly exalts bodily exercise above book then say public feeling be in dangerous extreme bodily exercise in case will be uppermost in youth thought will have strongest hold on interest will take lion share of time will by mean barring few purely exceptional instance slowly surely end in leaving to good moral mental purpose certainly uncultivated possibly dangerous man cry from camp of adversary be got to at last man who lead out of door life us strength that god have given to be dangerous man did body ever hear like of cry reverberated with variation by two human echo nobody ever heard like of clear mind of cant gentleman answered sir patrick agricultural laborer lead out of door life us strength that god have given to sailor in merchant service doe name be uncultivated shamefully uncultivated class see result look at map of crime will find most hideous offense in calendar committed not in town where average man doe lead out of door life doe a rule use strength be a rule comparatively cultivated not in town in agricultural district a for english sailor except when royal navy catch cultivates ask brinkworth who have served in merchant navy what sort of specimen of moral influence of out of door life muscular cultivation be in nine case out of ten said arnold be a idle vicious a ruffian a walk earth cry from opposition be agricultural laborer be sailor in merchant service smart reverberation from human echo smith be laborer jones be sailor pray let not be personal gentleman said sir patrick be speaking generally can only meet extreme objection by pushing argument to extreme limit laborer sailor have served purpose if laborer sailor offend by mean let walk off stage hold to position advanced just now man may be well born well off well dressed well fed if be uncultivated man be in spite of advantage man with special capacity for evil in on very account mistake be far from saving that present rage for exclusively muscular accomplishment must lead inevitably downward to lowest deep of depravity fortunately for society special depravity be more le certainly result in first instance of special temptation ordinary mass of thank god pas through life without being exposed to other than ordinary temptation thousand of young gentleman devoted to favorite pursuit of present time will get through existence with worse consequence to than coarse tone of mind manner lamentable incapability of feeling of higher gentler influence sweeten purify life of more cultivated men take other case may occur to body case of special temptation trying modern young man of prosperous class of mine let beg mr delamayn to honor with attention what have now to say because refers to opinion did really express a distinguished from opinion affect to agree with never advanced geoffrey indifference showed sign of giving way go on said still sat looking straight before with heavy eye noticed nothing expressed nothing take example have now in view pursued sir patrick example of average young gentleman of time blest with advantage physical cultivation can bestow on let man be tried by temptation insidiously call into action in own interest savage instinct latent in humanity instinct of self seeking cruelty be at bottom of crime let man be placed toward other person guiltless of injuring in position demand one of two sacrifice sacrifice of other person sacrifice of own interest own desire neighbor happiness neighbor life stand let say between attainment of something that want can wreck happiness strike down life without to knowledge fear of suffering for what be to prevent being man be from going straight to end on condition will skill in rowing swiftness in running admirable capacity endurance in other physical exercise have attained by strenuous cultivation in kind have excluded similarly strenuous cultivation in other kind will physical attainment help to win purely moral victory over own selfishness own cruelty wo even help to see that be selfishness that be cruelty essential principle of rowing racing harmless principle enough if can be sure of applying to rowing racing only have taught to take advantage of man that superior strength superior cunning can suggest there have be nothing in training to soften barbarous hardness in heart to enlighten barbarous darkness in mind temptation find man defenseless when temptation pass way care who be how high stand accidentally in social scale be to moral intent purpose animal nothing more if happiness stand in way if can do with impunity to will trample down happiness if life happens to be next obstacle encounter if can do with impunity to will trample down life not mr delamayn in character of victim to irresistible fatality to blind chance in character of man who have sown seed reaps harvest that sir be case put a extreme case only when discussion began a extreme case only a perfectly possible case at same time restate now before advocate of other side of question must open lip to reply geoffrey suddenly flung off indifference started to foot stop cried threatening others in fierce impatience to answer for with clenched fist there be general silence geoffrey turned looked at sir patrick a if sir patrick have personally insulted who be anonymous man who find way to own end pity nobody stick at nothing asked give name be quoting example said sir patrick be not attacking man what right have cried geoffrey utterly forgetful in strange exasperation have seized on of interest that have in controlling before sir patrick what right have to pick out example of rowing man who be infernal scoundrel when be quite a likely that rowing man may be good fellow ay better fellow if come to than ever stood in shoe if one case be quite a likely to occur a other readily admit answered sir patrick have surely right to choose case please for illustration wait mr delamayn be last word have to say mean to say have taken example not of specially depraved man a erroneously suppose of average man with average share of mean cruel dangerous quality be part parcel of unreformed human nature a religion tell a may see for if choose to look at untaught fellow creature where suppose man to be tried by temptation to wickedness out of common show to best of ability how completely moral mental neglect of present material tone of public feeling in england have tacitly encouraged leaf at mercy of worst instinct in nature how surely under condition must go down gentleman a be step by step a lowest vagabond in street go down under special temptation from beginning in ignorance to end in crime if deny right to take such example a in illustration of view advocate must either deny that special temptation to wickedness can assail man in position of gentleman must assert that gentleman who be naturally superior to temptation be only gentleman who devote to athletic pursuit there be defense in stating case have spoken out of own sincere respect for interest of virtue of learning out of own sincere admiration for young men among who be resisting contagion of barbarism about in future be future hope of england have done angrily ready with violent personal reply geoffrey found checked in turn by person with something to say with resolution to say at particular moment for little time past surgeon have discontinued steady investigation of geoffrey face have given attention to discussion with air of man whose self imposed task have come to end a last sentence fell from last speaker lip interposed so quickly so skillfully between geoffrey sir patrick geoffrey be taken by surprise there be something still wanting to make sir patrick statement of case complete said think can supply from result of own professional experience before say have to say mr delamayn will perhaps excuse if venture on giving caution to control be going to make dead set at too inquired geoffrey be recommending to keep temper nothing more there be plenty of men who can fly into passion without doing particular harm be not one of do mean think state of health mr delamayn be quite so satisfactory a may be disposed to consider geoffrey turned to admirer adherent with roar of derisive laughter admirer adherent echoed together arnold blanche smiled at other even sir patrick looked a if must hardly credit evidence of own ear there stood modern hercules self vindicated a hercules before eye that looked at there opposite stood man whom must have killed with one blow of fist telling in serious earnest that be not in perfect health be rare fellow said geoffrey half in jest half in anger what be matter with have undertaken to give what believe to be necessary caution answered surgeon have not undertaken to tell what think be matter with may be question for consideration little time hence in meanwhile must like to put impression about to test have objection to answer question on matter of particular importance relating to yourself let hear question first have noticed something in behavior while sir patrick be speaking be a much interested in opposing view a of gentleman about understand sitting in silence leaving entirely to others to put case on side until sir patrick said something happened to irritate have time before answer ready in own mind have a good answer in mind a have be made here to day yet did give did give perhaps felt though knew objection to be good one that be hardly worth while to take trouble of putting into word in short let friend answer for rather than make effort of answering for geoffrey looked at medical adviser with sudden curiosity sudden distrust say asked how do come to know what be going on in mind without telling of be business to find out what be going on in people body to do that be sometimes necessary for to find out if can what be going on in mind if have rightly interpreted what be going on in mind there be need for to press question have answered already turned to sir patrick next there be side to subject said have not touched on yet there be physical objection to present rage for muscular exercise of sort be quite a strong in way a moral objection have stated consequence a may affect mind can state consequence a do affect body from own experience from own experience can tell a medical man that proportion not by mean small one of young men who be now putting to violent athletic test of strength endurance be taking that course to serious permanent injury of own health public who attend rowing match foot race other exhibition of sort see nothing successful result of muscular training father mother at home see failure there be household in england miserable household to be counted sir patrick by more than one two in there be young men who have to thank strain laid on constitution by popular physical display of present time for being broken men invalided men for rest of life do hear that said sir patrick looking at geoffrey geoffrey carelessly nodded head irritation have have time to subside stolid indifference have got possession of again have resumed chair sat with outstretched leg staring stupidly at pattern on carpet what doe matter to be sentiment expressed over from head to foot surgeon went on can see remedy for sad state of thing said a long a public feeling remains what public feeling be now fine healthy looking young man with superb muscular development longs naturally enough to distinguish like others training authority at college elsewhere take in hand naturally enough again on strength of outward appearance whether have be right wrong in choosing be more than can say until experiment have be tried mischief have be in many case irretrievably done how many of be aware of important physiological truth that muscular power of man be fair guarantee of vital power how many of know that have a great french writer put two life in surface life of muscle inner life of heart lung brain even if did know even with medical men to help must be in last degree doubtful in most case whether previous examination must result in reliable discovery of vital fitness of man to undergo stress of muscular exertion laid on apply to of brother will tell a result of own professional observation be in sense overstating serious evil exaggerating deplorable dangerous consequence to lead have patient at moment who be young man of twenty who posse one of finest muscular development ever saw in life if young man have consulted before followed example of other young men about can not honestly say

painter a model for samson only last week saw swoon away like young girl in mother arm name cried geoffrey admirer still fighting battle on side in absence of encouragement from geoffrey be not in habit of mentioning patient name replied surgeon if insist on producing example of man broken by athletic exercise can do do who be know perfectly well be in doctor hand not yet where be there in pause of breathless silence with eye of person in room eagerly fastened on surgeon lifted hand pointed to geoffrey delamayn chapter twentieth touching a soon a general stupefaction be allayed general incredulity asserted a matter of course man who first declared that seeing be believing laid finger whether knew not on one of fundamental folly of humanity easiest of evidence to receive be evidence requires other judgment to decide on than judgment of eye will be on account evidence humanity be most ready to credit a long a humanity last eye of body looked at geoffrey judgment of body decided on evidence there visible that surgeon must be wrong lady lundie disturbed over dinner invitation led general protest mr delamayn in broken health exclaimed appealing to better sense of eminent medical guest really now ca expect to believe that stung into action for second time by startling assertion of have be made subject geoffrey rose looked surgeon steadily insolently straight in face do mean

character bet bet hang sentiment drew arnold by arm out of ear shot of others say asked anxiously do think have set old fogy back up do mean sir patrick geoffrey nodded went on have put little matter to yet about marrying in scotland know suppose cut up rough with if try now eye wandered cunningly a put question to farther end of room surgeon be looking over port folio of print lady be still at work on note of invitation sir patrick be alone at book shelf immersed in volume have just taken down make apology suggested arnold sir patrick may be little irritable bitter be just man kind man say be not guilty of intentional disrespect toward will say enough right sir patrick deep in old venetian edition of decameron found suddenly recalled from medieval italy to modern england by le person than geoffrey delamayn what do want asked coldly want to make apology said geoffrey let by gones be by gones sort of thing be guilty of intentional disrespect toward forgive forget not bad motto sir

may have said too sharply on side let by mean forget rest having met advance made to in term paused expecting geoffrey to leave free to return to decameron to unutterable astonishment geoffrey suddenly stooped over whispered in ear want word in private with sir patrick started back a if geoffrey have tried to bite beg pardon mr delamayn what did say must give word in private sir patrick put back decameron bowed in freezing silence confidence of honorable geoffrey delamayn be last confidence in world into desired to be drawn be secret of apology thought what can possibly want with be about friend of mine pursued geoffrey leading way toward one of window be in scrape friend be want to ask advice be strictly private know there came to full stop looked to see what impression have produced so far sir patrick declined by word gesture to exhibit slightest anxiety to hear word more must mind taking turn in garden asked geoffrey sir patrick pointed to lame foot have have allowance of walking morning said let infirmity excuse geoffrey looked about for substitute for garden led way back again toward one of convenient curtained recess opening out of inner wall of library will be private enough here said sir patrick made final effort to escape proposed conference undisguised effort time pray forgive mr delamayn be quite sure that apply to right person in applying to be scotch lawyer ai certainly understand about scotch marriage eh sir patrick manner suddenly altered be that subject wish to consult on asked be not be friend friend then yes be scrape with woman here in scotland friend know whether be married to not be at service mr delamayn to geoffrey relief by mean unmixed with surprise sir patrick not only showed further reluctance to be consulted by actually advanced to meet wish by leading way to recess be nearest to quick brain of old lawyer have put geoffrey application to for assistance blanche application to for assistance together have built own theory on basis thus obtained do see connection between present position of blanche governess present position of mr delamayn 'friend thought sir patrick stranger extreme than have met in experience something may come out of two strangely assorted companion seated one on side of little table in recess arnold other guest have idled out again on to lawn surgeon with print lady with invitation be safely absorbed in distant part of library conference between two men so trifling in appearance so terrible in destined influence not over anne future only over future of arnold blanche be to practical purpose conference with closed door now said sir patrick what be question question said geoffrey be whether friend be married to not did mean to marry no being single man being single woman at time in scotland yes very well now tell circumstance geoffrey hesitated art of stating circumstance implies cultivation of very rare gift gift of arranging idea one be better acquainted with truth than sir patrick be purposely puzzling geoffrey at starting under firm conviction that client have something to conceal from one process must be depended on for extracting truth under circumstance be process of interrogation if geoffrey be submitted to at outset cunning might take alarm sir patrick object be to make man invite interrogation geoffrey invited forthwith by attempting to state circumstance by involving in usual confusion sir patrick waited until have thoroughly lost thread of narrative then played for winning trick must be easier to if asked few question inquired innocently much easier be quite at service suppose clear ground to begin with be at liberty to mention name place date do want to be particular be a particular a can will do if say present year yes be friend lady at time in present year traveling together in scotland living together in scotland be doing together in scotland well be meeting other at inn oh be meeting other at inn be first at rendezvous woman be first stop bit be getting to now produced from pocket written memorandum of arnold proceeding at craig fernie have taken down from arnold own lip have got bit of note here went on perhaps 'd like to have look at sir patrick took note read rapidly through to then re read sentence by sentence to geoffrey using a text to speak from in making further inquiry asked for by name of wife at door read sir patrick meaning presume door of inn have lady previously given out a married woman to people of inn yes how long have be at inn before gentleman joined only hour so did give name ca be quite sure must say not did gentleman give name be certain did sir patrick returned to memorandum said at dinner before landlady waiter take room for wife made say be husband at same time ' be that done jocosely mr delamayn by lady gentleman be done in downright earnest mean be done to look like earnest so to deceive landlady waiter yes sir patrick returned to memorandum that stopped night ' stopped in room have taken for wife yes what happened next day went away wait bit said have business for excuse be to say kept up deception with people of inn left lady behind in character of wife be did go back to inn how long did lady stay there after have gone staid well staid few day friend have not seen since be friend lady english scotch english at time when met at inn have of arrived in scotland from place in be previously living within period of le than twenty one day geoffrey hesitated there must be difficulty in answering for anne lady lundie domestic circle have occupied windygates for much longer period than three week before date of lawn party question a affected arnold be only question required reflection after searching memory for detail of conversation have taken place between when arnold have met at lawn party geoffrey recalled certain reference on part of friend to performance at edinburgh theatre at once decided question of time arnold have be necessarily detained in edinburgh before arrival at windygates by legal business connected with inheritance like anne have certainly be in scotland before met at craig fernie for longer period than period of three week accordingly informed sir patrick that lady gentleman have be in scotland for more than twenty one day then added question on own behalf let hurry sir will soon have done will have done after two more question answered sir patrick be to understand that lady claim on strength of circumstance have mentioned to to be friend wife geoffrey made affirmative reply readiest mean of obtaining sir patrick opinion be in case to answer yes in other word to represent anne in character of lady a claiming to be married to arnold in character of friend having made concession to circumstance be at same time quite cunning enough to see that be of vital importance to purpose have in view to confine strictly to one perversion of truth there must be plainly depending on lawyer opinion unless opinion be given on fact exactly s have occurred at inn to fact have thus far carefully adhered to fact with one inevitable departure from have be just forced on determined to adhere to end did letter pas between lady gentleman pursued sir patrick none know of answered geoffrey steadily returning to truth have done mr delamayn well what be opinion before give opinion be bound to preface by personal statement be not to take if please a statement of law ask to decide on fact with have supplied whether friend be according to law of scotland married not geoffrey nodded be said eagerly experience mr delamayn be that single man in scotland may marry single woman at time under circumstance in short after thirty year practice a lawyer know what be not marriage in scotland in plain english said geoffrey mean be wife in spite of cunning in spite of self command eye brightened a said word tone in spoke though too carefully guarded to be tone of triumph be to fine ear unmistakably tone of relief look tone be lost on sir patrick first suspicion when sat down to conference have be obvious suspicion that in speaking of friend geoffrey be speaking of like lawyer habitually distrusted first impression own included object thus far have be to solve problem of geoffrey true position geoffrey real motive have set snare accordingly have caught bird be now plain to mind first that man who be consulting be in probability really speaking of case of person secondly that have interest of what nature be impossible yet to say in satisfying own mind that friend be by law of scotland indisputably married man having penetrated to extent secret geoffrey be concealing from abandoned hope of making further advance at present sitting next question to clear up in investigation be question of who anonymous lady might be next discovery to make be whether lady must must not be identified with anne silvester pending inevitable delay in reaching that result straight course be in sir patrick present state of uncertainty only course to follow in laying down law at once took question of marriage in hand with concealment whatever a to legal bearing of from client who be consulting rush to conclusion mr delamayn said have only told what general experience be thus far professional opinion on special case of friend have not be given yet geoffrey face clouded again sir patrick carefully noted new change in law of scotland went on so far a relates to irregular marriage be outrage on common decency common sense if think language in thus describing too strong can refer to language of judicial authority lord dea delivered recent judgment of marriage in scotland from bench in word make marriage form ceremony civil religious notice before publication after cohabitation no writing witness even be essential to constitution of most important contract two person can enter into there be scotch judge own statement of law that administers observe at same time if please that make full legal provision in scotland for contract affecting sale of house land horse dog only contract leave without safeguard precaution of sort be contract unites man woman for life a for authority of parent innocence of child law recognizes claim on in one case in other girl of twelve boy of fourteen have nothing to do to cross border to be married without interposition of slightest delay restraint without slightest attempt to inform parent on part of scotch law a to marriage of men woman even mere interchange of consent a have just heard make man wife be not required to be directly proved may be proved by inference more even than whatever law for consistency may presume men woman be in point of fact held to be married in scotland where consent have never be interchanged where party even know that be legally held to be married person be sufficiently confused about law of irregular marriage in scotland by time mr delamayn have said enough to justify strong language used when undertook to describe to who be 'authority ' talked of just now inquired geoffrey must ask might find flatly contradicted if did ask by authority equally learned equally eminent answered sir patrick be not joking be only stating fact have heard of queen commission no then listen to in march beixty five queen appointed commission to inquire into marriage law of united kingdom report of commission be published in london be accessible to body who chooses to pay price of two three shilling for one of result of inquiry be discovery high authority be of entirely contrary opinion on one of vital question of scottish marriage law commissioner in announcing that fact add that question of opinion be right be still disputed have never be made subject of legal decision authority be where at variance throughout report haze of doubt uncertainty hang in scotland over most important contract of civilized life if other reason existed for reforming scotch marriage law there must be reason enough afforded by one fact uncertain marriage law be national calamity can tell what think about friend case ca said geoffrey still holding obstinately to end that have in view certainly now that have given due warning of danger of implicitly relying on individual opinion may give opinion with clear conscience say that there have not be positive marriage in case there have be evidence in favor of possibly establishing marriage nothing more distinction here be far too fine to be appreciated by geoffrey mind frowned heavily in bewilderment disgust not married exclaimed when said be man wife before witness be common popular error said sir patrick a have already told witness be not legally necessary to make marriage in scotland be only valuable a in case to help at future time in proving marriage be in dispute geoffrey caught at last word landlady waiter might make out to be marriage then said yes remember if choose to apply to one of professional colleague might possibly tell be married already state of law allows interchange of matrimonial consent to be proved by inference leaf wide door open to conjecture friend refers to certain lady in so many word a wife lady refers to friend in so many word a husband in room have taken a man wife remain a man wife till next morning friend go away without undeceiving body lady stay at inn for day after in character of wife circumstance take place in

soft sandy ground looked at stick then suddenly pulled out of ground looked at arnold good afternoon said went on way again by arnold followed stopped for moment two men looked at other without word passing on side arnold spoke first be out of humor geoffrey what have upset in way have miss silvester missed other geoffrey be silent have seen since left windygates reply do know where miss

once roused be spirit not readily quelled geoffrey have roused at last when come to sens said will remember old time receive apology till do come to sens go way by have more to say to geoffrey set teeth came one step arnold eye met with look steadily firmly challenged though be stronger man of two to force quarrel step further if dared one human virtue geoffrey respected understood be virtue of courage there be before undeniable courage of weaker man callous scoundrel be touched on one tender place in whole being turned went on way in silence left by arnold head dropped on breast friend who have saved life one friend possessed who be associated with earliest happiest remembrance of old day have grossly insulted have left deliberately without slightest expression of regret arnold affectionate nature simple loyal clinging where once fastened be wounded to quick geoffrey fast retreating figure in open view before became blurred indistinct put hand over eye hid with boyish shame hot tear that told of heartache that honored man who shed be still struggling with emotion have overpowered when something happened at place where road met four road pointed a nearly a might be toward four point of compass arnold be now on road to eastward having advanced in direction to meet geoffrey between two three hundred yard from farm house inclosure before have kept watch road to westward curving away behind farm led to nearest market town road to south be way to station road to north led back to windygates house while geoffrey be still fifty yard from turning must take back to windygates while tear be still standing thickly in arnold eye gate of farm inclosure opened light four wheel chaise came out with man driving woman sitting by side woman be anne silvester man be owner of farm instead of taking way led to station chaise pursued westward road to market town proceeding in direction back of person in vehicle be necessarily turned on geoffrey advancing behind from

returned faithful to engagement have undertaken to post before inclosure chaise be then speck in distance in minute more be speck out of sight so to use sir patrick phrase have woman broken through difficulty must have stopped man so in sore need have anne silvester won sympathy have given place by farmer side in vehicle took on own business to market town so by hair breadth did escape treble risk of discovery threatened from geoffrey on way back from arnold at post from valet on watch for appearance at station afternoon wore on servant at windygates airing in ground in absence of mistress guest be disturbed for moment by unexpected return of one of gentlefolk mr geoffrey delamayn reappeared at house alone went straight to smoking room calling for supply of old ale settled in arm chair with newspaper began to smoke soon tired of reading fell into thinking of what have happened during latter part of walk prospect before have more than realized most sanguine anticipation that must have formed of have braced after what have happened in library to face outbreak of serious scandal on return to house here when came back be nothing to face here be three people sir patrick arnold blanche who must at least know anne be in serious trouble keeping secret a carefully a if felt that interest be at stake more wonderful still here be anne so far from raising hue cry after actually taking flight without saying word must compromise with living soul what in name of wonder did mean did best to find way to explanation of sort actually contrived to account for silence of blanche uncle arnold be pretty clear that must have three combined to keep lady lundie in ignorance of runaway governess return to house secret of anne silence completely baffled be simply incapable of conceiving that horror of seeing set up a obstacle to blanche marriage might have be vivid enough to overpower sense of own wrong to hurry away resolute in ignorance of what else to do never to return again never to let living eye rest on in character of arnold wife be clean beyond making out be final conclusion at geoffrey arrived if be interest to hold tongue be interest to hold mine there be end of for present put up foot on chair rested magnificent muscle after walk filled pipe in thorough contentment with interference to dread from anne more awkward question on term be on now to come from arnold looked back at quarrel on heath with certain complacency did friend justice though have disagreed who must have thought fellow have so much pluck in said to a struck match lit second pipe hour

morning for swanhaven lodge ninth scene music room chapter fortieth julius make mischief julius delamayn be alone idly sauntering to fro with violin in hand on terrace at swanhaven lodge first mellow light of evening be in sky be close of day on anne silvester have left perth hour earlier julius have sacrificed to duty of political position a made for by father have submitted to dire necessity of delivering oration to elector at public meeting in neighboring town of kirkandrew detestable atmosphere to breathe disorderly audience to address insolent opposition to conciliate imbecile inquiry to answer brutish interruption to endure greedy petitioner to pacify dirty hand to shake be stage by aspiring english gentleman be compelled to travel on journey lead from modest obscurity of private life to glorious publicity of house of common julius paid preliminary penalty of political first appearance a exacted by free institution with necessary patience returned to welcome shelter of home more indifferent if possible to attraction of parliamentary distinction than when set out discord of roaring people still echoing in ear have sharpened customary sensibility to poetry of sound a composed by mozart a interpreted by piano violin possessing of beloved instrument have gone out on terrace to cool in evening air pending arrival of servant whom have summoned by music room bell man appeared at glass door led into room reported in answer to master inquiry that mr julius delamayn be out paying visit be not expected to return for hour at least julius groaned in spirit finest music mozart have written for violin associate that instrument with piano without wife to help husband be mute after instant consideration julius hit on idea promised in degree to remedy disaster of mr delamayn absence from home have mr glenarm gone out too asked sir compliment if mr glenarm have nothing else to do will be so kind a to come to in music room servant went away with message julius seated on one of terrace bench began to tune violin mr glenarm rightly reported by bishopriggs a having privately taken refuge from anonymous correspondent at swanhaven lodge be musically speaking far from being efficient substitute for mr delamayn julius possessed in wife one of few player on piano forte under whose subtle touch that willow soulless instrument becomes inspired with expression not own produce music instead of noise fine organization can work miracle have not be bestowed on mr glenarm have be carefully taught be to be trusted to play correctly be julius hungry for music reigned to circumstance asked for more servant returned with answer mr glenarm must join mr delamayn in music room in ten minute time julius rose relieved resumed sauntering walk now playing little snatch of music now stopping to look at flower on terrace with eye enjoyed beauty hand fondled with caressing touch if imperial parliament have seen at moment imperial parliament must have given notice of question to illustrious father be possible lord that can have begotten member a after stopping for moment to tighten one of string of violin julius raising head from instrument be surprised to see lady approaching on terrace advancing to meet perceiving that be total stranger to assumed that be in probability visitor to wife have honor of speaking to friend of mr delamayn asked wife be not at home be sorry to say be stranger to mr delamayn lady answered servant informed that have gone out must find mr delamayn here julius bowed waited to hear more must beg to forgive intrusion stranger went on object be to ask permission to see lady who be have be informed guest in house extraordinary formality of request rather puzzled julius do mean mr glenarm asked yes pray think permission necessary friend of mr glenarm may take welcome for granted in house be not friend of mr glenarm be total stranger to made ceremonious request preferred by lady little more intelligible left lady object in wishing to speak to mr glenarm still in dark julius politely waited until pleased to proceed further explain explanation did not appear to be easy one to give eye dropped to ground hesitated painfully name if mention resumed without looking up may possibly inform paused color came went hesitated again struggled with agitation controlled be anne silvester said suddenly raising pale face suddenly steadying trembling voice julius started looked at in silent surprise name be doubly known to not long since have heard from father lip at father bedside lord holchester have charged have earnestly charged to bear name in mind to help woman who bore if woman ever applied to in time to come again have heard name more lately associated scandalously with name of brother on receipt of first of anonymous letter sent to mr glenarm have not only summoned geoffrey to refute aspersion cast upon have forwarded private copy of letter to relative at swanhaven geoffrey defense have not entirely satisfied julius that brother be free from blame a now looked at anne silvester doubt returned upon strengthened almost confirmed be woman so modest so gentle so simply unaffectedly refined shameless adventuress denounced by geoffrey a claiming on strength of foolish flirtation knowing at time to be privately married to man be woman with voice of lady look of lady manner of lady in league a geoffrey have declared with illiterate vagabond who be attempting to extort money anonymously from mr glenarm impossible making allowance for proverbial deceitfulness of appearance impossible name have be mentioned to said julius answering after momentary pause instinct a gentleman made shrink from referring to association of name with name of brother father mentioned added considerately explaining knowledge of in way when last saw in london father came step nearer with look of distrust a well a look of astonishment in face father be lord holchester be not yes what made speak of be ill at time julius answered have be thinking of event in past life with be entirely unacquainted said have known father mother desired if be ever in want of assistance to place service at disposal when expressed that wish spoke very earnestly gave impression that there be feeling of regret associated with recollection on have be dwelling slowly in silence anne drew back to low wall of terrace close by rested one hand on to support julius have said word of terrible import without suspicion of what have done never until now have anne silvester known that man who have betrayed be son of other man whose discovery of flaw in marriage have ended in betrayal of mother before felt shock of revelation with chill of superstitious dread be chain of fatality wound invisibly round turn way might be still going darkly on in track of dead mother to appointed hereditary doom present thing passed from view a awful doubt cast shadow over mind lived again for moment in time when be child saw face of mother once more with wan despair on of bygone day when title of wife be denied social prospect be closed forever julius approached roused can get thing asked be looking very ill hope have said nothing to distress question failed to attract attention put question instead of answering did say be quite ignorant of what father be thinking of when spoke to about quite ignorant be brother likely to know more about than do certainly not paused absorbed once more in own thought startled on memorable day when have first met by geoffrey family name have put question to whether there have not be acquaintance between parent in past time deceiving in else have not deceived in have spoken in good faith when have declared that have never heard father mother mentioned at home curiosity of julius be aroused attempted to lead on into saying more appear to know what father be thinking of when spoke to resumed may ask interrupted with gesture of entreaty pray ask be past over can have interest for have nothing to do with errand here must return went on hurriedly to object in trespassing on kindness have heard mentioned mr delamayn by member of family besides father julius have not anticipated that sh e must approach of own accord painful subject on have forborne to touch be little disappointed have expected more delicacy of feeling from than have shown be necessary asked coldly to enter on that blood rose again in anne cheek if have not be necessary answered do think must have forced to mention to let remind that be here on sufferance if speak plainly matter at what sacrifice to own feeling make situation more embarrassing than be already have something to tell mr glenarm relating to anonymous letter have lately received have word to say to next about contemplated marriage before allow to do ought to know who be have owned ought to have heard worst can be said of conduct face tell have heard worst after forbearance have shown to a perfect stranger will not commit meanness of taking by surprise perhaps mr delamayn understand now why felt obliged to refer to brother will trust with permission to speak to mr glenarm be simply modestly said with unaffected touching resignation of look manner julius gave back respect sympathy for moment have unjustly withheld from have placed confidence in said most person in situation must have withheld feel bound in return to place confidence in will take for granted that motive in matter be one be duty to respect will be for mr glenarm to say whether wish interview to take place not can do be to leave free to propose to be free a spoke sound of piano reached from music room julius pointed to glass door opened on to terrace have only to go in by door said will find mr glenarm alone anne bowed left arrived at short flight of step led up to door paused to collect thought before went in sudden reluctance to go on enter room took possession of a waited with foot on lower step report of mr glenarm contemplated marriage have produced such effect on a sir patrick have supposed have found no love for geoffrey left to wound latent jealousy only waiting to be inflamed object in taking journey to perth be completed when correspondence with geoffrey be in own hand again change of purpose have brought to swanhaven be due entirely to new view of position toward mr glenarm coarse commonsense of bishopriggs have first suggested to if failed to protest against mr glenarm marriage in interest of reparation geoffrey owed to conduct must only confirm geoffrey audacious assertion that be married woman already for own sake might still have hesitated to move in matter blanche interest be concerned a well a own for blanche sake have resolved on making journey to swanhaven lodge at same time feeling toward geoffrey a felt now conscious a be of not really desiring reparation on be about to insist be essential to preservation of own self respect that must have purpose in view must justify to own conscience in assuming character of mr glenarm rival have only to call to mind critical situation of blanche to see purpose before plainly assuming that must open coming interview by peaceably proving that claim on geoffrey be beyond dispute might then without fear of misconception take tone of friend instead of enemy might with best grace assure mr glenarm that have rivalry to dread on one easy condition that engaged to make geoffrey repair evil that have done marry without word against to dread from so long a unsays word undoes deed have thrown doubt on marriage of arnold blanche if must bring interview to end there be way found of extricating arnold by own exertion from false position in have innocently placed toward wife such be object before a now stood on brink of interview with mr glenarm up to moment have firmly believed in capacity to realize own visionary project be only when have foot on step that doubt of success of coming experiment crossed mind for first time saw weak point in own reasoning for first time felt how much have blindly taken for granted in assuming that mr glenarm must have sufficient sense of justice sufficient command of temper to hear patiently hope of success rested on own favorable estimate of woman who be total stranger to what if first word exchanged between proved estimate to be wrong be too late to pause reconsider position julius

resolution to animate opened glass door at top of step went into room mr glenarm rose from piano two woman one so richly other so plainly dressed one with beauty in full bloom other worn blighted one with society at foot other outcast living under bleak shadow of reproach two woman stood face to face exchanged cold courtesy of salute between stranger in silence first to meet trivial necessity of situation be mr glenarm good humoredly put end to embarrassment shy visitor appeared to feel acutely by speaking first be afraid servant have not told said mr delamayn have gone out beg pardon have not called to see mr delamayn mr glenarm looked little surprised went on however a amiably a before mr delamayn perhaps suggested expect here moment anne explained again have just parted from mr

be little hope of sympathy establishing between wished to speak to answered about something happened while be paying visit in neighborhood of perth dawning surprise in mr glenarm face became intensified into expression of distrust hearty manner vanished under veil of conventional civility drawn over suddenly looked at anne never at best of time beauty thought wretchedly out of health now

that real reason for bringing geof frey delamayn away from scotland when did be that trainer be uneasy wanted to be near london for medical advice doctor on being consulted owned that be at loss to understand symptom be asked to treat have fetched great surgeon to fulham that morning mr speedwell abstained from mentioning that have foreseen what must happen at windygates said be have met mr delamayn in society felt interest enough in case to pay visit with what result have seen ' did tell thing about delamayn health said that have questioned doctor on way to fulham that of patient symptom indicated serious mischief what symptom be did not hear mr speedwell only spoke of change for worse in woman must be likely to understand at one time must be so dull heedless that nothing must rouse at flew into most terrible passion without apparent cause trainer have found almost impossible in scotland to keep to right diet doctor have only sanctioned taking house at fulham after being first satisfied not only of convenience of garden also that hester dethridge must be thoroughly trusted a cook with help have placed on entirely new diet have found unexpected difficulty even in doing that when trainer took to new lodging turned out that have seen hester dethridge at windygates have taken strongest prejudice against on seeing again at fulham appeared to be absolutely terrified terrified why nobody know why trainer doctor together must only prevent leaving house by threatening to throw up responsibility of preparing for race unless instantly controlled behaved like man instead of child since time have become reconciled little by little to new abode partly through hester dethridge caution in keeping always out of way partly through own appreciation of change in diet hester skill in cookery have enabled doctor to make mr speedwell mentioned thing have forgotten can only repeat sir patrick result at have arrived in own mind coming from man of authority opinion seems to to be startling in last degree if geoffrey delamayn run in race on thursday next will do at risk of life at risk of dying on ground yes sir patrick face became thoughtful waited little before

wish to appear to avoid after answer that have sent to mother message returned slowly half way across front garden looked toward passage in be standing passed before door disappeared round corner of cottage on way to back garden inference be not to be mistaken be geoffrey who be avoiding have lied to sir patrick when next day came must find reason of own for refusing to take to holchester house went up stair at same moment hester dethridge opened bedroom door to come out observing anne closed again remained invisible in room once more inference be not to be mistaken hester dethridge also have reason for avoiding anne what did mean what object must there be in common between hester geoffrey there be fathoming meaning of anne thought reverted to communication have be secretly made to by blanche be not in womanhood to be insensible to such devotion a sir patrick conduct implied terrible a position have become in ever growing uncertainty in never ending suspense oppression of yielded for moment to glow of pride gratitude warmed heart a thought of sacrifice have be made of peril be still to be encountered solely for sake to shorten period of suspense seemed to be duty owed to sir patrick a well a to herself why in situation wait for what next day might bring forth if opportunity offered determined to put signal in window night toward evening heard once more noise appeared to indicate repair of sort be going on in house time sound be fainter came a fancied not from spare room a before from geoffrey room next to dinner be later than usual that day hester dethridge did not appear with tray till dusk anne spoke to received mute sign in answer determined to see woman face plainly put question required written answer on slate telling hester to wait went to mantle piece to light candle when turned round with lighted candle in hand hester be gone night came rang bell to have tray taken away fall of strange footstep startled outside door called out who be there voice of lad whom geoffrey employed to go on errand for answered what do want here asked through door mr delamayn sent up ma'be wish to speak to directly anne found geoffrey in dining room object in wishing to speak to be on surface of trivial enough wanted to know how must prefer going to holchester house on next day by railway in carriage if prefer driving said boy have come here for order can tell to send carriage from livery stable a go home railway will do perfectly well for anne replied instead of accepting answer dropping subject asked to reconsider decision there be absent uneasy expression in eye a begged not to consult economy at expense of own comfort appeared to have reason of own for preventing from leaving room sit d own minute think before decide said having forced to take chair put head outside door directed lad to go up stair see if have left pipe in bedroom want to go in comfort a lady must repeated with uneasy look more marked than ever before anne must reply lad voice reached from bedroom floor raised in shrill alarm screaming fire geoffrey ran up stair anne followed lad met at top of stair pointed to open door of anne room be absolutely certain of having left lighted candle when went down to geoffrey at safe distance from bed curtain bed curtain nevertheless be in blaze of fire there be supply of water to cottage on upper floor bedroom jug can usually in place at earlier hour be standing that night at cistern empty pail be left near directing lad to bring water from resource geoffrey tore down curtain in flaming heap partly on bed partly on sofa near using can pail alternately a boy brought drenched bed sofa be over in little more than minute cottage be saved bed furniture be destroyed room a matter of course be rendered uninhabitable for night at least probably for more night to come geoffrey set down empty pail turning to anne pointed across passage wo be much inconvenienced by said have only to shift quarter to spare room with assistance of lad moved anne box chest of drawer have escaped damage into opposite room done cautioned to be careful with candle for future went down stair without waiting to hear what said in reply lad followed be dismissed for night even in confusion attended extinguishing of fire conduct of hester dethridge have be remarkable enough to force on attention of anne have come out from bedroom when alarm be given have looked at flaming curtain have drawn back stolidly submissive into corner to wait event there have stood to appearance utterly indifferent to possible destruction of own cottage fire extinguished still waited impenetrably in corner while chest of drawer box be being moved then locked door without even passing glance at scorched ceiling burned bed furniture put key into pocket went back to room anne have hitherto not shared conviction felt by most other person who be brought into contact with hester dethridge that woman mind be deranged after what have just seen however general impression became impression too have thought of putting certain question to hester when be left together a to origin of fire reflection decided on saying nothing for night at least crossed passage entered spare room room have declined to occupy on arrival at cottage be obliged to sleep in now be instantly struck by change in disposition of furniture of room bed have be moved head set when have last seen against side wall of cottage be placed now against partition wall separated room from geoffrey room new arrangement have evidently be effected with settled purpose of sort hook in ceiling supported curtain bed unlike bed in other room having canopy attached to have be moved so a to adapt to change have be made chair washhand stand formerly placed against partition wall be now a matter of necessity shifted over to vacant space against side wall of cottage for rest other alteration be visible in part of room in anne situation event not immediately intelligible on face of be event to be distrusted be there motive for change in position of bed be by chance motive in be concerned doubt have barely occurred to before startling suspicion succeeded be there secret purpose to be answered by making sleep in spare room did question servant have heard geoffrey put to hester on previous night refer to have fire have so unaccountably caught curtain in own room be by possibility fire purposely kindled to force out dropped into nearest chair faint with horror a three question forced in rapid succession on mind after waiting little recovered possession enough to recognize first plain necessity of putting suspicion to test be possible that excited fancy have filled with purely visionary alarm for knew to contrary there might be undeniably sufficient reason for changing position of bed went out knocked at door of hester dethridge room want to speak to said hester came out anne pointed to spare room led way to hester followed why have changed place of bed asked from wall there to wall here stolidly submissive to question a have be stolidly submissive to fire hester dethridge wrote reply on other occasion be accustomed to look person to whom offered slate steadily in face now for first time handed to anne with eye on floor one line written contained direct answer word be have meant to move for time past ask why have moved wrote four word on slate wall be damp anne looked at wall there be sign of damp on paper passed hand over feel where might wall be dry be not reason said hester stood immovable there be dampness in wall hester pointed persistently with pencil to four word still without looking up waited moment for anne to read again left room be plainly useless to call back anne first impulse when be alone again be to secure door not only locked bolted at top bottom mortise of lock staple of bolt when tried be firm lurking treachery wherever else might be be not in fastening of door looked round room examining fire place window shutter interior of wardrobe hidden space under bed nothing be where to be discovered must justify most timid person living in feeling suspicion alarm appearance fair a be failed to convince presentiment of hidden treachery steadily getting nearer nearer to in dark have rooted firmly in mind sat down tried to trace way back to clew through earlier event of day effort be fruitless nothing definite nothing tangible rewarded worse still new doubt grew out of doubt whether motive sir patrick have avowed through blanche be motive for helping be really in mind did sincerely believe geoffrey conduct to be animated by worse object than mercenary object be only purpose in planning to remove out of husband reach to force geoffrey consent to separation on term julius have proposed be really sole end that have in view be secretly convinced knowing anne position a knew that be in personal danger at cottage have considerately kept that conviction concealed in fear that might otherwise encourage to feel alarmed about looked round strange room in silence of night felt that latter interpretation be likeliest interpretation of two sound caused by closing of door window reached from ground floor what be to be done be impossible to show signal have be agreed on to sir patrick arnold window in expected to see be window of room in fire have broken out room hester dethridge have locked up for night be equally hopeless to wait until policeman passed on beat to call for help even if must prevail upon to make open acknowledgment of distrust under husband roof even if help be near what valid reason must give for raising alarm there be not shadow of reason to justify one in placing under protection of law a last resource impelled by blind distrust of change in position of bed attempted to move utmost exertion of strength did not suffice to stir heavy piece of furniture out of place by so much a hair breadth there be alternative to trust to security of locked bolted door to keep watch through night certain that sir patrick arnold be on part also keeping watch in near neighborhood of cottage took out work book returned to chair placing near table in middle of room last noise told of
