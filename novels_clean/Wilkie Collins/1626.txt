hopeless sensation must steal over why write about better to try forget there be always to morrow to look to when to day be at worst th to morrow have proved worthy of faith put in sunshine again out of door a clear true reflection of in own heart a can hope to have just at time oh that month that one poor month of respite what be to do at end of month th made short entry for yesterday in afternoon just before tea time little thinking of event destined to happen with evening must be really worth chronicling for sake of excellent result to be sure to lead tendency be to be too sanguine about everything know be nevertheless firmly persuaded that can see new way out of present difficulty way of getting money enough to keep in comfort at farmhouse until william eye be well again new project be to relieve from uncertainty for next six month actually originated with have raised many inch higher in own estimation already if doctor only agrees with view of case when come to morrow william will allow to be persuaded know then let say what please will answer for rest be how new idea first found way into head have just done tea william in much better spirit than usual be talking with young sailor who be jocosely called here by very ugly name of foul weather dick farmer two eldest son be composing on oaken settle for usual nap dame be knitting two girl be beginning to clear tea table be darning child sock to appearance be not very propitious state of thing for creation of new idea yet idea grew out of for talking with husband on various subject connected with life in ship young sailor began giving description of hammock telling how be slung how be impossible to get into other way than stern foremost may mean how rolling of ship made rock like cradle how on rough night sometimes swayed to fro at rate a to bump bodily against ship side wake up with sensation of having just received punch on head from remarkably hard fist hearing ventured to suggest that must be immense relief to to sleep on shore in good motionless solid four post bed to surprise scoffed at idea said never slept comfortably out of hammock declared that quite missed occasional punch on head from ship side ended by giving most comical account of uncomfortable sensation felt when slept in four post bed odd nature of one of young sailor objection to sleeping on shore reminded husband a indeed did too of terrible story of bed in french gambling house once heard from gentleman whose likeness took be laughing at say honest foul weather dick seeing william turn toward smile indeed say husband that last objection of yours to four post bed on shore seems by mean ridiculous to at rate once knew gentleman dick who practically realized objection excuse sir say dick after pause with appearance of great bewilderment curiosity must put 'practically realized ' into plain english so that poor man like might have chance of understanding certainly say husband laughing mean once knew gentleman who actually saw felt what say in jest be afraid of seeing feeling whenever sleep in four post bed do understand that foul weather dick understood perfectly begged with great eagerness to hear what gentleman adventure really be dame who have be listening to talk backed son petition two girl sat down expectant at half cleared tea table even farmer drowsy son roused lazily on settle husband saw that stood fairly committed to relation of story so told without more ado have often heard relate that strange adventure william be best teller of story ever met with to friend of rank in many different part of england never yet knew fail of producing effect farmhouse audience be may almost say petrified by never before saw people look so long in same direction sit so long in same attitude a did even servant stole away from work in kitchen unrebuked by master mistress stood quite spell bound in doorway to listen observing in silence while husband be going on with narrative thought suddenly flashed across why must william not get wider audience for story a well a for others have heard from time to time from sitter have hitherto only repeated in private among few friend people tell story in book get money for what if told story in book what if book sold why freedom surely from one great anxiety be now preying on money enough to stop at farmhouse till william eye be fit for work again almost jumped up from chair a thought went on shaping in manner when great men make wonderful discovery do feel sensation like mine wonder be sir isaac newton within ace of skipping into air when first found out law of gravitation did friar bacon long to dance when lit match heard first charge of gunpowder in world go off with bang have to put strong constraint on must have communicated be passing in mind to william before friend at farmhouse knew be best to wait until be alone did wait what relief be when got up at last to say good night moment be in own room must not stop to take so much a pin out of dress before began dear said never heard tell that gambling house adventure so well before what effect have upon friend what effect indeed always have wherever tell so far did not seem to take much notice just nodded began to pour out of lotion in always bathe poor eye last thing at night a for went on story seem to interest people what number have picked up first last from different sitter in fifteen year of practice a portrait painter have idea how many story really do know must not undertake to say how many just then gave answer in very indifferent tone dabbing away time at eye with sponge lotion did so awkwardly roughly a seemed to that took sponge from applied lotion tenderly do think said if turned over one of story carefully in mind beforehand say one told to night for example that must repeat to so perfectly deliberately must be able to take down in writing from lip yes of course must why ask question because must like to have story that have be in habit of relating to friend set down fairly in writing by way of preserving from ever being forgotten must bathe left eye now because felt hottest to night began to forbode that growing indifference to what be saying must soon end in fairly going to sleep before have developed new idea unless took mean forthwith of stimulating curiosity in other word of waking into proper state of astonishment attention william said without syllable of preface have got new plan for finding money want for expense here jerked head up directly looked at what plan state of eye prevents for present from following profession a artist doe not very well what be to do with idle time dear turn author how be to get money want by publishing book good gracious leah be out of sens exclaimed put arm round neck sat down on knee course always take when want to persuade to anything with a few word a possible now william listen patiently to said artist lie under great disadvantage in case of accident talent be of service to unless can use eye finger author on other hand can turn talent to account just a well by mean of other people eye finger a by mean of own in present situation therefore have nothing for a said before to turn author wait hear out book want to make be book of story will repeat will write down from dictation manuscript will be printed will sell book to public so support honorably in adversity by doing best can to interest amuse others while be saying suppose in very excitable manner husband looked a young sailor friend must phrase quite taken aback be always quick at contriving leah said how in world came to think of plan thought of while be telling gambling house adventure downstairs answered be ingenious idea bold idea went on thoughtfully be one thing to tell story to circle of friend thing to put into printed form for audience of stranger consider dear that be of used to what be called writing for press very true said nobody be used to when first begin yet plenty of people have tried hazardous literary experiment successfully besides in case have material ready to hand surely can succeed in shaping presentably if aim at nothing simple truth who be to do eloquent description striking reflection part of said william perplexedly shaking head nobody replied eloquent description striking reflection be just part of story book people never read do let not if can possibly help write so much a single sentence can be conveniently skipped come come continued seeing begin to shake head again more objection william be too certain of success of plan to endure if still doubt let refer new project to competent arbitrator doctor be coming to see to morrow will tell have told if will promise on side will engage on mine to be guided entirely by opinion william smiled readily gave promise be wanted to send to bed in best spirit for of course must never have thought of mentioning doctor a arbitrator if have not known beforehand that be sure to be on side th arbitrator have shown that deserved confidence in ranked entirely on side before have half done explaining to what new project really be a to husband doubt difficulty dear good man must not so much a hear mentioned objection cried gayly set to work mr kerby make fortune always said wife be worth weight in gold here be now ready to get into bookseller scale prove set to work set to work with heart said william beginning at last to catch infection of enthusiasm when part of work wife have be completed what be to do with produce of labor leave to answered doctor finish book send to house will show at once to editor of country newspaper have plenty of literary friend in london will be just man to help by by added doctor addressing think of everything mr kerby pray have thought of name yet for new book at question be turn to be taken aback idea of naming book have never once entered head good title be of vast importance said doctor knitting brow thoughtfully must think about what will be eh mr kerby what will be perhaps something may strike after have fairly set to work husband suggested talking of work continued turning to how be to find time leah with nursery occupation for writing down story a tell have be thinking of that morning said have come to conclusion that will have little leisure to write from dictation in day time what with dressing washing child teaching giving meal taking out to walk keeping amused at home to say nothing of sitting sociably at work with dame two girl in afternoon be afraid will have few opportunity of doing part of book between breakfast tea time when child be in bed farmer family be reading dozing must have at least three unoccupied hour to spare so if mind putting off working time till after dark there be title shouted doctor jumping out of chair a if have be shot where cried looking round in surprise of moment a if have expected to see title magically inscribed for on wall of room in last word to be sure rejoined doctor said just now that must not have leisure to write from mr kerby dictation till after dark what can do better than name book after time when book be written call boldly after dark stop before anybody say word for against let see how name look on paper opened writing desk in great flutter doctor selected largest sheet of paper broadest nibbed pen must find wrote in majestic round text letter with alternate thin thick stroke beautiful to see two cabalistic word after dark three laid head together over paper in breathless silence studied effect of round text william raising green shade in excitement of moment actually disobeying doctor order about not using eye in doctor own presence after good long stare looked round solemnly in other face nodded there be doubt on subject after seeing round text in one happy moment doctor have hit on right name have written title page said good friend taking up hat to go now leave to two to write book since then have mended four pen bought quire of letter paper at village shop william be to ponder well over story in daytime so a to be quite ready for after dark be to commence new occupation evening heart beat fast eye moisten when think of how many of dearest interest depend upon one little beginning that be to make to night prologue to first story before begin by aid of wife patient attention ready pen to relate of story have heard at various time from person whose likeness have be employed to take will not be amiss if try to secure reader interest in following page by briefly explaining how became possessed of narrative matter contain of myself have nothing to say have followed profession of traveling portrait painter for last fifteen year pursuit of calling have not only led through england have taken twice to scotland once to ireland in moving from district to district be never guided beforehand by settled plan sometimes letter of recommendation get from person who be satisfied with work have done for determine direction in travel sometimes hear of new neighborhood in there be resident artist of ability remove thither on speculation sometimes friend among picture dealer say good word on behalf to rich customer so pave way for in large town sometimes prosperous famous brother artist hearing of small commission be not worth while to accept mention name procure introduction to pleasant country house thus get on now in one way now in not winning reputation making fortune happier perhaps on whole than many men who have got one other so at least try to think now though started in youth with a high ambition a best of thank god be not business here to speak of past time disappointment twinge of old hopeless heartache come over sometimes still when think of student day one peculiarity of present way of life be that brings into contact with sort of character almost feel by time a if have painted civilized variety of human race upon whole experience of world rough a have be have not taught to think unkindly of fellow creature have certainly received such treatment at hand of of sitter a must not describe without saddening shocking kind hearted reader taking one year one place with have cause to remember with gratitude respect sometimes even with friendship affection very large proportion of numerous person who have employed of result of experience be curious in moral point of view for example have found woman almost uniformly le delicate in asking about term le generous in remunerating for service than men on other hand men within knowledge be decidedly vainer of personal attraction more vexatiously anxious to have done full justice to on canvas than woman taking sex together have found young people for most part more gentle more reasonable more considerate than old summing up in general way experience of different rank extends let premise way down from peer to publican have met with most of formal ungracious reception among rich people of uncertain social standing highest class lowest among employer almost always contrive in widely different way of course to make feel at home a soon a enter house one great obstacle have to contend against in practice of profession be not a person may imagine difficulty of making sitter keep head still while paint difficulty of getting to preserve natural look day peculiarity of dress manner people will assume expression will brush up hair will correct little characteristic carelessness in apparel will in short when want to have likeness taken look a if be sitting for picture if paint under artificial circumstance fail of course to present in habitual aspect portrait a necessary consequence disappoints everybody sitter always included when wish to judge of man character by handwriting want customary scrawl dashed off with common workaday pen not best small text traced laboriously with finest procurable crow quill point so be with portrait painting be after nothing right reading of external of character recognizably presented to view of others experience after repeated trial have proved to that only way of getting sitter who persist in assuming set look to resume habitual expression be to lead into talking about subject in be greatly interested if can only beguile into speaking earnestly matter on what topic be sure of recovering natural expression sure of seeing little precious everyday peculiarity of man woman peep out one after quite unawares long maundering story about nothing wearisome recital of petty grievance local anecdote unrelieved by faintest suspicion of anything like general interest have be condemned to hear a consequence of thawing ice off feature of formal sitter by method just described must fill hundred of volume promote repose of thousand of reader on other hand if have suffered under tediousness of many have not be without compensating gain from wisdom experience of few to of sitter have be indebted for information have enlarged mind to for advice have lightened heart to for narrative of strange adventure riveted attention at time have served to interest amuse fireside circle for many year past be now must fain hope destined to make kind friend for among wider audience than have yet addressed singularly enough almost best story have heard from sitter have be told by accident only remember two case in story be volunteered to although have often tried experiment can not call to mind even single instance in leading question a lawyer call on part addressed to sitter ever produced result worth recording over over again have be disastrously successful in encouraging dull people to weary clever people who have something interesting to say seem so far a have observed to acknowledge other stimulant than chance for story propose including in present collection excepting one have be indebted in first instance to capricious influence of same chance something sitter have seen about something have remarked in sitter in room in take likeness in neighborhood through pas on way to work have suggested necessary association have started right train of recollection then story appeared to begin of own accord occasionally most casual notice on part of very unpromising object have smoothed way for relation of long interesting narrative first heard one of most dramatic of story will be presented in book merely through being carelessly inquisitive to know history of stuffed poodle dog be thus not without reason lay stress on desirableness of prefacing one of following narrative by brief account of curious manner in became possessed of a to capacity for repeating story correctly can answer for that memory may be trusted may claim a merit because be after mechanical one forget nothing that can call long passed conversation event a readily to recollection a if have happened few week ago of two thing at least feel tolerably certain beforehand in meditating over content of book first can repeat correctly have heard secondly have never missed anything worth hearing when sitter be addressing on interesting subject although can not take lead in talking while be engaged in painting can listen while others speak work better for so much in way of general preface to page for be about to ask reader attention let now advance to particular describe how came to hear first story in present collection begin with because be story have oftenest rehearsed to borrow phrase from stage wherever go be sooner later sure to tell only last night be persuaded into repeating once more by inhabitant of farmhouse in be now staying not many year ago on returning from short holiday visit to friend settled in paris found professional letter awaiting at agent in london required immediate presence in liverpool without stopping to unpack proceeded by first conveyance to new destination calling at picture dealer shop where portrait painting engagement be received for found to great satisfaction have remunerative employment in prospect in about liverpool for at least two month to come be putting up letter in high spirit be just leaving picture dealer shop to look out for comfortable lodging when be met at door by landlord of one of largest hotel in liverpool old acquaintance whom have known a manager of tavern in london in student day mr kerby exclaimed in great astonishment what unexpected meeting last man in world whom expected to see yet very man whose service want to make use of what more work for said be people in liverpool going to have portrait painted only know of one replied landlord gentleman staying at hotel who want chalk drawing done for be on way here to inquire of artist whom picture dealing friend must recommend how glad be that met before have committed to employing stranger be likeness wanted at once asked thinking of number of engagement have already got in pocket immediately to day very hour if possible said landlord mr faulkner gentleman be speaking of be to have sailed yesterday for brazil from place wind shifted last night to wrong quarter came ashore again morning may of course be detained here for time may also be called on board ship at hour notice if wind shift back again in right direction uncertainty make matter of importance that likeness must be begun immediately undertake if possibly can for mr faulkner liberal gentleman who be sure to give own term reflected for minute two portrait be only wanted in chalk must not take long besides might finish in evening if other engagement pressed hard upon in daytime why not leave luggage at picture dealer put off looking for lodging till night secure new commission boldly by going back at once with landlord to hotel decided on following course almost a soon a idea occurred to put chalk in pocket sheet of drawing paper in first of portfolio came to hand so presented before mr faulkner ready to take likeness literally at five minute notice found very pleasant intelligent man young handsome have be great traveler have visited wonder of east be now about to explore wild of vast south american continent thus much told good humoredly unconstrainedly while be preparing drawing material a soon a have put in right light position have seated opposite to changed subject of conversation asked little confusedly a thought if be not customary practice among portrait painter to gloss over fault in sitter face to make a much a possible of good point feature might posse certainly answered have described whole art mystery of successful portrait painting in few word may beg then said that will depart from usual practice in case draw with defect exactly a be fact be went on after moment pause likeness be now preparing to take be intended for mother roving disposition make great anxiety to parted from last time very sadly unwillingly know how idea came into head struck morning must not better employ time while be delayed here on shore than by getting likeness done to send to a keepsake have portrait of since be child be sure to value drawing of more than anything else must send to only trouble with explanation to prove be really sincere in wish to be drawn unflatteringly exactly a be secretly respecting admiring for what have just said promised that direction must be implicitly followed began to work immediately before have pursued occupation for ten minute conversation began to flag usual obstacle to success with sitter gradually set up between quite unconsciously of course mr faulkner stiffened neck shut month contracted eyebrow evidently under impression that be facilitating process of taking portrait by making face a like lifeless mask a possible trace of natural animated expression be fast disappearing be beginning to change into heavy rather melancholy looking man complete alteration be of great consequence so long a be only engaged in drawing outline of face general form of feature accordingly worked on doggedly for more than hour then left off to point chalk again to give sitter few minute rest thus far likeness have not suffered through mr faulkner unfortunate notion of right way of sitting for portrait time of difficulty a well knew be to come be impossible for to think of putting expression into drawing unless must contrive mean when resumed chair of making look like again will talk to about foreign part thought try if ca make forget that be sitting for picture in way while be pointing chalk mr faulkner be walking up down room chanced to see portfolio have brought with leaning against wall asked if there be sketch in told there be few have made during recent stay in paris in paris repeated with look of interest may see gave permission asked a matter of course sitting down took portfolio on knee began to look through turned over first five sketch rapidly enough when came to sixth saw face flush directly observed that took drawing out of portfolio carried to window remained silently absorbed in contemplation of for full five minute after that turned round to asked very anxiously if have objection to part with sketch be least interesting drawing of collection merely view in one of street running by back of house in palais royal four five of house be comprised in view be of particular use to in way be too valueless a work of art for to think of selling begged acceptance of at once thanked quite warmly then seeing that looked little surprised at odd selection have made from sketch laughingly asked if must guess why have be so anxious to become possessed of view have given probably answered there be remarkable historical association connected with street at back of palais royal of be ignorant said mr faulkner at least none know of only association connected with place in mind be purely personal association look at house in drawing house with water pipe running down from top to bottom once passed night there night will never forget to day of death have have awkward traveling adventure in time that adventure well never mind suppose begin sitting make bad return for kindness in giving sketch by thus wasting time in mere talk come come thought a went back to sitter chair will see natural expression on face if can only get to talk about adventure be easy enough to lead in right direction at first hint from returned to subject of house in back street without hope showing undue curiosity contrived to let see felt deep interest in everything now said after two three preliminary hesitation at last to great joy fairly started on narrative of adventure in interest of subject soon completely forgot that be sitting for portrait very expression that wanted came over face drawing proceeded toward completion in right direction to best purpose at fresh touch felt

feather counted feather again three white two green while still lingered over very improving intellectual employment thought insensibly began to wander moonlight shining into room reminded of certain moonlight night in england night after picnic party in welsh valley incident of drive homeward through lovely scenery moonlight made lovelier than ever came back to remembrance though have never given picnic thought for year though if have tried to recollect must certainly have recalled little nothing of scene long past of wonderful faculty help to tell be immortal speaks sublime truth more eloquently than memory here be in strange house of most suspicious character in situation of uncertainty even of peril might seem to make cool exercise of recollection almost out of question nevertheless remembering quite involuntarily place people conversation minute circumstance of kind have thought forgotten forever must not possibly have recalled at will even under most favorable auspex what cause have produced in moment whole of strange complicated mysterious effect nothing ray of moonlight shining in at bedroom window be still thinking of picnic of merriment on drive home of sentimental young lady who must quote childe harold because be moonlight be absorbed by past scene past amusement when in instant thread on memory hung snapped asunder attention immediately came back

valance above be within inch of being parallel with waist still looked breathlessly steadily slowly very slowly saw figure line of frame below figure vanish a valance moved down before be constitutionally anything timid have be on more than one occasion in peril of life have not lost self possession for instant when conviction first settled on mind that bed top be really moving be steadily continuously sinking down upon looked up shuddering helpless panic stricken beneath hideous machinery for murder be advancing closer closer to suffocate where lay looked up motionless speechless breathless candle fully spent went out moonlight still brightened room down down without pausing without sounding came bed top still panic terror seemed to bind faster faster to mattress on lay down down sank till dusty odor from lining of canopy came stealing into nostril at final moment instinct of self preservation startled out of trance moved at last there be just room for to roll sidewise off bed a dropped noiselessly to floor edge of murderous canopy touched on shoulder without stopping to draw breath without wiping cold sweat from face rose instantly on knee to watch bed top be literally spellbound by if have heard footstep behind must not have turned round if mean of escape have be miraculously provided for must not have moved to take advantage of whole life in be at

capital of france such machine for secret murder by suffocation a might have existed in worst day of inquisition in lonely inn among hartz mountain in mysterious tribunal of westphalia still a looked on must not move must hardly breathe began to recover power of thinking in moment discovered murderous conspiracy framed against in horror cup of coffee have be drugged drugged too strongly have be saved from being smothered by having taken overdose of narcotic how have chafed fretted at fever fit have preserved life by keeping awake how recklessly have confided to two wretch who have led into

found that miniature be very beautifully painted represented woman face young woman with kind sad eye pale delicate cheek light hair pure tender lovely expression thought of raphael moment looked at portrait old lady observed impression miniature produced on nodded head in silence what beautiful innocent pure face said mademoiselle clairfait gently brushed particle of dust from miniature with

sister rose not one of lanfray family apparently composure of young lady when name be mentioned showed plainly enough that original of miniature have be relation of theirs tried to stifle curiosity on subject of sister rose by giving entirely to work for full half hour mademoiselle clairfait sat quietly before with hand crossed on lap eye fixed on bracelet happy alteration enabled to do something toward completing outline of face figure might even under fortunate circumstance have vanquished preliminary difficulty of task at one effort fate be against that day while be still working rapidly to satisfaction servant knocked at door to announce luncheon mademoiselle lightly roused from serious reflection quiet position in moment ah said turning miniature round on wrist till be out of sight

asylum in office to lonely old man to whom beister rose brother have be greatly indebted in revolutionary time out of train of circumstance connected with first acquaintance between mademoiselle friend whose portrait wear arose after time of father bankruptcy for many year before be placed under charge good old governess lived entirely with beister rose brother must then have heard interesting thing that have since often repeated to sister might suggest said after instant consideration that best way to give fair chance of studying mademoiselle clairfait face at next sitting must be to lead thought again to that quieting subject of miniature to event portrait recall be really only plan after what have observed morning can think of for enabling to do sitter justice be delighted to hear say so replied lady for execution of plan by by sister will be easiest thing in world word from at time will set mademoiselle thinking talking too of friend of youthful day depend on

occupies following page in case of preceding narrative have repeated what be related to a nearly a possible in very word of sitter in case of third story be impossible for to proceed upon same plan circumstance of sister rose eventful history be narrated to at different time in most fragmentary discursive manner mademoiselle clairfait characteristically mixed up with direct interest of story not only reference to place people have recognizable connection with outburst of passionate political declamation on extreme liberal side to say nothing of little tender apostrophe to beloved friend

enough to oppress man spirit lomaque be not thinking of caring for now out of mass of paper lie before on old writing table have just taken up read one have carried thought back to past to change have taken place since stood alone on doorstep of trudaine house pondering on what might happen more rapidly even than have foreboded change have occurred in le time even than have anticipated sad emergency for rose brother have prepared a for barely possible calamity overtook trudaine called for patience courage self sacrifice have to give for sister sake by slow gradation downward from bad to worse husband character manifested le le disguisedly almost day by day occasional slight ending in habitual neglect careless estrangement turning to cool enmity small insult ripened evilly to great

love from first trudaine have devoted to meet such trial a now assailed like man met in defiance alike of persecution from mother of insult from son hard task be only lightened when a time advanced public trouble began to mingle with private grief then absorbing political necessity came a relief to domestic misery then grew to be one purpose pursuit of danville life cunningly to shape course so that might move safely onward with advancing revolutionary tide cared not whither a long a kept possession safe life out of danger mother inflexibly true to old world conviction through peril might entreat upbraid might talk of honor courage sincerity heeded not heeded only to laugh a have taken false way with wife so be now bent on taking with world year passed on destroying change swept

meanwhile danville anger cooled down recovered use of cunning sense have hitherto served well sent to recall discarded servant be too late lomaque be already in position to set at defiance nay to put neck perhaps under blade of guillotine worse than anonymous letter reached warning to lose time in proving patriotism by indisputable sacrifice in silencing mother whose imprudent sincerity be likely ere long to cost life danville knew well enough to know that there be one way of saving thereby saving have always refused to emigrate now insisted that must seize first opportunity must procure for of quitting france until calmer time arrived probably must have risked own life ten time over rather than have obeyed have not courage to risk son too yielded for sake partly by secret influence partly by unblushing fraud danville procured for such paper permit a must enable to leave france by way of marseille even then refused to depart until knew what son plan be for future showed letter be about to dispatch to robespierre vindicating suspected patriotism indignantly demanding to be allowed to prove by filling office matter how small under redoubtable triumvirate then governed more

patience skill hook be baited for thrown in rod be put into hand friend went back to place began at last to angle in earnest certainly caught few fish in case mean of course that fish caught be scanty in number light in weight whether be presence of miller foreman gloomy personage who stood staring disastrously upon from little flower garden on opposite bank that cast adverse influence over sport whether want of faith earnestness a angler acted retributively on companion a well a know not be certain that got almost a little reward for skill a got for patience after nearly two hour of intense expectation on part intense angling on mr garthwaite jerked line out of water in rage bade follow to place declaring that stream must have be netted by poacher in night who have taken large fish away with have thrown in small one to grow until next visit moved away further down bank leaving imperturbable foreman still in flower garden staring at speechlessly on departure exactly a have already stared at on approach stop minute said mr garthwaite suddenly after have walked distance in silence by side of stream have idea now be out for day angling wo be balked instead of trying water here

above two mile from here stream call in county dialect glenwith beck run through ground a walked on mr garthwaite manner altered became unusually silent thoughtful mention of miss welwyn name have evidently called up recollection be not in harmony with day mood feeling that to talk to on indifferent subject must be only to interrupt thought to purpose walked by side in perfect silence looking out already with curiosity impatience for first view of glenwith grange stopped at last close by old church standing on outskirt of pretty village low wall of churchyard be bounded on one side by plantation be joined by park paling in noticed small wicket gate mr garthwaite opened led along shrubbery path conducted circuitously to dwelling house have evidently entered by private way for approached building by back looked up at curiously saw standing at one of window on lower floor little girl watching a advanced seemed to be about nine ten year old must not help stopping moment to look up at clear complexion long dark hair be so beautiful yet there be something in expression dimness vacancy in large eye changeless unmeaning smile on parted lip seemed to jar with be naturally attractive in face perplexed disappointed even shocked though hardy knew why mr garthwaite who have be walking along thoughtfully with eye on ground turned back when found lingering behind looked up where be looking started little thought then took arm whispered rather impatiently say anything about having seen that poor child when be introduced to miss welwyn will tell why afterward led round hastily to front of building be very dreary old house with lawn in front thickly sprinkled with flower bed creeper of sort climbing in profusion about heavy stone porch mullion of lower window in spite of prettiest of ornament clustering brightly round building in spite of perfect repair in be kept from top to bottom there be something repellent to in aspect of whole place deathly stillness hung over fell oppressively on spirit when companion rang loud deep toned bell sound startled a if have be committing crime in disturbing silence when door be opened by old female servant while hollow echo of bell be still vibrating in air must hardly imagine possible that must be let in be admitted however without slightest demur remarked that there be same atmosphere of dreary repose inside house have already observed rather felt outside dog barked at approach door banged in servant office head peeped over banister not one of ordinary domestic consequence of unexpected visit in country met eye ear large shadowy apartment half library half breakfast room into be ushered be a solitary a hall of entrance unless except such drowsy evidence of life a be here presented to in shape of angola cat gray parrot first lying asleep in chair second sitting ancient solemn voiceless in large cage mr garthwaite walked to window when entered without saying word determining to let taciturn humor have way asked question looked around room to see what information must give room often do give such information about character habit of owner of house two table covered with book be first object attracted on approaching be surprised to find that influencing periodical literature of present day whose sphere be already almost without limit whose reader even in time may be numbered by million be entirely unrepresented on miss welwyn table nothing modern nothing contemporary in world of book presented of volume beneath hand not one bore badge of circulating library wore flaring modern livery of gilt cloth work took up have be written at least fifteen twenty year since print hanging round wall toward next looked be engraved from devotional subject by old master music stand contained music of later

of early womanhood still remaining a saw in hers sorrow have evidently passed over fair calm countenance before have left resignation there a only trace expression be still youthful youthful in kindness candor especially be only when looked at hair be now growing gray at wan thin hand at faint line marked round mouth at sad serenity of eye that fairly detected mark of age more than that token of great grief have be conquered not banished even from voice alone from peculiar uncertainty of low calm tone when spoke be easy to conjecture that must have passed through suffering at time of life have tried to quick noble nature that must not subdue mr garthwaite met other almost like brother sister be plain that friendly intimacy between have be of very long duration visit be short one conversation never advanced beyond commonplace topic suited to occasion be therefore from what saw not from what heard be enabled to form judgment of miss welwyn deeply a have interested far more deeply than at know how to explain in fitting word can not say that be unwilling to depart when rose to take leave though nothing must be more courteous more kind than manner toward during whole interview must still perceive that cost effort to repress in presence shade of sadness reserve seemed often ready to steal over must confess that when once twice heard half sigh stifled saw momentary relapse into thoughtfulness suddenly restrained felt indefinable awkwardness in position made ill at ease set doubting whether a perfect stranger have done right in suffering to be introduced where new face must awaken interest curiosity where new sympathy must ever be felt new friendship ever be formed a soon a have taken leave of miss welwyn be on way to stream in ground more than satisfied mr garthwaite that impression lady have produced on be of transitory kind by overwhelming with question about not omitting one two incidental inquiry on subject of little girl whom have seen at back window only rejoined that story must answer question that must begin to tell a soon a have arrived at glenwith beck be comfortably settled to fishing five minute more of walking brought to bank of stream showed water running smoothly slowly tinged with softest green luster from reflection of tree almost entirely arched over leaving to admire view at ease mr garthwaite occupied with necessary preparation for angling baiting hook a well a own then desiring to sit near on bank at last satisfied curiosity by beginning story will relate in own manner a nearly a possible in own word angler

whose dishonest gain be confided to hand for safe keeping must have be certainly captured on venturing back to france along with two associate for daring imposture in took refuge if true baron franval

really did happen on morning when awoke after flight of ida sister can be briefly told a soon a eye opened rested on police agent sitting quietly by bedside with loaded pistol in hand monbrun knew immediately that be discovered never for instant lost self possession for be famous said wished to have five minute allowed to deliberate quietly in bed whether must resist french authority on english ground so gain time by obliging one government to apply specially to have delivered up by other whether must accept term officially offered to by agent if quietly allowed to be captured chose latter

on such condition that owner of correggio be willing to trust treasure out of own hand to suffer to be copied by stranger restriction imposed thought sufficiently absurd perhaps offensively suspicious a well be communicated to politely enough before be allowed to undertake commission unless be inclined to submit to precautionary regulation must affect other artist exactly a affected be told not to

commonplace work that unlucky modern artist ever produced face of holy family not only failed to display right purity tenderness of expression absolutely failed to present expression at be flat heresy

ear shrank from opening door in partition when whispering sound terrified knew not how why first faltered then ceased altogether when heard sob followed when heart told who be weeping in next room then began to be influenced by new feeling be stronger than strongest fear opened door without hesitation almost without trembling coverlet be drawn up over old man gabriel be kneeling by bedside with face hidden when spoke to neither answered looked at after while sob shook ceased still never moved except once when touched then shuddered shuddered under hand called in little sister spoke to still uttered word in reply wept one by one often often entreated with loving word stupor of grief held speechless motionless be beyond power of human tear stronger even than strength of human love be near daybreak storm be lulling still change occurred at bedside once twice a perrine knelt near gabriel still vainly endeavoring to arouse to sense of presence thought heard old man breathing feebly stretched out hand toward coverlet must not summon courage to touch to look at be first time have ever be present at death bed stillness in room stupor of despair have seized on gabriel so horrified that be almost a helpless a two child by side be not till dawn looked in at cottage window so coldly so drearily yet so re assuringly that began to recover self possession at then knew that best resource must be to summon assistance immediately from nearest house while be trying to persuade two child to remain alone in cottage with gabriel during temporary absence be startled by sound of footstep outside door opened man appeared on threshold standing still there for moment in dim uncertain light looked closer looked intently at be francois sarzeau chapter ii fisherman be dripping with wet face always pale inflexible seemed to be little altered in expression by peril through must have passed during night young pierre lay almost insensible in arm in astonishment fright of first moment perrine screamed a recognized there there there said peevishly advancing straight to hearth with burden make noise never expected to see alive again dare say gave up a lost only escaped after by miracle laid boy down where must get full warmth of fire then turning round took wicker covered bottle from pocket said if have be for brandy stopped suddenly started put down bottle on bench near advanced quickly to bedside perrine looked after a went saw gabriel who have risen when door be opened moving back from bed a francois approached young man face seemed to have be suddenly struck to stone blank ghastly whiteness be awful to look at moved slowly backward backward till came to cottage wall then stood quite still staring on father with wild vacant eye moving hand to fro before muttering never pronouncing one audible word francois did not appear to notice son have coverlet of bed in hand anything matter here asked a drew down still gabriel must not speak perrine saw answered for gabriel be afraid that poor grandfather be dead whispered nervously dead there be sorrow in tone a echoed word be very bad in night before death happened did wander in mind have be rather light headed lately be very restless spoke of ghostly warning that know of said saw heard many thing told from other world that pierre gabriel screamed suddenly interrupting look at look at face grandfather be not dead at moment francois be raising father head to look closely at faint spasm have indeed passed over deathly face lip quivered jaw dropped francois shuddered a looked moved away hastily from bed at same instant gabriel started from wall expression altered pale cheek flushed suddenly a snatched up wicker cased bottle poured little brandy be left in down grandfather throat effect be nearly instantaneous sinking vital force rallied desperately old man eye opened again wandered round room then fixed intently on francois a stood near fire trying terrible a position be at moment gabriel still retained self possession enough to whisper few word in perrine ear go back again into bedroom take child with said may have something to speak about have better not hear son gabriel grandfather be trembling over said francois if be dying at be dying of cold help to lift bed to hearth let touch gasped old man let look at in way let come near gabriel be ghost be a gabriel answered heard knocking at door father opened disclosed to view people from neighboring fishing village who have come more out of curiosity than sympathy to inquire whether francois boy pierre have survived night without asking one to enter fisherman surlily shortly answered various question addressed to standing in own doorway while be thus engaged gabriel heard grandfather muttering vacantly to last night how about last night grandson what be talking about last night did say father be drowned very foolish to say be drowned then see come back alive again be that be so weak in head ca remember what be gabriel something too horrible to speak of be that what be whispering trembling about said nothing horrible crime bloodshed know nothing of crime bloodshed here must have be frightened out of wit to talk in way merchant table only big heap of old stone what with storm thinking be going to die being afraid about father must have be light headed give thought to nonsense gabriel be better now will live to laugh at poor grandfather for talking nonsense about crime bloodshed in sleep ah poor old man last night light headed fancy nonsense of old man why laugh at be laughing so light headed so light stopped suddenly low cry partly of terror partly of pain escaped look of pining anxiety imbecile cunning have distorted face while have be speaking faded from forever shivered little breathed heavily once twice then became quite still have died with falsehood on lip gabriel looked round saw that cottage door be closed that father be standing against how long have occupied that position how many of old man last word have heard be impossible to conjecture there be lowering suspicion in harsh face a now looked away from corpse to son made gabriel shudder first question that asked on once more approaching bedside be expressed in tone quiet a be have fearful meaning in what did grandfather talk about last night asked gabriel did not answer that have heard that have seen misery horror might yet be to come have stunned mind unspeakable danger of present position be too tremendous to be realized must only feel vaguely in weary torpor oppressed heart while in other direction use of faculty physical mental seemed to have suddenly totally abandoned be tongue wounded son gabriel a well a arm father went on with bitter laugh come back to saved by miracle never speak to must rather have died than old man there ca hear now why must tell what nonsense be talking last night wo say will crossed room put back to door before of leave place will confess know that duty to church bid to go at once tell priest of grandfather death if leave duty unfulfilled remember be through fault keep here for here stop till be obeyed do hear that idiot speak speak instantly will repeat to day of death ask again what did grandfather say to when be wandering in mind last night spoke of crime committed by guiltily kept secret by answered gabriel slowly sternly morning denied own word with last living breath last night if spoke truth truth echoed francois what truth stopped eye fell then turned toward corpse for few minute stood steadily contemplating breathing quickly drawing hand several time across forehead then faced son once more in short interval have become in outward appearance changed man expression voice manner be altered heaven forgive went on must almost laugh at at solemn moment for having spoken acted just now so much like fool denied word did poor old man say sense often come back to light headed people just before death be proof of fact be gabriel own wit must have be little shaken wonder by what went through last night what have come home to morning a if anybody must ever really give serious credit to wandering speech of dying old man where be perrine why did send away wonder at still looking little startled feeling low in mind for have have trying night of trying in way must have be good deal shaken in wit last night between fear about fear about to think of being angry with gabriel for being little alarmed very naturally by old man queer fancy come out perrine come out of bedroom whenever be tired of must learn sooner later to look at death calmly shake hand gabriel let make up say more about what have passed wo still angry with for what said to just now ah will think better about by time return come out perrine have secret here where be going to asked gabriel a saw father hastily open door to tell priest that one of congregation be dead to have death registered answered francois be duty must be performed before take rest went out hurriedly a said word gabriel almost trembled at when found that breathed more freely that felt le horribly oppressed in mind body moment father back be turned fearful a thought be now be still change for better to be capable of thinking at be behavior of father compatible with innocence must old man confused denial of own word in morning in presence of son be set for one instant against circumstantial confession that have made during night alone with grandson be terrible question gabriel now asked shrank involuntarily from answering yet doubt solution of must one way other irrevocably affect whole future of life must sooner later be solved at hazard be there way of setting at rest yes one way to go instantly while father be absent examine hollow place under merchant table if grandfather confession have really be made while be in possession of sens place gabriel knew to be covered in from wind weather have never be visited since commission of crime by perpetrator by unwilling accomplice though time have destroyed besides hair bone of victim must still be left to bear witness to truth if truth have indeed be spoken a conviction grew on young man cheek paled stopped irresolute half way between hearth door then looked down doubtfully at corpse on bed then there came upon suddenly revulsion of feeling wild feverish impatience to know worst without instant of delay possessed only telling perrine that must be back soon that must watch by dead in absence left cottage at once without waiting to hear reply even without looking back a closed door behind there be two track to merchant table one longer of two by coast cliff other across heath latter path be also for little distance path led to village church be afraid of attracting father attention here so took direction of coast at one spot track trended inland winding round of many druid monument scattered over country place be on high ground commanded view at great distance of path leading to village just where branched off from heathy ridge ran in direction of merchant table here gabriel descried figure of man standing with back toward coast figure be too far off to be identified with absolute certainty looked like might well be francois sarzeau whoever be man be evidently uncertain way must proceed when moved forward be first to advance several pace toward merchant table then went back again toward distant cottage church twice hesitated thus second time pausing long before appeared finally to take way led to village leaving post of observation among stone at have instinctively halted for minute past gabriel now proceeded on own path must man really be father if be so why did francois sarzeau only determine to go to village where business lay after having twice vainly attempted to persevere in taking exactly opposite direction of merchant table did really desire to go there have heard name mentioned when old man referred to in dying word have failed to summon courage enough to make safe by removing last question be too horrible to be pursued gabriel stifled affrightedly in own heart a went on reached great druid monument without meeting living soul on way sun be rising mighty storm cloud of night be parting asunder wildly over whole eastward horizon wave still leaped foamed gloriously gale have sunk to keen fresh breeze a gabriel looked up saw how brightly promise of lovely day be written in heaven trembled a thought of search be now about to make sight of fair fresh sunrise jarred horribly with suspicion of committed murder be rankling foully in heart knew that errand must be performed nerved to go through with for dared not return to cottage until mystery have be cleared up at once forever merchant table be formed by two huge stone resting horizontally on three others in troubled time of more than century ago regular tourist be unknown among druid monument of brittany entrance to hollow place under stone since often visited by stranger be at time nearly choked up by bramble weed gabriel first look at tangled nook of brier convinced that place have not be entered perhaps for year by living being without allowing to hesitate for felt that slightest delay might be fatal to resolution passed a gently a possible through bramble knelt down at low dusky irregular entrance of hollow place under stone heart throbbed violently breath almost failed forced to crawl few foot into cavity then groped with hand on ground about touched something something made flesh creep to handle something must fain have dropped grasped tight in spite of drew back into outer air sunshine be human bone no have be dupe of own morbid terror have only taken up fragment of dried wood feeling shame at such self deception a be about to throw wood from before re entered place when idea occurred to though be dimly lighted through one two chink in stone far part of interior of cavity be still too dusky to admit of perfect examination by eye even on bright sunshiny morning observing took out tinder box match like other inhabitant of district always carried about with for purpose of lighting pipe determining to use piece of wood a torch might illuminate darkest corner of place when next entered fortunately wood have remained so long have be preserved so dry in sheltered position that caught fire almost a easily a piece of paper moment be fairly aflame gabriel went into cavity penetrating at once time to furthest extremity remained among stone long enough for wood to burn down nearly to hand when came out flung burning fragment from face be flushed deeply eye sparkled leaped carelessly on to heath over bush through have threaded way so warily few minute before exclaiming may marry perrine with clear conscience now be son of a honest man a there be in brittany have closely examined cavity in corner not slightest sign that dead body have ever be laid there be visible in hollow place under merchant table chapter iii may marry perrine with clear conscience now there be part of world where must be drawing natural picture of human nature to represent son a believing conscientiously that offense against life law of hospitality secretly committed by father rendered though innocent of participation in unworthy to fulfill engagement with affianced wife among simple inhabitant of gabriel province however such acuteness of conscientious sensibility a be extraordinary exception to general rule ignorant superstitious a might be people of brittany practiced duty of hospitality a devoutly a practiced duty of national religion presence of stranger guest rich poor be sacred presence at hearth safety be especial charge property especial responsibility might be half starved be ready to share last crust with nevertheless a must share with own child outrage on virtue of hospitality thus born bred in people be viewed by with universal disgust punished with universal execration ignominy be uppermost in gabriel thought by side of grandfather bed dread of worst dishonor there be wiping out held speechless before perrine shamed horrified so that felt unworthy to look in face when result of search at merchant table proved absence there of evidence of crime spoken of by old man blessed relief absorbing triumph of discovery be expressed entirely in one thought have prompted first joyful word must marry perrine with clear conscience for be son of honest man when returned to cottage francois have not come back perrine be astonished at change in gabriel manner even pierre child remarked rest warmth have by time so far recovered younger brother that be able to give account of perilous adventure of night at sea be still listening to boy narrative when francois at last returned be now gabriel who held out hand made first advance toward reconciliation to utter amazement father recoiled from variable temper of francois have evidently changed completely during absence at village settled scowl of distrust darkened face a looked at son never shake hand with people who have once doubted exclaimed loudly irritably for always doubt forever after be bad son have suspected father of infamy that dare not openly charge with on other testimony than rambling nonsense of half witted dying old man speak to wo hear innocent man spy be bad company go denounce juda in disguise care for secret for what be girl perrine doing here still why have gone home long ago priest coming want stranger in house of death take back to farmhouse stop there with if like nobody want here there be something in manner look of speaker a uttered word so strange so sinister so indescribably suggestive of meaning much more than said that gabriel felt heart sink within instantly almost at same moment fearful question forced irresistibly on mind might not father have followed to merchant table even if have be desired to speak must not have spoken now while question suspicion that brought with be utterly destroying re assuring hope conviction of morning mental suffering produced by sudden change from pleasure to pain in thought reacted on physically felt a if be stifling in air of cottage in presence of father when perrine hurried on walking attire with face alternately flushed turned pale with moment approached door went out with a hastily a if have be flying from home never have fresh air free daylight felt like heavenly guardian influence to until now must comfort perrine under father harshness must assure of own affection earthly influence must change while walked together toward farmhouse must do more durst not confide to subject be uppermost in mind of human being be last to whom must reveal terrible secret be festering at heart a soon a got within sight of farmhouse gabriel stopped promising to see again soon took leave of perrine with assumed ease in manner with real despair in heart whatever poor girl might think of felt at moment that have not courage to face father hear talk happily pleasantly a custom be of perrine approaching marriage left to gabriel wandered hither thither over open heath knowing caring in what direction turned step doubt about father innocence have be dissipated by visit to merchant table that father own language manner have now revived have even confirmed though dared not yet acknowledge so much to be terrible enough to be obliged to admit that result of morning search be after not conclusive that mystery be in very truth not yet cleared up violence of father last word of distrust extraordinary indescribable change in father manner while uttering what did thing mean guilt innocence again be longer reasonable to doubt death bed confession made by grandfather be not on contrary far more probable that old man denial in morning of own word at night have be made under influence of panic terror when moral consciousness be bewildered intellectual faculty be sinking longer gabriel thought of question le competent possibly also le willing felt to answer must seek advice from others wiser than not while thousandth part of chance remained that father be innocent thought be still in mind when found once more in sight of home be still hesitating near door when saw opened cautiously brother pierre looked out then came running toward come in gabriel oh do come in said boy earnestly be afraid to be alone with father be be beating for talking of gabriel went in father looked up from hearth where be sitting muttered word spy made gesture of contempt did not address word directly to son hour passed on in silence afternoon waned into evening evening into night still never spoke to of child soon after be dark went out took net with saying that be better to be alone on sea than in house with spy when returned next morning there be change in day passed week month even elapsed still though manner insensibly became what used to be toward other child never altered toward eldest son at rare period when now met except when absolutely obliged to speak preserved total silence in intercourse with gabriel must never take gabriel out with in boat must never sit alone with gabriel in house must never eat meal with gabriel must never let other child talk to about gabriel must never hear word in expostulation word in reference to anything dead father have said done on night of storm from gabriel young man pined changed so that even perrine hardly knew again under cruel system of domestic excommunication under wearing influence of one unchanging doubt never left more than under incessant reproach of own conscience aroused by sense that be evading responsibility be solemn immediate duty to undertake sting of conscience ill treatment at home self reproach for failing in duty of confession a good catholic be powerful enough in influence over gabriel to make disclose secret under oppression of very life be wasting away knew that if once revealed whether father be ultimately proved to be guilty innocent there must remain slur suspicion on family on perrine besides from approaching connection with in time in generation must never be removed reproach of world be terrible even in crowded city where many of dweller in abiding place be stranger to be far more terrible in country where none near be stranger where talk of know of where nothing intervenes between tyranny of evil tongue gabriel have not courage to face dare fearful chance of life long ignominy not even to serve sacred interest of justice of atonement of truth chapter iv while gabriel still remained prostrated under affliction be wasting energy of body mind brittany be visited by great public calamity in private misfortune be overwhelmed for while be now time when ever gathering storm of french revolution have risen to hurricane climax chief of new republic be in power whose last worst madness be to decree extinction of religion overthrow of everything outwardly symbolized throughout whole of country that governed already decree have be executed to letter in around paris now soldier of republic be on way to brittany headed by commander whose commission be to root out christian religion in last surest

sweet sound congregation who have gathered together be poor alike persecuted alike worshiping alike to overthrow of worldly interest at imminent peril of life how brightly tenderly moonlight shone upon altar people before how solemnly divinely deep harmony a chanted penitential psalm mingled with hoarse singing of freshening night breeze in rigging of ship how sweetly still rushing murmur of many voice a uttered response together now died away now rose again softly into mysterious night of member of congregation young old there be one whom that impressive service exercised influence of consolation of peace that one be gabriel often throughout day reproaching conscience have spoken within again again often when joined little assembly on beach turned away face in secret shame apprehension from perrine father vainly after gaining deck of ship did try to meet eye of father paul a frankly a readily a affectionately a others met burden of concealment seemed too heavy to be borne in presence of priest yet torment a be still bore when knelt with rest of congregation saw perrine kneeling by side when felt calmness of solemn night still sea filling heart when sound of first prayer spoke with dread spiritual language of own to soul then remembrance of confession have neglected terror of receiving unprepared sacrament knew must be offered to grew too vivid to be endured sense that merited no longer though once worthy of confidence in perfect truth candor placed in by woman with whom be soon to stand before altar overwhelmed with shame mere act of kneeling among congregation passive accomplice by silence secrecy for aught knew to contrary of crime be bounden duty to denounce appalled a if have already committed sacrilege must never be forgiven tear flowed down cheek though strove to repress sob burst from though tried to stifle knew that others besides perrine be looking at in astonishment alarm must neither control move to leave place raise eye even until suddenly felt hand laid on shoulder that touch slight a be ran through instantly looked up saw father paul standing by side beckoning to follow signing to congregation not to suspend devotion led out of assembly then paused for moment reflecting then beckoning again took into cabin of ship closed door carefully have something on mind said simply quietly taking young man by hand may be able to relieve if tell what be a gabriel heard gentle word saw by light of lamp burned before cross fixed against wall sad kindness of expression with priest be regarding oppression have lain so long on heart seemed to leave in instant haunting fear of ever divulging fatal suspicion fatal secret have vanished a be at touch of father paul hand for first time now repeated to ear sound of prayer praise rising grandly while from congregation above grandfather death bed confession word for word almost a have heard in cottage on night of storm once once only did father paul interrupt narrative in whisper be addressed to gabriel have hardly repeated first two three sentence of grandfather confession when priest in quick altered tone abruptly asked name place of abode a question be answered father paul calm face became suddenly agitated next moment resolutely resuming self possession bowed head a sign that gabriel be to continue clasped trembling hand raising a if in silent prayer fixed eye intently on cross never looked away from while terrible narrative proceeded when gabriel described search at merchant table referring to father behavior since time appealed to priest to know whether might even yet in defiance of appearance be still filially justified in doubting whether crime have be really perpetrated then father paul moved near to once more spoke again compose look at said with former sad kindness of voice manner can end doubt forever gabriel father be guilty in intention in act victim of crime still life can prove be heart beat wildly deadly coldness crept over a saw father paul loosen fastening of cassock round throat at instant chanting of congregation above ceased then sudden awful stillness be deepened rather than interrupted by faint sound of one voice praying slowly with trembling finger priest removed band round neck paused little sighed heavily pointed to scar be now plainly visible on one side of throat said something at same time bell above tolled while spoke be signal of elevation of host gabriel felt arm passed round guiding to knee sustaining from sinking to floor for one moment longer be conscious that bell have stopped that there be dead silence that father paul be kneeling by beneath cross with bowed head then object around vanished saw knew nothing more when recovered sens be still in cabin man whose life father have attempted be bending over sprinkling water on face clear voice of woman child of congregation be joining voice of men in singing agnus dei look up at without fear gabriel said priest desire not to avenge injury

being posted a scout in various direction on high land of heath must have followed guarded priest to place of destination forbade leaving abruptly walked swiftly onward with one young man only for companion gabriel have committed brother sister to charge of perrine be to go to farmhouse night with newly married wife father mother father paul have desired that might be done when gabriel be left alone to follow path led to fisherman cottage priest never spoke while walked on never looked aside to right left always held ivory crucifix clasped to breast arrived at door knock whispered father paul to gabriel then wait here with door be opened on lovely moonlight night francois sarzeau have stood on threshold year since with bleeding body in arm on lovely moonlight night now stood there again confronting very man whose life have attempted knowing not father paul advanced few pace so that moonlight fell fuller on feature removed hat francois sarzeau looked started moved one step back then stood motionless perfectly silent while trace of expression of kind suddenly vanished from face then calm clear tone of priest stole gently on dead silence bring message of peace forgiveness from guest of former year said pointed a spoke to place where have be wounded in neck for one moment gabriel saw father trembling violently from head to foot then limb steadied again stiffened suddenly a if struck by catalepsy lip parted without quivering eye glared without moving in orbit lovely moonlight looked ghastly horrible shining on supernatural panic deformity of face gabriel turned away head in terror heard voice of father paul saying to wait here till come back then there be instant of silence again then low groaning sound seemed to articulate name of god sound unlike father voice unlike human voice have ever heard then noise of closing door looked up saw that be standing alone before cottage once after interval approached window just saw through hand of priest holding on high ivory crucifix stopped not to see more for heard such word such sound a drove back to former place there stayed until noise of something falling heavily within cottage struck on ear again advanced toward door heard father paul praying listened for several minute then heard moaning voice now joining to voice of priest now choked in sob bitter wailing once more went back out of hearing stirred not again from place waited long weary time there so long that one of scout on lookout came toward evidently suspicious of delay in priest return waved man back then looked again toward door at last saw open saw father paul approach leading francois sarzeau by hand fisherman never raised downcast eye to son face tear trickled silently over cheek followed hand led a little child might have followed

be alone in studio will endeavor to lead into speaking of young man in room there of daughter in term more becoming to to to until time allow to go on with work luca shrugged shoulder went back to statue father rocco who have be engaged during last ten minute in mixing wet plaster to right consistency for taking cast suspended occupation crossing room to corner next partition removed from cheval glass stood there lifted away gently while brother back be turned carried close to table at have be at work then resumed employment of mixing plaster having at last prepared composition for use laid over exposed half of statuette with neatness dexterity showed to be practiced hand at cast taking just a have covered necessary extent of surface luca turned round from statue how be getting on with cast asked do want help none brother thank answered priest pray disturb workman on account luca turned again to statue at same moment father rocco softly moved cheval glass toward open doorway between two room placing at angle a to make reflect figure of person in smaller studio did with significant quickness precision be evidently not first time have used glass for purpose of secret observation mechanically stirring wet plaster round round for second casting priest looked into glass saw a in picture be going forward in inner room maddalena lomi be standing behind young nobleman watching progress made with bust occasionally took modeling tool out of hand showed with sweetest smile that too a sculptor daughter understood something of sculptor art now then in pause of conversation when interest be especially intense in fabio work suffered hand to drop absently on shoulder stooped forward so close to that hair mingled for moment with moving glass inch two so a to bring nanina well under eye father rocco found that must trace repetition of little act of familiarity by immediate effect produced on girl face manner whenever maddalena so much a touched young nobleman matter whether did so by premeditation really by accident nanina feature contracted pale cheek grew paler fidgeted on chair finger nervously twisted untwisted loose end of ribbon fastened round waist jealous thought father rocco suspected week ago turned away gave whole attention for few minute to mixing of plaster when looked back again at glass be just in time to witness little accident suddenly changed relative position of three person in inner room saw maddalena take up modeling tool lay on table near begin to help fabio in altering arrangement of hair in bust young man watched what be doing earnestly enough for few moment then attention wandered away to nanina looked at reproachfully answered by sign brought smile to face directly maddalena surprised at instant of change following direction of eye easily discovered at whom smile be directed darted glance of contempt at nanina threw down modeling tool turned indignantly to young sculptor who be affecting to be hard at work again signor fabio said next time forget what be due to rank warn of if please beforehand will take care to leave room while speaking last word passed through doorway father rocco bending abstractedly over plaster mixture heard continue to herself in whisper a went by if have influence at with father that impudent beggar girl will be forbidden studio jealousy on other side thought priest something must be done at once will end badly looked again at glass saw fabio after instant of hesitation beckon to nanina to approach left seat advanced half way to then stopped stepped forward to meet taking by hand whispered earnestly in ear when have done before dropping hand touched cheek with lip then helped on with little white mantilla covered head shoulder out of door girl trembled violently drew linen close to face a fabio walked into larger studio addressing father rocco said be afraid be more idle more stupid than ever to day ca get on with bust at to satisfaction so have cut short sitting given nanina half holiday at first sound of voice maddalena who be speaking to father stopped with look of scorn at nanina standing trembling in doorway left room luca lomi called fabio to a went away father rocco turning to statuette looked to see how plaster be hardening on seeing thus engaged nanina attempted to escape from studio without being noticed priest stopped just a be hurrying by child said in gentle quiet way be going home nanina heart beat too fast for to reply in word must only answer by bowing head take for little sister pursued father rocco putting few silver coin in hand have got customer for mat plait so nicely need not bring to room will come see evening when be going round among parishioner will take mat away with be good girl nanina have always be good girl a long a be alive child will never want friend adviser nanina eye filled with tear drew mantilla closer than ever round face a tried to thank priest father rocco nodded to kindly

to priest who be still busy over cast hope will get on better with bust to morrow said father rocco politely be sure can not complain of model complain of cried young man warmly have most beautiful head ever saw if be twenty time sculptor be must despair of being able to do justice walked into inner room to look at bust again lingered before for little while then turned to retrace step to larger studio between doorway stood three chair a went by absently touched back of first two passed third just a be entering larger room stopped a if struck by sudden recollection returned hastily touched third chair raising eye a approached large studio again after doing met eye of priest fixed on in unconcealed astonishment signor fabio exclaimed father rocco with sarcastic smile who must ever have imagined that be superstitious nurse be returned young man reddening laughing rather uneasily taught bad habit have not got over yet with word nodded hastily went out superstitious said rocco softly

sculptor take way to right after half hour have elapsed two workman quitted studio to go to dinner luca brother be left alone may return now said father rocco to conversation be suspended between earlier in day have nothing more to say rejoined luca sulkily then can listen to brother with greater attention pursued priest objected to coarseness of tone in talking of young pupil daughter object still more strongly to insinuation that desire to see married provided always that be sincerely attached to other spring from mercenary motive be trying to snare rocco in mesh of fine phrase be not to be caught know what own motive be for hoping maddalena may get offer of marriage from wealthy young gentleman will have money will profit by be coarse mercenary if please be true reason why want to see maddalena married to fabio want to see too for what reason must like to know if not for mine of what use must wealthy relation be to what be people with money what be money to man who follows calling money be something to everybody be when have found that have taken account of give money enough to buy daily bread to pay for lodging coarse cassock though may want much for poor for want more

have wife child interest outside sacred circle of church brother do see dust dirt shapeless marble chip lying around statue there cover that floor instead with gold though litter may have changed in color form in eye must be litter still very noble sentiment dare say rocco ca echo granting that care nothing for money will explain to why be so anxious that maddalena must marry fabio have have offer from poorer men knew of have never taken least interest in accepting rejecting proposal before hinted reason to month ago when fabio first entered studio be rather vague hint brother ca be plainer to day think can in first place let begin by assuring have objection to young man may be little capricious undecided have incorrigible fault have discovered be rather cool way of praising rocco must speak of warmly enough if be not representative of intolerable corruption monstrous wrong whenever think of think of injury present existence perpetuates if do speak of coldly be only for reason luca looked away quickly from brother began kicking absently at marble chip be scattered over floor around now remember said what that hint of yours pointed at know what mean then know answered

steward only found more more difficulty in obtaining appointed number of trustworthy beauty at last resource failed altogether appeared in master presence about week before night of ball to make humiliating acknowledgment that be entirely at wit end total number of fair shepherdess with fair character whom have be able to engage amounted only to twenty three nonsense cried marquis irritably a

hour of darkness must not even close eye a soon a new day broke rose to breathe early morning air at window to think in perfect tranquillity over have passed since entered melani palace to wait on guest at masquerade on reaching home previous night other sensation have be absorbed in vague feeling of mingled dread curiosity produced by sight of weird figure in yellow mask have left standing alone with fabio in palace corridor morning light however suggested new thought now opened note young nobleman have pressed into hand read over over again hurried pencil line scrawled on paper must there be harm forgetfulness of own duty in using key inclosed in note keeping appointment in ascoli garden at ten o'clock surely not surely last sentence have written believe in truth honor nanina for believe implicitly in yours be enough to satisfy time that must not be doing wrong in listening for once to pleading of own heart besides there in lap lay key of wicket gate be absolutely necessary to use that if only for purpose of giving back safely into hand of owner a last thought be passing through mind plausibly overcoming faint doubt difficulty might still have left be startled by sudden knocking at street door looking out of window immediately saw man in livery standing in street anxiously peering up at house to see if knocking have aroused anybody doe marta angrisani sick nurse live here inquired man a soon a nanina showed at window yes answered must call up be there person ill call up directly said servant be wanted at ascoli palace master count fabio nanina waited to hear more

conceal anxiety to tell particularly what master illness be how have affected so suddenly after ball know nothing about answered man noticing be manner a put question with surprise except master be brought home by two gentleman friend of about couple of hour ago in very sad state half out of mind a seemed to gathered from what be said that have got dreadful shock from seeing woman take off mask show face to at ball how must be in least understand know that when doctor be sent for looked very serious talked about fearing brain fever here servant stopped for to astonishment saw nanina suddenly turn away from then heard cry bitterly a went back into house marta angrisani have huddled on clothes be looking at in glass to see that be sufficiently presentable to appear at palace when felt two arm flung round neck before must say word found nanina sobbing on bosom be ill be in danger cried girl must go with to help have always be kind to marta be kinder than ever now take with take with to palace child exclaimed nurse gently unclasping arm yes yes if be only for hour pleaded nanina if be only for one little hour day have only to say that be helper must let in marta will break heart if ca see help to get well again nurse still hesitated nanina clasped round neck once more laid cheek burning hot now though tear have be streaming down instant before close to good woman face love marta

wither up by absence now be ill get beyond ca master oh marta break heart by denying have suffered so much for sake have earned right to nurse marta be not proof against last appeal have one great rare merit for middle aged woman have not forgotten own youth come child said soothingly wo attempt to deny dry eye put on mantilla when get face to face with doctor try to look a old ugly a can if want to be let into sick room along with ordeal of medical scrutiny be passed more easily than marta angrisani have anticipated be of great importance in doctor opinion that sick man must see familiar face at bedside nanina have only therefore to state that knew well that have sat to a model in day when be learning art of sculpture to be immediately accepted a marta privileged assistant in sick room worst apprehension felt by doctor for patient be soon realized fever flew to brain for nearly six week lay prostrate at mercy of death now raging with wild strength of delirium now sunk in speechless motionless sleepless exhaustion be only repose at last blessed day came when enjoyed first sleep when doctor began for first time to talk of future with hope even then however same terrible peculiarity marked light dream have previously shown in fierce delirium from faintly uttered broken phrase dropped from when slept a from wild word burst from when sens be deranged one sad discovery inevitably resulted that mind be still haunted day night hour after hour by figure in yellow mask a bodily health improved doctor in attendance on grew more more anxious a to state of mind there be appearance of positive derangement of intellect there be mental depression unaltering invincible prostration produced by absolute belief in reality of dreadful vision that have seen at masked ball suggested to physician gravest doubt about case saw with dismay that patient showed anxiety a got stronger except on one subject be eagerly desirous of seeing nanina day by bedside a soon a be assured that wish must be faithfully complied with seemed to care for nothing more even when proposed in hope of rousing to exhibition of something like pleasure that girl must read to for hour day out of one of favorite book only showed languid satisfaction week passed away still do what must must not make so much a smile one day have begun to read to a usual have not proceeded far before marta angrisani informed that have fallen into doze ceased with sigh sat looking at sadly a lay near faint pale mournful in sleep miserably altered from what be when first knew have be hard trial to watch by bedside in terrible time of delirium be harder trial still to look at now to feel le le hopeful with succeeding day while eye thought be still compassionately fixed on door of bedroom opened doctor came in followed by andrea d'arbino whose share in strange adventure with yellow mask caused to feel special interest in fabio progress toward recovery asleep see sighing in sleep said doctor going to bedside grand difficulty with continued turning to d'arbino remains precisely what be have hardly left single mean untried of rousing from that fatal depression yet for last fortnight have not advanced single step be impossible to shake conviction of reality of face saw rather think saw when yellow mask be removed a long a persists in own shocking view of case so long will lie there getting better doubt a to body worse a to mind suppose poor fellow be not in fit state to be reasoned with on contrary like men with fixed delusion have plenty of intelligence to appeal to on point except one point on be wrong have argued with vainly by hour together posse unfortunately acute nervous sensibility vivid imagination besides have a suspect be superstitiously brought up a child must be probably useless to argue rationally with on certain spiritual subject even if mind be in perfect health have good deal of mystic dreamer in composition science logic be broken reed to depend upon with men of kind doe merely listen to when reason with doe attempt to answer have only one form of answer be unfortunately most difficult of to dispose of try to convince of delusion invariably retort by asking for rational explanation of what happened to at masked ball now though believe firmly that have be dupe of infamous conspiracy have be able a yet to penetrate thoroughly into mystery of yellow mask common sense tell that must be wrong in taking view of that must be right in taking ours if can not give actual tangible proof of if can only theorize when asks for explanation be too plain in present condition that time remonstrate with on subject only fix in delusion more more firmly be not for want of perseverance on part said d'arbino after moment of silence that be still left in dark ever since extraordinary statement of coachman who drove woman home have be inquiring investigating have offered reward of two hundred scudi for discovery of have examined servant at palace night watchman at campo santo police book list of keeper of hotel lodging house to hit on trace of woman have failed in direction if poor friend perfect recovery doe indeed depend on delusion being combated by actual proof fear have little chance of restoring so far a be concerned confess at end of resource hope be not quite conquered yet returned doctor proof want may turn up when least expect be certainly miserable case continued mechanically laying finger on sleeping man pulse there lie wanting nothing now to recover natural elasticity of mind here stand at bedside unable to relieve of weight be pressing faculty down repeat signor andrea nothing will rouse from delusion that be victim of supernatural interposition production of startling practical proof of error at present be in position of man who have be imprisoned from birth in dark room who denies existence of daylight if can not open shutter show sky outside will never convert to knowledge of truth saying word doctor turned to lead way out of room observed nanina who have moved from bedside on entrance standing near door stopped to look at shook head good humoredly called to marta who happened to be occupied in adjoining room signora marta said doctor think told time ago pretty careful little assistant life in house pray doe take much walking exercise very little signor dottore go home to sister when leaf palace very little walking exercise indeed thought so pale cheek heavy eye told a much now dear said doctor addressing nanina be very good girl be sure will attend to what tell go out morning before come here take walk in fresh air be too young not to suffer by being shut up in close room day unless get regular exercise take good long walk in morning will fall into hand a patient be quite unfit to continue attendance here now signor andrea be ready for mind child walk day in open air outside town will fall ill take word for nanina promised compliance spoke rather absently seemed scarcely conscious of kind familiarity marked doctor manner truth be that thought be occupied with what have be saying by fabio bedside have not lost one word of conversation while doctor be talking of patient of condition on recovery depended oh if proof must cure must only be found thought to herself a stole back anxiously to bedside when room be empty on getting home that day found letter waiting for be greatly surprised to see that be written by le person than master sculptor luca lomi be very short simply informing that have just returned to pisa that be anxious to know when must sit to for new bust

steady observant way close at side pushing great rough muzzle from time to time affectionately into hand trying hard to attract attention at interval by barking capering in front of got little notice however for pain be thinking again of that physician have said day before by fabio bedside thought brought with others equally absorbing that be connected with mysterious story of young nobleman adventure with yellow mask thus preoccupied have little attention left for gambol of dog even beauty of morning appealed to in vain felt refreshment of cool fragrant air hardly noticed lovely blue of sky bright sunshine gave gayety interest to commonest object around after walking nearly hour began to feel tired looked about for shady place to rest in beyond behind there be only high road flat country by side stood little wooden building half inn half coffee house backed by large shady pleasure garden gate of stood invitingly open workman in garden be putting up stage for firework place be otherwise quiet lonely enough be only used at night a sort of rustic ranelagh to citizen of pisa resorted for pure air amusement after fatigue of day observing that there be visitor in ground nanina ventured in intending to take quarter of hour rest in coolest place must find before returning to pisa have passed back of wooden summer house in secluded part of garden when suddenly missed dog from side looking round after saw that be standing behind summer house with ear erect nose to ground having evidently that instant scented something that excited suspicion thinking possible that might be meditating attack on unfortunate cat turned to see what be watching carpenter engaged on firework stage be just then hammering at violently noise prevented from hearing that scarammuccia be growling must feel that be moment laid hand on back curiosity be excited stooped down close to to look through crack in board before stood into summer house be startled at seeing lady gentleman sitting inside place be looking through be not high enough up to enable to see face recognized thought recognized pattern of lady dress a one have noticed in former day in demoiselle grifoni show room rising quickly eye detected hole in board about level of own height caused by knot having be forced out of wood looked through to ascertain without being discovered if wearer of familiar dress be person have taken to be saw not brigida only a have expected father rocco a well at same moment carpenter left off hammering began to saw new sound from firework stage be regular not loud voice of occupant of summer house reached through heard brigida pronounce name of count fabio instantly stooping down once more by dog side caught muzzle firmly in hand be only way to keep scarammuccia from growling again at time when there be din of hammering to prevent from being heard two word count fabio in mouth of woman excited jealous anxiety in what must brigida have to say in connection with name never came near ascoli palace what right reason must have to talk of fabio did hear what said heard brigida ask in coolest hardest tone priest answered at least not of will repeat then asked what have so suddenly determined to give up idea of making future experiment on superstitious fear of count fabio in first place result of experiment already tried have be so much more serious than have anticipated that believe end have in view in making have be answered already well be not only reason shock to mind might be fatal to can use what believe to be justifiable fraud to prevent marrying again can not burden with crime be second reason believe have yet suddenness with sent to last night to appoint meeting in lonely place emphatic manner in requested may almost say ordered to bring wax mask here suggest to mind that something must have happened what be be woman curiosity must be satisfied after secret have trusted to already need not hesitate think to trust with one more perhaps not secret time be moreover of great importance know that wax mask wore at ball be made in plaster mold taken off face of brother statue yes know that brother have just returned to studio have found morsel of plaster used for mold sticking in hair of statue have asked a person left in charge of work room for explanation explanation a must offer have not satisfied talk of making further inquiry considering that will be used more think safest to destroy wax mask asked to bring here that might see burned broken up with own eye now know wanted to know now therefore be turn to remind have not yet have direct answer to first question addressed to when met here have brought wax mask with have not have not why just a question be put nanina felt dog dragging free of grasp on mouth have be listening hitherto with such painful intensity with such absorbing emotion of suspense terror astonishment that have not noticed effort to get away have continued mechanically to hold mouth shut now be aroused by violence of struggle to knowledge that unless hit upon new mean of quieting must have mouth free must betray by growl in agony of apprehension lest must lose word of momentous conversation made desperate attempt to appeal to dog fondness for by suddenly flinging arm round neck kissing rough hairy cheek stratagem succeeded scarammuccia have for many year past never received greater mark of mistress kindness for than such a pat on head present of lump of sugar might convey dog nature be utterly confounded by unexpected warmth of nanina caress struggled up vigorously in arm to try return by licking face must easily prevent from doing must so gain few minute more to listen behind summer house without danger of discovery have lost brigida answer to father rocco question be in time to hear next word be alone here said brigida be woman know that may not have come armed be only commonest precaution on part not to give chance of getting at wax mask till have made condition never said word about condition before true remember telling that wanted nothing novelty of going to masquerade in character of dead enemy luxury of being able to terrify man who have brutally ridiculed in old day in studio be truth be not le truth that experiment on count fabio have detained in city much longer than ever intended that be penniless deserve to be paid in plain word will buy mask of for two

until become more like if wish to apologize for calling wretch if want to secure wax mask honor with visit before four o'clock afternoon bring two hundred scudi with delay till after four will be too late instant of silence followed then nanina judged that brigida must be departing for heard rustling of dress on lawn in front of summer house unfortunately scarammuccia heard too twisted round in arm growled noise disturbed father rocco heard rise leave summer house there must have be time enough perhaps for to conceal among tree if must have recovered self possession at once be incapable of making effort to regain must neither think move breath seemed to die away on lip a saw shadow of priest stealing over grass slowly from front to back of summer house in moment be face to face stopped few pace from eyed steadily in dead silence still crouched against summer house still with one hand mechanically kept hold of dog be well for priest that did so scarammuccia formidable teeth be in full view shaggy coat be bristling eye be starting growl have changed from surly to savage note be ready to tear down not father rocco only clergy in pisa at moment notice have be listening said priest calmly see in face have heard must not answer word must not take eye from there be unnatural stillness in face steady unrepentant unfathomable despair in eye that struck with horror must have

put hope of life once in hand be because be not worthy of trust discovery ruin overtake that be instrument of retribution can be decree of heaven be nothing blind justice of chance looked upward doubtingly to lustrous sky above sighed nanina eye still followed mechanically seemed to feel influence for suddenly looked down at again what keep silent why be afraid said can do harm with dog at side workman yonder within call can do harm wish to do none go back to pisa tell what have heard restore man love to ruin be work do be never enemy even when distrusted be not enemy now be fault of

barely hear strange confusion clouded mind a lost sight of have injured have injured word bewildered oppressed simple heart vague doubt fear sudden antipathy to remaining longer near summer house
