told consul what horace told namely that nurse in black dress be to be seen in place if there have be person must certainly prussian inform have be found in attendance on injured frenchman cross of geneva convention must have be amply sufficient to protect woman wearing that badge of honor must have disgraced by abandoning wounded men before german entered place in short interposed lady janet

identity miss roseberry affair think likely enough well what happens after that wounded woman be brought to life by operation becomes delirious in hospital at mannheim during delirium idea of miss roseberry identity ferment in brain assumes present perverted form in form still remains a necessary consequence persists in reversing two identity say be miss roseberry declares miss roseberry to be

mercy sense of right instead of accepting expression of sincere contrition encouraging to make completest speediest atonement grace have evidently outraged insulted a necessary result endurance have given way under own sense of intolerable severity intolerable wrong remedy for mischief thus done be a julian have first seen to speak privately with grace to soothe by owning that opinion of justice of claim have undergone change in favor then to persuade in own interest to let carry to mercy such expression of apology regret a might lead to friendly understanding between with motif have made request to be permitted to speak separately to one other scene have followed new insult offered by grace answer have wrung from mercy have convinced that such interference a have contemplated must have slightest prospect of success only remedy now left to try be desperate remedy of letting thing take course trusting implicitly to mercy better nature for result let see police officer in plain

confidence in be confidence soundly placed must nobly pardon outrage have be heaped upon must do justice to woman whom have wronged if on other hand belief in be nothing better than blind belief of infatuated man if faced alternative persisted in asserting assumed identity what then julian faith in mercy refused to let darker side of question find place in thought rested entirely with to bring

janet want with whatever be will not keep long away from will be quite alone here have warned servant not to show one in with word left mercy first sensation be sensation of relief soon lost in feeling of shame at weakness must welcome temporary relief in position a hers emotion thus roused merged in turn into sense of impatient regret for lady janet message thought to herself might have known fate by time slow minute followed other drearily paced to fro in library faster faster under intolerable irritation maddening uncertainty of own suspense ere long even spacious room seemed to be too small for sober monotony of long book lined shelf oppressed offended threw open door led into dining room dashed in eager for change of object athirst for more space more air at first step checked rooted to spot under sudden revulsion of feeling quieted in instant room be only illuminated by waning fire light man be obscurely visible seated on sofa with elbow on knee head resting on hand looked up a open door let in light from library lamp mellow glow reached face revealed julian gray mercy be standing with back to light face being necessarily hidden in deep shadow recognized by figure by attitude into unconsciously fell that unsought grace that lithe long beauty of line belonged to one woman in house rose approached have be wishing to see said hoping accident might bring about such meeting a offered chair mercy hesitated before took seat be first meeting alone since lady janet have interrupted at moment when be about to confide to julian melancholy story of past be anxious to seize opportunity of returning to confession term in have addressed seemed to imply put question to in plain word feel deepest interest in hearing that have still to confide to answered anxious a may be will not hurry will wait if wish be afraid must own do wish mercy rejoined not on account because time be at disposal of horace holmcroft expect to see in few minute must give few minute julian asked have something on side to say to think ought to know before see one horace included spoke with certain depression of tone be not associated with previous experience of face looked prematurely old careworn in red light of fire something have plainly happened to sadden to disappoint since have last met willingly offer time have at own command mercy replied doe what have to tell relate to lady janet gave direct reply what have to tell of lady janet said gravely be soon told so far a be concerned have nothing more to dread lady janet know even heavy weight of oppression caused by impending interview with horace failed to hold place in mercy mind when julian answered in word come into lighted room said faintly be too terrible to hear say that in dark julian followed into library limb trembled under dropped into chair shrank under great bright eye a stood by side looking sadly down on lady janet know repeated with head on breast tear falling slowly over cheek have told have said nothing to lady janet to one confidence be sacred confidence to until have spoken first have lady janet said anything to not word have looked at with vigilant eye of love have listened to with quick hearing of love have found own way to truth will not speak of to will not speak of to living creature only know now how dearly loved in spite of cling to still life poor soul have be barren one unworthy miserably unworthy of such nature a hers marriage be loveless childless have have admirer never in higher sense of word friend best year of life have be wasted in unsatisfied longing for something to love at end of life have filled void heart have found youth again through at age at age be such tie a to be rudely broken at mere bidding of circumstance will suffer anything risk anything forgive anything rather than own even to herself that have be deceived in there be more than happiness at stake there be pride noble pride in such love a hers will ignore plainest discovery deny most unanswerable truth be firmly convinced from own knowledge of character from what have observed in to day that will find excuse for refusing to hear confession more than believe if exertion of influence can do that will leave mean untried of preventing from acknowledging true position here to living creature take serious responsibility on in telling shrink from ought to know will know what trial what temptation may yet lie before paused leaving mercy time to compose if wished to speak to felt that there be necessity for speaking to be plainly not aware that lady janet have already written to to defer promised explanation circumstance be in confirmation of opinion have expressed ought to mention to tried to mention to be not equal to effort few simple word in have touched on tie bound lady janet to have wrung heart tear choked must only sign to to go on may wonder at speaking so positively continued with nothing better than own conviction to justify can only say have watched lady janet too closely to feel doubt saw moment in truth flashed on a plainly a now see did not disclose gradually burst on a burst on suspected nothing be frankly indignant at sudden interference strange language until time came in pledged to produce mercy merrick then then only truth broke on mind trebly revealed to in word voice look then then only saw marked change come over remain in while remained in room dread to think of what may do in first reckless despair of discovery that have made distrust though god know be not naturally suspicious man most apparently trifling event be now taking place about have held nobly to resolution to own truth prepare before evening be over to be tried tempted again mercy lifted head fear took place of grief in eye a rested in startled inquiry on julian face how be possible that temptation can come to now asked will leave to event to answer question said will not have long to wait in meantime have put on guard stooped spoke next word earnestly close at ear hold fast by admirable courage have shown thus far went on suffer anything rather than suffer degradation of be woman whom once spoke of woman still have in mind who can nobly reveal

looking toward door through have lately passed in instant saw mean to end hardly waiting to hear few kind expression of sympathy approval addressed to hinted timidly at proposal have now to make to be going back into next room asked not if object to replied object want to be there after horace have joined yes after horace have joined do wish to see when be over summoned resolution told frankly what

persuasion on for first time between perplexity distress julian be for moment at loss how to answer love for mercy dared not acknowledge be a vital feeling in a faith in have be free to avow to refuse anything that asked of in sore need more even than to refuse to hear confession have be first impulse to make to be cruel sacrifice to sense of what be due to horace of what be due to shrink a might even from appearance of deserting be impossible for except under reserve be almost equivalent to denial to grant request can do will do said door will be left unclosed will remain in next room on condition horace know of a well a must be unworthy of confidence in if consented to be listener on other term understand that be sure a well a do have never thought of proposal to in light woman like

circumstance where be horace time asked why be not here have be called away answered by message from lady janet reply more than astonished julian seemed almost to alarm returned to mercy chair said to eagerly be sure horace told that lady janet have insisted on seeing when not long ago asked to wait for here while went upstairs julian face darkened ominously confirms worst fear said have have communication with lady janet mercy replied by showing aunt note read carefully through did not tell said that must find excuse for refusing to hear confession begin by delaying simply to gain time

doubt of success judging by what have already seen of doubt be confirmed in ordinary intercourse of life must merely have thought commonplace uninteresting woman seeing a saw while be alone in other word penetrating below surface have never in sad experience met with hopelessly narrow mean low nature a hers understanding a must not fail to do what sudden change in lady janet behavior toward really meant one idea be to take cruelest possible advantage of so far from feeling consideration for be only additionally imbittered toward protested against being permitted to claim merit of placing in right position here by own voluntary avowal of truth insisted on publicly denouncing on forcing lady janet to dismiss unheard before whole household can have revenge at last lady janet be afraid of be own word be almost ashamed to repeat on honor be own word possible humiliation to be heaped on consideration to be shown for lady janet age lady janet position nothing absolutely nothing to be allowed to interfere with miss roseberry vengeance miss roseberry triumph there be woman shameless view of what be due to a stated by in plainest term kept temper did must to bring to better frame of

resource only friend be friend in canada after what have said to in boudoir must be quite useless to appeal to sympathy of julian gray in pecuniary sense in one word be absolutely incapable of gratifying own vindictive longing there sat mistress of mablethorpe house perfectly well aware of lady janet pointed to empty chair suppose sit down again suggested course of interview seems to have brought back to question that asked when came into room instead of threatening with law suppose consider propriety of permitting to be of use to be in habit of assisting lady in embarrassed circumstance nobody know of steward who keep account once more let inquire if little advance of pecuniary sort delicately offered must be acceptable to grace returned slowly to chair that have left stood by with one hand grasping top rail with eye fixed in mocking scrutiny on lady janet face at last ladyship show hand said hush money will send back to paper rejoined lady janet how obstinate be grace hand closed tighter tighter round rail of chair without witness without mean without so much a refuge thanks to own coarse cruelty of language conduct in sympathy of others sense of isolation helplessness be almost maddening at final moment woman of finer sensibility must have instantly left room grace impenetrably hard narrow mind impelled to meet emergency in very different way last base vengeance to lady janet have voluntarily exposed herself be still within reach for present thought there be one way of being even with ladyship can cost a much a possible pray make allowance for said

protectress must probably have be dismissed in few week with year salary to compensate with recommendation to suitable employment what must be fair compensation now lady janet decided that five year salary immediately given future assistance rendered if necessary must represent fit remembrance of late colonel roseberry claim liberal pecuniary acknowledgment of harshness of treatment grace might have sustained at hand at same time for further satisfying of own conscience determined to discover sum grace must consider sufficient by simple process of making grace propose term be impossible for to make offer said for reason need of money will depend greatly on future plan be quite ignorant of future plan '' perhaps ladyship will kindly advise said grace satirically can not altogether undertake to advise lady janet replied can only suppose that will scarcely remain in england where have friend whether go to law with not will surely feel necessity of communicating personally with friend in canada be right grace be quite quick enough to understand a be meant properly interpreted answer signified if take compensation in money be understood a part of bargain that remain in
