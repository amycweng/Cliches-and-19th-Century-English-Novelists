maurice to join if chose did not choose have come there ever so much earlier than need have done dragging aunt with because marian have told that service must be specially required by now a soon a saw went away with two officerswent away without vouchsafing word made up mind there on spot that must never think of againnever speak to otherwise than might speak to most indifferent of mortal yet be man must struggle right manfully with world trouble one who have struggled with from boyhood have never be overcome now be unable to conceal bitterness of wrath because little girl have ridden off to look for green spot for tablecloth without asking assistance picnic be think in general rather tedious for elderly people who accompany when joint become little stiff dinner be eaten most comfortably with accompaniment of chair table roof overhead be agrment de nevertheless picnic can not exist without certain allowance of elderly people miss marians captain ewing can not go out to dine on grass without one to look after so elderly people go to picnic in dull tame way doing duty wishing day over now on morning in question when marian rode off with captain ewing lieutenant graham maurice cumming remained among elderly people certain mr pomken great jamaica agriculturist one of council man who have known good old time got by button held fast discoursing wisely of sugar ruin of gadsden pan recreant negro on of subject maurice cumming be known to have opinion of own a mr pomkens word sounded into one ear into other fell note listened to from afarthe shrill laughing voice of marian leslie a gave happy order to satellite around ever anon bass haw haw of captain ewing who be made welcome a chief of attendant that evening in whisper to brother councillor mr pomken communicated opinion that after there be not so much in young cumming a people said mr pomken have idea that young cumming be in love then dinner came spread over acre maurice be among last who seated when did so be in awkward comfortless corner behind mr pomkens back far away from laughter mirth of day yet from comfortless corner must see marian a sat in pride of power with friend julia davis near flirt a bad a herself satellite around obedient to nod happy in smile now wont allow more champagne said marian who will there be steady enough to help over rock to grotto oh have promised cried captain indeed have not have julia miss davis have certainly promised said lieutenant have made promise dont think will go at said julia who be sometimes inclined to imagine captain ewing must be own property much more of kind maurice cumming must not hear must seeand imagine be worse how innocent inane be after flirting of most young lady if word doings in line must be brought to paper know whether there be a rule more vocal expression of sentiment of love between man woman than there be between two thrush whistle call to other guided by instinct rather than by reason be going home with lady to night believe said maurice to miss jack immediately after dinner miss jack acknowledged that such be destination for night then going back to spanish town at once wont hurt onefor to tell truth have have enough of work why maurice be in such hurry to come more fool so now be in hurry to go away dont notice to anybody miss jack looked in face saw that be really wretched knew cause of wretchedness dont go yet maurice said then added with tenderness be quite uncommon with go to maurice speak to openly freely once for will find that will listen then dear maurice do for sake made answer walked away roaming sadly by among tree listen exclaimed to yes will alter dozen time in a many hour who can care for creature can change a change yet must not help caring for a went on climbing among rock again came upon sound of voice heard especially that of captain ewing now miss leslie if will take hand will soon be over difficulty then party of seven eight scrambling over stone came nearly on level on stood in full view of leading others be captain ewing miss leslie turned on heel to go away when caught sound of step following voice saying oh there be mr cumming want to speak to in minute light hand be on arm why be running away from said marian becauseoh dont know be not running away have party made up be not going to intrude on what nonsense do come now be going to wonderful grotto thought so ill natured of not joining at dinner indeed know have promised did not answer looked at herfull in face with sad eye laden with love half understood countenance only half understood be matter maurice said be angry with will come join marian can not do if can leave come with for hour will not keep longer stood hesitating moment while companion remained on spot where have left come miss leslie called captain ewing will have dark before can get down will come with whispered to maurice wait moment tripped back in five minute returned after eager argument with friend there said dont care about grotto one bit will walk with nowonly will think so odd so started off together before tropical darkness have fallen upon maurice have told tale of loveand have told in manner differing much from that of marians usual admirer spoke with passion almost with violence declared that heart be so full of image that must not rid of for one minute must wish to do so said if must be marian own marian very own if not then explained to with lover warmth with almost more than lover liberty what be idea of being own very own in doing so inveighed against usual light heartedness in term at rate be strong enough marian here well perhaps knew that lesson be somewhat deserved perhaps appreciated at value love of such man a maurice cumming weighing in judgment difference between ewings graham then answered well prudently with word startled by prudent seriousness a coming from begged pardon heartily said for grief have caused yet how be to be blamed seeing that have known nothing of feeling father mother have said something to of proposed marriage something very little have answered by saying that did not think maurice have warmer regard for than of cousin after answer father

towards perfecting dearest hope a to make formal offer to marion nevertheless did gather that thing be fast way tending if only dancing be over said to herself dreading unnumbered waltz with ewing
