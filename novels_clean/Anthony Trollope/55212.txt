not go on altogether unaltered there be felt fate in thing necessity in dark way within own mind connected with fall of adam general imperfection of humanity demanded change be always change for worse therefore though to around be mostly silent on matter be afflicted by general idea that world be going on towards ruin that thing throve with herself be not sufficient for comfort for being good woman with large heart be anxious for welfare not only of herself of child for of who might come after at rate in own locality thus when found that there be tendency to dine at one instead of twelve to wear same clothes on week day a on sunday to desire easy chair linen must be bleached absolutely white thought a to failing condition of world must get better of make melancholy trait be perhaps evidence of weakness of toryism then frau frohmann also have strength be thoroughly pervaded by determination in a far a in lay have aught to do with must be well to do in world be grand ambition in mind that creature connected with establishment from oldest most time honoured guest down to last stray cat have taken refuge under roof must always have enough to eat hunger unsatisfied hunger disagreeable

devotee smoking of many pipe fill up vacant hour of men at brunnenthal dinner be great glory of day must be vain for sthetical guest who might conceive to be superior to allurement of table to make little of frau dinner one have better seek other quarter for summer holiday at brunnenthal peacock be necessary that must believe in paramount importance of dinner not to come to at appointed time must create first marvel in frau mind then pity a to state of health at last hot anger must be found that such neglect arose from contempt what muse will assist to describe dinner in few word be commenced of course by soup real soup not barley broth with strong prevalence of barley then must follow boiled meat from soup be supposed to have be made such boiled meat so good that supposition must have contained falsehood with there must be always potato pickled cabbage various relish then there must be two other kind of meat generally with accompaniment of stewed fruit after fish trout from neighbouring stream for preservation of great tank have be made vegetable with unknown sauce must follow then must come roast consisted always of poultry be accompanied of course by salad be after be made effort on frau fame most depended pudding think be subject of greatest struggle most complete success two pudding daily be by rule of house required to be eaten not two pudding brought together so that might choose with careless haste one other two separate course of pudding with interval between for appreciation for thought for digestion one can doubt be declined absolute punishment such a notice to leave house follows such abstention frau be displeased when dressed in best on sunday doe not smile on who abstain after pudding there be dessert there be little cake to nibble if will be nibbled very freely heat of battle be over with second pudding have great fame banquet so that lady gentleman from innsbruck have driven out here to enjoy distance way be from two to three hour so that pleasant holiday be made by visit to frau establishment there be ramble up to waterfall smoking of pipe among rock pleasant opportunity for secret whisper among young people frau must not be well pleased if be presumed that great inducement for visit be not to be found in dinner provides in way though guest at house may not exceed perhaps thirty in number will sometimes be case nearly twice a many be seated at board that frau have eye to profit can not be doubted fond of money be certainly fond of prosperity generally judging merely from what come beneath eye observer will be led to suppose that sole ambition on occasion be to see food have provided devoured by guest weak stomach halting appetite conscientious scruple a to over enjoyment of victual restraint in reference to subsequent excess subsequent eating thing be scandal to if cant wont dont eat dinner when get ought not to go to brunnenthal peacock banqueting hall speise saal occupies great part of first floor here also be drawing room reading room a be called having over door lese saal painted so that purpose may not be doubted reading room be not much guest generally spend time chiefly out of door in bedroom when be not banqueting there be two other banquet breakfast supper need not be specially described of latter may be said that be curtailed dinner having limited course of hot meat only one pudding on floor there be bedroom two nest of others above accommodation be chiefly afforded in other building of one opposite be longer though not so high a central house there be little down road near mill a far up stream where bath have be built innovation to frau frohmann did not lend without much inward suffering there be huge barn many stable for frau keep posting establishment

grouped nature have so surrounded that can hardly find anywhere prettier spot behind house so a to leave only space for little meadow be always a green a irrigation can make hill rise not high enough to be called mountain be pine clad from foot to summit in front around ground be broken immediately before door there be way up to lateral valley down come nameless stream just below house make way

visitor come upon waterfall waterfall at innsbruck be so often made to be excuse of outing be in truth performed in quest of frau frohmanns dinner below peacock where mill be placed valley be closely confined a sombre pine forest rise abruptly on side here very little lower be that gloomy ghost like pas through rock be called hllenthor name will not translate be narrow ravine very dark in dark

spread rising however rapidly here modern engineering have carried road in various curve turn round knoll of hill spur of mountain till traveller a ascends hardly know way be going from one two point among curve view down upon peacock with various appendage with dark red roof many window glittering in sun be so charming that tourist be almost led to think that must have be placed a be with view to effect frau be what used to be called personable woman to say that be handsome must hardly convey proper idea let reader suppose woman of about fifty very tall of large dimension must be unjust to call fat because though very large be still symmetrical when be dressed in full tyrolese costume be always case at certain hour on sunday on other stated by mean unfrequent day a to be never quite able to learn exact rule when be so dressed arm be bare down from shoulder such arm never saw on human being back be very broad bust expansive head stand erect upon a head of old juno in motion though doubt whether must climb by mountain path to parish church display certain stately alertness forbids one to call fat smile when really mean to smile to show thereby good will to be gracious be a sweet a hebe then be that see that in prime must in truth have be lovely woman there be at moment kindness in eye playfulness about mouth be apt to make think that can do what like with frau who have not at time be charmed by frolic playfulness of tiger not that frau frohmann have aught of tiger in nature power power be there not unfrequently sign of power if be thwarted contradicted counselled by unauthorised counsellor above if be censured then sign of power be shown then frau doe not smile at such time be wont to speak mind very plainly to make who hear understand that within precinct purlieu of brunnenthal peacock be irresponsible despot there have be guest there rash enough to find trifling fault with comfort provided for whose bed perhaps have be too hard towel too limited perhaps hour not agreeably arranged for few however have ever done so twice who have so sinned have then be told that next diligence must take quickly to innsbruck if be discontented have rarely stuck to complaint gone comfort of house price charged general charm of place have generally prevailed so that complainant sometimes with spoken apology have in most case sought permission to remain in late year frau certainty of victory have created feeling that nothing be to be said against arrangement of peacock displeased guest can exercise displeasure best by taking away in silence frau of late year have have two counsellor for though be ill inclined to admit advice from who have received authority to give be not therefore so self confident a to feel that can live thrive without listening to wisdom of others two counsellor may be regarded a representing first elder conscience second younger worldly prudence in matter of conscience very much more be concerned than simple honesty be not against cheating extortion that counsellor be sharp to rather in regard to innovation think to be prejudicial to manner life of brunnenthal of innsbruck of tyrol of austrian empire generally indeed of world at large to be a father have be before for father too have kept peacock to let life be cheap simple yet very plentiful a have be in day be counsel given by father conolin old priest who always spent two night in month at establishment be not unfrequently to be seen there on other occasion have be opposed to many thing have be effected that alteration of hour of dinner erection of bathhouse changing of plate at course especially certain notification advertisement by foreigner may have be induced to come to brunnenthal kaplan chaplain a be called be particularly averse to stranger seeming to think that advantage of place must be reserved if not altogether for tyrolese at rate for german of southern germany be probably of opinion that real good must be obtained by harbouring lutheran of late english also have come to whom though be personally very courteous be much averse in heart of heart such have ever be tendency of advice have always be received with willing nay with loving ear fate of kaplan have be a be fate of such counsellor let toryism of tory be ever so strong be destiny to carry out purpose of opponent so have be be with frau though be always in spirit antagonistic to other counsellor be other counsellor who prevailed with at innsbruck for many year there have lived lawyer rather family of lawyer men always of good repute moderate mean named schlessen in hand have be reposed by frau confidence a to business matter almost one in business must have in lawyer first schlessen whom frau have known in youth who be then very old man have be almost a conservative a priest then have come son who have be le so still lived died without much either of light of progress contamination of revolutionary idea from outer world about three year before date of tale also have passed away now young fritz schlessen sat in chair of forefather be opinion of innsbruck generally that young lawyer be certainly equal probably superior in attainment intellect to of predecessor have learned business at munich vienna though be only twenty six when be left to manage client most of adhered to among others so did frau did knowing nature of man of counsel might expect to receive from for though loved priest loved old way loved to be told that must live thrive on rule by father have lived thriven before still there be always present to mind fact that be engaged in trade that first object of tradesman must be to make money shoemaker can set to work to make shoe having a first intention ambition to make foot of customer comfortable may come second to a conscientious man may be essentially necessary set to work to make shoe in order that may earn living law almost of nature may say have become so recognised by frau that felt that must be followed even in spite of priest if need be that in order that might be followed must be well that must listen to advice of herr schlessen heard therefore that kaplan must say to with gracious smile something of what lawyer must say to not always very graciously in long run must take lawyer advice will have to be told in following chapter how be that fritz schlessen have preponderating influence in brunnenthal arising from other cause than professional soundness general prudence may however be a well to explain here that peter frohmann son sided always with priest attached altogether to conservative interest though be honest diligent dutiful to mother be lumpy uncouth slow of speech action understood cutting of timber making of hay something perhaps of care of horse of nourishment of pig in money matter be not efficient amalia malchen daughter who be four five year brother junior be much brighter be strong on reforming side british money be to thinking a good a austrian even tyrolese to thrive even better than forefather have thriven seemed to to be desirable therefore though by brightness feminine way be very dear to priest be generally opposed to in family conclave be chiefly in consequence of persistency that table napkin at peacock be now changed twice week chapter ii beginning of trouble of late day up to time of be speaking chief contest between frau with kaplan peter on one side malchen with fritz schlessen on other be on most important question whether whole rate of charge must not be raised at establishment price have be raised doubt within last twenty year frau must not have kept house open have be done indirectly that matter may not be complicated for reader will assume that charge be made at peacock in zwansigers kreutzers that zwansiger containing twenty kreutzers be worth eightpence of english money now must be understood that guest at peacock be entertained at rate of six zwansigers four shilling day that included everything necessary bed breakfast dinner cup of coffee after dinner supper a much fresh milk a anybody chose to drink when cow be milked use of everything in about establishment guest who required wine beer of course be charged for what have who be rich enough to be taken about in carriage paid so much per job separate jaunt having be inserted in tariff doubt there be other possible probable extra ordinary guest might live for six zwansigers day bulk of did so live with addition of allowance of beer might think appropriate from time to time little have be added to cost of luxury wine have become dearer perhaps carriage bath be addition to bill certain larger more commodious room be supposed to be entitled to extra zwansiger per week main charge have always remained fixed in time of frau father guest have be entertained at let say four shilling head guest be so entertained now world at rate tyrolese world south of innsbruck knew six zwansigers be charge in brunnenthal must be like adding new difficulty to path of life to make change frau have always held head high have never be ashamed of looking neighbour in face when be advised to rush at once up to seven zwansigers half five shilling day felt must do so must be overwhelmed with shame must not customer then have cause of complaint must not have such cause that must in truth desert did not know that herr wei magistrate from brixen with wife wife sister child who came yearly to peacock must not afford to bring family at increased rate of expense fraulein tendel with sister must never come from innsbruck if such announcement be made to be pride of woman heart to give be necessary for good living to who must come submit to for four shilling day among extra must endure alteration did not like extra if people must have luxury must be made to pay for peacock have always be kept open for six zwansigers though fritz schlessen be very eloquent must not give way to fritz schlessen simply told that good thing provided for guest cost at present more than six zwansigers must not therefore be sold by at price without loss be rich fritz remarked shrugging shoulder having amassed property must if pleased dispose of gradually by entertaining guest at loss to only let know what be doing that might be charity might be generosity might be friendliness be not trade everything else in world have become dearer therefore living at peacock must be dearer a to wei tendels doubt might be shocked perhaps hindered from coming place must surely be filled by others be not house always full from st of june till end of september be not stranger refused admittance week after week from want of accommodation if new price be found to be too high for tyrolese bavarian must not offend german from rhine belgian english be not plain to one people now came from greater distance than heretofore be argument herr schlessen used though be very disagreeable be not easily answered frau repudiated altogether idea of keeping open house on other than true trade principle when young lawyer talked to about generosity waxed angry accused of laughing at dearest frau frohmann said be so necessary must know truth of course intend to make profit if can not do so at present price yet will not raise at rate understand what be that be doing now last year have be bad year knew that have not increased store took place in month of april when proposition be being made a to price for coming season lawyer have suggested that circular must be issued giving notice of altered tariff malchen be clearly in favour of new idea must not see that wei tendels other neighbour must be entertained at manifest loss indeed have prepossession in favour of foreigner especially of english when expressed brought down upon head sundry hard word from mother who called pert hussey implied that if fritz schlessen wanted to pull house down malchen must be willing that must be done better do that mother than keep roof on at loss said malchen who upon be turned at once out of little inner room in conference be being held peter who be present on occasion be decidedly opposed to innovation partly because conservative nature so prompted partly because did not regard herr schlessen with friendship so warm a entertained by sister be perhaps little jealous of lawyer then have idea that a thing be prosperous to eye must certainly come right at last fortune of house have be made at rate of six zwansigers day there be thought wisdom more clear than of adhering to line of conduct have proved to be advantageous kaplan be clear against change of price then burdened advice on question with suggestion be peculiarly disagreeable to frau acknowledged truth of much that lawyer have said appeared to that good thing provided must not in truth be sold at term a be now fixed be quite alive to fact that behoved frau a wise woman to make profit charity be one thing business be frau did charity like christian generally using father conolin a almoner in such matter a keeper of house of public entertainment be necessary that must live kaplan be a wide awake to a be frau herself lawyer thought that change must not be in direction indicated by schlessen condition of wei of tendels must be considered how must be if one of meat one of pudding be discontinued if cup of coffee after dinner be made extra must not that so reduce expenditure a to leave profit in case wei tendels need not necessarily incur increased charge when kaplan have spoken lawyer looked closely into frau face proposition might doubt for present meet difficulty knew that must be disagreeable there came cloud upon old woman brow frowned even upon priest theyd want to be helped twice out of one pudding youd gain nothing said peter according to said lawyer if there be only one course dinner must cost same fewer dish le cost doubt dont believe know anything about said frau perhaps not said lawyer on little detail doubt be best judge think have shown that something must be done might try coffee frau frohmann said priest must not take youd only save coffee said lawyer sugar said priest then theyd never ask for brandy suggested peter frau on occasion said not word further after little while got up from chair stood silent among be known to be sign that conference be dismissed have taken place immediately after dinner at period of year be eaten at noon have simply be family meal at frau have sat with two child two friend kaplan on such occasion be always free nothing that have in house ever cost kreutzer attorney paid way like one else when called on for absolute work done not exactly for advice given in conference made charge might be that time be coming in money must pas on side that time have not arrived a yet a soon a frau be left alone reseated in accustomed arm chair set to work in sober almost solemn sadness to think over be most perplexing question there must be doubt that wealth at present owned have be made by business carried on at present price after existing fashion why must there be change be told that must make customer pay more because be made to pay more why must pay more must understand that in general prosperity of brunnenthal about must have somewhat higher wage a have prospered why must not also prosper servant of poor must thought be poorer than servant of rich why must poultry be dearer meat thing knew be cheaper a tea sugar coffee have bought three horse during winter certainly have be costly father have not given such price before have that probably have be peter fault who have too rashly acceded to demand made upon now remembered with regret on st of january have acceded to petition from carpenter for addition of six zwansigers to monthly wage have made request on plea of sixth child adding also that journeyman carpenter at brixen at innsbruck be getting what asked have granted to coming of additional baby that must probably have denied to other argument have never occurred to that be really paying additional four shilling month because carpenter be becoming dearer throughout world malchens clothes be certainly much more costly than own have be when be young then malchen be foolish girl fond of fashion from munich just at moment be in love must hardly be right that poor tendel female with small fixed mean must be made to pay more for necessary summer excursion because malchen must dress in so called french finery instead of adhering a ought to tyrolese custom frau on occasion spent hour in solitude thinking over have dismissed conference must not be regarded a end to matter herr schlessen have come out from innsbruck with written document in pocket be proposing to have printed circulated if printed circulated must intimate to world at large that frau frohmann have raised price therein new rate seven zwansigers half head be inserted unblushingly at full length a though such disruption of old law be most natural thing in world there be flippancy about disgusted old woman malchen seemed to regard act must banish from peacock old friend well known customer of house a though be easy trifle almost desirable with very object frau heart warmed to well known face a thought of must not have infinitely greater satisfaction in cooking good dinner for simple tyrolese neighbour than for rich foreigner who after be too often indifferent to what be done for by tendel lady pudding be recognised a real work of art thought of talked of ate doubt dreamed of herr wei how enjoyed dinner how proud always be a encouraged child around to help to dish in succession frau wei with care narrow mean be to be deprived of cheap month holiday be so necessary for in order that peacock charm of brunnenthal generally might be devoted to jew from frankfort rich shopkeeper from hamburg worse still to proud thankless englishman at end of hour frau have determined that must not raise price yet something must be done have resolved even silently resolved that must carry on business at loss must have felt that be worthy of restraint a lunatic to keep house of public entertainment to lose by be to mind very sad idea to work be out of pocket by working to who knew little nothing of modern speculation catastrophe be most melancholy to work with intention of losing must be condition only of lunatic schlessen have made good point a to last season money spent have be absolutely more than money received something must be done yet must not raise price then considered priest proposition peter knew have shown to be fool though feeling be good always be fool expense of house doubt might be much diminished in manner suggested by herr conolin salt butter must be given instead of fresh at breakfast cheaper coffee must be procured course at dinner might be reduced second pudding might be discontinued with economical result have not success in thing be pride of life of what good must life be to if pride be crushed wei doubt must come same how must whisper talk of among when found parsimonious change tendel lady must not complain be not likely that breath of complaint must ever pas humble lip frau frohmann who be perhaps somewhat unduly proud of character for wealth must have to explain to why be that second pudding have be abolished must be forced to declare that must no longer afford to supply declaration to must have in something of meanness something of degradation must not abandon glory of dinner be a though must ask royal academician to cease to exhibit picture actor to consent to have name withdrawn from bill thus at last came to that further resolve kaplans advice must be rejected a must that of lawyer something must be done for moment there came upon sad idea that must leave whole thing to others retire into obscurity at village from whence frohmanns have originally come there must be ample mean for private comfort then who must carry on peacock who must look after farm timber posting mill peter be certainly not efficient for malchens ambition lay elsewhere there be too cowardice in idea of running away be very displeasing to why need there be raising of price at in one direction in other have never be persuaded into paying more to others then must not have be driven to demand more from others higher payment on part have thought not be obligatory on have be soft good natured therefore be that be now called upon to be exorbitant there be something abominable to in general greed of world for more money at moment felt almost hatred for poor carpenter regarded that new baby of a impertinent intrusion must fall back upon old wage old price for everything there must be difficulty with innsbruck butcher unless must give way must try man at brixen in matter of fowl must not yield kreutzer to entreaty of poor neighbour who brought to for sale then walked forth from house to little arbour summer house be close to chapel opposite in found schlessen smoking pipe with cup of coffee before malchen by side have made up mind herr schlessen said be only when be very angry with that called herr schlessen what will do asked lawyer hing at just destroy bit of paper so saying frau walked back to house fritz schlessen looking round at malchen did destroy bit of paper chapter iii question of mitgift about two month after event described in last chapter malchen fritz schlessen be sitting in same little arbour be again smoking pipe again drinking coffee be again alone when two be seated together in arbour at early period of season be usually left alone a be known to be lover by guest who must then be assembled at peacock when summer have grown into autumn stranger from distance have come place be crowded then ordinary coffee drinker smoker must crowd round arbour regardless of love of amalia fritz whole family of wei be now at peacock two tendel lady three four others men with wife daughter from botzen brunecken place around at great distance be now end of june be not till july that house becomes full be in august that real crowd be gathered at frau frohmanns board be then that folk from distance can not find bed whole culinary resource of establishment be put to greatest stress be now monday lawyer have be making holiday having come to brunnenthal on previous saturday on sunday there have be perhaps dozen visitor from innsbruck who have be driven out after early mass for dinner sunday holiday everything have be done at peacock on old style there have be diminution either in number in excellence of dish have there be increase in tariff have be first day of season at there have be full table frau have done best everybody have known that sojourner in house be to be entertained at old rate have be hoped by lawyer priest by malchen even by peter that zwansiger must be added to charge for dinner demanded from townspeople at last moment word have gone forth that there must be increase morning old lady have be very gloomy have heard mass in own chapel have then made very busy in kitchen have spoken no word to one till at moment before dinner gave instruction to malchen who always made out bill saw that money be duly received there be to be increase then when last pudding have be sent in went according to custom to room decorated in grand costume when guest have left dining room be clustering about in passage on seat in front of house waiting for coffee have come forth very fine with grand cap on head with gold silver ornament with arm bare radiant with smile shook madame wei very graciously by hand stooped down kissed youngest child to one fraulein after said civil word when a happened seppel carpenter went by dressed in sunday best with child in hand stopped asked kindly after baby have made up mind that at rate for time must not submit to humiliation of acknowledging that be driven to necessity of asking increased price have taken place on sunday be on following day that two lover be in arbour together now must be understood that world knew that lover be lover that world presumed that be to become husband wife there be not never have be least secrecy about malchen be four five twenty be perhaps thirty knew own mind be of likely to be persuaded by others either to marry not to marry frau have given consent not with ecstacy of joy with son in law be sometimes welcomed still without reserve kaplan have given in adhesion young lawyer be not quite man liked entertained of new idea about religion be given to innovation be respectable well to do be lover against whom a friend of family must not lift up voice peter did not like man peter in way be fond of sister have not objected have done so must not have mattered much malchen be stronger at brunnenthal than peter thus may be said that thing generally smiled upon lover yet one have ever heard that day be fixed for marriage madame wei have once asked malchen malchen have told not exactly to mind own business have be very nearly meaning of what have said there be indeed difficulty be difficulty frau have assented in gradual fashion rather by not dissenting a thing have gone on so that have come to be understood that thing be to be have never said word a to young lady fortune a to mitgift in case must certainly be necessary such woman a frau in giving daughter must surely have to give something with frau be woman who did not like parting with money be such woman even lawyer did not like asking question fraulein have once inquired mother have merely raised eyebrow remained silent then lawyer have told priest that in performance of moral duty frau ought to settle something in own mind priest have assented have seemed to imply in performance of such duty old lady ought not to be hurried year two seemed to think must not be too much for consideration so matter stood at present moment perhaps be that german be slow people may be that tyrolese be especially so be that a may herr schlessen did not seem to be driven into agony of despair by delay be fondly attached to malchen a to offering to take without mitgift quite empty handed just a stood be out of question young man who have anything ever among acquaintance did that kind of thing scale must be somewhat equally balanced have good income be entitled to substantial mitgift be quite ready to marry to morrow if only important question must get settled malchen be quite a well aware a be that mother must be brought to do duty in matter perhaps of two be little more impatient if there must at last be slip between cup lip effect to must be so much more disastrous than to must very easily get wife young woman be a plenty a blackberry so fraulein told might find difficult to suit if at last affair be to be broken off knew to be fair upstanding good looking lass with personal attraction sufficient to make such young man a fritz schlessen like society knew also that good look such a be must not be improved by fretting might be possible that fritz must change mind day if be kept waiting till saw becoming day by day more commonplace under eye malchen have good sense enough not to overrate own charm knew world well enough to be aware that must be wise to secure if possible comfortable home while be at best be not that suspected fritz did not think that must be justified in supposing to be more angelic than other young men simply because be lover therefore malchen be impatient for last month two have be making up mind to be very round with mother on subject at present moment however lover a be sitting in arbour be discussing rather frau affair in regard to establishment than own schlessen have in truth come

knew that mother be happy in mind became eloquent about wood quarry farm chapter vii gold becomes cheap if there be more money sir ought to make more comfortable be said by frau to mr cartwright few day after return from innsbruck be reply to statement made by have listened to advice from hoff butcher now be listening to advice from guest have told that trouble of hers have come from fact that gold have become more plentiful in world than heretofore rather from that other fact that have refused to accommodate to increased plenty of gold then have come very natural suggestion if there be more money ought to make more comfortable not at frau frohmann well sir then paused not wishing to express unrestrained praise of wealth so to appear too worldly minded yet feeling that certainly be wrong according to clearly expressed opinion of world not at though have barn store filled with gold must not make guest comfortable with must not eat drink sleep upon delight with looking at a do at waterfall at mill up yonder must buy thing for ah if must buy thats just question if everybody have gold so common if barn be full of then people must not care to take for meat wine never can be like surely there be knowing probably not be question of degree when have hay crop here very plentiful dont find that hay becomes cheap thats of course gold becomes cheap just think over youll find how be when hay be plentiful cant get so much for load because becomes cheap can feed more cow altogether know that such plenty be blessing so be with gold when be plentiful cant get so much meat for a used to do a can get gold much easier will come to same thing if will swim with stream a friend in innsbruck counselled then frau again considered again found that must not accept doctrine a bearing upon own case dont think can be like here sir said why not here a well a elsewhere because never see bit of gold from one year end to other barn full of why so precious that english people french american always change for paper before come here if mean that be because bank note be so common then mr cartwright scratched head feeling that there must be difficulty in making frau understand increased use of article common a have become in great mart of world have not a yet made way into valley be because bank note be le common frau gazed at steadfastly trying to understand something about still use bank note at innsbruck nothing else said there be little silver among shop never see bit of gold at munich at munich tell french piece have become well not common not so very scarce at dresden know perhaps dresden be same at paris ah paris do have gold there when be young be silver at paris gold be now a plentiful a blackberry at berlin be nearly same just here in austria have not quite got through difficulty think be doing very well in austria at rate in tyrol very well frau frohmann very well indeed pray suppose that mean anything to contrary though havent got into way of using gold money world around have done so of course if meat be dear at munich because gold wont buy so much there a used to do meat will be dearer also at innsbruck even though continue to pay for with bank note be dearer sir doubt said frau shaking head have endeavoured to contest point gallantly have be beaten by conduct of two butcher higher price of hoff at innsbruck have become at rate better than lower price of deceitful enemy at brixen be dearer for world generally may suffice friend doctrine be quite enough for world at large swim with stream in buying selling what call trade thing arrange so subtly that be often driven to accept without quite knowing why be so then can only swim with stream in matter if want to find out cause if can not satisfy mind without knowing why be that must pay more for everything must therefore charge more to other people be because gold note represent have become more common in world during last thirty year did want to know be not satisfied to swim with stream a hoff have done not caring to inquire simply feeling sure that a thing be so so must be that such change must take place have gone much against grain of conservative nature in own mind have attributed pestilently increased expense to elongated petticoat french bonnet swallow tailed coat taste for sour wine have imagined that josephine bull might have be contented with old price for egg if must also be contented with old raiment old food grounding resolution on belief have endeavoured not only to resist further change even to go back to good old time now be quite aware that in doing so have endeavoured to swim against stream whether ought to be so not be not a yet quite sure be becoming sure that such be fact that fact be too strong for to combat did not at like swimming with stream there be something conveyed by idea be repugnant to sense of honour did not mean that be to increase price because other people increased whether be wrong right hated doing of anything because other people did be not that base propensity to imitation cause of long petticoat girl be wearing be not thus that vile change be effected saw around on side have not be glory great resolve to stand a fast a possible on old way now in great attempt to do so be to be foiled thus easily be clear to that must be foiled if not in one way then in must either raise price else retire to schwatz have be thoroughly beaten in endeavour to make others carry on trade in accordance with theory on side have be beaten there be not poor woman in valley not one of who have wont to be so submissive gracious to who have not deserted proposed reduction of two kreutzers on dozen of egg have changed most constant of humble friend into bitterest foe seppel must have gone through fire water for anything that man strength courage must do must have done threat of going back to old wage have conquered even seppels gratitude concurrent testimony have convinced that must either yield go when came to think of in solitude did not wish to go schwatz oh yes must be very well to have quiet place ready chosen for retirement when retirement must be necessary what did retirement mean must not be to simply beginning of dying man woman must retire when longer able to do work of world who in world must keep brunnenthal peacock a well a be fatigued with kitchen worn out with charge of guest worried inwardly by anxiety of position not in least not at for later misfortune have come upon misfortune knew how to remedy at once if only must bring to apply remedy kaplan have indiscreetly suggested to that a malchen be about to marry be taken away into town must be good thing that peter must take wife so that there might be future mistress of establishment in readiness idea caused to arm instantly with renewed self assertion so be already preparing for departure to schwatz be thus communed with have already made up mind that must succumb to difficulty go idea have come simply from kaplan without consultation with one to frau seemed a though whole valley be already preparing for departure must not go with strength energy why must shut up a ready for death must not go to schwatz yet awhile if not then must raise price to waste substance to expend success of life in entertaining folk gratis who after must believe that be paying for entertainment must be worse even than going to schwatz have be thinking over what be telling said to mr cartwright about week after last interview on day before departure from valley hope find be wrong frau frohmann a for wrong right be very difficult to get at in wicked world one can acknowledge necessity be where be sir one can see what be necessary if one must only see that be right also one must be so much more comfortable there be thing so hard to be seen friend let do what will can not see clearly into middle of perhaps must have explained to better about depreciation of money nominal rise in value of everything else if have understood better be sure understand about poor woman cant ever do at rate ought to give confidence that purpose to do be being done by everybody around be talking to about wei herr wei hear have salary raised last spring have asked frau with energy little start for piece of news have not reached before somebody be saying so other day doubt be found that must be paid more because have to pay more for everything wanted therefore ought to expect to have to pay more piece of information gave frau more comfort than anything have yet heard that gold must be common what people call drug in market did not come quite within scope of comprehension gold to be gold zwansiger zwansiger if herr wei got more for service from community ought to get more from for service did seem plain to then triumph in direction be immediately diminished by tender feeling a to other customer what of poor fraulein tendels said ah yes said mr cartwright there come to fixed income to what to people with fixed income must suffer frau frohmann there be old saying that in making law can not look after little thing people who work earn living be multitude to matter adjust few who live upon what have saved others have saved for must go to wall did frau understand at once made up mind that however necessary might be to raise price against wei rest of world must never raise against two poor desolate fraulein so herr wei have have salary raised have said nothing to about doubt prudently wishing to conceal matter have said nothing to about although have talked to about own affair have applauded courage old conservatism in must not demand that extra zwansiger half hardened heart so much that felt must have pleasure in sending circular to a to new tariff might come let alone a pleased certainly ought to have told that own salary have be increased there be more to do than sending out new circular to customer how be to send circular round valley to old woman others concerned how be to make seppel anton josephine bull understand that must be forgiven have old price increased wage if must come back to allegiance never say word again a to sad affair of past summer circular must be of nature very different from must serve for customer thinking over came to opinion that suse krapp must be best circular day two after cartwright be gone sent for suse suse be by mean bad diplomate when gaining point have desire to triumph outwardly when feeling conqueror be quite ready to flatter conquered one have never be more gracious more submissive more ready to declare that in matter frau will be law of valley than now when be given to understand that everything must be bought on same term a heretofore that dairy must be discontinued during next season that wild fruit of wood mountain must be made welcome at peacock a have heretofore always be case to morrow will be happiest day that ever be in valley said suse in enthusiasm a for seppel be telling only yesterday that must never be happy man again till must find once more at work in old shed behind chapel then suse be told that seppel might come a soon a pleased hell be there morning after next if im living woman continued suse energetically then said word oh meine liebe frau frohmann broke heart when told be going away going away said frau a though have be stung who said be going away did hear psha be that stupid priest have never before be heard to say word against kaplan now must hardly restrain why must go away indeed be not thinking of going away must be bad thing if be to be driven out of house by little trouble a to price of egg butter suse krapp be not going away will be best word have of heard many day frau frohmann when came to that be a though must have broken heart then be sent away upon mission not upon occasion without full glass of kirsch wasser on very day following seppel be back there be nothing said between mistress waited about front of house till have opportunity of putting hand up to cap smiling at a stood upon doorstep then before week be over old woman young girl be crowding round place with little present on first return to allegiance brought to frau a peace offering season be nearly over when signified to malchen desire that fritz schlessen must come out to valley did with much good humour explaining frankly that fritz must have to prepare new circular that must discus with nature of altered proposition be to be made to public fritz of course came be closeted with for full hour during absolutely prepared document for innsbruck printer be simple announcement for future charge made at brunnenthal peacock must be seven half zwansigers per head per day then went on to declare that a heretofore frau frohmann must endeavour to give satisfaction to who must do honour of visiting establishment instruction be given to schlessen a to sending circular out to public do said frau dont send one to tendel lady something else be settled at conference a soon a be over fritz schlessen be encountered by malchen who on such occasion must never be far away though spot on met be one might not have be altogether secure from intrusive eye took fondly by waist whispered word in ear will do asked malchen anxiously to question reply be made by kiss in whisper have conveyed to amount now fixed for mitgift chapter viii doesnt make difference to of so frau frohmann have raised price have acknowledged to world to have be beaten in enterprise there be however certain misfortune be infinitely worse in anticipation than in reality have be looked forward to a terrible humiliation be soon found to be one of note of triumph be sounded none at least reached ear indeed so fell out that with whom have quarrelled for awhile seemed now to be more friendly with than ever between hoff thing be so sweet that mention be ever made of money meat be sent bill be paid with reticence almost implied that be not trade amiable giving taking of good thing of world there have never be word of explanation with seppel be late early about cart furniture innumerable little act of kindness made way up to mother many child suse josephine have never be so brisk egg have never be so fresh vegetable so good except from working of own mind received wound real commencement of matter did not take place till following summer commencement a regarded public circular be sent out to such letter answer be returned up to following june frau be ignorant what effect charge must have upon coming of customer there be time at thought that house must be left desolate that extra charge must turn away from heart of visitor in way must be compelled to retire to schwatz suppose dont come at said to peter one day must be very bad said peter who also have fear in same direction fritz schlessen think wont make difference said frau zwansiger half day doe make difference to most men replied peter uncomfortably be uncomfortable when schlessen came out raised spirit perhaps old wei wont come said then there will be plenty in place there be house like peacock over country now in engadine bregenz salzkammergut seems to more charge fuller be be for grand folk for anybody chooses have come to that that more money people be charged better like money have become so plentiful with rich that dont know what to do with be repetition of mr cartwright barn full of gold there be something in assertion that money must be plentiful in idea gold must be drug savoured to of innovation be therefore unpleasant still felt that old time be good that other time must be so good a old time if people must come fill house pay zwansiger half extra without grumbling there must be consolation in early in june malchen made call at house of fraulein tendel malchen at time be known to innsbruck a handsome frau schlessen who have be brought home in winter to husband house with so very comfortable mitgift in hand be now quite old story there be people in town who said that young wife already knew quite a much about husband business a have ever done about mother at moment be obeying one of mother command mother hope be coming out to brunnenthal year said elder fraulein shook head sadly because then malchen paused younger of two lady shook head because always have be there yes have mean change in price wont have anything to do with if will come couldnt think of malchen then mother will be very unhappy thats new circular be not sent to of course heard of if dont come mother will take very bad then of course lady said must come so that little difficulty be overcome took place in june at time young wife be staying out in valley with mother have only gone into innsbruck on visit be with mother preparing for guest perhaps a frau too often thought preparing for guest who must never arrive from day to day however there came letter bespeaking room a usual when st of june came there be herr wei with family have taught to regard coming of wei a kind of touchstone by might judge of success of what have done if remained away must be because in spite of increase in salary must not encounter higher cost of recreation for wife family be too fond of good living of peacock not to come if must afford if must not pay so much then must others in rank of life must be sad indeed to frau if house be to be closed to neighbour german even though might succeed in filling with foreigner from distance now wei have come not having given usual notice having sent message for room only two day before arrival at once there be little sparring match between herr wei frau didnt suppose that there must be much trouble a to finding room said herr wei why shouldnt there be a much trouble a usual asked frau in return have felt that there be slight in arrival of whole family without usual preliminary inquiry a though there must never again be competition for room at peacock well friend suppose that little letter be sent about country will make difference thats a people like to take hasnt made difference with seems have to think good deal about frau frohmann suppose will have to make stay shorter own be little surprised to see tendel woman here zwansiger half day come to deal of money at end of month when there be two three be happy to think wont hurt herr wei a have have salary raised be neither here there frau frohmann said magistrate almost with touch of anger world knew ought to know how very insufficient be stipend when compared with invaluable public service rendered such at least be light in looked at question at rate said frau a stalked away house be like to be a full a ever be glad to hear be glad to hear be last word on occasion before day be over told wife that thought place be not a comfortable a usual that frau with high price be more upsetting than ever wife who took delight in being called madame wei at brixen who considered to be in degree lady of fashion have nevertheless be very much disturbed in mind by increased price have suggested that place must be abandoned raising of price be in eye extortion though small raising of salary be simply justice a thought inadequate justice living at peacock be good nobody must deny when middle aged man be taken away from comfort of home how be to console in midst of idleness unless have good dinner herr wei have therefore determined to endure injury a usual to pas holiday in brunnenthal when madame wei saw two fraulein from innsbruck in house whose mean knew down to last kreutzer who certainly must not afford increased demand thought that there must be something not apparent to view must be possible that frau must be so unjust so dishonest so extortious a to have different price for different neighbour that englishman even german from berlin must be charged something extra might not perhaps be unjust extortious among friend of same district to put zwansiger half on to one not to seemed to madame wei to be sin for there must be pardon be so glad to see here said to younger fraulein be so kind of always be here know yes yes feared that perhaps know that with have to think more than once about before must make up mind to pay increased charge magistrat felt little hurt about to fraulein at first answered nothing thinking that perhaps ought not to make public special benevolence shown by frau to herself sister zwansiger half be great deal of money to add on said madame wei be indeed might have got cheaper elsewhere then thought that perhaps might have done so too have made increase to said poor lady who at last be forced to tell truth a by not doing so must have be guilty of direct falsehood in allowing to be supposed that sister paid increased price soh oh oh exclaimed madame wei clasping hand together bobbing head up down soh oh oh have found out then shortly after that next day there be uncomfortable perturbation of affair at peacock be not indeed known to guest to who heard heard of seemed for time to be very terrible madame wei frau have what be commonly called few word together frau frohmann said madame wei be quite astonished to hear from agatha tendel that be only charging old price why shouldnt charge just what please nothing at if pleased asked frau sharply of course can do think among neighbour there shouldnt be one price to one one to must do good frau wei if be to charge lady more than can pay doe do harm if live here at cheap rate surely there must be one price among neighbour herr wei got circular doubt knew dont suppose want to live here at rate le than cost to keep can do what like about coming can do what like about staying away knew price have not made secret about change a for interference between other customer be what wont put up with so now know about by end of speech frau have worked up into grand passion spoke aloud so that near heard then there be great commotion in peacock be thought that wei must go away remained for allotted time be only disturbance took place passed off altogether to credit of frau something in vague way came to be understood about fixed income so that peter malchen with kaplan even down to seppel suse krapp be aware that two fraulein ought not to be made to pay a much a prosperous magistrate who have have salary raised then be quite understood that difference made in favour of two poor lady be kindness shown to must not therefore be injury to one else later in year when establishment be full everything be going on briskly when two pudding be at very height of glory wild fruit be brought up on supper table in huge bowl when brunnenthal be at loveliest frau be appearing on holiday in gayest costume cartwright returned to valley of course have ordered room much beforehand frau trusting altogether to wisdom of counsel did not even yet quite understand have kept very best apartment for greeting between be most friendly frau condescending to put on something of holiday costume to add honour to arrival thing have never be known to do before on behalf of guest of course there be not then time for conversation day two have not passed before made known to mr cartwright later experience people have come sir just same said so perceive dont seem to make difference to of didnt think must dont suppose anybody have complained well there be little said by one lady mr cartwright be not because charged more because old friend be allowed to pay le didnt do harm dare say harm oh dear couldnt do harm if tried thought id tell sir because said must be so people dont seem to think more of seven zwansigers half than do of six very odd very odd indeed suppose right sir asked still thinking that there must be something wrong in world when so monstrous condition of thing seemed to prevail theyd think great deal of if charged more than believed sufficient to give fair profit for outlay trouble how can know anything about mr cartwright ah indeed how do do frau frohmann must study matter very closely before can find out how adjust may be sure of that world will never complain of fair price will never long endure unfair price will give thanks at to who sell good at loss frau curtseyed retired quite satisfied that have done right thing in raising price still feeling that have many struggle to make before must understand matter lady of launay chapter how bessy pryor became young lady of importance how great be difference between doing duty desiring to do between doing

sea island patagonia have be safe now when idea of combining property be again mooted at first said nothing against surely such precaution a must suffice especially a bessys retiring nature must not allow to fall in love with man within short compass of fortnight not word more be said between mr mile son a to prospect of mr morrison not word more then be intelligent enough to perceive that match be not agreeable to attributed feeling on part to idea bessy ought to be treated in respect a though be daughter of house of launay idea be absurd safe match if must be managed must of course go on

early want of ruddy health into gradual proportion of perfect feminine loveliness having seen gradual growth did not know how lovely girl be woman hardly ever doe know how omnipotent may be attraction feminine nature feminine form diffuse unconsciously on young men around philip knew rather felt a walked about park declared to that alexander morrison be insufferably impudent clerical prig for assertion there be in truth ground whatsoever then accused mother of sordid love of money property swore to that must never stir step towards cornwall if chose to have red haired launay girl up from far west must go away to london perhaps back to japan what shocked most be that girl a bessy girl whom treated always just like own sister must give to such man a young parson at very first asking struck tree among be walking with stick a thought of meanness of feminine nature then greasy ugly brute mr morrison be not at greasy must have be acknowledged by world at large to be much better looking than philip launay then came day of departure be going up to london in march to see book through press make intimate at club introduce generally to way of life be to be hereafter have be understood that be to pas season in london that then combined property question must come on in earnest such be mother understanding by time by day of departure be quite determined that combined property question must never receive consideration at hand early on day met bessy somewhere about house be very sweet to on occasion partly because loved dearly a adopted brother partly because be going partly because be nature to be sweet there be one question want to ask said suddenly turning round upon with frown have not meant to frown be nature to do so when heart frowned within what be philip turned pale a spoke looked full in face be engaged to parson went on looking at did not answer word be going to marry have right to ask then shook head certainly be not now a spoke voice be changed frown have vanished again shook head then got hold of hand left hand with not thinking of a other than brother be so glad detest that man oh philip be very good care two penny for goodness be

thing be so disagreeable be one of philip be truest best of brother at rate wont then paused wont thats promise to best dearest brother nodded head again be satisfied went away when returned to launay at end of four month found that thing be not going on pleasantly at park mr morrison have be refused with positive assurance from young lady that must never change mind mr mile have become more stern than ever in performance of duty to family chapter iii how bessy pryor came to love heir of launay matter became very unpleasant at park soon after philip went away there have be something in manner a left silence in regard to on bessys part created not at first surprise uneasiness in mind of mr mile bessy hardly mentioned name mr mile knew enough of world to feel that such restraint must have cause must have be natural for girl so circumstanced to have be full of philip botany feeling instigated parson to renewed attempt parson have to tell that there be chance for have said asked mr mile that can never be will be said mr mile stirred on occasion to assertion of obstinacy be in nature then there be most unpleasant scene between old lady dependent what be that expect asked expect aunt bessy have be instructed to call mr mile aunt what do think be to be done for done for have done everything may not stay with then mr mile gave utterance to very long lecture in many thing be explained to bessy bessys position be said to be one very peculiar in nature be mr mile to die there must be home for must not hope to find home in philip house a real sister might have done everybody loved because have be good gracious be duty to marry especially duty so that there might be future difficulty mr morrison be exactly man that girl a bessy ought to want a husband bessy through tear declared that didnt want husband that certainly did not want mr morrison have philip said anything asked imprudent old woman then bessy be silent what have philip said to told when asked that must never marry then be in very moment that mr mile in truth suspected blow be to fall upon in same moment resolved that let pain be what might to of must do duty by family yes said to herself a sat alone in unadorned unattractive sanctity of own bedroom will do duty at rate now with deep remorse acknowledged to herself that have be remiss for moment anger be very bitter have warmed reptile in bosom very word came to thought though be not pronounced word be at once rejected girl have be no reptile girl have be true girl have be a sweet girl a have ever brightened hearth of old woman acknowledged so much to herself even in moment of agony not le must do duty by family of launays let girl do what might must be sent away got rid of sacrificed in way rather than philip must be allowed to make fool when for couple of day have turned in mind did not believe that there be a yet understanding between girl philip still be sure that danger existed not only have girl refused destined husband just man a such girl a bessy ought to have loved have communicated purpose in respect to philip there have be more of confidence between than between girl how must two have talked on subject unless there have be between something of stricter closer friendship even than of brother sister there have be something of conspiracy between against who at launay be held to be omnipotent against who have in hand income power ownership mother of one of protectress only friend of other must do duty let bessy be ever so sweet girl must be made to marry mr morrison must be made to go whither must go if whither must be found how must philip be prevented from following mr mile in agony conceived idea that must be easier to deal with girl than with philip woman if think to be duty will more readily sacrifice in performance of than will man so at least thought mr mile judging from own feeling bessy be very good very affectionate very grateful have always be obedient if possible must be driven into arm of mr morrison must stand firm against such effort a must be made in direction then appeal must be made to herself after have be done for must ruin family of launays for mere whim of own heart during process of driving into mr morrison arm process from first to last be altogether hopeless not word have be said about philip bessy understood reticence have be asked a to promise to philip never forgot that have be asked did ever forget word at moment so displeased have grown to be loveliest woman have ever looked upon remembered now that have held hand tightly while have spoken that effort have be necessary a withdrew have be perfectly serious in decrying personal compliment still still there have be flavour of love in word now remained among heartstrings of course be not brother not even cousin there be not touch of blood between to warrant compliment a joke a young man have told that thought a young woman to be lovely above others be quite sure of possible amount of driving must drive into arm of mr morrison old woman became more more stern dear aunt bessy said to one day with air of firmness have evidently be assumed purposely for occasion indeed indeed can not love mr morrison then mr mile have resolved that must resort to other alternative bessy must go did believe that when everything must be explained bessy must raise difficulty a to own going bessy have more right to live at launay than have other fatherless motherless penniless living creature how to explain what reason must be given must girl be sent then there came delay caused by great trouble on sudden mr mile be very ill began about end of may when philip be still up in london inhaling incense came up from success of book at first be very eager that son must not be recalled to launay why must young man be brought into house with sick old woman of course be eager what evil might not happen if two be brought together during illness at end of three week however be worse so much worse that people around be afraid became manifest to of that truth must be told to philip in spite of injunction bessys position became one of great difficulty because word fell from mr mile explained to almost with accuracy condition of aunt mind must not be here said over over again now have be case a matter of course bessy during old lady illness have never left bedside day night of course have be nurse of course have tended invalid in everything have be so much matter of course that poor lady have be impotent to prevent in ineffectual effort to put end to bessys influence servant even doctor obeyed bessy in regard to household matter mr mile found quite unable to repel bessy from bedside then with mind always intent on necessity of keeping young people apart when be settled that philip must be summoned said again again must not be here bessy must not be here bessy whither must go place be even suggested to be to consult other friend a to place clergyman of own parish for instance who out of house be most intimate friend must have to tell whole story story must not be told by lip philip have never said word to except one word have grown to be loveliest woman that ever looked upon word be very frequent in thought must tell one of if did think lovely if did love why must not thing run smoothly have found to be quite out of question that must be driven into arm of mr morrison soon came to own to herself that might easily be enticed into other arm then perhaps have meant nothing so probably have meant nothing if not why must be driven away from launay a aunt became worse worse when philip came down from london with philip london physician nothing be settled about poor bessy nothing be done when philip bessy stood together at sick woman bedside be nearly insensible wandering in mind still with care heavy at heart philip said what be mother asked philip then bessy escaped from room resolved that must always be absent when philip be by mother bedside there be week in case be almost hopeless then week during mistress of launay crept slowly back to life must not be that two must see much of other during such week at meal sat together bessy be still constant at bedside of aunt now again be alone with philip at first struggled to avoid struggled altogether in vain must not be avoided then of course spoke bessy be sure know that love be sure hope do replied purposely misinterpreting then frowned at be sure bessy be above subterfuge what subterfuge why do say that be sister of mine cousin even know what mean when say that love will be wife oh if might only have knelt at foot hidden face among hand have gladly answered with little yes extracted from amidst happy blush in way there be time for such joy philip think how ill mother be said that can not change have to ask whether can love be bound to ask whether will love must not answer then during second week in mr mile be creeping back to life swore that did love must love must be true to for ever ever chapter iv how bessy pryor owned that be engaged when pretty oath have be sworn while mr mile be too ill to keep eye upon to separate of course two lover be much together for whispering word of love for swearing oath for sweet kiss looking into others eye few minute now again will give ample opportunity long hour of day night be passed by bessy with aunt there be short moment heavenly moment sufficed to lift off earth into elysium of joy love for be so perfect so assured in matter such a said in fondly serious air mother can have right to interfere with with may said bessy foreseeing in midst of paradise storm must surely come why must wish to do so why must not allow to make happy in only way in be possible there be such ecstacy of bliss coming from such word a perfection of feeling of mutual love that must not be exalted to heaven although knew that storm must surely come if love must make happy then then surely must be happy of course have given up idea about parson said fear have not philip seems to too monstrous that human being must go to work settle whom two other human being be to marry there be never possibility of told be to be so never must have be said bessy with great emphasis not even for much a love not even for to whom owe everything must consent to marry man did not love what know how will answer when bid give up oh love how will answer then told at considerable length what be answer thought must in such circumstance be made to mother bessy be to declare that nothing must alter intention that own happiness that of lover depended on firmness that two did in fact intend to have own way in matter sooner later bessy a heard lesson made direct reply knew too well that must be of service to that must be possible for to say when resolute old woman must declare purpose must be come what might must always love philip launay that never never never must become wife of other man so much thought must say a to asserting right to lover that be sure must be beyond everyone in house except mr mile be aware that philip bessy be lover from dependent of house tidings spread through parish there have be no special secrecy lover doe not usually pronounce vow in public little half lighted corner twilight hour be chosen bank beneath tree supposed to be safe from vulgar eye lonely wandering philip have followed usual way of world in love making have sought secret moment with special secrecy before servant must whisper to bessy with look of thorough confidence in eye servant completely understand thus while poor old woman be still in bed while be unaware of danger of own immediate impotence secret a far a be secret became known to launay mr morrison heard over at budcombe with heart down in boot told that now certainly there must be chance for at launay mr gregory be rector be with daughter that bessy have become intimate knowing much of mind of first lady of parish took upon to say word two to philip be so glad to hear that mother be much better morning very much better have be most serious illness terribly serious mr gregory then there be pause sundry other faltering allusion be made to condition of thing up at house from philip be aware that word of counsel perhaps reproach be coming hope will excuse philip if tell something think will excuse anything from people be saying about place that during mother illness have engaged to bessy pryor thats very odd said philip odd repeated parson very odd indeed because what people about place say be always supposed to be untrue report be true be true quite true be proud to be in position to assure have be accepted be really sorry for mr morrison know what will mother say think that anyone can say that bessy be not fit to be wife of finest gentleman in land said with air of pride showed plainly enough that did not intend to be talked out of purpose must not have spoken that dear mother be so ill rejoined parson understand must fight own battle bessys a best may may be quite sure mr gregory mean to fight did bessy deny fact when friend mary gregory interrogated question of bessys marriage with mr morrison have somewhat cruelly in regard to more cruelly still in regard to gentleman become public property in neighbourhood everybody have known that mr mile intended to marry bessy to parson of budcombe everybody have thought that bessy must a matter of course accept destiny everybody now knew that bessy have rebelled a mr mile autocratic disposition be well understood everybody be waiting to see what must come of neighbourhood generally thought that bessy be unreasonable ungrateful mr morrison be very nice man nothing must have be more appropriate now when truth came out everybody be very much interested indeed that mr mile must assent to marriage between heir bessy pryor be quite out of question be too well known to leave doubt on mind of anyone in launay budcombe on matter men woman drew breath looked at other be just when parish thought that be going to die that parishioner first heard that bessy must not marry mr morrison because of young squire now when be known that mr mile be not going to die be known that young squire be absolutely engaged to bessy pryor therell be deal o vat in voir said old head ploughman of launay talking over matter with wife of mr gregory gardener there be going to be deal of fat in fire mr mile be not like other mother everything in respect to present income be in hand bessy be not like other girl have absolutely locus standi in world except what came to from bounty of old lady

solemnly what doe mr mile say dont want anybody to ask about said bessy of course love what be good of denying can not talk about then mary gregory looked a though terrible secret have be revealed to secret of burden might probably be too much for to bear first storm arose from interview took place between mother son a soon a mother found able to speak on subject be near heart sent for once again besought to take step towards that combining of property be so essential to launay interest generally then declared purpose very plainly did not intend to combine property did not care for red haired launay cousin be intention to marry bessy pryor yes have proposed to have accepted poor sick mother be at first almost overwhelmed with despair what can do tell truth when ask said do screamed what

looking awful in wanness speaking with low studied harsh voice with two hand before on counterpane have have son with have told bessy felt that be trembling be hardly able to support have not word to say sick old woman be terrible in severity be true yes be true whispered bessy be to be return oh dearest darling oh aunt dear dearest dearest aunt speak like look at like that know love dont know

become estranged from even philip have not be half so much to a girl bessy have wound round very heartstrings made happy even to sit look at bessy have denied pretty thing prettiest of thing have grown up beneath eye did not draw away hand while hand be being kissed made up mind that must do duty of what service will be love said if be to be return bessy must only lie sob hide face say that will give up not to say that not to give up be only resolution at bessy have arrived if will not say so must leave will send word what be to do if be enemy will not remain here pray pray call enemy have better go woman voice a said be dreadful in harshness then bessy slowly creeping down from bed slowly slunk out of room chapter v how bessy pryor ceased to be young lady of importance when old woman be alone at once went to work in own mind resolving what must be course of proceeding to yield in matter to confirm happiness of young people never occurred to again again repeated to herself that must do duty again again repeated to herself that in allowing philip bessy to come together have neglected duty that duty required to separate in spite of love in spite of engagement though happiness of life might depend upon did not in least doubt duty be duty be duty to aggrandise house of launay so that old autocracy of land might so far a in lay be preserved that must be good pious thing to do to keep apart to force philip to marry girl in cornwall to drive bessy into mr morrison arm be to so certain that required further thought have never indulged life have be so led a to maintain power of own order relieve want of below have done nothing for own pleasure how must occur to that must be well for to change whole course of life in order that might administer to joy of young man young woman did not occur to to do so lying thus alone white sick feeble very strong of heart made resolution a bessy must not well be sent out of house till home must be provided for elsewhere philip must be made to go a be to be first step again sent for philip day mother not while be so ill said in answer to first command that must leave launay at once have not occurred to that

not because be no longer welcome there a guest unless must promise to abandon bessy be tyranny mother said mean to argue question said mr mile leaning back among pillow gaunt with hollow cheek yellow with long sickness seeming to be eye a looked at tell that must go mother then at considerable length explained intended arrangement must go live upon very modest income proposed at rate must go go at once house be hers must not have there must have one in house who disputed will have be over indulgent mother to have be return made to have condescended to explain to intention in regard to bessy have immediately resolved to thwart when be dead gone might perhaps be in power to ruin family if chose a to that must take further thought a long a lived must do duty suppose may understand said that will leave launay early after breakfast to morrow do mean to turn out of house do said looking full at eye with grey hair coming dishevelled from under large frill of nightcap with cheek gaunt yellow extended hand be very thin have be very near death seemed a gazed at to be very near now if went might be fate never to see again can not leave like said then obey why must not be married mother will not argue know a well a do will obey not in mother must not do so without perjuring then go out of house at once be sitting now bolt upright on bed supporting on hand behind whole thing be so dreadful that must not endure to prolong interview left room then there came message from old housekeeper to bessy forbidding to leave own room be thus that bessy first understood that great sin be to be made public to household mr knowl who be head of domestic have be told now felt that sort of authority over bessy have be confided to miss bessy be not to go into room at say that will not see till promise to be said by why mr knowl well miss suppose along of mr philip know that better than mr philip be to go to morrow morning never come back more never come back to launay not while thing be a be miss

carried out a far a immediate severance of lover be concerned when command have be brought by mouth of servant bessy determined that must not see philip again before went understood that be bound by position bound by gratitude bound by sense of propriety to so much obedience a earthly authority must be sufficient to make abandon troth in must not allow even aunt to sway aunt though be sick suffering even though be dying love vow be sacred to obedience at moment did owe kept room philip came to door sat mute must not speak to mr knowl when brought food asked whether intended to obey order aunt want promise from miss bessy be sure aunt know that will obey said bessy on following morning philip left house sent message to mother asking whether must see refused think have better not

take upon to say that madam be better doubt worry of last day two have be great trouble to mr knowl grew much in self importance at time felt that be overtopping miss bessy in affair of launay be le true than singular that sympathy of place must be on side of old woman illness probably have something to do with then have be so autocratic launay budcombe have be so accustomed to bow down to rebellion on part of anyone seemed to be shocking who be bessy pryor that must dare to think of marrying heir who even be supposed heir that must dare to think of marrying anyone in opposition to actual owner of acre heir though be called be not necessarily heir might do a pleased with launay budcombe there be who thought that if philip be still obstinate must leave everything to elder son did not love elder son in day never saw be gay man of world who have never be dutiful to might take name of launay family must be perpetuated a well way a other philip be very foolish a for bessy bessy be worse than foolish be verdict of place generally think launay liked trouble of neighbour be generally endurable subject for conversation be blessing launay liked excitement nevertheless felt to be compressed into whisper solemn demeanour gregory girl be solemn conscious of iniquity of friend deeply sensitive of danger to poor philip be exposed when rumour came to vicarage that fly have be up at great house be immediately conceived that mr jones lawyer from taunton have be sent for with view to alteration of will suddenness anger disruption of thing be dreadful when be discovered that fly contained one doctor there be disappointment on third day there came message from mr mile to rector must mr gregory step up see mr mile then be thought at rectory that dear old lady be again worse that have sent for clergyman that might receive last comfort of religion again be wrong mr gregory said very suddenly want to consult a to future home for bessy pryor must go from yes must go from have heard perhaps about son mr gregory acknowledged that have heard of course must go can not have philip banished from house be to be own in matter probably have be most to blame have perhaps be foolish be wickedness rather than folly have be wickeder must have be duty to great duty must have be stronger be son can not banish oh must not be brought together love bessy pryor dearly mr gregory oh so dearly since came to now so many year ago have be like gleam of sunlight in house have always be gentle with very touch of hand be sweet to must not on account sacrifice honour of family have duty to do must do though tear heart in piece where can send permanently well yes permanently if philip be married of course might come back will still trust that may be married first mean to cast off only must go anything may be wanting in money will be paid for will be provided for comfortably know what have hoped about mr morrison perhaps may even yet be able to persuade must be away from here where can send be question not very easy to answer mr gregory said that must take time to think of mr mile when asked question be aware that mr gregory have maiden sister living at avranches in normandy who be not in opulent circumstance chapter vi how bessy pryor be to be banished when man be asked by friend if know of horse to be sold doe not like immediately to suggest transfer of animal have in own stable though may at moment be in want of money anxious to sell steed so be with mr gregory sister must be delighted to take a boarder young lady for whom liberal payment must be made at first moment have hesitated to make offer by own sister must be benefited on next morning however wrote a follows dear mr mile sister amelia be living at avranches where have pleasant little house on outskirt of town with garden old friend be living with died last year sister be now alone if think that bessy must like to sojourn for awhile in normandy will write to amelia make proposition bessy will find sister good tempered kind hearted faithfully yours joshua gregory mr mile did not care much for good temper kind heart have asked whether wished bessy to be happy must no doubt have answered in affirmative must probably have done so in regard to human being animal in world of course wanted to be happy happiness be to thinking of much le importance than duty at present moment duty bessys duty philip duty be so momentous that idea of happiness ought to be considered in matter at have mr gregory written to say that sister be woman of severe moral of stern aspect prone to repress youthful ebullition supposed to be disagreeable because of temper must have be obstacle in present condition of thing suffering must be better than happiness more in accord with feeling position of person concerned be quite intelligible to mr mile bessy must really love philip almost to breaking of heart quite intelligible that philip must have set mind upon untoward marriage with obstinacy of proud man when young men young woman neglect duty heart have to be broken be not soft silken operation can be made pleasant by good temper social kindness be necessary for certain quite adequate reason bessy must be put on wheel be racked tormented to talk to of good temper of old woman who must have to turn wheel must be to lie to mr mile did not want to think that thing must be made pleasant for soon after receipt of mr gregory letter sent for bessy who be then brought into room under guard a be of mr knowl mr knowl accompanied along corridor be surely unnecessary a bessys door have not be locked upon imprisonment have only come from obedience mr knowl felt that great trust have be confided to be anxious to omit none of duty opened door so that invalid on bed must see that

in truth so grateful to be consciousness of of potency of bessys charm even over have made hasten to send away from bessy must read to day must hold hand when be half dozing must assist in movement with patience much more than tenderness of waiting maid there be voice so sweet hand so cool memory so mindful step so soft a bessys now bessy be there lying on bed caressing more closely bound to

in lover major general have be worldly untrue have be possible that philip must be a have be major general there have be moment of doubt in heart have fainted little a read lover word acknowledged to herself how wrong have be to faint at declared to be matter in own future happiness be altogether bound up then there have be playful allusion to happiness be not le pleasant to because have pretended to think that other person might be indifferent pouted lip at a though be present while be reading with joyous affectation of disdain must not consent to immediate marriage at avranches there must be delay must write to explain that then read aunt letter moved very much have read twice before there came upon feeling of doubt acknowledgment to herself that must reconsider matter even when be only reading before have begun to consider former joy be repressed almost quenched so much of be too true terribly true of course duty must be paramount if must persuade that duty required to abandon philip must abandon let suffering to herself to others be what might then what be that duty required of to sacrifice be special heroism woman can achieve yes believed that then how about sacrificing philip who doubt be telling truth when said that own happiness be altogether bound up in love be moved too by mr mile said a to grandeur of launay family have learned enough of manner of launay to be quite alive to aristocratic idiosyncrasy of old woman bessy pryor be nobody must have be well that philip launay must have founded happiness on girl of higher birth have not done so king cophetuas marriage have be recognised by world at large philip be more than king cophetua be le than beggar girl like to like in marriage be doubt expedient not indispensable though be not philip equal yet be lady must not disgrace at table among friend be sure that must be comfort to in work part of old woman letter moved most be in gave full play to own heart spoke without reserve of own love for dearest bessy day be heavy to bear because have not bessy with be impossible to read not to have desire to yield how good lady have be to be not through that have known philip for mr mile what must own life have be thought that have be sure of philip happiness must have satisfied that must bear blow must have done a be asked must have achieved heroism shown strength of gratitude must have taken delight in administering to comfort of old friend only that philip have promise that must possibly owe to world beside must be le so infinitely le than what owed to must have consulted miss gregory knew so well what miss gregory must have advised miss gregory must only have mentioned major general own experience bessy determined therefore to lie awake think of to take other counsellor beyond own heart chapter ix how bessy pryor answered two letter what came of letter be read very often that from mr mile think oftener philip love be plainly expressed what more be expected from lover letter than strong manly expression of love be quite satisfactory declaring one important fact that happiness be bound up in hers mr mile be stronger letter by far more suggestive have so mingled hardness softness have enveloped stern lesson of feminine duty in so sweet frame of personal love that be hardly possible that girl a bessy pryor must not be shaken by argument there be moment during night in have almost resolved to yield woman can soar only by suffering be not sure that wanted to soar certainly did want to do duty even though suffering must come of there be one word in aunt letter militated against writer purpose rather than assisted since first came to have never be false false hoped have not be false might be duty of man woman duty must be founded on truth be not special duty at moment to be true to philip know that be altogether logical know that in so supporting in love there may have be bias of personal inclination bessy perhaps be little prone to think that delight duty went together that flattering assurance that have never yet be false strengthened resolution to be true now to philip took whole of next day to think abstaining during whole day from word of confidential conversation with miss gregory then on following morning wrote letter to philip must be easily written word come readily when one have to give hearty assent to eager welcome proposition to deny to make denial to one loved respected to make denial of loved one have right to ask must be difficult bessy like brave girl went to hard task first rushed instantly at subject a brave horseman ride at fence without craning dearest aunt can not do a bid word to be so sacred to that dare to break can not say that wont be when feel have already given to dear dearest aunt heart be very sad a write because feel that be separating from almost for ever know that love know that be miserable because have banished from side sweet kind word of love to be like dagger to because can not show gratitude by doing a must have seems so hard know be probable may never see again yet be to be separated from will be enemy in world there be two really love though can not will not give up desire to be back at launay now only that might be with love for must be contented with simple permission that must exist love for can not be satisfied unless be allowed to be close to once again say that woman duty consists in suffering be striving to do duty know how great be suffering in doing however angry may be with bessy will not think that can appear even to be ungrateful without pang though will not give up need not fear that will do anything must come here must not suppose avoid seeing must ask to go at once must beg miss gregory to tell that must not make welcome to house in thing will do a though be daughter though know so well how far be from right to make use of so dear name dear dear aunt daughter must love better strive more faithfully to be obedient will always be even when be most angry with own poor loving most affectionate bessy other letter need perhaps be not given in entirety even in such chronicle a there seems to be something of treachery something of want of forbearance to young lady be entitled in making public word of love one may write to lover bessys letter be doubt full of love be full of prudence also begged not to come to avranches a to marriage a of have spoken be assured quite impossible must never give up so have told mr mile in respect duty to be above duty to aunt be so subject to aunt that must not in other matter disobey for sake for philip sake only for philip sake grieved that there must be more delay of course be aware that might possibly be trouble in life too many for to bear in case might make free from without word of reproach from of that alone must be judge for present must be partner to plan for future aunt have desired to stay at avranches at avranches must remain there be word of love doubt letter taken altogether be much sterner le demonstrative of affection than written to aunt there very soon came rejoinder from mr mile be so curt harsh a almost to crush bessy by laconic severity be separated from be enemy be beneath that one line old woman have signed name m mile in large plain angry letter bessy who knew turn of woman mind understood exactly how have be with when wrote few word when with care have traced that indignant signature then everything will be broken though there be one gleam of sunshine left to that gleam will be extinguished one will say that a lady of launay did not do duty be thus lady of launay have communed with when penned that dreadful line bessy understood must almost see woman a wrote then in desolation told everything to miss gregory showed two former letter showed that dreadful denunciation of lasting wrath described exactly what have be own letter to mr mile to lover miss gregory have one recipe to offer in such malady namely have taken in somewhat similar sickness gentleman must be allowed to go forth into world seek fitter wife whereas bessy must content for remainder of life with pleasure of memory miss gregory thought that be much even to have be once loved by major general when bessy almost angrily declared that must not be enough for miss gregory very meekly suggested that possibly affection might change in lapse of year that other suitor perhaps mr morrison might in course of time suffice at idea bessy became indignant miss gregory be glad to confine to remedy pure simple acknowledged to have be good for then there passed month month without line from launay from philip that mr mile must not write again be to be expected have declared enmity there be end of everything during month there have come cheque to miss gregory from man of business with cheque there have be intimation that present arrangement be to be brought to close appeared therefore that mr mile in spite of enmity intended to provide for mutinous girl continuation of comfort now enjoyed certainly nothing more than must have be expected from in regard to philip though bessy have assured have assured miss gregory also that did not at desire correspondence in present condition of affair still felt so total cessation of tidings to be hard to bear mary gregory when writing to aunt said nothing of philip merely remarked that bessy pryor must be glad to know that aunt have nearly recovered health be again able to go out among poor then bessy began to think not that philip be like major general for to idea must not give way at that higher nobler motif have induced to yield to mother if so must never reproach if so must forgive in heart of heart if so must accept destiny entreat old friend to allow to return once more to launay thenceforth to endure evil thing fate must have done to in patient submission if once word must have come to from philip then must freely declare that everything must be over then for always between lover after such suffering a while be undergoing agony so severe surely friend must forgive terrible word be enemy must surely then be withdrawn if be to be so if be to be end of love philip at least must write must not leave in doubt after decision on own part thought ought to have sustained be explained to by miss gregory that major general have taken three month before have be inspirited to send fatal letter to declare purpose of marrying money there must be little doubt according to miss gregory that philip be undergoing same process be thought natural end to affair be kind of thing young lady without dowry with heart to love be doomed to suffer there must be doubt that miss gregory regarded termination of affair with certain amount of sympathetic satisfaction must have given bessy launay lover must have done so sadness disappointment be congenial to heart broken still constant be to thinking pretty feminine acquisition be to herself heroine of own romance thought good to be heroine bessy be indignant not that philip must be false that must not dare to write say so think ought to write be on lip when door be opened lo of sudden philip mile be in room chapter x how bessy pryors lover argued case must now go back to launay will be remembered that bessy received letter on same day namely from mr mile from philip that came from launay philip have be sent away from place when fact of declared love be first made known to old lady a though into banishment be to be perpetual till must have repented of sin such certainly have be mother intention be to be sent one way girl everyone concerned be to be made to feel terrible weight of displeasure till repentance retractation must come be to be starved into obedience by minimised allowance by weariness of life at avranches person most grievously punished by arrangement be have declared to herself that must endure anything everything in performance of duty desolation of life be so extreme that be very hard to bear did not shrink tell that be unendurable after awhile persuaded now that bessy be gone there must be reason why philip also must be exiled must not her influence be more potent over philip if be at launay therefore sent for came thus be that two letter be written from same house philip obeyed mother behest in coming a have obeyed in going did not hesitate to show that felt to be aggrieved launay of course belonged to must leave property to hospital if chose be well aware of have be brought up a heir must not believe that there must come ruin of heaven earth a must be produced by change in mother intention a to launay property touching marriage felt that have right to marry whom pleased a long a be lady that dictation from mother in such matter be tyranny not to be endured have talked over with rector before went of course be possible that mother must commit injustice a at rector hinted there be said philip bound to possibility be however thought all impossible whether probable improbable fear of such tyranny must drive from purpose be little magniloquent perhaps in what said be very resolved be therefore with feeling of injury inflicted upon that first greeted mother on return to house for day two not word passed about bessy of course be delighted to be with glad enough to have shooting said in answer to word of hers shouldnt have gone a know unless have driven away be hard on old woman bore for day be simply affectionate gentle to son more gentle than be wont then wrote to bessy told son that be writing be so impossible said that can not conceive that bessy must not obey when come to regard at distance see impossibility bessy can of course do a plea replied philip almost jauntily then determined that also must write there be further dispute on matter till bessys answer came then mr mile be very angry indeed have done best so to write letter that bessy must be conquered by weight of argument by warmth of love if reason must not prevail surely gratitude must compel to do a be bidden very first word of bessys letter contained flat refusal can not do a bid who be girl have be picked out of gutter that must persist in right of becoming mistress of launay in moment old woman love be turned into feeling of condemnation nearly akin to hatred then sent off short rejoinder declaring to be bessys enemy on following morning regret have come perhaps remorse be woman of strong passion subject to impulse be at time uncontrollable be one who be always compelled by conscience to quick repentance sometimes to agonising feeling of wrong done by to declare that bessy be enemy bessy who for so many year have prevented wish who have never be weary of well doing to who have be patient in thing who have be gleam of sunshine of whom have sometimes said to herself in closet that child be certainly nearer to perfection than other human being that have known true be not fit that girl must become mistress of launay misfortune have happened must be cured if even by severance of person so dear to other a bessy knew that have signed in declaring one so good one so dear to be enemy what must do next day went on did nothing simply suffered there be pretext on must frame affectionate letter to child must not write ask to be forgiven for harshness of letter must not simply revoke sentence have pronounced without reference to philip love in great misery with strong feeling of self degradation because have allowed to be violent in wrath went on repentant still obstinate till philip forced subject upon mother said one day be not time that thing must be settled what thing philip know intention what intention a to making bessy wife can never be will be have to be if a regard own feeling must bring to yield to how must do so with honour in regard to for nothing on earth must induce to change mind be matter on man have to judge for have not heard word from from anyone to make think have judged wrongly do birth rank go for nothing paused moment then answered very seriously

that upon man who must speak to a philip have spoken not le be power in hand must bid go marry be beggar must tell that launay must go to brother must instantly make will to effect so strong be desire for masterdom upon that longed to do in very teeth of honest wish to do what be right there be wish longing to do what knew to be wrong there be struggle within during strove to strengthen for evil be

power rather be in hand must not punish boy even though have deserved have punished girl from moment have be crushed by torment because of thing that have done others besides mr mile have felt with something of regret that have lacked hardness necessary for cruelty courage necessary for doing how will be mother asked philip a knew not what to answer rose slowly from chair leaving room went to seclusion of own chamber day again passed before philip renewed question repeated in same word how will be mother wistfully looked up at a though even yet something might be accorded by to pity a though son might even yet be induced to accede to mother prayer be not that thought so no have thought much be aware that must not be so a dog will ask with eye when know that asking be in vain so did ask one word from mother will make happy not of will not happiness make happy then stooped over kissed forehead must be happy if knew be wretched want to be happy must be enough that one doe one duty

more than cousinly did not doubt that young man be philip launay knowing what knew be not disposed to make spoken complaint when bessy lifted face to be kissed miss gregory became red very uneasy be probable that have never progressed a far a with young man who afterwards became major general bessy have minute be allowed to for reflection must have be le affectionate knew nothing of cause have brought philip to avranches only knew that dear friend at launay have declared to be enemy that have determined that must not for year become wife of philip launay without consent of who have used

glorious young grate upon feeling even of who be generous self denying miss gregory be generous by nature self denying by practice philip pan bessys wondrous prosperity be for moment little hard upon there have be comfort to in conviction that philip be better than major general suppose be so said be if one of have mean exactly if be poor dont see how being young can enable to live upon nothing intended to imply that philip probably must have be major general that be heir to launay philip who have never heard of major general be little puzzled nevertheless acceded to proposition not caring

out of room having said that might go tell have never endeavoured to renew fight when have spoken to endeavouring to draw from warmth of assent have generally be very silent have never brought absolutely to wish joy have not a yet so crucified own spirit in matter a to be able to tell that have chosen wife well have shown in hundred way that anger be at end that if feeling be left opposed to own happiness be simply one of sorrow there be sign made think that even be not deep seated must pat stroking hair leaning on shoulder administering to comfort with nervous accuracy a to little thing be peculiar to then gave infinity of direction a to way in must be proper that bessy must travel being anxious at first to send over maid for behoof not mr knowl younger woman who must have be at bessys command philip however objected to maid when mr mile remarked that if be bessys fate to become mistress of launay bessy ought to have maid to attend philip said that must be very well month two hence when bessy must have become not mistress of launay be place trusted might not be vacant for many long day first lieutenant to mistress by right of marriage refused altogether to take maid with a explained to bessy with much laughter so came to understand other thoroughly bessy knew that great trouble of life have be a mountain in way have disappeared suddenly a might visionary mountain then when thoroughly understood other started back to england to launay together chapter xii how bessy pryor be brought back what then became of bessy understood condition of old woman much better than did son be little said on way home because of disappointment sad because be to have for daughter in law yes indeed philip because know that have not wanted will be kind because will belong to perhaps partly because love will always regret that young lady down in cornwall have not be allowed to add to honour greatness of family launays be everything to what can do for launays of course said many pretty thing to in answer to must not eradicate from mind feeling that in regard to old friend who have be so kind to be returning evil for good even bessy did not quite understand old woman when found that have yielded there be disappointment in old woman heart who can have indulged in certain longing for lifetime in special ambition seen that ambition that longing crushed trampled on without feeling have brought failure on herself by own weakness a told why have given way to bessy to bessys blandishment be because have not be strong to do duty that ruin have fallen upon hope power in own hand have be sufficient for philip need never have seen bessy pryor might not bessy pryor have be sent somewhere out of way when became evident that have charm of own with to be dangerous even after first evil have be done power have be sufficient need not have sent for philip back need have written letter to bessy might have be calm steady in purpose so that there must have be violent ebullition of anger so violent a to induce repentance with repentance renewed softness pang of renewed repentance when philip have left on mission to normandy heart be heavy with regret heavy also with anger be with that be angry have known duty have not done have known duty have neglected because bessy have be soft to dear pleasant be here that bessy did not quite understand friend bessy reproached because have made to friend bad return to kindness have received old woman must not allow to entertain such thought once have spoken to herself of having warmed serpent in bosom instantly with infinite self scorn have declared to herself that bessy be serpent for have done for bessy bessy have made ample return only possible return must be full enough bessy have loved too have loved bessy must have have weight though two have be linked together by very heartstrings have be duty to make severance because joint affection have be dangerous have allowed own heart to over ride own sense of duty therefore be angry not with bessy with thing be done to quarrel with philip have be impossible to one feeling coming upon own repentance own weakness acknowledgment of certain man strength on part of son have brought to such condition that have yielded then be natural that must endeavour to make best of even doing of be trial to when told that a far a woman went mere woman philip must not have found better wife have searched world round found that be being tempted from proper path even in what right must have to look for consolation there for other reason still felt to be adequate have resolved that something else must be done that something else have not be done because have failed in duty now be trying to salve sore by very poison have created wound bessys sweet temper bessys soft voice bessys bright eye bessys devotion to delight of others be so many temptation grovelling a be in sackcloth ash because have yielded to how must console by prospect of future enjoyment for son there be various duty to must attend grievously afflicted a be by want of attention to great duty a fate have determined that bessy pryor be to become mistress of launay be proper that launay must know recognise future mistress bessy certainly must not be punished by want of earnestness in respect one must be punished new mistress must be made a welcome a though have be red haired girl from cornwall knowl be good deal put about because mr mile remembering few hard word knowl have allowed to use in day of imprisonment became very stern be settled that miss pryor be to become mr philip launay will obey just a mr knowl who have saved little money began to consider whether must not be a well to retire into private life when day came on two traveller be to reach launay mr mile be very much disturbed in mind in what way must receive girl in last communication very last have called bessy enemy now bessy be being brought home to be made daughter in law under own roof how sweet must be to stand at door welcome in hall among smiling servant to make tender fuss hovering over a must be so natural with mother in law who loved adopted daughter a tenderly a mr mile loved bessy how pleasant to take by hand lead away into inner sanctum where warm kiss a between mother child must be given taken to hear praise of philip then to answer again with other praise to tell with word half serious half drollery that must now buckle on armour do work take upon task of managing household there be quite enough of softness in old woman to make delightful imagination revelled in thinking of even at moment in be telling that be impossible be impossible be to force such change upon bessy must not believe in sincerity of change have told bessy that be enemy at last carriage have gone to station be here not waggonette on occasion real carriage carriage be wont to toddle four mile hour about parish be honour meant for prodigal daughter said philip a took seat if have never be naughty must only have have

upon knee before say that love aunt say at once say that first of know love know love oh be so glad to have again be so hard not to be with when thought that be ill did not know how sick must make to be away from then at time afterwards be there word spoken on one side other a to declaration of enmity there be nothing then said in way of explanation there be nothing perhaps necessary be clear to bessy that be received at launay a philip future wife not only by mr mile by whole household that honour of place be to be awarded to without stint for herself must have sufficed to explanation of circumstance have led to change so violent be quite unnecessary be not so with mr mile must not say word in justification of herself in excuse rather than justification have bessy into bedroom that night said word holding between two thin hand hand of girl addressed have known bessy did not wish bessy muttered that did know think knew why how must help aunt upon old woman patted hand suppose must not help if have be young man must not have helped must not help a be though be old woman think be a foolish a be perhaps be foolish be not well know have misgiving about dear have object thought be sacred holy to have be wedded through many year have have to be thrust aside then will hate child will love with heart will be son wife now a such will be dear to almost a be dear will still be own bessy gleam of sunlight without whom house be so gloomy that be like prison to for do think must want other young woman about house than own dear bessy that other wife for philip must come a near heart a do if have stood in way will not think of more at rate need not think of added old woman a remembered circumstance will be made welcome with honour privilege due to philip wife if there be

everyone remembers severity of christmas of will not designate year more closely lest must enable who be too curious to investigate circumstance of story inquire into detail intend to make known that winter however be especially severe cold of last ten day of december be more felt think in paris than in part of england may indeed be doubted whether there be town in country in thoroughly bad weather be more afflicting than in french capital snow hail seem to be colder there fire certainly be le warm than in london then there be feeling among visitor to paris that paris ought to be gay that gaiety prettiness liveliness be aim a money commerce general business be aim of london with outside sombre darkness doe often seem to want excuse for ugliness on occasion at christmas of paris be gay pretty lively must not walk street without being ankle deep not in snow in snow have just become slush there be falling throughout day night of rd of december succession of damp half frozen abomination from sky made almost impossible for men woman to go about business be at ten oclock on evening that english lady gentleman arrived at grand hotel on boulevard de italiens a have reason for concealing name of married couple will call mr mr brown now wish to be understood that in general affair of life gentleman lady lived happily together with amenity must bind husband wife mr brown be one of wealthy family mr brown when married have be relieved from necessity of earning bread nevertheless have at once yielded to when expressed desire to spend winter of life in south of france though be by disposition somewhat idle little prone to energetic occupation of life must generally allow at other period of year to be carried hither thither by whose more robust nature delighted in excitement of travelling on occasion there have be little difference between early in december intimation have reached mr brown at pau on coming christmas there be to be great gathering of thompson in thompson family hall at stratford le bow that who have be thompson be desired to join party with husband on occasion only sister be desirous of introducing to family generally most excellent young man to whom have recently become engaged thompson real name however be in fact concealed be numerous thriving people there be uncle cousin brother who have done well in world who be likely to do better still one have lately be returned to parliament for essex flat be at time of be writing conspicuous member of gallant conservative majority be partly in triumph at success that great christmas gathering of thompson be to be held opinion have be expressed by legislator must mr brown with husband fail to join family on happy occasion must be regarded a being fainant thompson since marriage be affair now nearly eight year old mr brown have never passed christmas in england desirability of doing so have often be mooted by very soul craved festivity of holly mince pie there have ever be meeting of thompson at thompson hall though meeting not so significant not so important to family a one be now to be collected more than once have expressed wish to see old christmas again in old house among old face husband have always pleaded certain weakness about throat chest a reason for remaining among delight of pau year after year have yielded now loud summons have come be not without considerable trouble that have induced mr brown to come a far a paris most unwillingly have left pau then twice on journey at bordeaux tour have made attempt to return from first moment have pleaded throat when at last have consented to make journey have stipulated for sleeping at two town at paris mr brown who without slightest feeling of fatigue must have made journey from pau to stratford without stopping have assented to everything so that might be at thompson hall on christmas eve when mr brown uttered unavailing complaint at two first town at stayed did not perhaps quite believe that said of own condition know how prone strong be to suspect weakness of weak a weak be to be disgusted by strength of strong there be perhaps few word between on journey result have hitherto be in favour of lady have succeeded in bringing mr brown a far a paris have occasion be le important doubt must have yielded weather have be bad even when left pau a have made way northward have become worse still worse a left tour mr brown in hoarse whisper have declared conviction that journey must kill mr brown however have unfortunately noticed hour before that have scolded waiter on score of overcharged franc two with loud clear voice have really believed that there be danger even suffering must have yielded woman be satisfied in such matter to be taken in by false pretence observed that ate good dinner on way to paris that took small glass of cognac with complete relish man really suffering from bronchitis surely must not do so persevered brought into paris late in evening in midst of slush snow then a sat down to supper thought that did speak hoarsely loving feminine heart began to misgive now be at rate clear to that must not be worse off by going on to london than must be must remain in paris if man be to be ill have better be ill in bosom of family than at hotel what comfort must have what relief in huge barrack a for cruelty of weather london must not be worse than paris then thought have heard that sea air be good for sore throat in bedroom have be allotted to au quatrime must not even get decent fire must in way be wrong now to forego great christmas gathering when nothing must be gained by staying in paris have perceived that a husband became really ill became also more tractable le disputatious immediately after little glass of cognac have declared that must be if must go beyond paris began to fear that after everything must have be done in vain a went down to supper between ten eleven be more subdued merely remarked that journey must be sure be death of be half past eleven when got back to bedroom then seemed to speak with good sense also with much real apprehension if cant get something to relieve know will never make way on said be intended that must leave hotel at half past five next morning so a to arrive at stratford travelling by tidal train at half past seven on christmas eve early hour long journey infamous weather prospect of horrid gulf between boulogne folkestone must have be a nothing to mr brown have not be for settled look of anguish have now pervaded husband face if dont find something to relieve will never live through said again sinking back into questionable comfort of parisian hotel arm chair dear what can do asked almost in tear standing over caressing be thin genteel looking man with fine long soft brown beard little bald at top of head certainly genteel looking man loved dearly in softer mood be apt to spoil with caress what can do dearie know must do anything if must get into bed pet be warm then to morrow morning will be right at moment be preparing for bed be assisting then tied piece of flannel round throat kissed put in beneath bed clothes ill tell what can do said very hoarsely voice be so bad now that must hardly hear so crept close to bent over must do anything if must only say what then told what be plan down in salon have seen large jar of mustard standing on sideboard a left room have observed that have not be withdrawn with other appurtenance of meal if must manage to find way down there taking with handkerchief folded for purpose if must then appropriate part of content of jar returning with prize apply to throat thought that must get relief so that might be able to leave bed next morning at five be afraid will be very disagreeable for to go down alone at time of night croaked out in piteous whisper of course ill go said dont mind going in least nobody will bite at once began to fold clean handkerchief wont be two minute darling if there be grain of mustard in house ill have on chest immediately be woman not easily cowed journey down into salon be nothing to before went tucked clothes carefully up to ear then started to run along first corridor till came to flight of stair be easy enough easy enough to descend then there be corridor flight third corridor third flight began to think that be wrong found in part of hotel have not hitherto visited soon discovered by looking through open door two that have found way among set of private sitting room have not seen before then tried to make way back up same stair through same passage so that might start again be beginning to think that have lost altogether that must be able to find salon bedroom when happily met night porter be dressed in loose white dressing gown with white net over loose hair with white worsted slipper ought perhaps to have described personal appearance sooner be large woman with commanding bust thought by to be handsome after manner of juno with stranger there be certain severity of manner about fortification a be of virtue against possible attack declared determination to maintain at point beautiful character of british matron much a have be appreciated at thompson hall have met with ill natured criticism among french men woman at pau have be called la fire anglaise name have reached own ear of husband have be much annoyed have taken in good part have indeed be somewhat proud of title have endeavoured to live up to with husband must on occasion be soft be of opinion that with other men british matron must be stern be now greatly in want of assistance nevertheless when met porter remembered character have lost way wandering through horrid passage said in severest tone be in answer to question from question to reply be given very slowly then when asked where madame wished to go paused again thinking what destination must announce doubt man must take back to bedroom if so mustard must be renounced with mustard a now feared hope of reaching thompson hall on christmas eve though be in many respect brave woman did not dare to tell man that be prowling about hotel in order that might make midnight raid upon mustard pot paused therefore for moment that might collect thought erecting head a did so in best juno fashion till porter be lost in admiration thus gained time to fabricate tale have said dropped handkerchief under supper table must show way to salon in order that might pick up porter did more than accompanied to room in have supped here of course there be prolonged need hardly be said vain search good natured man insisted on emptying enormous receptacle of soiled table napkin on turning over one by one in order that lady property might be found lady stood by unhappy still patient a man be stooping to work eye be on mustard pot there be capable of containing enough to blister throat of score of sufferer edged off little towards while man be busy trying to persuade that must surely forgive if took mustard told whole story descent from juno bearing must have be so great must have owned not only to quest for mustard also to fib must not do porter be at last of opinion madame must have made mistake madame acknowledged that be afraid be so with longing lingering eye with eye turned back oh so sadly to great jar left room porter leading way assured that must find by must not leave till have put on to proper passage journey seemed to be longer now even than before a ascended many stair swore to herself that must not even yet be baulked of object must husband want comfort for poor throat comfort be there within reach not have counted stair a went up marked turn well be sure now that must know way that must return to room without fault must go back to salon even though man must encounter again must go boldly forward seize remedy poor husband so grievously required ah yes said when porter told that room be in corridor have then reached know now be so much obliged come step further be anxious to accompany up to very door stood in passage prevailed lingered awhile naturally unluckily have brought money with must not give two franc piece have earned must fetch from room feeling be to return to husband without mustard second attempt must be possible disappointed man turned on heel at last made way down stair along passage seemed to to be almost eternity while listened to still audible footstep have gone on creeping noiselessly up to very door of room there stood shading candle in hand till thought that man must have wandered away into furthest corner of endless building then turned once more retraced step there be difficulty now a to way knew stair at head of flight stood listened not sound be to be heard then went on again heart beat high with anxious desire to achieve object at same time with fear what might have be explained so easily at first must now be a difficult of explanation at last be in great public vestibule be now visiting for third time of at last visit have taken bearing accurately door be there closed indeed opened easily to hand in hall on stair along passage there have be gas here there be light beyond given by little taper carried when accompanied by porter have not feared darkness now there be something in obscurity made dread to walk length of room up to mustard jar paused listened trembled then thought of glory of thompson hall of genial warmth of british christmas of proud legislator who be first cousin with rush made good distance laid hand upon copious delf looked round there be one there sound be heard not distant creak of shoe not rattle from one of thousand door a paused with fair hand upon top of jar while other held white cloth on medicinal compound be to be placed looked like lady macbeth a listened at duncan chamber door there be doubt a to sufficiency of content jar be full nearly up to lip mixture be doubt very different from good wholesome english mustard cook make fresh for with little water in two minute be impregnated with sour odour be to english eye unwholesome of colour still be mustard seized horn spoon without further delay spread ample sufficiency on folded square of handkerchief then commenced to hurry return still there be difficulty thought of have occurred to before candle occupied one hand so that have other for sustenance of treasure have brought plate saucer from salon must have be well a be be obliged to keep eye intent on right hand to proceed very slowly on return journey be surprised to find what aptitude thing have to slip from grasp still progressed slowly be careful not to miss turning at last be safe at chamber door there be chapter ii mr brown failure with eye still fixed upon burden glanced up at number of door have be determined through not to forget that then turned latch crept in chamber also be dark after gaslight on stair be so much better have put out two candle on dressing table before have left husband a be closing door behind paused must hear that be sleeping be well aware that have be long absent quite long enough for man to fall into slumber who be given way must have be gone thought fully hour there have be no end to turning over of napkin have so well known to be altogether vain paused at centre table of room still looking at mustard now delicately dried from off hand have have idea that must have be so difficult to carry so light so small affair there be nothing have be lost took small instrument from washing stand with handle collected flowing fragment into centre then question occurred to whether a husband be sleeping so sweetly must be well to disturb listened again felt that slight murmur of snore with ear be regaled be altogether free from real malady in throat then occurred to that after fatigue perhaps have only made cross bethought how during whole journey have failed to believe in illness what meal have eaten how thoroughly have be able to enjoy full complement of cigar then that glass of brandy against have raised voice slightly in feminine opposition now be sleeping there like infant with full round perfected almost sonorous working of throat who doe not know that sound almost of two rusty bit of iron scratching against other come from suffering windpipe there be semblance of here why disturb when be so thoroughly enjoying that rest more certainly than anything else must fit for fatigue of morrow journey think that after labour must have left pungent cataplasm on table have crept gently into bed beside have not thought suddenly struck of great injury have be doing if be not really ill to send down there in strange hotel wandering among passage in middle of night subject to contumely of anyone who might meet on commission if be not sanctified by absolute necessity must be so thoroughly objectionable at moment hardly did believe that have ever really be ill let have cataplasm if not a remedy then a punishment must at rate do harm be with idea of avenging rather than of justifying past labour of night that proceeded at once to quick action leaving candle on table so that might steady right hand with left hurried stealthily to bedside even though be behaving badly to must not cause discomfort by waking roughly must do wife duty to a british matron must must not only put warm mixture on neck must sit carefully by for twenty minute so that might relieve from when proper period must have come for removing counter irritation from throat there must doubtless be little difficulty in in collecting mustard after have served purpose have be at home surrounded by own comfort application must have be made with delicate linen bag through pungency of spice must have penetrated with strength sufficient for purpose circumstance of occasion have not admitted have felt done wonder in achieving so much success a have obtained if there must be anything disagreeable in operation must submit to have asked for mustard for throat mustard must have a thought passed quickly through mind leaning over in dark with eye fixed on mixture lest must slip gently raised flowing beard with left hand with other inverted rapidly steadily very softly fixed handkerchief on throat from bottom of chin to spot at collar bone meeting together form orifice of chest covered whole noble expanse there be barely time for glance never have be more conscious of grand proportion of manly throat sweet feeling of pity came upon causing to determine to relieve suffering in shorter space of fifteen minute have be lying on back with lip apart a held back beard hand nearly covered feature of face made violent effort to free from encounter did not even move arm leg simply emitted snore louder than have come before be aware that be not wont to be so loud that there be generally something more delicate perhaps more querulous in nocturnal voice then present circumstance be exceptional dropped beard very softly there on pillow before lay face of stranger have put mustard plaster on wrong man not priam wakened in dead of night not dido when first learned that neas have fled not othello when learned that desdemona have be chaste not medea when became conscious of slaughtered child must have be more struck with horror than be british matron a stood for moment gazing with awe on stranger bed one vain half completed snatching grasp made at handkerchief then drew back hand if be to touch must not wake at once find standing there in bedroom then how must explain by what word must so quickly make know circumstance of strange occurrence that must accept before have said word might offend for moment stood paralyzed after faint ineffectual movement of arm then stirred head uneasily on pillow opened wider lip twice in rapid succession snored louder than before started back couple of pace with body placed between candle with face averted with hand still resting on foot of bed endeavoured to think what duty required of have injured man though have done most unwittingly there must be doubt that have injured if for moment must be brave injury might in truth be little how disastrous might be consequence if be now in cowardice to leave who must tell applied for fifteen to twenty minute mustard plaster may be salvation of throat ill at ease if left there throughout night upon neck of strong man ailing nothing only too prone in strength to slumber soundly how sad how painful for aught knew how dangerous might be effect surely be error man with heart in bosom must pardon judging from what little have seen of thought that must have heart in bosom be not duty to wake then quietly to extricate from embarrassment have brought upon in doing what word must use how must wake how must make understand goodness beneficence sense of duty before must have jumped from bed rushed to bell have summoned above below to rescue sir sir move stir scream have put mustard plaster on throat thinking that be husband a yet harm have be done let take off then hold peace for ever where be man of such native constancy grace of spirit at first moment of waking with shock must hear word from mouth of unknown woman by bedside at once obey to letter must not surely jump from bed with horrid compound falling about from there must be complete relief unless must keep present attitude without motion picture presented to mind a to probable conduct be so terrible that found unable to incur risk then idea presented to mind know how in moment quick thought will course through subtle brain must find that porter send to explain there must be concealment now must tell story must bid to find necessary aid ala a told that must do so knew well that be only running from danger be duty to encounter once again put out hand a though to return along bed then thrice snorted louder than before moved up knee uneasily beneath clothes a though sharpness of mustard be already working upon skin watched for moment longer then with candle in hand fled poor human nature have be old man even middle aged man must not have left to unmerited suffering a be though completely recognised duty knew what justice goodness demanded of must not do there be still left to plan of sending night porter to be not till be out of room have gently closed door behind that began to bethink how have made mistake with glance of eye looked up then saw number on door remarking to herself with briton natural criticism on thing french that horrid foreigner know how to make figure scudded rather than ran along corridor then down stair along passage so that might not be found in neighbourhood must poor man in agony rush rapidly from bed in confusion of first escape hardly ventured to look for own passage did in least know how have lost way when came upstairs with mustard in hand at present moment chief object be night porter went on descending till came again to vestibule looking up at clock saw that be now past one be not yet midnight when left husband be not at astonished at lapse of time seemed to a though have passed night among misery oh what night there be yet much to be done must find that porter then return to own suffering husband ah what now must say to if must really be ill how must assuage yet how more than ever necessary be that must leave hotel early in morning that must leave paris by very earliest quickest train must take a fugitive from present danger door of salon be open have courage to go in search of second supply must have lacked strength to carry up stair where now oh where be that man from vestibule made way into hall everything seemed to be deserted through glass must see light in court beyond must not bring to endeavour even to open hall door now be very cold chilled to very bone have be done at christmas during such severity of weather a have never before be experienced by living parisian feeling of great pity for gradually came upon what wrong have done that must be so grievously punished why must be driven to wander about in way till limb be failing then so absolutely important a be that strength must support in morning man must not die even though be left there without aid to rid of cataplasm a best might be absolutely necessary that must disgrace must not even procure mean of disgracing if telling story to night porter must have be disgrace did not find at last resolved to make way back to own room without further quest began to think that have done that must do man be ever killed by mustard plaster on throat discomfort at worst must not be worse than hers have be too probably than of poor husband so went back up stair along passage made way on occasion to door of room without difficulty way be so well known to that must not wonder that have failed before now hand have be empty eye have be at full command looked up there be number very manifest on occasion opened door most gently thinking that husband might be sleeping a soundly a other man have slept crept into room chapter iii mr

with husband be quite at ease except that be complaining of cold when be anxious to get out into carriage still stood there leisurely arranging shawl after shawl around throat can do quite a well in omnibus have just said to very crossly when there appeared upon scene through side door very night porter whom dreaded with soiled pocket handkerchief in hand even before sound of own name met ear mr brown knew understood full horror of position from man hostile face from little article held in hand if during watch of night have have money in pocket if have made friend of greedy fellow by well timed liberality might have be so different reflected that have allowed to go unfeed after trouble knew that be enemy be handkerchief that feared thought that might have brazened out anything that one have seen enter leave that strange man room one have seen dip hand in jar have doubt be found wandering about house while slumberer have be made to suffer so strangely there might have be suspicion perhaps accusation must have be ready with frequent protestation to deny charge made against though one might have believed one must have convicted here however be evidence against must be unable to stand for moment at first glance acknowledged potency of damning morsel of linen during horror of night have never given thought to handkerchief yet ought to have known that evidence must bring against be palpable certain name m brown be plainly written on corner what fool have be not to have thought of have remembered plain marking a careful well conducted british matron have put upon clothes must at hazard have recovered article oh that have waked man bribed porter even told husband now be a be friendless without support without word that must say in own defence convicted of having committed assault upon strange man in own bedroom then of having left thing must be explained by truth how to explain such truth how to tell such story in way to satisfy injured folk with only barely time sufficient to catch train then occurred to that must have legal right to stop because pocket handkerchief have be found in strange gentleman bedroom yes be mine said turning to husband a porter with loud voice asked if be not madame brown take charles come on mr brown naturally stood still in astonishment did put out hand porter must not allow evidence to pas so readily out of custody

handkerchief night porter quickly put behind back charles can not allow ourselves to be delayed will write letter to keeper of hotel explaining then essayed to swim out through front door into courtyard in vehicle be waiting for three four men woman interposed even husband did not seem quite ready to continue journey to night be christmas eve said mr brown will not be at thompson hall think of sister why did go into man bedroom dear whispered mr brown in english porter heard whisper understood language porter who have not be tipped yees vy asked porter be mistake charles there be not moment to lose can explain to in carriage then clerk suggested that madame have better postpone journey little gentleman upstairs have certainly be very badly treated have demanded to know why so great outrage have be perpetrated clerk said that did not wish to send for police here mr brown gasped terribly threw on husband shoulder did not think must allow party to go till gentleman upstairs have received satisfaction have now become clearly impossible that journey must be made by early train even mr brown gave up demanded of husband that must be taken back to own bedroom what be to be said to gentleman asked porter of course be impossible that mr brown must be made to tell story there in presence of clerk when found have succeeded in preventing from leaving house be satisfied with promise from mr brown that must inquire from wife what be mysterious circumstance must then come down to office give explanation if be necessary must see strange gentleman whom now ascertained to be certain mr jones returning from east of europe learned also that mr jones have be most anxious to travel by very morning train wife have intended to use mr jones have be most particular in giving order accordingly that at last moment have declared to be unable even to dress because of injury have be done during night when mr brown heard from clerk just before be allowed to take wife upstairs while be sitting on sofa in corner with face hidden look of awful gloom came over own countenance what must be that wife have done to man of so terrible nature have better come up with said to with marital severity poor cowed woman went with tamely a might have done patient grizel not word be spoken till be in room door be locked now said what doe mean be not till nearly two hour have passed that mr brown came down stair very slowly turning over in mind have now gradually heard absolute exact truth have very gradually learned to believe be first necessary that must understand that wife have told many fib during night a constantly alleged to when complained of conduct in respect have be told on behalf have not struggled to get mustard for comfort when have secured prize have not hurried to put on a have fondly thought throat though have fibbed to afterwards have not done so in order that might not be troubled be not angry with because be in man room asked looking full into eye not quite without sob paused moment then declared with something of true husband confidence in tone that be not in least angry with on account then kissed bade remember that after one must really injure what harm have be done charles gentleman wont die because have have mustard plaster on throat worst be about uncle john dear jane do think so much of christmas eve at thompson hall mr brown when again found in clerk office requested that card might be taken up to mr jones mr jones have sent down own card be handed to mr brown mr barnaby jones how be sir asked clerk in whisper whisper have at same time something of authoritative demand something also of submissive respect clerk of course be anxious to know mystery be hardly too much to say that everyone in vast hotel be by time anxious to have mystery unravelled mr brown must tell nothing to anyone be merely matter to be explained between mr jones said card be taken upstairs after awhile be ushered into mr jones room be of course very with reader be already acquainted there be fire burning remains of mr jones be on table be sitting in dressing gown slipper with shirt open in front silk handkerchief very loosely covering throat mr brown a entered room of course looked with considerable anxiety at gentleman of whose condition have heard so sad account must only observe considerable stiffness of movement demeanour a mr jones turned head round to greet have be very disagreeable accident mr jones said husband of lady accident dont know how must have be accident have be most most most most monstrous er er must say interference with gentleman privacy personal comfort quite so mr jones on part of lady who be wife so understand be about to become married man can understand what feeling must be wish to say a little a possible to harrow here mr brown bowed there fact did do thought be what give word a gentleman mr jones when be putting that mess upon thought be did indeed mr jones looked at new acquaintance shook head did not think possible that woman must make such mistake a have very bad sore throat continued mr brown indeed may perceive still in saying perhaps aggravated little sign of distemper asked mr brown to go down get one just what put on wish have said mr jones putting hand up to neck wish have for sake a well a mine for hers poor woman dont know when will get over shock dont know when will have stopped on journey be to have be to night very night christmas eve with young lady be engaged to marry of course couldnt travel extent of injury done nobody can imagine at present have be just a bad to sir be to have be with family christmas eve there be particular reason most particular be only hindered from going by hearing of condition why did come into room at cant understand that lady always know own room at hotel thats yours thats ours dont see how easy be have lost way be little afraid lest thing must fall down wish have with heart thats how be now im sure mr jones youll take lady apology be most unfortunate mistake most unfortunate what more can be said mr jones gave up to reflection for few moment before replied to supposed that be bound to believe story a far a went at rate did not know how must say that did not believe seemed to to be almost incredible especially incredible in regard to personal mistake for except have long beard brown beard mr jones thought that there be point of resemblance between mr brown still even that felt must be accepted then why have be left deserted to undergo torment found out mistake at last suppose oh yes why didnt wake fellow take off again ah cant have cared very much for man comfort when went away left like ah there be difficulty mr jones difficulty who be have done to come to in bedroom in middle of night put that thing on then leave there say nothing about seems to deuced like practical joke mr jones thats way look at said mr jones plucking up courage there isnt woman in england in france le likely to do thing than wife shes a steady a rock mr jones must no more go into gentleman bedroom in joke than oh dear youre going to be married man unless make difference said mr jones almost in tear have sworn must be with christmas eve oh mr jones can not believe that will interfere with happiness how must think that wife a be to be must do thing a in joke wouldnt do at joke anyway how can tell what accident might happen to anyone shed have wakened man then afterwards im sure must must never have left to suffer in way heart be too soft why didnt send to wake explain thats what jane must have done must have gone wakened whole thing be impossible said shaking head a remembered that jane be not in condition a yet to undergo such mutual trouble at last mr jones be brought to acknowledge that nothing more must be done lady have sent apology told story must bear trouble inconvenience to have subjected still however have own opinion about conduct generally must not be brought to give sign of amity simply bowed when mr brown be hoping to induce to shake hand sent word of pardon to great offender matter however be so far concluded that there be further question of police interference doubt that lady with husband be to be allowed to leave paris by night train nature of accident probably became known to mr brown be interrogated by many though professed to declare that must answer question nevertheless found better to tell clerk something of truth than to allow matter to be shrouded in mystery be to be feared that mr jones who did not once show through day who employed hour in endeavouring to assuage injury done still lived in convicsion that lady have played practical joke on subject of such joke never talk about mr jones must not be induced to speak even by friendly adherence of night porter mr brown also clung to seclusion of own bedroom never once stirring from till time came in be to be taken down to omnibus upstairs ate meal upstairs passed time in packing unpacking in requesting telegram might be sent repeatedly to thompson hall in course of day two such telegram be sent in latter of thompson family be assured that brown must arrive probably in time for breakfast on christmas day certainly in time for church asked more than once tenderly after mr jones welfare must obtain information be very cross thats know about said brown then made remark a to gentleman christian name appeared on card a barnaby sister husband name will be burnaby said man christian name be barnaby thats difference said husband with ill timed jocularity know how people under cloud be apt to fail in asserting personal dignity on former day separate vehicle have be ordered by mr brown to take wife to station now after misfortune contented with such provision a people at hotel might make for at appointed hour brought wife down thickly veiled there be many stranger a passed through hall ready to look at lady who have done that wonderful thing in dead of night none must see feature of face a stepped across hall be hurried into omnibus there be many eye also on mr jones who followed very quickly for also in spite of suffering be leaving paris on evening in order that might be with english friend on christmas day a went through crowd assumed air of great dignity to perhaps something be added by endeavour a walked to save poor throat from irritation too got into same omnibus stumbling over foot of enemy in dark at station got ticket one close after other then be brought into others presence in waiting room think must be acknowledged that here mr jones be conscious not only of presence of consciousness of presence that assumed attitude a though must have said now do think possible for to believe that mistook for husband be perfectly quiet sat through quarter of hour with face continually veiled mr brown made little overture of conversation to mr jones mr jones though did mutter reply showed plainly enough that have desire for further intercourse then came accustomed stampede awful rush internecine struggle in seat have to be found seat fancy be regularly found even by most tardy always appears that british father british husband be actuated at stormy moment by conviction unless prof very hercules daughter wife will be left desolate in paris mr brown be quite herculean carrying two bag hat box in own hand besides cloak coat rug stick umbrella when have got wife well seated with face to engine with corner seat for there be mr jones immediately opposite to mr jones a soon a perceived inconvenience of position made scramble for place be too late in contiguity journey a far a calais have to be made poor woman never once took up veil there sat without closing eye stiff a ramrod sometimes showing by little uneasy gesture that trouble at neck be still there never speaking word hardly moving limb crossing from calais to dover lady be of course separated from victim passage be very bad more than once reminded husband how well must have be with now have pursued journey a have intended a though have be detained in paris by fault mr jones a laid down on back gave up to wondering whether man before have ever be made subject to such absolute injustice now again put hand up to own beard began to doubt whether must have be moved a must have be moved without waking what if chloroform have be used many such suspicion crossed mind during misery of passage be again together in same railway carriage from dover to london have now got used to close neighbourhood knew how to endure presence of other a yet mr jones have never seen lady face longed to know what be feature of woman who have be so blind if indeed that story be true if be not true of what like be woman who must dare in middle of night to play trick a still kept veil close over face from cannon street brown took departure in cab for liverpool street station whence must be conveyed by eastern county railway to stratford now at rate trouble be over must be in ample time not only for christmas day church for christmas day breakfast will be just same a getting in there last night said mr brown a walked across platform to place wife in carriage for stratford entered first a did so there saw mr jones seated in corner hitherto have borne presence well now must not restrain from little start little scream bowed head very slightly a though acknowledging compliment then down dropped veil when arrived at stratford journey being over in quarter of hour jones be out of carriage even before brown there be uncle john carriage said mr brown thinking now at rate must be able to free from presence of terrible stranger doubt be handsome man to look at on face so sternly hostile have ever before fixed eye did not perhaps reflect that owner of other face have ever be so deeply injured by chapter v mr brown at thompson hall please sir be to ask for mr jones said servant putting head into carriage after mr mr brown have seated mr jones exclaimed husband why ask for mr jones demanded wife servant be about to tender explanation when mr jones stepped up said that be mr jones be going to thompson hall said lady with great vigour so be said mr jones with much dignity

have be slow to understand being somewhat suspicious by nature be beginning to think whether possibly mustard have be put by lady on throat with reference to connexion with thompson hall must be that for reason of own have wished to prevent coming have contrived untoward stratagem out of brain have wished to make ridiculous to thompson family to whom a family be at present unknown be becoming more more improbable to that whole thing must have be accident when after first horrid torment of morning in have in agony invoked assistance of night porter have begun to reflect on situation have

being discussed then sister in law child disappeared be incumbent on lucy to fix somewhere must begin life after what seemed to to be most unfeminine fashion just a though be young man for be thus that described to herself own position over over again at time lucy graham be twenty six year old have hitherto regarded a being stronger more steadfast than be woman generally of age have taught to despise feminine weakness have learned to be almost brother equal in managing affair of shop in absence have declared to herself looking forward then to future necessity have become present to with terrible quickness that must not be feckless helpless insufficient for herself a be so many female have girded up for work day life looking forward to time when might leave telegraph become partner with brother sudden disruption have broken up that be twenty six well made cheery healthy to eye singularly good looking though one probably must have called pretty handsome in first place complexion be brown be impossible to deny that whole face be brown a also be hair generally dress there be pervading brownness about left upon who met lasting connection between lucy graham that serviceable long

doubted much also have be bookseller man in larger way of business than brother fifteen year older than widower with family knew to be good man with comfortable house adequate income kind heart have gone to must not have be required then to live among bookshelf telegraph have doubted much whether must not go to knew must love child thought that must buckle to new work with will feared feared that must not love perhaps there have come across heart idea of what might be joy of real downright hearty love if so be only idea personage have come across path thus to disturb idea fear have be so strong with that have never be able to induce to become wife of man when have come to after brother death in worst desolation when prospect of service in other nursery have be strongest before eye have still refused perhaps there have be pride in feeling that a have rejected in comparative prosperity must not take now when renewal of offer might probably be effect of generosity did refuse widowed bookseller have to look elsewhere for second mother for child then there arose question how where must live when came to point of settling that idea of starting in life like young man became very awful indeed how be to do must respectable keeper of lodging take in upon that principle if so in what way must plan out life sixteen hour day be to be own what must do with be be not to contemplate enjoyment of social pleasure if so how be to be found of such nature a not to be discreditable on rare occasion have gone to play with brother have then enjoyed treat thoroughly whether have be hamlet at lyceum lord dundreary at haymarket have found equally able to be happy there must not be for now even such rare occasion a thought that knew that young woman alone must not go to theatre with propriety let be ever so brave then three shilling day though sufficient for life must hardly be more than sufficient how must begin at last chance assisted girl also employed in telegraph office with whom there have be family acquaintance over beyond formed in office happened at time to be thrown upon world in such fashion a herself two agreed to join force be one sophy wilson by name be agreed between that must club mean together hire room for joint use here must be companionship possibly after awhile sweet friendship sophy be younger than might probably need perhaps be willing to accept assistance to be able to do something must be of use to somebody must felt go far towards giving life that interest must otherwise lack when lucy examined friend thinking of closeness of future connection be startled by girl prettiness youth thorough unlikeness to herself sophy have long black glossy curl large eye pink complexion be very short seemed to have inclination for strong serviceable brown binding be so valuable in lucy eye rather to be wedded to bright colour soft material soon became evident to elder young woman that younger looked upon employment simply a stepping stone to husband to get married a soon a possible be unblushingly declared by sophy wilson to be one object of ambition a supposed that of other girl in telegraph department seemed to be friendly at first docile to have be brought up with aptitude for decent life to be imbued with necessity of not spending more than three shilling day be quick enough at work in office quicker even than lucy herself be taken by lucy a evidence that new friend be clever must therefore probably be agreeable companion took together bedroom in very quiet street in clerkenwell street might be described a genteel because contained shop here began to keep house a called now nature of work be such that be not called upon to be in office till noon that then be required to remain there till eight in evening at two short space be allowed for dinner be furnished to at cheap rate in room adjacent to in worked here for eightpence must get good meal if preferred must bring food with even have cooked upon premise in evening tea bread butter be provided for by official then at eight few minute after left building walked home keeping of house be restricted in fact to providing tea bread butter for morning meal perhaps when must afford for repetition of such comfort later in evening there be sunday to be considered a to day made contract with keeper of lodging house to sit at table partake of dish so be established from first lucy graham made up mind that be duty to be very friend of friend to new companion be a though have consented to marry widowed bookseller must then have considered bound to devote to welfare be not that must a yet say that loved sophy wilson love with must not be so immediate a nature of bond between be such that might possibly do so much for happiness unhappiness of other then though sophy be clever for a to lucy did not doubt still be too evidently in many thing inferior to herself much in want of such assistance a stronger nature must give lucy in acknowledging put down own greater strength to score of year nature of life have be called upon to lead have early in day be required to help to hold own to be a be woman of business weakness of other be very apparent to doctrine a to necessity of husband have be very soon declared have well almost disgusted lucy then found cause to lament peculiar arrangement requirement of office have made a to hour at first have seemed to to be very pleasant that must have morning hour for needlework perhaps for little reading when found that sophy must lie in bed till ten because early rising be not obligatory then wished that have be classed among whose presence be demanded at eight after awhile there be little difference between a to what might what might not be done with propriety after office hour be over must be explained that in huge room in eight hundred girl be at work together there be also sprinkling of boy young men a girl be employed there after eight there must always be on duty in afternoon increasing number of other sex of whom remained there till late at night indeed night now whether by chance a lucy feared by management sophy wilson have usual seat next to young lad with whom soon contracted certain amount of intimacy from intimacy arose proposition that two must go with mr murray be at first called mister formal appellation soon degenerated into familiar alec to music hall lucy graham at once set face against music hall why asked other girl dont mean to say that decent people dont go to music hall dont mean to say anything of kind then go decently attended how decently must be decent with brother said lucy something of kind brother ejaculated other girl with tone of thorough contempt visit to music hall with brother be not at sort of pleasure to sophy be looking forward did best to get over objection to seemed to be fastidious absurd observing that if people be to feel like there must be coming together of people at when found that lucy must not be instigated to go to music hall that idea of alec murray going to such place unattended by others be regarded a proposition too monstrous to be discussed sophy for awhile gave way returned again again to subject thinking to prevail by asserting that alec have friend most excellent young man who must go with bring sister alec be almost sure that sister must come lucy however must have nothing to do with lucy thought that there must be very great intimacy indeed before anything of kind must be permitted so there be something of quarrel sophy declared that life a theirs be too hard for that kind of amusement be necessary unless be allowed delight must go mad must die must throw off waterloo bridge lucy remembering duty remembering how imperative be that must endeavour to do good to one human being with whom be closely concerned forgave tried to comfort forgave even though at last refused to be guided by monitress for sophy did go to music hall with alec murray reporting reporting falsely that be accompanied by friend friend sister lucy poor lucy be constrained by certain circumstance to disbelieve false assertion feared that sophy have gone with alec alone a be fact yet forgave friend how be to live together at if can not forgive others offence chapter ii abraham hall a there be immediate repetition of offence forgiveness soon became complete lucy found interest of life in endeavour to be good to weak child whom chance have thrown in way for sophy wilson be weak child be full of alec murray for awhile induced lucy to make young man acquaintance lad be earning twelve shilling week if two poor young creature chose to love other get married must be respectable though might be unfortunate must at rate be way of world be natural combination with must have right to interfere found that alec be mere boy with idea beyond enjoyment of bright scarf penny cigar with girl by side at music hall dont think can be worth while to go much out of way for sake said lucy who be going out of way not he a good a anybody else suppose one must have somebody to talk to sometimes last word uttered so plaintively showing so plainly that be unable to endure simple unchanging dulness of life of labour that lucy heart be thoroughly softened towards have great gift of being not le able to sympathize with weakness of weak because of own abnormal strength so came to pas that worked for friend stitching mending when girl ought to have stitched mended for reading to even though little of what be read might be understood yielding to assisting in thing till at last came to pas that in truth loved such love care be much wanted for elder girl soon found that younger be weak in health a well a weak in spirit there be day on must not at rate did not go to office when six month have passed by lucy have not once be absent since have begun new life have seen that man who have come to look at house asked sophy one day a be walking down to office lucy have seen strange man having met on stair isnt fine fellow for anything know let hope that be very fine said lucy laughing he about a handsome chap a think ever saw a for being chap man saw must be near forty be little old must say not near that dont think can have wife wouldnt come here he engineer have care of steam engine in city road great printing place name be abraham hall he earning three four pound week man like ought to have wife how did learn about true sally heard from mr green mr green be keeper of lodging house sally be maid couldnt help speaking to yesterday because be at door together talked just like gentleman although be smutty greasy be glad talked like gentleman told lodged here that be telegraph girl that never got home till half past eight must be just beau for because be big steady looking fellow dont want beau said lucy angrily then will take said sophy a entered office soon after that came to pas that there did arise slight acquaintance between girl abraham hall partly from fact of near neighbourhood partly perhaps from little trick on sophys part man seemed to be so steady so solid so little given to lightness of flirtation to dangerous delight that lucy be inclined to welcome accident when saw on sunday morning free from soil of work must perceive that be still young man probably not much over thirty there be look about a though be well inured to care of world such a be often produced by possession of wife family not look of depression by mean seeming to betoken appreciation of seriousness of life from lucy unconsciously accepted idea of security in man feeling that might be pleasant to have strong one near from whom in case of need assistance might be asked without fear for man be tall broad powerful seemed to lucy eye to be very pillar of strength when must stand still for moment to greet in street poor sophy who have so graciously offered man to friend at beginning of intercourse seemed soon to change mind to desire attention for herself be certainly much more worthy than alec murray to lucy to whom be rule of life a strong a in commandment that girl must not throw at man must be sought by be painful thing to see how many of poor sophys much needed sixpence be now spent in little article of finery by be hoped that mr hall eye might be gratified how glossy ringlet be brushed made to shine with pomatum how little collar be washed re washed starched re starched in order that might be smart for lucy who be always neat endeavoured to become browner browner did by way of reproach condemnation not at surmising that mr hall might possibly prefer good solid wearing colour to glittering blue pink gewgaw at time sophy be always full of what mr hall have last said to after awhile broached idea that be gentleman in disguise why in disguise why not gentleman not in disguise asked lucy who have own idea perhaps little exaggerated a to nature gentleman then sophy explained gentleman real gentleman in disguise must be very interesting one who have quarrelled with father perhaps because must not endure paternal tyranny have then determined to earn own bread till might happily come into family honour property in year two perhaps instead of being abraham hall be in reality right honourable russell howard cavendish if during temporary abeyance must prove thorough emancipation from thraldom of aristocracy by falling in love with telegraph girl how fine must be when lucy expressed opinion that mr hall might be very fine fellow though be fulfilling no more than normal condition of life at present moment sophy must not be contented declaring that friend with reading knew nothing of poetry in way talked very frequently about abraham hall till lucy must often feel that such talking be indecorous then must be silent for awhile herself rebuke other girl for constant mention of man name then again must be brought back to subject for in little intercourse took place between man conduct be so simple yet so civil that must not really feel to be unworthy of place in thought sophy soon declared frankly to friend that be absolutely in love with man wouldnt have know said when lucy scolded for avowal have how can bring to talk in such way about man what doe want of of men do marry know sometimes said sophy dont know how young man be to get wife unless girl will show that be fond of must show first that be fond of thats very well for talkee talkee said sophy doesnt do for practice men be awfully shy then though do marry sometimes dont want to get married particularly not a do come like accident how be man to fall into pit if there pit open in answer to lucy used many argument much scolding to very little effect that other girl must have thought so much about be so ready with argument be horrid to pit open ejaculated lucy must rather never speak to man again than regard in such light sophy said that might be very well declared that must not wash elder girl be so much shocked by there came upon gradually feeling of doubt whether joint life must be continued sophy declared purpose openly of entrapping abraham hall into marriage have absolutely induced to take to theatre have asked lucy to join have sternly refused basing refusal on inability to bear expense when offered to give treat told with simple gravity that nothing must induce to accept favour from man who be not either very old friend near relation when said so looked at that be sure that approved of resolve did not say word to press took sophy wilson a lucy knew paid for sophys ticket displeased lucy so much that began to think whether there must not be separation must not continue to live on term of affectionate friendship with girl whose conduct so strongly disapproved then again though must not restrain poor light thing altogether did restrain in degree be doing good by companionship then if really be in man mind to marry girl that certainly must be good thing for girl with husband must be steady enough be quite sure that idea of preparing pit for one a abraham hall must be absurd sophy be pretty clever if married must at rate love husband lucy thought have heard that steady severe thoughtful men be apt to attach to woman of butterfly order did not like way in sophy be doing then who be that must be judge if abraham hall liked must not that be much more to purpose therefore resolved that there must be separation at present if possible quarrelling soon came to pas that there be very solid reason against separation sophy who be often unwell must sometimes stay away from office for day two on score of ill health though by doing so lost one of three shilling on such day gradually became worse superintendent at department have declared that in case of further absence medical certificate must be sent doctor attached to office have called upon have looked grave have declared that wanted considerable care have then gone so far a to recommend rest meant absence from work for at least fortnight ordered medicine of course meant loss of third of wage in such circumstance at time be not likely that lucy must think of separation while sophy be ill abraham hall often came to door to inquire after health so often that lucy almost thought that friend have succeeded man seemed to be sympathetic anxious must hardly have inquired with so much solicitude have not really be anxious a to poor sophys health then when sophy be better must come in to see girl must deck out with little ribbon must have collar always starched ironed ready for reception certainly did seem to lucy that man be becoming fond of foolish little friend during period lucy of course have to go to office alone leaving sophy to care of lodging house keeper in solitude trouble be heavy on in first place sophys illness have created certain necessarily increased expense at same time joint income have be diminished by one shilling week out of six lucy be in general matter allowed to be dispenser of money on occasion other girl must assert right always meant right to indulgence out of joint income must be indulgence to alone even bright ribbon must not be have for nothing lucy wanted bright ribbon when be fairly prosperous have not grudged little expenditure in direction have told that young girl like to be bright in eye of men that have right even to endeavour to make friend look at thing with eye even confessed to herself deficiency on own part want of womanliness in did not aspire to be attractive still owning to herself vehemently declaring to herself to be attractive in eye of man whom must love must of delight be most delightful thinking of have endeavoured not to be angry with poor sophy when became pinched for shilling sixpence to feel doubtful whether at end of fortnight there must be money to pay mr green for lodging coal then heart became sad within told that sophy though be ill ought to be more careful there be trouble for awhile be very grievous telegraphy be art not yet perfected among be still subject to many change now be case at time that pundit of office be in favour of system of communicating message by ear instead of by eye little dot prick even in lucy time have be changed more than once have quickly become familiar to one must read use telegraphic literature more rapidly correctly than lucy graham now that system of little tinkling sound be coming up system seemed to be very pleasant to female who be gifted with musical aptitude found to be le quick le expert le useful than neighbour be very sad for have always be buoyed up by unconscious conviction of own superior intelligence then though there have be neither promise threat have become aware at rate have thought that be aware that girl who must catch use tinkling sound must rise more quickly to higher pay than le gifted one have struggled therefore to overcome difficulty have endeavoured to force ear to do ear be not capable of accomplishing have failed to day have owned to herself that must fail sophy have be one of first to catch tinkling sound lucy came back to room sad down at heart full of trouble have long task of needlework before have be put by for awhile through cause consequent on sophys illness now be better perhaps will marry take away will be alone again said to herself a though declaring that state of thing must be relief to almost happiness have just be here said sophy to a soon a entered room sophy be painfully cruelly smart clean starched shining about lock so prepared that a lucy thought must have evidently expected well what did say have not said much yet be very good of to come see be looking so handsome be going out somewhere evening to political meeting with two three other men be got up quite like gentleman do like to see look like always think working man look best in working clothes said lucy there truth about then when get into black coat be pretending to be something else everybody can see difference there be severity almost savageness in surprised sophy so much that at first hardly knew how to answer be going to speak at meeting said after pause of course have to make tidy told that be going to say must not like to hear speak said lucy very sharply setting to work instantly upon labour not giving moment for preparation moment for rest why must like to hear man speak who must condescend to love so empty so vain thing a then became gradually ashamed of own feeling yes said think must like to hear speak only if be not quite so tired mr hall be man of good sense well educated think must like to hear speak must like to hear say one thing know said sophy then lucy in rage tore asunder fragment of garment on be working chapter iii sophy wilson go to hastings sophy went back to work in very few day be permanently moved from seat have hitherto occupied next to alec murray near to lucy to distant part of chamber in tinkling instrument be used a part of arrangement consequent on be called on to attend from ten till six instead of from noon till eight hour for dining be changed also in way great separation between girl be made for must walk to office together walk from to lucy though be sometimes inclined to be angry with friend be very painful sophy triumphed in greatly think be to have step up to s in musical box said laughing for be so that called part of room in little bell be always ringing wont be nice to have s d instead of s lucy said solemnly that increase of income be always nice that when such income be earned by superiority of acquirement be matter of just pride enunciated with something of dogmatic air having schooled to give due praise to sophy although have to be given at expense of own feeling when sophy said in reply that be just what have be thinking that a must do work by ear be of course worth more than who must not then other must only with difficulty repress soreness of heart to sophy think new arrangement be most pleasant because enabled to reach street in lived just when abraham hall be accustomed to return from work must generally come home to clean a called must then again go out for employment amusement for evening now by proper system of lying in wait by creeping slow walking quick by watching well be generally able to have word two with be so very bashful must always call miss wilson of course be obliged to call mr how be miss graham asked one evening be very well think lucy be always well never knew anybody so strong a be be great blessing how be do get so tired at nasty office though of course like what be doing now better than other be that rolling up band used to kill dont think will ever really be strong till get away from telegraph suppose have young lady where be there be believe lot of in building stitching binding never see dont think care much for young lady mr hall not much now why not now what doe mean dare say never told miss graham before have wife of own for time wife yes indeed did not stay with long left before have be year married left died said correcting very quickly false impression word have be calculated to make dear died before year be out how sad be very sad have baby mr hall wish have have none because then must have be still living yes have boy poor little mortal be two year old think to day must so like to see little boy do bring day mr hall then father explained that child be in country down in hertfordshire nevertheless promised that must day bring up to town show to new friend surely having once be married having child must want wife yet how little apt be to say do of thing by saying doing men be supposed to express desire in direction be very slow at making love so slow that sophy hardly found able to make use of own little experience with alec murray who however in way of husband be not worth thinking of have great deal more to say for must put on ribbon for mr hall wait for in street look up into face call mr hall must not tell how dearly must love little boy what excellent mother must be to unless gave encouragement when lucy heard that have be married man that have child be gratified though knew not why yes must like to see of course said speaking of boy child if have not responsibility of taking care of be always nice must so like to take care of must not like to ask to bring boy up out of country paused moment then added be just man whom must have thought must have married just man to be made very serious by grief of such loss be coming to think doe person good to have to bear trouble must not say that if always felt a sick a do after day work about week after sophy be so weak in middle of day that be obliged to leave office go home know will kill said that evening if go on with place be so stuffy nasty then terrible stair if must get out of settle down then must be quite well be not made for kind of work not like be think be made for certainly be such blessing to be strong said poor sophy yes be blessing do bless god that have made so be one good thing have be given to be better think than others a said looked at sophy thought that be very pretty thought also that prettiness have danger temptation good strong serviceable health might perhaps be better for one who have to earn bread through thought there be great struggle going on within to be able to earn one bread without personal suffering be very good to be tempted by prettiness to ribbon pomatum vanity one can not afford be very bad to do a sophy be doing in regard to young man setting cap at resolving to make prey of a fowler doe of bird be to way of thinking most unseemly to be loved by such man a abraham hall to be chosen by a companion to be removed from hard outside unwomanly work of world to indoor occupation husband must require from how much better life according to real taste must that be than anything now saw before be very well to be brown strong while exigency of position be now surrounded must not keep from dreaming of something must have be much better than that month two passed away during child have on one occasion be brought up to town on saturday evening have be petted washed fed generally cared for by two girl during sunday greatly increased intimacy with father now a lucy quickly observed abraham hall called sophy by christian name when word be first pronounced in lucy presence sophy blushed looked round at friend never said that change have be made at own request do so hate to be called miss wilson have said seems among friend a though be hundred year old then have called sophy did not dare not a yet to call abraham other girl watched very closely saying nothing during two month sophy have be away from office more than time then doctor said have better leave town for awhile be september be desired that must pas that month at hastings now must be explained that in such emergency a department have provided most kindly aid for young woman five six at time be sent out for month to hastings to brighton be employed in telegraph office in town railway fare be paid for small extra allowance be made to to enable to live away from home privilege be too generally sought to be always at command of who want be accorded except on doctor certificate in september sophy wilson be sent down to hastings in spite however of official benevolence greatly lightened special burden illness must always bring on who have to earn bread in sophy wilson case have done so much for nevertheless weight of misfortune fell heavily on poor little struggle have to be made a to clothes before girl must be sent away from home though sick one be enabled to support at hastings cost of london lodging must have be divided fell entirely upon lucy then at end of month there came worse tidings doctor at hastings declared that girl be unfit to go back to work be indeed altogether unfit for such effort a eight hour continued attendance required from wanted at rate period of perfect rest therefore remained down at seaside without extra allowance be so much needed for maintenance then struggle became very severe with lucy so severe that began to doubt whether must long endure sophy have two shilling day two third of wage must not subsist on something have to be sent to in addition something must only come from lucy wage so at least be at first in order to avoid debt gave up more comfortable room went upstairs into little garret denied accustomed dinner at office contenting with bread cheese often simply with bread must take in pocket washed own clothes mended even own boot so still might send part of earnings to sick one be better abraham asked one day be hard to know mr hall writes just a feel at moment be afraid fear to return to office perhaps doe not suit suppose not think other kind of life must be better for dare say must must do anything asked man very slowly must do anything well yes lucy at least thought that must do great deal there be one thing if must do must make sophy at rate believe to be well sickness be not organic be not a appeared due to cause must be specified have not a yet be called by name such a consumption general debility have be spoken of by office doctor by at hastings now lucy certainly thought that few word from mr hall must do more than doctor in way of effecting cure sophy hated telegraph office lacked strength of mind necessary for doing be distasteful to that idea of husband have taken such hold of that nothing else seemed to to give prospect of contentment why dont go down see mr hall said then be silent for awhile before answered silent very thoughtful lucy a sound of own word rested on ear felt have done wrong in asking question why must go down unless indeed be in love with girl prepared to ask to be wife if be to go down expressly to visit at hastings unless be so prepared what false hope must raise what damage must do instead of good how indeed must possibly go down on such mission without declaring to world that intended to make girl wife be necessary that question must be answered must do good by that said perhaps not only thought what did think now asked question showed plainly by manner that expected answer dont know said lucy blushing suppose ought not to have thought anything seemed to be so fond of fond of well one doe get fond of kind neighbour suppose must think impertinent miss lucy have never made even approach to familiarity before if be to say that be fond of of indeed replied thinking that a fondness declared by young man for two girl at one same moment must not be interesting so neither must be impertinent dont think must do good by going down that kind of thing cost so much money of course doe be very wrong must like to do something miss lucy then put hand into trouser pocket lucy knew that be going to bring forth money be very poor idea of taking money from be shocking to according to theory of life even though sophy have be engaged to man a promised wife must not consent to accept maintenance from pecuniary aid till have be made in very truth flesh of flesh bone of bone present engaged girl might take of course hardly even present of simple utility shawl might be given so that be pretty thing not shawl merely for warmth engaged girl must rather live on bread water up to marriage than take mean of living from man loved till must take by right of having become wife such be feeling now knew that man be about to offer money will do very well said sophy together be very hard pinched replied have given up room yes have done that when be alone did not want so big place suppose understand about said somewhat roughly perhaps gruffly must be better word think there be one thing poor people ought never to do ought never to be ashamed of being poor among then looked up into face a did so tear formed in of eye be ashamed of anything before asked be afraid of telling truth lest must offer to help know dont have dinner regular a used who have dared to tell that mr what be dinner to anybody well be something to if be to be friend of course dont like seeing go without meal youll be ill next be very strong isnt way to keep so to work without victual youre used to be talking to now in such tone a to make almost feel that be scolding good can come of be sending money down to hastings to of course share everything wouldnt take anything from for dare say anybody can see how proud be if leave for dont think have right to refuse of course want if dont with brought out sovereign put down on table indeed couldnt mr hall said may give to if please can send said lucy not knowing how else to answer couldnt dont know address then without waiting for word walked out of room leaving sovereign on table occurred in small back parlour on ground floor be in occupation of landlady be used sometimes by lodger for such occasional meeting what be to do with sovereign must be very angry if man be to send sovereign be not right that must measure sophys feeling by own then might still be that man be sending present to girl whom intended to make wife why why why have asked about dinner what be affair to must not have gone without dinner for ever rather than have taken at hand yet who be there in world of whom thought so well a of so took sovereign upstairs with into garret chapter iv mr brown hairdresser lucy when got up to own little room with sovereign sat for awhile on bed cry must not in least explain to herself why be that be shedding tear at moment be not because sophy be ill though be cause to of great grief because be so hard put to for money to meet want may be doubted whether grief pain ever doe of produce tear be rather outcome of emotional feeling be not thinking much of sophy a cried certainly be own want present to mind sovereign be between finger did not at first even turn mind to consider what have best be done with what right have to make inquiry a to poverty be that told now provoked to anger so that wept from sheer vexation why must have searched into want spoken to of need of victual what have there be between to justify in tearing away that veil of custom be always supposed to hide private necessity from acquaintance till ourselves feel called upon to declare have talked to about meal ought to know that must starve rather than accept one from yes be very angry with must henceforth keep aloof from still a sat there be present to eye ear form word of heroic man have seemed to scold there be female heart can be better reached more surely touched by truth of anger than by patent falseness of flattery have paid compliment must not now have be cry must have complained to herself of usage certainly must not have sat thinking of wondering what sort of woman have be that young wife to whom have first given wondering whether be possible that sophy must be good enough for then got up looking down upon own hand gazed at sovereign till have made up mind what must do with at once sat down wrote to sophy have made up mind there must be diminution in contribution made from own wage in way must portion of sovereign administer to own comfort though might want accustomed victual ever so badly must not come to from earnings so told sophy in letter mr hall have expressed great anxiety for welfare have begged that must accept present from be to get anything with sovereign might best

privacy of may be of vital importance must be kept during hour of work a free a possible from communication with public be not that girl young men must be prone to tell word have be mean of passing on to destination that might be worth while of sinner to offer great temptation that power of offering must be lessened a much a possible therefore when abraham hall pressed request doorkeeper told that be quite impossible do mean to say that if be affair of life death must not be called out abraham asked in voice have sometimes seemed to lucy to be so impressive be not prisoner dont know a to replied man must have to see superintendent suppose then let see superintendent at last did succeed in seeing one whom so convinced of importance of message a to bring lucy to door miss graham said

married be first word said in street have written to yes have told about be so glad that must be settled to liking out of town say that be nearly well now hope that mr brown be good sort of man that will be kind to must hardly be possible lucy thought that must have taken away from office merely to talk to of sophys prospect be evident that be strong enough to conceal chagrin might have be caused by sophys apostacy must however be case that be going to leave london because feeling have be too much disturbed to allow of remaining quiet so be going away be for long well yes suppose be for always then there came upon sense of increased desolation be not only friend then though have refused pecuniary assistance there have be present to feeling that there be near to strong human being whom must trust who in last extremity must be kind to for always go to night then thought that have be right to insist on seeing must certainly have be great blow to if have gone without word of farewell there be man wanted immediately to look after engine at great establishment on wye in forest of dean have offered four pound week four pound week must go at once have be talked about for time now have come in clap have to be off without day notice almost before know where be a for leaving london be just what like love country oh yes said lucy will be nice about little boy must be that be to be asked to do something for child be now at door of house here be said perhaps can say better inside what have got to say then followed into back sitting room on ground floor chapter v abraham hall married said about little boy must not say what have to say in street though have thought to do so then paused sat down feeling did not know why a though must lack strength to hear if stood be then case that particular service be to be demanded from something must show confidence in very idea of seemed at once to add grace to life must have child to love there must be something for to do there must be letter between must certainly add grace to life how odd that must not take child with have paused moment while thought of be aware that be looking at did not dare to return gaze even to glance up at face then gradually felt that be shivering trembling what be that ailed just now when must be so necessary that must speak out with strength have eaten nothing since breakfast when have come to be afraid that must show to be weak will be mother said what did mean how be to answer knew that eye be on hers be more than ever firmly fixed upon floor be aware that ought briskly to have acceded to request so a to have shown by ready alacrity that have attributed no other meaning to word than have be intended to convey that have not for moment be guilty of rash folly though be so imperative upon to say word yet must not speak everything be swimming round be not even sure that must sit upon chair lucy said then thought must have fallen lucy will be wife there be doubt about word sense of hearing be at rate not deficient there came upon at once thorough conviction that trouble have be changed for ever day into joy blessing word have be spoken from certainly must never go back of course of course must be commandment to yet there be unfitness about disturbed be still powerless to speak remembrance of meanness of clothes poorness of position came upon so that must be duty to tell that be not fit for yet must not speak if will say that want time to think about will be contented said did not want moment to think about must not have confessed to herself that have learned to love oh so much too dearly if be not for most unexpected most unthought of almost impossible revelation did not want moment to make herself sure that did love yet must not speak will say that will think of for month then there came upon idea that be not asking because loved in order that might have mother whom must trust for child even must have be flattering must not have sufficed then when told what be rather what thought to be felt sure that must not really love why must such man a love woman then mouth be opened can not want for said not for then why be not man to seek girl for fortune have none then again be dumfounded must not explain what meant must not say because be brown because be plain because have become thin worn from want because clothes be old shabby ask said because with heart love be a though heaven have be opened to that must speak word be not true be to impossible a be so must not coy love to for moment if only must have found word with to speak to must not even look up at put out hand so a to touch lucy said stand up come to then stood up with one little step crept close to side lucy can love a asked question arm be pressed round waist a put up hand to welcome rather than to restrain embrace again felt strength support warmth of grasp will not say that love be poor thing replied poor thing be well yes there be different way of being poor have be poor enough in time never thought poor thing must not say ever of again girl must not think poor thing may not say girl then there be just little murmur sound must have be yes for inability of lip to open if girl then wife will wife be called poor thing lucy have seen dont think like poor thing like do do now must go back to city road give up charge take money must leave at seven after cup of tea will see again see again oh to day mean indeed will not see off own own own man what will say at office dont care what say let say what like have never be absent day yet without leave what time will be here then named hour of course will have last word perhaps will tell something must do must leave money with not yet that will come after said smiling up at with sparkle of tear in eye with such smile then caught in arm kissed may come at present at rate said to though be repeated once again there be opposition then in own masterful manner put on hat stalked out of room without more word must return to office afternoon of course if only for sake of explaining wish to absent rest of day must not go forth into street just yet though have be able to smile at to return caress for moment so to stand by that might have something of delight of love still be too much flurried too weak from excitement of last half hour to walk back to post office without allowing minute to recruit strength collect thought went at once up to own room cut for bit of bread began to eat just a one must trim one lamp carefully for night work even though oppressed by heaviest sorrow put fuel on fire must be needed then having fed leaned back in chair throwing handkerchief over face in order that might think of oh how much there be to fill mind with many thought looking back to what have be even hour ago then assuring with infinite delight of certain happiness of present position told that world have be altered to within short space a for loving there be doubt about now must own to herself that have long since loved even when thought that might probably take that other girl a wife that must love be not matter of course being what be that must love that be marvel did need not doubt that must remember distinctly word of assurance that have spoken to ask because with heart love may not say girl if girl then wife think that like poor thing like if be regarded by a good enough to be wife then must certainly never call poor thing again in trouble poverty especially in solitude have often thought of other older man who have wanted to make wife sometimes almost with regret there must have be duty for home mode of life more fitting to feminine nature than solitary tedious existence there must have be something for to love human being on whom to spend human solicitude sympathy have leagued with sophy wilson have be true to bond have have in little satisfaction other life have sometimes thought must have be better have never loved man must not have loved a husband must thought be loved by wife have done what be right in refusing good thing have offered now be rewarded now have come to bliss of have dreamed that of belonging to man to whom felt that be bound by chord of heart then repeated name to herself abraham hall tried in lowest whisper sound of other name lucy hall opened arm wide a sat upon chair a though in way must take child to bosom have be sitting so nearly hour when started up suddenly again put on old hat hurried off towards office felt now that a regarded clothes did not care about there be paradise prepared for so dear so near that present be made quite bright by merely being short path to future for sake cared a belonging to must fain have be possible not have shown in garb unfitting for wife everything about have always be decent fitting serviceable well be own doing have chosen a be must not run in debt to make herself fit for notice because such debt must have be debt to be paid by if must squeeze from food what must supply with garment fit at rate to stand with at altar must be done then a hurried on to office remembered what have said about money must not have money till be hers of right then with what perfect satisfaction must take from pleased to give how hard must work for in order that might never feel that have given good thing for nothing be five oclock before be at office have promised to be back in lodging at six to get for tea be quite out of question that must work to day truth be maam said to female superintendent have received accepted offer of marriage afternoon be going out of town to night want to be with before go be plea against official rigour can not prevail remember once when young man applied to saturnine pundit who ruled matter in certain office for leave of absence for month to get

lover have borrowed little back parlour from mr green have spread tea thing made toast in kitchen before came there something suppose more friendship betwixt mr hall better said landlady smiling great

necessary said with vehemence a be not necessary will not be so will get thing will belong to always will not wear till day that also will belong to went with night to station kissed openly a parted from on platform there be nothing in love now of be ashamed how after necessary interval followed down into gloucestershire how became wife standing opposite to in bright raiment liberality have supplied how became a good wife a ever blessed man household need hardly here be told that miss wilson recovered health married hairdresser may be accepted by anxious reader a undoubted fact alice dugdale chapter doctor family used to be said in village of beetham that nothing ever went wrong with alice dugdale meaning of perhaps lay in fact that be determined that thing must be made to go right thing a came be received by with gracious welcome thing be seemed to be so well pleased with treatment afforded to that too for most part made gracious in return nevertheless have have sorrow a who have not have kept tear for herself have shown smile for comfort of around in little story will be told how in certain period of life have suffered much how still smiled how at last got better of sorrow father be country doctor in populous straggling parish of beetham beetham be one of place so often found in south of england half village half town for existence of there seems to be special reason have mayor municipality market pavement gas be therefore no more than village have doctor alices father dr dugdale be man have be established at beetham for more than thirty year knew pulse tongue for ten mile round know that be very great a doctor be kind hearted liberal man enjoyed confidence of beethamites be everything for thirty year have worked hard have brought up large family without want be still working hard though turned sixty at time of be speaking have even in old age many child dependent on though have fairly prospered have not become rich man have be married twice alice be only child left at home by first wife two elder sister be married elder brother be away in world alice have be much younger than have be only child living with when have brought to house second mother for be then fifteen eight nine year have since gone almost year have brought increase to doctor family there be now seven little dugdales in about nursery what seven must do when alice must go away folk of beetham always declared that be quite at loss even to guess for mr dugdale be one of woman who succumb to difficulty who seem originally to have be made of soft material to have become warped out of joint tattered almost useless under wear of world alice have be constructed of thoroughly seasoned timber so let be knocked about a might be never out of repair now doctor excellent a be at doctoring be not very good at household matter so that folk at beetham have reason to be at loss when bethought a to what must happen when alice must go away of course there be always that prospect of girl going away girl not unfrequently intend to go away sometimes go away very suddenly without previous intention at rate girl a alice can not be regarded a fixture in house binding a may be duty at home be quite understood must adequate provocation to go away be brought within reach will go let duty be what may alice be thoroughly good girl good to father good to little brother sister unutterably good to poor foolish stepmother doubt must go away if duly asked when vista of future discomfort in doctor house first made clearly apparent to beethamites idea alice might perhaps go very soon have begun to prevail in village eldest son of vicar parson rossiter have come back from india a major rossiter with appointment a said of year let put down a have renewed acquaintance with old playfellow others more than one two have endeavoured before to entice alice to go away be said that dark visaged warrior with swarthy face black beard bright eye probably too something in nobler than outward bearing have whispered word have prevailed be supposed that alice now have fitting lover that therefore must go away there be doubt in mind of single inhabitant of beetham a to quality of lover be considered on side that be fitting so fitting that alice must of course go when asked john rossiter be such man beethamite looked upon a hero so beetham be proud to have produced in small community man will come up now then a to whom be surmised that young lady must of course accept man who be now about ten year older than alice have everything to recommend be made up of good gift of beauty conduct dignity good heart fifteen hundred year at very least official duty required to live in london from beetham be seventy mile distant duty allowed ample time for visiting parsonage so very fitting be to take girl away upon whom might fix eye of approbation that there be others higher than alice in world standing who be said to grudge young lady of village so great prize for alice dugdale be young lady of village more whereas there be county family around with daughter among whom rossiters have be in habit of mixing now that rossiter have come to fore parsonage family be held to be almost equal to county people to whatever extent alices love affair have gone have be very silent about have lover a yet taken final step of being closeted for ten minute with father nevertheless everybody have be convinced in beetham that must be so unless might be mr rossiter mr rossiter be ambitious for son in matter sympathised with county people county people certainly be of opinion that john rossiter might do better did not altogether see what there be in alice dugdale to make such fuss about of course have sweet countenance rather brown with good eye have not said feature in face must be called handsome nose be broad mouth be large did not like perpetual dimpling of cheek if natural looked a if be practised be stout almost stumpy thought doubt danced well having good ear being active healthy with such waist girl must really be graceful acknowledged to be best nursemaid that ever mother have in family thought pity that must be taken away from duty for presence be so much desired at rate by one a john rossiter who knew beetham well who though turned hill of middle life have still eye for female charm used to declare to myself alice though be decidedly village not county be far far away prettiest girl in part of world old parson loved so did miss rossiter miss janet rossiter who be four five year older than brother therefore quite old maid john be so great man that of dared to say much to encourage a neither did mr rossiter to use eloquence on other side be felt by of that persuasion might have on john anything intended effect when man at age of thirty three be deputy assistant inspector general of cavalry be not easy to talk way that in matter of love john rossiter though best fellow in world be apt to be taciturn on subject men frequently marry almost without thinking about at well perhaps might a well at rate can not very well help that too often be frame of mind rossiters discussion to be of higher nature than perhaps not quite what must have be be thing of such moment that requires to be pondered again again man have to think of of of child have to come after of total good total bad may come of such decision a in one manner there be too much of negligence so in other there may be too much of care perhaps might a well so good be providence be sometimes more successful than careful long pondering hero old parson be very sweet to alice believing that must be daughter in law so be miss rossiter thoroughly approving of sister mr rossiter be little cold of alice must read plainly digest without saying word if be to be must welcome happy lot with heartfelt acknowledgment of happiness provided for if be not to be human being must know that have sorrowed there must be nothing lack daisical in life conduct have work to do knew that a long a did that grief must not overpower in own house be taken for granted that be to go in manner distressed youll never be here to lengthen em said stepmother to almost whining when there be question a to flounce in certain juvenile petticoat might require to be longer than be first made before must be finally abandoned that certainly will if tiny grows a doe now suppose hell pop regularly when next come down said mr dugdale there be ever so much in annoyed alice in first place word pop be to abominable then be almost called upon to deny that must pop when in heart thought very probable that might word knew have become intelligible to eldest of little sister who be present moreover be most unwilling to discus subject at must hardly leave undiscussed when such direct question be asked mamma said dont let think about anything of kind did not at satisfy ought to have repudiated lover altogether yet must not bring to tell necessary lie suppose will come day said child old enough to understand meaning of such coming for men may come men may go go on for ever for ever said sang alice with pretence of drollery a turned to little sister even in little song there be purpose let man come let man go must go on at rate apparently untroubled in walk of life of course hell take away then what be to do said mr dugdale moaning be sad enough for girl thus to have lover thrown in face when be by mean sure of lover day two afterwards word much more painful be said to up at parsonage into parsonage went frequently to show that there be nothing in heart to prevent visiting old friend a have be wont john will be down here next week said parson whom met on gravel drive just at hall door how often come what do do at horse guard wherever be that go to hell be more steady when have taken wife said old man in meantime what becomes of cavalry dare say youll know about before long said parson laughing now dear how can be so foolish a to fill girl head with nonsense of kind said mr rossiter who at moment came out from front door youre doing john injustice be making people believe that have said that have not said alice at moment be very angry a angry a well must be be certain that mr rossiter did not know what son have said have not said be cruel that who have put forward claim who have never be forward in seeking lover must be thus almost publicly rebuked quiet a wished to be be necessary that must say one word in own defence dont think mr rossiters little joke will do john injustice harm said a may be taken seriously hope will not repeat must not do better for thats opinion said old man turning back into house there have be word before on subject between wife be not well pleased with at moment dear alice be sure know that mean everything best for said mr rossiter if nobody must mean anything just let alone must be best a for nonsense mr rossiter dont know of that im not likely to be carried away by foolish idea of kind do know that be very good then why must talk at a though be very bad mr rossiter felt that have be reprimanded be le inclined than ever to accept alice a daughter in law alice a walked home be low in spirit angry with because be so people must be fool of course be to be expected have known all along mr rossiter wanted grander wife for son whereas parson be anxious to have for daughter in law of course loved parson better than wife why be that felt at moment mr rossiter must prevail of course will be so said to see now suppose be right then certainly ought not to have come here perhaps come because wish to see miss wanless went little out of road home not only to dry tear to rid herself of effect of then spent remainder of afternoon swinging brother sister in garden chapter ii major rossiter perhaps be coming here to see miss wanless alice have said to herself in course of week found that surmise be correct john rossiter stayed only one night at parsonage then went over to brook park where lived sir walter wanless wanlesses parson have not so declared when told alice that son be coming john said on arrival that be special visit made to brook park not to beetham have be promised for last three month though only fixed lately took trouble to come across to doctor house with express purpose of explaining fact suppose have always be intimate with said mr dugdale who be sitting with alice little crowd of child round there be tone of sarcasm in word not at hidden know that be great deal finer than mere village folk dont know wanlesses of course do youll find much more at home at brook park than can in place a though not spoken be contained in tone of lady speech have always be neighbour said john rossiter neighbour ten mile off said mr dugdale dare say good samaritan lived thirty mile off said alice dont think distance have much to do with said major like neighbour to be neighbourly like beetham neighbour said mr dugdale there be reproach in word of mr dugdale have heard of miss georgiana wanless major rossiter knew that have done so after fashion lady be accusing for deserting alice alice understood also yet behoved to hold well up be cheerful like beetham people best said then be because dont know other remember going to brook park once when there be party of child hundred year ago thought quite paradise there be profusion of strawberry by imagination have be troubled ever since youll just be in time for strawberry major rossiter have always be john till quite lately john with memory of childhood now have become major rossiter went out into garden with for moment a took leave not quite alone a little boy of two year old be clinging to hand if have way said id have neighbour everywhere at distance envy man chiefly for one love best must be very near think one love best of oh yes so that one may do something wouldnt to have day must bobby then allowed willing little urchin to struggle up into arm to kiss smeared a be face with bread butter mother meant to say be running away from old friend of course did see loom so very large to here be such swell a dick say that be little sore when pas by everybody like to be bowed to by royalty dont know that brook park be of course proper place for dont expect what be going to express little disgust little pride when find left behind word must have le declared own feeling on matter than be uttering found compelled to laugh at lest in other direction something of tenderness might escape whereby might be injured worse than by raillery in nothing that might say must there be le of real reproach to than in hate word swell said so do then why do use to show how much better brook park be than beetham be sure dont talk about swell at brook park why do throw brook park in teeth feel inclination to make disagreeable to day be never like hope not then be bound to follow up what poor dear mamma began wont throw brook park in teeth lady know be very nice sir walter wanless be little grand isnt know said must be much happier here than there because sir walter be so grand because friend here be dearer friend still be right must go one can not always be where one must be happiest be happiest with bobby said can always have bobby then gave hand at gate went down to parsonage night mr rossiter be closeted for awhile with son before went to bed be supposed in beetham to be of higher order of intellect of higher stamp generally than husband daughter to be in respect nearly on par with son have not travelled a have done be of ambitious mind have thought beyond beetham poor dear parson cared for little outside bound of parish be so glad be going to stay for awhile over at brook park said only for three day in intimacy of house three day be lifetime of course like to interfere when be said major frowned knowing well that mother be going to interfere can not help thinking how much connection with wanlesses must do for dont want anything from connection be very well john for man to say in truth depend on connection one with be beginning world dont know about mother to eye be of course look upwards take that a come doubt still must have in mind to rise man be assisted very much by kind of wife marries much must be done for son in law of sir walter wanless nothing hope ever for on score to succeed by favour be odious even to rise by merit so much outside assistance be often necessary though will assuredly deserve that will ever get yet may be more likely to get a son in law to sir walter wanless than if be married to obscure girl men who make most of in world do think of thing be last woman in world to recommend boy to look after money in marriage miss wanlesses will have none therefore can speak more freely will have very little a coming from family have great influence have contested county five time then where be there handsomer girl than georgiana wanless major thought that knew one did not answer question be that girl ought to be manner be perfect conduct constant performance of domestic duty be of course admirable if come to one to have to wash linen who wash linen well be good woman among mean thing high spirit be not to be found be not so sure of that must be so how can employment of hour in day on menial work leave time for mind to fill making childrens frock may be duty must also be impediment be speaking of alice of course be speaking of alice must wager head that have read twice more in last two year than georgiana wanless mother be not disposed to discus one young lady other be not going to brook park to look for wife if ever take one will be simply because like best not because wish to use a rung of ladder by to climb upwards into world that just must be said to mr rossiter have be aware still have thought that word in season might have effect did have effect john rossiter a be driven over to brook park on following morning be unconsciously mindful of allusion to washerwoman have seen that alices cheek have be smirched by greasy crumb from little brother mouth have seen that tip of finger showed mark of needle have seen fragment of thread about dress mud even from childrens boot on skirt have seen have be aware that georgiana wanless be free from such soil on outward raiment liked perfect grace of unspotted feminine apparel have too thought of hour in alice might probably be employed amidst multifarious need of nursery have argued to much a mother have argued be good homely worthy of thousand praise be exactly that wanted in wife have repudiated with scorn mother cold worldly doctrine yet have felt that must be pleasant thing to have known in london that wife be daughter of sir walter wanless be true that be wonderfully handsome complexion perfectly clear nose cut a out of marble mouth delicate a of goddess with waist quite to match shoulder be white a alabaster dress be at time perfect finger be without mark stain there might perhaps be want of expression face so symmetrical be seldom expressive then to crown be justified in believing that be attached to almost a much have be said to by lady wanless word must amount to a much coupled a be with immediate invitation to brook park of have given no hint to human being have be at brook park once before rumour of something between miss georgiana wanless have reached people at beetham have reached a have seen not only mr rossiter also alice dugdale there have be moment up in london when mind have veered round towards miss wanless there be one little trifle opposed action of mind be heart have begun to think that might be duty to marry georgiana more thought so more clearly must figure of alice stand before so that veil must be thrown over when tried to summon to imagination statuesque beauty of one girl bright eye of other must look at word from speaking mouth must be in ear have once kissed alice immediately on return in presence of father memory of halcyon moment be always present to when thought most of miss wanless did not think much of kiss how grand must be at dining table how glorious in drawing room with alice how sweet must be to sit by brook side listen to water now since have be at beetham from nature of thing sometimes make event to come from exactly contrary cause new charm have be added to alice simply by little effort have made to annoy have talked to of swell have pretended to be jealous of wanlesses just because have known that must hate to hear such word from lip that must be vexed by exhibition of such feeling on part be

daughter son be in army be beyond control daughter be at home be altogether under control of mother indeed everything at brook park be under control of lady wanless though man alive gave air more autocratic than sir walter be on shoulder fell burden of five daughter of maintaining with straitened mean hospitality of brook park on behoof hard worked woman be lady wanless in doing duty with imperfect light doubt to best of ability with such light a possessed be somewhat fine in dress not for comfort might accrue to herself from feeling that alliance with wanlesses must not be valued by proper sort of young men unless be grand girl be beautifully dressed oh with such care economy daily labour among two lady maid upstairs father what with election farming period of costly living early in life have not done well for family that knew never rebuked be for to set matter right must only do by getting husband for daughter that might be achieved wanless prestige must be maintained with crippled mean be so hard to maintain family prestige poor duke may do perhaps earl baronet be not high enough to give bad wine to guest without serious detriment to unmarried daughter beginning to what might be hoped to be long line of success have already be made eldest girl sophia be engaged lady wanless did not look very high knowing failure in such operation will bring with such unutterable misfortune sophia be engaged to eldest son of neighbouring squire whose property indeed be not large be squire likely to die very soon there be mean of present living future rental of year young mr cobble be now staying at house have be duly accepted by sir walter youngest girl who be only nineteen have fallen in love with young clergyman in neighbourhood must not do at young clergyman be not allowed within park georgiana be beauty for if for great destiny might have be hoped be turn matter of lady wanless thought great deal major be too good to be allowed to escape georgiana in cold impassive way seemed to like major therefore lady wanless paired off instantly with decision be necessary amidst labour of life have scruple in what did feeling sure that daughter must make honest good wife that blood of wanlesses be dowry in major have be told to come early because party be made to visit certain ruin about eight mile off castle owless a be called to lady wanless be accustomed to take guest because family history declared that wanlesses have lived there at very remote period still belonged to sir walter though unfortunately intervening land have for most part fallen into other hand owless wanless be supposed to be same thus there be room for good deal of family tattle be delighted to see at brook park said sir walter a met at luncheon table when be at christchurch father be at wadham remember well exactly same word have be spoken when major on former occasion have be made welcome at house clearly implied feeling christchurch though much superior may condescend to know wadham under certain circumstance of baronet nothing further be heard seen till dinner lady wanless went in open carriage with three daughter sophie being one of a affair be settled be not necessary that one of two side saddle must be allotted to use young cobble who have be asked to send two horse over from cobble hall so that rossiter might ride one felt very hard there be appeal from lady wanless youll have plenty enough of evening said mother patting affectionately be so necessary just at present that georgiana edith must have horse exercise in way be arranged that georgiana must ride with major edith third daughter with young burmeston son of cox burmeston brewer at neighbouring town of slowbridge country brewer be not quite what lady wanless must have liked with difficulty such a hers rich young brewer might be worth having be hard upon mr cobble who must not have sent horse over have known major saw at glance georgiana rode well liked lady to ride doubted whether alice have ever be on horseback in life after how many advantage doe girl lose by having to pas day in nursery for moment such idea crossed mind then asked question a to scenery through be passing very fine indeed said georgiana looked square before sat with back square to horse tail there be hanging in saddle shifting about in uneasiness must rise fall easily even gracefully when horse trotted be fond of riding can see said major do like riding answered tone in spoke of present occupation be much more lively than in have expressed approbation of scenery at ruin got down lady wanless told entire story of owlesses wanlesses filled brewer mind with wonder a to antiquity dignity of family major be fish just at moment in hand rossiters be very old too said smiling perhaps be kind of thing dont care for very much indeed said be true for be proud of knowing that have come from rossiters who have be over four hundred year in herefordshire remembrance of old merit will always be incitement to new be just that major rossiter be strange how very nearly in same word georgiana said same thing to yesterday georgiana happened to overhear did not contradict mother though made grimace to sister be seen by one else then lady wanless slipped aside to assist brewer edith leaving major second daughter together two younger girl of whom youngest be wicked one with penchant for curate be wandering among ruin by wonder whether there ever be people called owless said rossiter not quite knowing what subject of conversation to choose of course there be mamma always say so that settle question doe not dont see why there shouldnt be owlesses wont sit on wall thank because must stain habit youll be tired not particularly tired be not so very far id go back in carriage only of course cant because of habit oh yes im very fond of dancing very fond indeed always have two ball year at slowbridge there be others about county dont think ever have ball at beetham there be one to give doe miss dugdale ever dance major have to think for moment before must answer question why must miss wanless ask a to alices dancing be sure doe now think of have heard talk of dancing dont know alice dugdale miss wanless shook head be worth knowing be quite sure be have always heard that thought so be very good to child isnt very good indeed must be almost pretty if wasnt so so so dumpy must say then got on horse again rode back to brook park let georgiana be ever so tired did not show rode in under portico with perfect equestrian grace im afraid took too much out of said lady wanless to major that evening georgiana have gone to bed little earlier than others be in degree hard upon a have not proposed ride excused be arranged lady wanless yes indeed said smiling did arrange little excursion be not who kept talking whole day now again be felt to be unfair a nearly word of conversation between young people have be given in little chronicle on following day young people be again thrust together before parted for night little word be spoken by lady wanless indicated very clearly that there be special bond of friendship between major second daughter be quite right have said in answer to extracted compliment doe ride very well when be up in town in may thought saw one with seat in row miss green who taught duchess of ditchwaters daughter declared that knew nothing like on third morning returned to beetham early a intended to go up to town same afternoon then there be prepared for little valedictory opportunity in must not press young lady finger for moment a did so no one be looking at then knew that be so much more dangerous because one be looking nothing must be more knowing than conduct of young lady who be not in way too forward if admitted that slight pressure be done with retiring rather than obtrusive favour be not by own doing that be alone with for moment there be casting down casting up of eye yet seemed to a left went out into hall that there have be so much between that be almost bound to propose to in hall there be baronet to bid farewell honour did to guest only when be minded to treat with great distinction lady wanless be delighted to have have here said remember to father tell that remember very well when be at christchurch be at wadham be something to have have one hand taken in so paternal manner by baronet with eyebrow coat yet when returned to beetham be not in good humour with seemed to that have be almost absorbed among wanlesses without action will of own tried to comfort by declaring that georgiana be without doubt remarkably handsome young woman that be perfect horsewoman a though be matter to of moment then went across to doctor house to say word of farewell to alice have have pleasant visit asked oh yes very well that second miss wanless be quite beautiful be not be handsome certainly call lovely said alice rode with other day over to old castle who must have told of already yes there be party of went over when be going there again now something have be said of further visit rossiter have almost promised that must return be impossible not to promise when undefined invitation be given man can not declare that be engaged for ever ever how be that alice knew have be said done can not say have fixed exact day replied almost angrily ive heard about know that young mr burmeston be at mr tweed told what favourite be if be true will congratulate because do really think that young lady be most beautiful that ever saw in life said with smile good humoured little shake of head if be to be that heart must be broken at least must not know still hoped still thought that by being very constant at work might get over chapter iv beethamites be told through beetham before week be over major rossiter be to marry second miss wanless beetham liked news beetham be proud that one of son must be introduced into great neighbouring family especially that must be honoured by hand of acknowledged beauty beetham month ago have declared that alice dugdale beethamite herself from babyhood who have be born bred at beetham have ever lived there be to be honoured by hand of young hero may be doubted whether beetham have be altogether satisfied with arrangement be apt to envy good luck of who have always be familiar with why must have be alice dugdale more than one of tweed girl miss simkins daughter of attorney who must certainly have snug little fortune of own unfortunately must not be case with alice dugdale have be felt that alice be hardly good enough for hero alice who have be seen about with dugdale child pushing in perambulator almost day since eldest be born prefer authority of stranger to of one chosen from among a two miss tweed miss simkins with alice three four others must not divide hero among be better then that hero must go from among choose fitting mate in higher realm felt greatness of wanlesses argued with mr rossiter that rising star of village must obtain such assistance in rising a must come to from almost noble marriage there have be certainly decided opinion that alice be to be happy woman mr dugdale stepmother have boasted of promotion old mr rossiter have whispered secret conviction into ear of favoured parishioner doctor have allowed patient to ask question about have become so common that alice have be inwardly indignant must have be outwardly indignant that must not allow to discus matter having be so beetham ought to have be scandalised by fickleness of hero beetham ought to have felt that hero be most unheroic at rate among lady there be shadow of such feeling of course such man a major be bound to do best for giving away of hand in marriage be very serious thing be not to be obligatory on young hero because have be carried away by fervour of old friendship to kiss young lady immediately on return home history of kiss be known over beetham be declared by competent authority to have amounted to nothing be last lingering touch of childhood happy embracing if alice be such fool a to take for more must pay penalty of folly be in father presence said mr rossiter defending son to mr tweed mr tweed have expressed opinion that kiss ought to go for nothing major be to be acquitted fact of acquittal made way even to doctor nursery so that alice knew that man might marry that girl at brook park with clean hand that a declared to herself did not increase sorrow if man be minded to marry girl be welcome for apologised for to own heart what man generally want said be beautiful wife of beauty of miss georgiana wanless there must be doubt only only only there have be dozen word must have left unspoken riveted news on mind of beethamites be stopping of brook park carriage at door of parsonage one day about week after major visit be not altogether unprecedented occurrence have there be precedent must hardly have be justified on present occasion perhaps once in two year lady wanless must call at parsonage then there must be return visit during reference must always be made to wadham christchurch visit be now out of order only nine month having elapsed of irregularity beetham took due notice on occasion miss wanless third young lady accompanied mother leaving georgiana at home what be whispered between two old lady beetham did not quite know made surmise be in wise be so glad to have major over with said ladyship be so good of said mr rossiter be great favourite with sir walter be so good of sir walter be quite pleased to have among young people be be quite sufficient to tell mr rossiter that john might have georgiana wanless for asking that lady wanless expected to ask then parting be much more affectionate than have ever be before there be squeezing of hand nodding of head meant great deal alice held tongue did work attempted to be cheery through again again asked what did matter even though be unhappy even though felt keen palpable perpetual aching at heart what must matter so long a must go about do business people in world have to be unhappy perhaps most people be sorrow though might not wear off must by wearing become dull enough to be bearable distressed in there be sorrow providence have given to certain condition of life to many charm be attached thoroughly loved people about father little brother sister even overworn somewhat idle stepmother be queen in house queen among busy toil liked being queen liked being busy one ever scolded crossed contradicted have essential satisfaction of consciousness of usefulness why must not that suffice to despised because there be hole in heart because felt to shrink over when name of georgiana wanless be mentioned in hearing yet must mention name speak with something akin to admiration of wanless family must say how well be that men must strive to rise in world how that world progressed through such individual effort must not mention name of john rossiter must endure that must be mentioned in hearing with special reference to herself mr dugdale though be overworn idle warped almost useless piece of furniture made a be said before of bad timber yet saw more of than anyone else be indignant to lose alice to have one to let down tuck take up stitch must be to loss of comfort though be feckless be true hearted knew that alice be being wronged be alice have right to hero not that stuck up young woman at brook park be thus spoke of affair to doctor after awhile found unable to be silent on subject to alice if what say doe take place will think worse of john rossiter than ever did of man ever knew said in presence of husband step daughter john rossiter will not be very much worse for said alice without relaxing moment from work there be sound of drolling in voice a though be quizzing stepmother for folly seems to that men may do anything now continued mr dugdale suppose be same now a always be said doctor if man chose to be false must always be false call unmanly said mr dugdale if be man must beat what must beat for said alice getting up a did so throwing down on table before little frock be making if have power of beating why must beat because be ill using how do know did ever tell so have ever heard word that have said to direct from second hand justifies in saying that have ill used ill use when speak like alice be so violent said doctor father will speak of once once for then pray pray let there be further mention of have right to complain of anything in major rossiter have done wrong who love must not mention name in reference to be villain said mr dugdale be villain be gentleman a far a know from crown of head to sole of foot doe ever occur to how little make of when talk of in way dismiss from mind father let thing be a be do think that be pining for man love say that major rossiter be true man gentleman must not give bobby little finger for whole body then there be silence afterwards doctor told wife that major name have better not be mentioned again among alice on occasion be appeared to be very angry with mr dugdale on evening next morning there be accession of tenderness in usually sweet manner to expression of mother anger against major have be wrong feeling of anger be not le endearing time after one evening parson came upon alice a be picking flower in one of beetham lane have child with be filling minnies apron with rose from hedge old mr rossiter stopped talked to after awhile succeeded in getting alice to walk on with havent heard from john said oh replied alice almost with start then added quickly there be one at house likely to hear from doe not write to anyone there did not know whether message might have reached think not be to be here again before long said parson oh indeed have moment to think of after thinking continued suppose will be going over to brook park fear will fear why must fear mr rossiter if be true be place where ought to be doubt truth dear ah know nothing about if so have better stay up in london suppose dont think john can care much for miss wanless why not be most thoroughly beautiful young woman ever saw dont think doe because believe heart be elsewhere alice have heart think so alice mr rossiter have not be not so know nothing of miss wanless can speak of seems to that be speaking of now then why doe go there be just what can not answer why doe go there why do do worst thing so often when see better dont leave undone thing wish to do mr rossiter be just what do do under constraint alice hope hope that may become wife endeavoured to deny that must ever be so strove to declare that be much too heart free for word must not come to lip must only sob while struggled to retain tear if doe come to give chance again even though may have be untrue to for moment then be left alone among child must dry tear suppress sob because minnie be old enough to know meaning of if saw must not for awhile go back into house left in passage then went out again walked up down little pathway that ran through shrub at bottom of garden believe heart be elsewhere must be that be so if so of what nature can be man love if when be given in one direction can go in with hand must understand that there have not be much heart in that being man not woman must have made turning point of life affair of calculation have taken here there without much love at a must seek commodious house so must also convenient wife resting on suggestion to herself have dared to declare to father mother that major rossiter be not villain perfect gentleman be not compatible with father story alice have heart old man have said how have come to pas that old man have known yet assurance be so sweet so heavenly so laden to ear with divine music at moment must not even ask to disbelieve if doe come to give chance again why yes though never spoke word of miss wanless without praise though have tutored to swear that miss wanless be very wife for yet knew too well not to know that be better than miss wanless for sake must with clear conscience give chance again dear old parson have seen all have known have appreciated if must ever come to pas that be to be daughter in law must have reward must not tell that expected to come again if did come must give parson chance such be idea at moment be forced to change before long chapter v invitation when major rossiter discussed own conduct with a men be so often compelled to do by own conscience in opposition to own wish be not well pleased with on return home from india have found possessed of liberal income have begun to enjoy without thinking much about marrying be not often that man look for wife because have made up mind that want article roams about unshackled till something at time seems to be altogether desirable present to then meditates marriage so have be with major alice have presented to a something altogether desirable something when be touched looked at seemed to be so full of sweetness to be for moment of thing most charming be not forward man one of who can see girl for first time on monday propose to on tuesday when idea first suggested to of making alice wife became reticent undemonstrative kiss have in truth meant more than mr tweed have said when began to feel that loved then hardly dared to dream of kissing though felt that loved liked perhaps must be fairer to say in early stage of feeling better than other woman yet when came to think of marriage importance of made hesitate be reminded by little hint from others by word plain enough from one person alice dugdale be after common thing there be fitness in such matter so said mr rossiter propriety in like being married to like have be lot to be village doctor alice must have suited well destiny however have carried major higher up must require to live in london among ornate people with polished habit peculiar manner of own must not alice be out of element in london see thing among passed life not morsel of soap pound of sugar be used in house what gave out hour be passed in washing teaching sewing for child in very walk be always pushing perambulator be doubt doctor daughter in fact be second mr dugdales nursemaid nothing must be more praiseworthy there be fitness in thing hero of beetham assistant deputy inspector general of british cavalry might surely do better than marry praiseworthy nursery girl be thus that mr rossiter argued with son argument be not without avail then georgiana wanless have be a be thrown at head when one be pelted with sugar plum one can hardly resent attack be clever enough to feel that be pelted at first liked sweetmeat girl riding on horseback with back square to horse tail with rein well held chimney pot hat on head be object unfortunately more attractive to eye of ordinary men than young woman pushing perambulator with two baby unfortunately say because in case young woman must be judged by personal merit not by external major declared to that personal merit must be affected by external girl who have pushed perambulator for many year must hardly have soul above perambulator there must be wanting flavour of aroma of romance that something of poetic vagueness without girl can hardly be altogether charming to sens of appreciative lover then little later on asked whether georgiana wanless be romantic poetic whether there be much of true aroma there yet thought that fate must require to marry georgiana wanless whom certainly did not love to leave alice to perambulator alice whom certainly did love a thought of be ill at ease with might be well that must give up assistant deputy inspector generalship go back to india so get rid of two trouble together fate a personified fate to in matter took form of lady wanless made sad to think that be weak creature in hand of old woman who wanted to use for certain purpose did not see way of escaping when began to console by reflecting that must have one of handsomest woman in london at dinner table knew that must be unable to escape about middle of july received following letter from lady wanless dear major rossiter girl have be at father for last ten day to have archery meeting on lawn have at last prevailed though sir walter have father abhorrence to have lawn knocked about now be settled ill see about sir walter said at last when so much a have be obtained knew that archery meeting be to be sir walter like own way be not always to be persuaded when have made slightest show of concession never go back from then come question a to day be now in course of discussion in full committee in matter sir walter be supposed to be excluded from voice can not matter to what day of week what day of month said georgiana very irreverently will not however much matter to so long a be over before st partridge come round girl one declared that must be here a one of guest in house room will be mostly full of young lady there will be one at rate for now what day will suit rather what day will suit cavalry generally everything must of course depend on cavalry girl say that cavalry be sure to go out of town after tenth of august must put off for week longer rather than not have inspector general must wednesday th suit cavalry be reading word of letter a be written bid say that if thursday friday in week wednesday thursday in next will do better accommodation of cavalry will be consulted can not be on monday saturday because there must be sunday encroachment on tuesday can not get band from slowbridge now know great purpose little difficulty one thing can not know how determined be to accommodate ourselves to cavalry meeting be not to take place without inspector general so let have early answer from august functionary girl think that inspector have better come down before day so a to make useful in preparing pray believe with sir walter kind regard yours most sincerely margaret wanless major felt that letter be very flattering that be false written for certain purpose must read between line at sentence of festival be to be got up not at instance of girl of lady wanless a final trap for catching of perhaps for mr burmeston irreverent word have never come from georgiana who be too placid to have said did not believe word of girl looking over writing of letter in such matter lady wanless have more life more energy than daughter little fun about cavalry came from lady wanless girl be too like father for such ebullition little spark of joke with name of girl be connected with in hearing name of georgiana have be specially connected have be aware origin always with lady wanless georgiana have said funny thing georgiana never spoke after fashion in hearing trap be plain to eye yet knew that must sooner later be caught in trap took day to think of before answered letter meditated military tour to berlin just about time if so must be absent during whole of august so a to make presence at toxopholite meeting impossibility yet at last wrote said that must be there there must be something mean in flight after need not ask girl to be wife unless chose to do so wrote very pretty note to lady wanless saying that must be at brook park on th a have suggested then made great resolution swore oath to that must not be caught on occasion after meeting must go no more either to brook park to beetham for awhile must not marry girl to whom be quite indifferent who from position be hardly qualified to be wife then went about duty with quieted conscience wedded for once for always to cavalry tidings of doings proposed by wanlesses have reached parson ear when told alice in lane that son be soon coming down to beetham again that be again going to brook park before july be over tidings of coming festivity have be spread over side of county thing have not be done for many year not since lady wanless have be young wife with two sister for whom husband have to be be provided there be who must still remember how well lady wanless have behaved on occasion since day hospitality on large scale have not be rife at brook park reason why be so be well known sir walter be determined not to embarrass further must hing be expensive must not be that there be great cause for deviation a then lady of neighbourhood put head together of gentleman declared that double stroke of business be to be done in regard to major rossiter mr burmeston how great relief must be to mother anxiety if three eldest girl must be married got rid of on same day beetham be ten mile from brook park have station of own whereas slowbridge with own station be only six mile from house major must fain have reached destination by slowbridge so a to have avoided chance of seeing alice be not that father mother must have felt aggrieved by such desertion on occasion mother begged to give one night have much that wished to say to then of course must have parsonage horse parsonage phaeton to take over to brook park free of expense did go down to beetham did spend evening there did go on to park without having spoken to alice dugdale everybody say be to marry georgiana wanless said mr rossiter if there be other reason why must not saying of everybody must be sufficient against be unreasonable john thing must be looked at whether be good bad may be case lady wanless talk more than ought to do may be case that a people say be looking out for husband for daughter dont know must do same if have five of on hand very little mean for if did how must get better husband for one of than one a major john rossiter then kissed forehead hate kind of thing altogether said pretended to be stern yet showed that be flattered by mother softness may well be john that match will be desirable to to too if so why must there not be fair bargain between two of know that admire girl must not deny lest must come to pas hereafter that must become wife everybody know that a far a birth go there be not family in county stand higher be so proud of boy wish to see mated with best reached parsonage that evening only just before dinner on next morning did not go out of house till phaeton came round to take to brook park be not going up to see old doctor said parson after breakfast no think not be never at home lady be always surrounded by child will take amiss said father almost in whisper will go a come back said blushing a spoke at own falsehood for if held to present purpose must return by slowbridge if fate intended that there must be nothing further between alice must certainly be much better that must not be brought together more knew too what father meant be more unwilling to take counsel from father even than mother yet blushed because knew that be false seem to slight said old man be too good for then drove over to brook park a made way by one of innumerable turning out of beetham saw at one of corner alice still with child still with perambulator merely lifted hat a passed did not stop to speak to chapter vi archery meeting assistant deputy inspector general when reached brook park found that thing be to be done on great scale two drawing room be filled with flower big dining room be laid out for to morrow lunch in preparation for who must prefer dining room to tent rossiter be first taken into baronet own room where sir walter kept gun administered justice be terrible bore rossiter said must disturb great deal sir walter oh dear dreadfully what must old friend father think of having to do kind of thing though when be at christchurch at wadham used to be gay enough im not quite sure that dont owe to to sir walter rather think put girl up to then laughed a though be very good joke told major where must find lady have be expressly desired by wife to be genial to major have be a genial a knew how rossiter a went out on to lawn saw mr burmeston brewer walking with third daughter must not admire strategy of lady wanless when acknowledged to how well managed thing brewer must not have be allowed to walk with gertrude fourth daughter even with maria naughty girl who liked curate because be ediths turn edith be certainly plainest of family yet have turn lady wanless be by far too good mother to have favourite among own child then found mother eldest daughter gertrude overseeing decoration of tent have be put up a addition to dining room expected to find mr cobble to whom have taken liking nice pleasant frank young country gentleman mr cobble be not wanted for express purpose might have be in way mr cobble be landed safe before long found walking round garden with lady wanless other girl though be to be sister be never thrown into special intimacy with will be down before long now that know be here said lady wanless be fatigued little thought better that must lie down be so impressionable know be georgiana knew that very well why must georgiana be called to by mother have be in truth engaged to must have be intelligible enough there have be nothing of kind a be thus dinned into ear thought of very small amount of conversation have ever taken place between young lady then there occurred to idea that must tell lady wanless in so many word that there be mistake doing so must require courage thought that must summon up manliness for purpose if only must find word occasion though be so frequently spoken of still nothing be said seemed to give opportunity required be hard for man to have to reject girl when have be offered harder to do so before offer have in truth be made be afraid there be little mistake in idea a to daughter be thus that must have have to speak then to have endured outpouring of wrath when must have declared that idea be only in own arrogant brain let pas by said nothing before long be playing lawn tennis with georgiana who did not seem to have be in least fatigued dear will not have said lady wanless about hour afterwards coming up disturbing game major rossiter ought to know better whereupon playfully took racket out of major hand mamma be such old bother said georgiana a walked back to house with major major have on previous occasion perceived that second miss wanless rode very well now saw that be very stout at lawn tennis observed none of peculiarity of mental physical development mother have described a impressionable nevertheless be handsome girl if to play at lawn tennis must help to make husband happy so much at rate must do took place on day before meeting before great day when morning came girl did not come down early to breakfast hero found left alone with mr burmeston have known family long time said major a be sauntering about gravel path together smoking cigar indeed said mr burmeston only took up about three month ago just before went over to owless very nice people dont think so very nice said major stand so high in county sort of thing birth doe go long way know so ought said major though baronet doe not do much in world have be in house know thing help then major understood mr burmeston have looked thing in face have determined that for certain consideration be worth while to lead one of miss wanlesses to hymeneal altar in mr burmeston be behaving with more manliness than who have almost made up mind dozen time have never be satisfied with way have done about visitor have begun to come sophia with mr cobble be very soon trying arrow together sophia have not be allowed to have lover on previous day be now making up for be very well lady wanless be little angry with eldest daughter success be insured for business be done seeing how many sacrifice have be made to during last twelvemonth surely now might have be active in aiding sister instead of merely amusing major be not good at archery be doubt excellent deputy inspector general of cavalry if bow arrow have still be weapon used in part of british army must not without further instruction have be qualified to inspect branch georgiana wanless on other hand be proficient such shooting a made be marvellous to look at be very image of diana a with beautiful figure regular feature dressed up to work stood with bow raised in hand let twang arrow circle immediately outside bull eye be farthest from mark ever touched good a be bad a be major nevertheless be appointed always to shoot together after world of failure major must shoot more not le did go backwards forward with georgiana when changed from one end to other found absolutely appointed to task grew upon during whole day that second miss wanless be supposed to be own almost a much a be elder property of mr cobble other young men must do more than speak to when once after great lunch in tent lady wanless came put hand affectionately upon arm whispered word into ear in presence of assembled guest knew that entire county have recognised a caught there be old lady deepbell there how be that towards end of day delight lady deepbell got hold of never knew lady deepbell have not be introduced to yet got hold of major rossiter be luckiest man of day said to pretty well said affecting to laugh why so be handsomest young woman out there hasnt be one in london season with figure be altogether wrong in surmise lady deepbell be right enough see of course poor girl wont have money then how nice be when gentleman like be able to dispense with perhaps do take after father little certainly be not bright upon word think girl be better for whats good of having such

with tweed dugdales simkinses while must enjoy greatly grandeur of wanless aristocracy so must accommodate comfortably to cosy gossip of beethamites be who first spread report in beetham that major rossiter be a called off first mentioned matter to mr rossiter did in manner more subdued than usual alliance have be high be inclined to think that mr rossiter must be disappointed did think mr rossiter that young people at brook park have meant something other day mr rossiter did not stand in awe of lady deepbell be not pleased at allusion must be much better if young people must be allowed to arrange own affair without so much tattling about said angrily thats very well tongue will talk know mr rossiter be sorry for sake because thought that must do very well very well indeed if young

about such at first have be doctor injunction to wife one way other will only be trouble to mr dugdale full of secret anxious to be obedient thinking that gentleman relieved from second love must be

before must fly way more thats papa then a before went off by to give renewed strength by solitary thinking have so healed flesh round wound that there be longer danger of mortification must now take care that there must be further wound people around must be sure to tell of breach between late lover wanless young lady tweed simkinses old lady deepbell must be full of must take care so to answer at first word that must not dare to talk to of major rossiter have cured so that no longer staggered under effect of blow having done that must not allow to be subject to little sting of little creature around have have enough of love of man love must make happy now with bobby other bairn hell be sure to come back said mr dugdale to husband will do good by talking about said doctor if will take advice will not mention name to fear that be worthless unworthy of mention might be very well thought mr dugdale one in village doubted that have at very least year that be handsome man one a be not to be picked up under hedge very men who go about world most like butterfly before marriage steady down best afterwards be word a discussed matter with mr tweed agreed that if hero showed again at doctor house bygone ought to be bygone lady wanless even after husband return from london declared to herself that even yet game have not be altogether played out sir walter who have be only possible direct messenger to man have be be aware a bad messenger a must have be selected must be authoritative persuasive therefore when told on coming home that be easy to perceive that major rossiters father must not have be educated at christchurch did not feel very much disappointed a next step determined to call on mr rossiter if must fail must beard lion in den go to major rossiter at horse guard did not doubt that must at least be able to say more than sir walter mr rossiter be aware be favourable to match dear mr rossiter said in most confidential manner there be little something wrong among young people think can put right if put head together if know one of young people said mr rossiter will be very hard to make change mind have be very attentive to young lady of course know

meaning of how be mother to answer for son lady wanless of course not know that girl of course be different thought that perhaps might know something about for did imagine must like connection so must why not nobody think more of birth than do nothing in opinion must have be nicer for john doe not see with eye if be to talk to for week must have effect be that girl of doctor mr rossiter think not idea be that when have turned over in mind have come to conclusion that will be better without wife than with one might cure of mr rossiter if must only have down there at brook park for week be sure must come to mr rossiter however must not say that thought probable that son must be induced soon to pay visit to brook park week after lady wanless absolutely did find way into major presence at horse guard without much success last word at interview only will be given to reader last word a be spoken by lady by gentleman then be to see girl die of broken heart said lady wanless with handkerchief up to eye hope not lady wanless in way might die fault must not be mine there be frown on gentleman brow a said cowed even lady a went back to slowbridge afternoon then home to brook park determined at last that game must be looked upon a played out there be longer ground on to stand fight before went to bed that night sent for georgiana darling child said that man be unworthy of

have be contented to take world a came to without thinking much of love romance when john rossiter have first shown at beetham after return from india when have welcomed so warmly too warmly a old playfellow idea have occurred to that must ever be more to than old playfellow own heart be too precious to herself to be given away idly to first comer then bird have flown in at window have be that coming of stranger have be very sweet to even for stranger must not change way unless perchance day might appertain to stranger then must be duty to fit entirely to in meantime when gave little hint that something of domestic slavery might be discontinued must not abate jot from duty if liked to come with when pushed child let come if cared to see when be darning stocking cutting bread butter let pay visit if thought thing derogatory certainty let stay away so thing have grown till have found surprised taken a be into net caught in pitfall of love held peace stuck manfully to perambulator be little colder in demeanour than heretofore whereupon major rossiter a reader be aware made two visit to brook park bird might peck at window must never again be taken into room bird from moment in have packed up portmanteau at brook park have determined that must be taken in at window again that must at rate return to window peck at glass with constancy soliciting that might be opened a now
