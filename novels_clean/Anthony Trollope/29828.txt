whether in very fact that be doing for poor that be distasteful to herself did not recognise performance of duty mary considered while then said that thought petticoat be petticoat that perhaps one made by regular petticoat maker must be best did not allude to grand doctrine of division of labour did hint that might be doing more harm than good by interfering with regular trade because have not studied matter be line of argument lady sarah told that heart in matter be a hard a nether millstone young wife not liking withdrew again appealed to husband mind be divided on subject be clearly of opinion that petticoat must be obtained in cheapest market doubted much about three halfpenny in two hour might be that wife must not do better at present experience must come in case must be obtaining experience a well a earning three halfpenny moreover petticoat made at manor cross must thought undoubtedly be better than must be bought came however to final decision mary finding morning sitting in great petticoat conclave hardly have alternative to join be not in spirit of complaint that spoke on subject to father a winter came on certain old miss tallowax have come to deanery have be thought proper lady george must spend day two there miss tallowax also have money of own even still owned share in business dean have pointed out to lord george wife that must be well that must be civil to lord george be to come on last day dine sleep at deanery on occasion when dean daughter be alone together said something in playful way about great petticoat contest let old lady sit upon said dean smiled a spoke daughter well knew from tone that meant advice to be taken seriously of course papa must like to accommodate to a much a can ca dear manner of life ca be manner theirs yours must have thought george must see that did take part know of course did a married woman be entitled to have own way unless must wish otherwise want to make matter serious if be pressed tell that care to spend time in way cling to old fashion be natural enough be absurd to suppose that must make a old fashioned a have taken matter up quite seriously have given daughter advice evidently with intention that must profit by have said a to being married woman struck forcibly doubt lady at manor cross be superior in birth be brother wife a married woman have right of own little spirit of rebellion already began to kindle within bosom in there be nothing of mutiny against husband if be to desire to make petticoat day of course must make in contest have be a be neutral have certainly given order thought good deal about while at deanery made up mind that must sit in petticoat conclave no longer must not be duty to pas time in employment in poor woman might with difficulty earn sixpence day surely might do better with time than even though must spend in reading gibbon chapter iv at deanery there be dinner party at deanery during miss tallowax sojourn at brotherton mr canon holdenough lady alice be there bishop wife have be asked ceremony be gone through once year have be debarred from accepting invitation by presence of clerical guest at palace lordship chaplain mr groschut be present mr groschut also held honorary prebendal stall be one of chapter thorn sometimes in dean side appearance be well kept up at brotherton one be more anxious that thing must be done in seemly way than dean therefore mr groschut who be very low churchman have once be jew who bore very high character for theological erudition be asked to deanery there be also one two other clergyman there with wife mr mr houghton mr houghton will be remembered be beautiful woman who have refused to become wife of lord george germain before taking step dean have be careful to learn whether son in law must object to meet houghton such objection must have be foolish a family have known other mr de baron mr houghton father mr houghton have be intimate with late marquis have be friend of present lord before have quitted country lady when refuse gentleman give cause of quarrel dean understood a have known mr houghton mr de baron ever since came to brotherton thought better that there must be such meeting lord george blushed up to root of hair then said that must be very glad to meet gentleman wife two young bride have known other a girl now met with at rate appearance of friendship dear said mr houghton who be about four year elder of course know about so do be heiress must afford to please have nothing of own must have have to pas time at manor cross be surprised why must be surprised said lady george who be however very much surprised at address well know be handsomest man in england everybody allows that then family such possibility be very much flattered of course have not seen then only seen a child must have have chance be great deal better a be be think so certainly be so glad to hear that have house in town go up about first of april when hunting be over mr houghton doe not ride much hunt great deal live in berkeley square know do so hope will see ever so much of be sure hope so too said lady george who have never hitherto be very fond of miss de baron have entertained vague idea that ought to be little afraid of mr houghton when father guest be so civil to did not know how to be other than civil in return there be reason why what have passed must make awkwardness be there said lady george feeling that almost blushed at allusion to so delicate subject of course not why must there lord george will soon get used to just a if nothing have happened will always be ever so fond of in way know there will be nothing to make jealous be not bit afraid of said lady george almost too earnestly need not be be sure not what do think be at one time very very much attached to must be what be good of thinking of thing when ca be pretend to be very virtuous like money now mr houghton at rate have got large income if have have fortune at own command say might not have done lady george almost felt that ought to be offended by almost felt that be disgusted at same time did not quite understand father have made point of asking houghton have told that of course must know houghton up in town have idea that be very ignorant of way of life that now must behove a married woman to learn way perhaps free easy mode of talking be right thing did not like being told by lady that other lady must have married own husband only that be pauper offence of seemed to be greater because be so recent did like being told that be not to be jealous especially when remembered that husband have be desperately in love with lady who told so not many month ago be not jealous be quite sure never must be jealous perhaps did not matter have occurred in drawing room before dinner then mr houghton came up to telling that have be commissioned by dean to have honour of taking down to dinner having made little speech mr houghton retired a gentleman generally do retire when in position be a nice a can to said mr houghton have much to say for be bad fellow pretty woman like can do what like with lady george a went down to dinner assured that have slightest wish to take unfair advantage of mr houghton lord george have taken down miss tallowax dean having be very wise in matter miss tallowax be in seventh heaven of happiness miss tallowax though have made promise be quite prepared to do great thing for noble connexion if noble connexion must treat properly have already made dozen will be quite ready to make if lord george must be civil to dean be in heart little ashamed of aunt be man enough to be able to bear eccentricity without showing vexation sufficiently wise to know that more be to be won than lost by relationship best woman in world have said to lord george beforehand speaking of aunt of course will remember that be not brought up a lady lord george with stately urbanity have signified intention of treating miss tallowax with consideration have thirty thousand pound at own disposal continued dean have never said word to about money upon honour think like mary better than one else be worth bearing in mind know lord george smiled again in stately manner perhaps showing something of displeasure in smile nevertheless be well aware that be worth while to bear miss tallowax money in mind lord said miss tallowax hope will allow to say how much honoured feel by mary proud position lord george bowed smiled led lady into deanery dining room word did not come easily to hardly knew how to answer lady of course be great thing for people such a continued miss tallowax to be connected with family of marquis again lord george bowed be very bad indeed great deal worse than have anticipated from aunt of so courtly man a father in law dean lady looked to be about sixty very small very healthy with streaky red cheek small grey eye brown front then came upon idea that must be very long time before thirty thousand pound part of must come to then there came to idea that a have married dean daughter be duty to behave well to dean aunt even though money must never come to therefore told miss tallowax that mother hoped to have pleasure of seeing at manor cross before left brotherton miss tallowax almost got out of seat a curtseyed with head shoulder to proposition dean be very good man at head of own dinner table party went off pleasantly in spite of sundry attempt at clerical pugnacity made by mr groschut man beast have own weapon wolf fight with tooth bull with horn mr groschut always fought with bishop so taught by inner instinct bishop according to mr groschut be inclined to think that might be done such change might be advantageously made in reference to certain clerical meeting that hilarity of diocese might be enhanced by certain evangelical festivity remark be generally addressed to mr canon holdenough who made almost reply to dean be on occasion prepared with civil answer while be answer must still seem to change conversation be law in close bishop barton must be never allowed to interfere with affair of brotherton cathedral if not bishop certainly not bishop chaplain though canon dean did not go altogether on four in reference to clerical affair generally be agreed on point chaplain who knew condition of affair a well a did thought law bad law be determined to abolish certainly must be very pleasant mr holdenough if must have meeting within confines of close mean to day mean to morrow might think of bishop who have greatest love for cathedral service be very much of mind know care very much for out of door gathering said canon why out of door asked chaplain meeting there be to be in close will hope be held in deanery said dean of meeting must say that like meeting such a best germain will pas bottle when be alone together always called son in law george in company dropped more familiar name mr de baron mr houghton father liked joke sporting men said always go to meet clerical men to meeting what be difference good deal if be in colour of coat said dean one be always under cover said canon other believe be generally held out of door there be fancy considerable resemblance in energy of who be brought together said chaplain clergyman ai allowed to hunt be said mr houghton who a usual be little in dark a to subject under consideration what be to prevent asked canon who have never be out hunting in life who certainly must have advised young clergyman to abstain from sport in asking question be enabled to strike sidelong blow at objectionable chaplain by seeming to question bishop authority own conscience must hope said chaplain solemnly thereby parrying blow successfully be very glad then said mr houghton did go into church to be thought real hunting man be great object of mr houghton ambition be afraid must hardly have suited houghton said dean come will go up to lady in drawing room after little while lord george found seated next to mr houghton adelaide de baron a have be when have sighed in vain at foot how have come to pas that be sitting there did not know be quite sure that have come to pas by arrangement contrived by have looked at once since have be in room almost blushing a did so have told that be certainly very beautiful almost thought that be more beautiful than wife knew knew now that beauty manner be not a well suited to a of sweet creature whom have married now be once more seated close to be incumbent on to speak to hope said almost in whisper still not seeming to whisper that have become very happy since met last hope so indeed said there can not at least be doubt a to lord george never knew sweeter young girl than mary lovelace so pretty so innocent so enthusiastic be poor worldly creature compared to be that say mr houghton lord george also be displeased more thoroughly displeased than have be wife did not know how to show displeasure though felt still felt also old influence of woman beauty be so delighted to have heard that have got house in munster court hope that lady george may be fast friend indeed wo call lady george for be mary to before of thought of getting husband for be not strictly true of lord george must know nothing do hope may hope that will call on certainly will do so will add so much to happiness of life if will allow to feel that have come gone have not broken friendship between certainly not said lord george lady have then said that have got to say changed position a silently a have occupied there be abruptness of motion yet lord george saw talking to husband at other side of room almost while own word be still sounding in own ear then watched for next few minute certainly be very beautiful there be room for comparison be so unlike otherwise must have be disposed to say that adelaide be more beautiful adelaide certainly must not have suited air of manor cross have associated well with lady sarah on next day marchioness lady susannah amelia drove over to deanery in great state to call on miss tallowax to take lady george back to manor cross miss tallowax enjoyed company of marchioness greatly have never seen lady of rank before only think how must feel said to niece that morning that never spoke to one above baronet lady in life think will find much difference said mary be used to be one of be above baronet lady ai dear have hardly looked into that a yet aunt there must surely have be little fib in dean daughter must have be very much unlike other young lady suppose ought to be afraid of dear only be so nice so pretty a for lord george be quite condescending lady george knew that praise be intended therefore made objection to otherwise objectionable epithet visit of marchioness be passed over with le disturbance to miss tallowax because be arranged that be to be taken over to lunch at manor cross on following day lord george have said word lady sarah have consented though a rule lady sarah did not like company of vulgar people peasant of parish down to very poorest of poor be daily companion with must spend hour feeling inconvenience from language habit did not like gentlefolk who be not gentle in day now long gone by have only assented to dean because holy order be supposed to make gentleman for must acknowledge bishop to be a grand nobleman a though might have be born son of butcher nobility gentry can not travel backwards have be in doubt about miss tallowax even with lady sarah feeling have made way teach to know that must submit to change thing be to be regretted lady sarah knew that be not strong enough to stand quite alone know be very rich marchioness have said in whisper if brotherton marries poor brother will want so badly that ought not to make difference mamma said lady sarah whether did make difference not lady sarah probably hardly knew did consent to asking of miss tallowax to lunch at manor cross chapter v miss tallowax be shown house dean took aunt over to manor cross in brougham dean brougham be neatest carriage in brotherton very much more so than bishop family carriage be doubt generally to be seen with only one horse bishop mr barton ever stirred without two then one horse be enough for town work that one horse must lift leg make conspicuous in manner of bishop rather sorry jade knew nothing on occasion a journey be long there be two horse hired nevertheless brougham looked very well a came up long manor cross avenue miss tallowax became rather frightened a drew near to scene of coming grandeur henry said to nephew will think so little of dear aunt replied dean in day lady who have plenty of money of own can hold head up anywhere dear old marchioness will think quite a much of a do of what perhaps struck miss tallowax most at first moment be plainness of lady dress be rather gorgeous in shot silk gown fashionable bonnet crowded with flower have be ashamed of splendour of article a put on yet have be ashamed also of ordinary daily head gear when saw marchioness especially when saw lady sarah who be altogether strange to wished that have come in customary black gown have heard something about lady sarah from niece have conceived idea lady sarah be dragon of family when saw little woman looking almost a old a though in truth one might have be other mother dressed in old brown merino with slightest morsel of white collar to be seen round neck began to hope that dragon must not be very fierce hope like brotherton miss tallowax said lady sarah think have heard that be here once before like brotherton very much lady lady sarah smiled a graciously a knew how came when first made henry dean long time ago now seems have not then honour of knowing mamma family be long before did know said marchioness then miss tallowax turned round again curtseyed with head shoulder dean at moment be not in room having be withdrawn from lady by son in law at front door a luncheon be announced two men came in lord george gave arm to wife great aunt dean followed with marchioness really be abeost ashamed to walk out before ladyship said miss tallowax with slight attempt at laughing at own ignorance lord george rarely laughed at anything certainly did not know how to treat pleasantly such subject a be quite customary said very gravely lunch be much more tremendous to miss tallowax than have be dinner at deanery though be ignorant ignorant at rate of way of such people a with whom be now consorting be by mean stupid old woman be soon able to perceive that in spite of old merino gown be lady sarah spirit quelled at first there be very little conversation lord george did not speak word marchioness never exerted poor mary be cowed unhappy dean made one two little effort without much success lady sarah be intent upon mutton chop finished to last shred turning over over in plate so that must be economically disposed of looking at very closely because be short sighted when mutton chop have finally done duty looked up from plate gave evident sign that intended to take upon weight of conversation subsequent ceremony of lunch little tart jelly custard pudding despised altogether regarding a wicked addition one pudding after dinner must have allowed nothing more of sort might be very well for parvenu millionaire to have two grand dinner day must not be necessary that germains must live in way even when dean of brotherton aunt came to lunch with hope like part of country miss tallowax said a soon a have deposited knife fork over bone manor cross be quite splendid lady said miss tallowax be

brother be marquis of brotherton can not say that be very young be two year senior ten year older than george think be not married yet asked miss tallowax question be felt to be disagreeable by poor mary must not keep from blushing a remembered how much to might depend on question of brother in law marriage lord george felt that old lady be enquiring what chance there might be that grand niece must ever become marchioness old lady brotherton who have always be anxious that elder son must marry felt uncomfortable a did also dean conscious that there must be conscious how important must be matter to said lady sarah with stately gravity elder brother be not yet married if must like to see room miss tallowax will have pleasure in showing way dean have seen room before remained with old

miss tallowax almost afraid to press such sacred board with foot queen elizabeth did really now people say never did actually come to manor cross at said conscientious lady amelia there be doubt that room be prepared for law said miss tallowax who began to be le afraid of distant royalty now that doubt be cast on absolute presence examining evidence a closely a can said lady sarah with savage glance at sister be inclined to think that certainly did come know that be at brotherton in there exists letter in sir humphrey germaine a be then be desired to prepare room for myself have doubt on subject after doe not make much difference said mary think make difference in world said lady susanna that piece of furniture will always be sacred to because believe did once afford rest sleep to

girl have caught ear have be pleased to marry into so good family have be delighted to think that by mean of prosperity in world father grand daughter might probably become peeress certainly have not intended that even for such reward a daughter must become submissive to old maid at manor cross foreseeing something of have stipulated that must have house of own in london time must probably be spent in country with reference to half of time must be necessary that must be made to understand that a wife of lord george be in respect inferior to sister in respect be superior see good of living in big house continued miss tallowax if time everything be to be a dull a dull be older than be know poor little dear always did say that young folk must have young folk about 'em of course be great thing for to have lord for husband look abeost too old for pretty darling a mary be only thirty three be in look suppose because be so grand be that lady sarah puzzle be in look yet have in own way

asked to come with put on hat joyfully joined hand over arm a walked away with into shrubbery be wonderful old woman be not george not very wonderful of course think be vulgar did say so no be too good to say so because be papa aunt be very good think be very good dare say be know that run into superlative quite so much a do have brought handsome present must not show before just now only came down from london morning did not say word about before look here then slipped glove off showed diamond ring must not wear that out of door only put on to show be good of 'young people of rank ought to wear nice thing said a gave be odd thing for to say yet understood lord george frowned thinking that also understood old woman word reminding that lady of rank at manor cross never did wear nice thing think be nice of course be entitled to make present if plea pleased george dare say a doe displease be well however have quite sense enough to understand in house more be thought of of of must have said blood that did not wish to hurt more be thought of personal good conduct than of ring jewel ring jewel personal conduct may go together may of course may very often do wo think personal conduct will be injured because wear aunt ring when lord george made allusion to personal conduct one of two hand dropped from arm now a repeated word there be little sting of sarcasm in voice be intending to answer aunt opinion that young people ought to wear nice thing doubt there be at present great rage for rich ornament costly dress be of be thinking when spoke of nice thing when spoke of personal conduct being more thought of here intended to imply that have come into family not given to rich ornament costly dress sister feel that portion in world be assured to without such outward badge wish that must share feeling be regular sermon to mary thinking be very disagreeable not at deserved did husband really mean to tell because sister chose to dress down in country like dowdy old maid whom world have deserted be to do same up in london injustice of on side struck home to at moment be old be young be plain be pretty be poor be rich did feel wish to make what called nice did feel very strong wish in direction be old maid be young bride then what right have to domineer over to send word to through husband of wish a to manner of dressing said nothing at moment became red began to feel that have power within to rebel at rate against sister in law there be silence for moment so then lord george reverted to subject hope can sympathise with sister said have felt that hand have be dropped have understood something of reason wished to rebel against by mean wished to oppose be aware a though by instinct that life must be very bad indeed must fail to sympathise with be still paramount desire of heart to be in love with must not bring to say that sympathised with in direct attack be made on own mode of thought of course be little older than be said hoping to get out of difficulty therefore more entitled to consideration think will own that must know what be what be not becoming to lady do mean said hardly able to choke rising sob that have anything to find fault with in have said nothing a to finding fault mary do think dress a ought to do why must ask question a know what else be to understand george of course will do anything that tell if wish to make

very united family speak now of elder brother who be in great measure separated from be of different nature mother sister have very many opinion in common live together have same way of thinking rank be high mean be small to blood be much more than wealth acknowledge however that rank demand many sacrifice sister endeavour to make sacrifice most conscientiously woman more thoroughly devoted to good work than sarah have never even read of if will believe will understand what mean what mean when say that here at manor cross think more of personal conduct than of ring jewel wish mary to be one of do not paused for moment then answered wish to be always one with almost wanted to be angry at be impossible to be one with dearest said must be one also with can not love a do george that be sure be not meaning of being married then thought of steadily for minute after made further speech think can quite dress like be sure must not like if did a said put second hand back upon arm said nothing further on subject till have brought back to house walking along by side almost mute not quite knowing whether ought to be offended with to take part be true that must not have liked to look like lady sarah must have liked to make approach in direction sufficient to show submission be already beginning to fear absence of control must befall young wife in london life to be to be so soon introduced be meditating whether must not induce one of sister to accompany a to sarah be almost hopeless amelia must be of little service though must be more likely to ingratiate with wife than others susanna be le strong than sarah le amiable than amelia then how must be if mary be to declare that must rather begin campaign without of young wife a soon a found alone in own bedroom sat down resolved that must never allow to be domineered by husband sister must be submissive to in thing authority must not be delegated to chapter vi bad tidings about middle of october there came letter from marquis of brotherton to brother startled at manor cross very much indeed in answering lord george communication a to marriage marquis have be mysterious disagreeable then be always disagreeable must on occasion

mother feel if be ever allowed to see how will feel if find that never want to see wife lady sarah sat silent for few minute before answered then declared for war be very bad george very bad can foresee great unhappiness especially unhappiness must come from constant condemnation of one whom ought to wish to love approve of before others nothing can be so bad a running away ought not to allow anything to drive mamma from own house from own duty think ought to take notice of brotherton letter to mr price be thus decided between that further notice must be taken of marquis letter to mr price

master for might hear hound rustling through covert a hurried up to certify to scent old leader have found for holt though thick be small fox have not much chance by breaking once up covert once back again animal went then dick watchful whip holding hand up to face holloaed away gently gentleman shouted sir simon let settle now mr bottomley if will only keep little steady will find better for at

expectation have be dodging backwards forward trying to avoid husband yet unwilling to leave farmer side wait moment ma'be wait moment now be right here to left so saying mr price jumped over low hedge mr houghton followed almost too closely mr houghton saw did follow have made way up resolved to stop wife gave slip at last moment now through gate ma'be then on straight a arrow for little wood will give lead over ditch ride quite so close ma'be then farmer went away feeling perhaps that best chance of keeping clear from too loving friend be to make pace so fast that must not be able quite to catch lady mountfencer nag be fast too be fast have will of own be not without cause that lord mountfencer have parted with so good horse out of stable have care ma'be said price a mr houghton

hound in opposition to old husband mr houghton followed a got out on other side fox be again away ai making for pugsby after said price to george scruby know that country yet said huntsman will be back in manor cross wood will see else park of manor cross lay to left of whereas pugsby desirable grass country away to bamham moor be to right men mindful of big brook knowing whereabouts of bridge

be still dozen rider pressing on among be farmer devoted follower gentleman in black let give praise where praise be due acknowledge that young bottomley be first at brook first over a soon a be beyond sir simon notice have scurried on across plough being light indiscreet have enjoyed heartfelt pleasure of passing george scruby george who hated mr bottomley grunted out malediction even though one must hear will soon be at bottom of said george meaning to imply in horsey phrase that rider if rode over ploughed ground after fashion must soon come to end of steed power bottomley if must only be seen to jump big brook before one else must have happiness enough for month to have done thing that must talk about be charm bottomley found in hunting ala though rode gallantly at brook did get over there be not much to talk about for unfortunately left horse behind in water poor beast going with rush off plough came with neck shoulder against opposite bank shot rider well on to dry land be about a good a dead'un said george a landed yard two to right be ill natured horse in truth be not hurt rider at rate young rider must not take lead from huntsman unless be very sure of of horse of run of hound next man over be gentleman in black who took in stand who really seemed to know what be about there be who afterwards asserted that be dean dean be never heard to boast of performance mr

a to be in front of have be hinted that arrangement be professional rather than providential present writer having given mind to investigation of matter be inclined to think that arises from general fitness of thing public institution have ought to have doctor in institution be doctor so invariably at hand just when be wanted a in hunting field very skilful young surgeon from brotherton be on spot almost a soon a lady be out of water declared that have dislocated shoulder what be to be done hat have gone have be under water be covered with mud be still senseless of course must neither ride

manner told that be indeed very pretty lady george mary a will still call for simplicity in spite of promotion have become somewhat afraid of mr houghton now seeing husband courtesy to guest understanding from manner that liked society began to thaw to think that might allow to be intimate with woman did not occur to to be in degree jealous not at least a yet in innocence did not think

three day next week to let know be not to be cowed there be good deal said at manor cross about newspaper correspondence condemnation of dean expressed by lady who thought that have lowered by addressing reply to editor in heat of discussion word two be spoken by lady susanna who entertained special objection to thing low made mary very angry think papa be at rate better judge than can be said between sister a sister generally be even sister in law must not be much at manor cross be felt to be misconduct mary be so much younger than be then be grand daughter of tradesman doubt thought that be willing to admit among on term of equality then there be feeling among that ought to repay great goodness by certain degree of humility submission from day to day young wife strengthened in resolution that must not be humble must not be submissive lady susanna when heard word drew up with air of offended dignity mary dear said lady sarah be not that little unkind think be unkind to say that papa be indiscreet said dean daughter wonder what 'd think if be to say word against dear mamma have be specially instructed to call marchioness mamma dean be not father in law said lady amelia very proudly a though in making suggestion begged to be understood that under circumstance must such connection have be possible be papa will stand up for do say that must know more about such thing than lady then lady susanna got up marched majestically out of room lord george be told of found obliged to speak to wife be afraid there have be something between susanna dear abused papa told papa knew better than did then walked out of room suppose meant to abuse dean called name said be indiscreet be calling name dear indiscreet be epithet even be noun substantive a name must be must only be one name be certainly very hard to fall in love with man who must talk about epithet so very soon after marriage yet must go on trying dear george said scold will do anything tell like to say hard thing of papa be not angry with for taking papa part be kissed told that be not in least angry with nevertheless went on to insinuate that if must bring to show something of submission to sister must make own life happier theirs must do anything must to make life happy said chapter xi lord lady george go up to town time went on day arranged for migration to london came round after much delicate fencing on one side other be fixed for st january fencing took place between dean acting on behalf of daughter lady of manor cross family generally though conceived to have have many cause of displeasure with mary be not le anxious to keep at manor cross must at moment have gladly assented to abandonment of london house have taught to look upon london house a allurement of satan most unwisely contrived countenanced by dean there be doubt that a dean acted on behalf of daughter so did act on behalf of brother must not oppose london house disliked feared now at last thoroughly repented of have be stipulation made at marriage dean money have be spent dean have be profuse with money have shown to be more wealthy man than one at manor cross have suspected mary fortune be doubt own furniture have be in great measure supplied by dean dean have paid necessary premium on going into house lord george felt to be impossible to change mind after have be done have be quite willing to postpone evil day a long a possible lady susanna be especially full of fear must be owned especially inimical to mary wish be one who have perhaps be most domineering to brother wife be certainly one whose domination mary resisted with most settled determination there be self abnegation about lady sarah downright goodness at same time easily handled magisterial authority commanded reverence after three month of residence at manor cross mary be willing to acknowledge lady sarah be more than sister in law that nature partook of divine omnipotence that compelled respect whether given willingly unwillingly to none of others must spirit thus humble especially not to lady susanna therefore lady susanna be hostile therefore lady susanna be quite sure that mary must fall into great trouble amidst pleasure of metropolis after said to elder sister what be l year to keep up house in london will only be for few month said lady sarah of course must have carriage then george will find altogether in hand of dean be what fear dean have done very well with be not man whom like to trust altogether be at rate generous with money be bound to be must not hold up head at have nothing else to depend on did hear what dr pountner said about other day since affair with newspaper have gone down very much in chapter be sure of think be little hard upon susanna must feel that be very wrong about house in london why be man because be married to be taken away from own pursuit if must not accommodate to taste must not have accepted let be just said lady sarah certainly let be just said lady amelia who in conversation seldom took much part unless when called upon to support eldest sister of course must be just said lady susanna did not accept said lady sarah till have agreed to comply with dean wish that must spend part of time in london be very weak said lady susanna wish must have be otherwise continued lady sarah can hardly suppose that taste of young girl from brotherton must be same a ours can understand mary must find manor cross dull dull exclaimed lady susanna dull ejaculated lady amelia constrained on occasion to differ even from eldest sister ca understand that must find manor cross dull particularly while have husband with bargain at rate be made said lady sarah before engagement be settled a money be hers think have right to complain be very sorry that must be so character be very far from being formed taste be so completely fixed that nothing will change then there be that mr houghton said lady susanna mr houghton have of course left manor cross long since have left most unsatisfactory feeling behind in mind of manor cross lady arose not only from personal dislike from suspicion most agonising suspicion that brother be more fond than must have be of lady society must be understood that mary knew nothing of be altogether free from such suspicion three sister marchioness under tuition have decided that must be very much better that lord george must see more of mr houghton be not thought infatuated in such fashion that must run to london after when in london must certainly be thrown into society can not bear to think of continued lady susanna lady amelia shook head think sarah ought to speak to seriously man have higher idea of duty than have if be made to think of will avoid have spoken replied lady sarah almost in whisper well well be angry how did bear be not angry did not bear very well told that certainly found to be attractive that thought have power enough to keep free from such fault a asked to promise not to see declined to make promise said might not be able to keep be horrid woman mary be afraid like said lady susanna know that evil will come of sundry scene counter to be enacted at deanery mary be in habit of getting taken over to brotherton more frequently than lady liked be impossible that must openly oppose visit to father on one occasion early in january have got husband to ride over with be closeted with dean while be away in city papa said almost think that will give up house in munster court give up look here mary will have happiness in life unless can make up mind not to allow old lady at manor cross to sit upon be not for sake doe not like must do anything for be very well must be last to advise to oppose wish if did not see that effect must be to make subject to sister dominion a well a must like to be always under thumb papa must like that be because foresaw stipulated so expressly a did that must have house of own woman when marries must be emancipated from other domestic control than of husband from nature of lord george family must have be impossible at manor cross therefore insisted on house in town must do more freely because wherewithal be to come from not from disturb what have done will not go against of course papa remember always that be to be done a much for sake a for yours position have be very peculiar have property of own have lived there with mother sister till feminine influence of house have almost domineered be duty to assist in freeing from looking at matter in light now presented to mary began to think that father be right with husband there must at rate be only one feminine influence added laughing will not over rule will not try said mary smiling at rate let other woman rule by degree will learn to enjoy london society so will will spend year at manor cross deanery by degree will be emancipated for can conceive nothing more melancholy than must be slavery yours if be to live throughout year with old woman then too said something to of satisfaction must receive from living in london told that for life have hardly a yet be commenced received lesson with thankfulness gratitude with something of wonder that must so openly recommend to manner of life have hitherto be taught to regard a worldly after further hint be given to that house in london might yet be abandoned when riding back with husband have be clever enough to speak of thing a fixed certainty have then known that also must regard a fixed have better not say anything more about said one day almost angrily to lady susanna then nothing more have be said about to there be other cause of confusion of terrible confusion at manor cross of confusion so great that from day to day marchioness must declare unable to go through trouble before workman be already in big house preparing for demolition reconstruction of everything a soon a must be gone other workman be already demolishing reconstructing cross sadness of weight on old lady mind be increased by fact that member of family have received so much even a message from marquis since have be decided that wish must not be obeyed over over again dowager attempted to give way suggested that must depart be out of sight seemed to that when marquis be marquis ought to have own way though be never so unreasonable be not head of family lady sarah be resolved carried point be to be

agent learned from that miss houghton story be substantially true marquis have informed man of business that heir have be born to have not communicated fact to one of family omission in such family be to lord george thinking so great crime on part of brother a to make doubt whether must ever again have fraternal relation with man who so little knew duty when mr knox showed letter brow became very black did not often forget be not often so carried away by feeling a to be in danger of doing so on occasion even be so moved a to be unable to control word italian brat who be to say how be born marquis lord must not do anything like said mr knox very seriously then lord george be ashamed of blushed up to root of hair have hardly known what have meant mistrusted italian widow because be italian because be widow mistrusted whole connexion because there have be in none of honourable openness must thought characterise family doings in such family a of germains know of what kind mean said shuffling knowing that shuffled suppose brother must do anything really wrong be blot to family terrible blot be lady of good family marchese said mr knox italian marchese said lord george with infinite contempt english nobleman have for foreign nobility not of highest order have that miss houghton story be true be certainly very unhappy be not at that have pictured to glory of being marquis of brotherton after brother death be only disappointment felt a to possible son of own though on side did feel blow reflection perplexed most be consciousness that must quarrel with brother that after quarrel must become nobody in world then added to be sense of family disgrace must have be quite content with position have be left master of house at manor cross even without of brother income wherewith to maintain house now must only be wife husband dean son in law living on money compelled by circumstance to adapt to almost thought that have known that must be turned out of manor cross must not have married then in spite of disclaimer to mr knox be already suspicious of foul practise heir to title property to family honour of germains have suddenly burst upon twelve month for aught that knew two three year after child birth nobody have be informed when child be born in what circumstance except that mother be italian widow what evidence on englishman might rely must possibly be forthcoming from such country a italy poor lord george who be a honest a sun be prepared to believe evil thing of people of whom knew nothing must brother die brother health be bad what step must take must be for to accept italian brat a heir to everything must ruin by pernicious lawsuit looking forward saw nothing family misery disgrace saw also inevitable difficulty with knew to be incapable to cope be true said to wife very gloomily when first met after interview with mr knox what miss houghton said felt sure be true directly told know why must have felt sure merely on word a to thing so monstrous a be seem to see that concern doe concern at except a make unhappy then there be pause for moment during crept close up to in manner have now become usual with why do think married said be too unhappy to answer pleasantly too much touched by sweetness to answer unpleasantly so said nothing certainly not with hope might become marchioness of brotherton may have made do thing can assure that have nothing to do with ca look forward suppose that may have son then buried face upon shoulder if so must not be better that child so born must be heir than italian baby of whom one know anything if be unhappy george will be unhappy for will not affect to care anything want to be marchioness only want to see without frown on brow to tell truth if did mind must care nothing about brother doings must make joke of marchese who miss houghton say be puckered faced old woman miss houghton seems to care great deal more about than do can not be subject for joke be almost angry at idea of wife of head of family being made matter of laughter that must be reprobated hated cursed if necessary be within limit of family dignity not that must become joke to with whom have unfortunately connected when have finished speaking to must not feel that be displeased must not feel also injustice of such displeasure of course have own little share in general disappointment have striven before to make nothing of in order that might be quite sure that have married not with idea of rank wealth for alone have made light of family misfortune in order that might be relieved yet be angry with be unreasonable how much have done for be not striving hour of life to love at rate to comfort with conviction that be loved be not constant in assurance to herself that whole life must be devoted to yet be surly to simply because brother have disgraced when be left alone sat down cried then consoled by remembering that father be coming to have be arranged that last day of february must be spent by lord george with mother sister at cross hall that dean must run up to town for week lord george went down to brotherton by morning train dean came up on same afternoon going coming be so fixed that two men met at deanery lord george have determined that must speak fully to dean respecting brother be always conscious of dean low birth remembering with slight discomfort stable keeper tallow chandler be little inclined to resent what thought to be disposition on part of dean to domineer still dean be practical sagacious man in whom must trust assistance of such friend be necessary to circumstance have bound to dean be man not prone to bind to many men wanted yet feared confidence of friendship lunched with dean then told story know said that brother be married of course heard that be married more than twelve month before informed that be going to be married be so do mean then that told falsehood letter to be very strange though did not think much of at time said ' be to be married ' naming day that certainly be falsehood a at time be married know that harsh word will do good be best george that must be quite plain in word to other placed a be a be be bound to tell of marriage a soon a knew have waited till be between forty fifty of course must feel that what must do must depend materially upon what did did at then having omitted to do duty screen fault by positive misstatement when intended return home make further concealment impossible however be of little moment said lord george who must not see that dean be already complaining that have be left without information ought to have possessed when be giving daughter to probable heir to title there be more than what more have son born more than twelve month since who say so exclaimed dean jumping up from chair heard first rather mary did in common conversation from old friend then learned truth from knox though have told none of have told knox knox have known through only lately know now knox supposes that be coming home so that people about may be reconciled to idea of having heir there will be le trouble think if boy come now than if be never heard of till be ten fifteen year old perhaps till after brother death there may be trouble enough still said dean almost with gasp dean be clear did not believe in boy lord george remembered that have expressed disbelief that mr knox have almost rebuked have now told fact said lord george have told a soon a knew be a true a sun said dean putting hand on son in law shoulder will be honest must not trust in honesty of others poor mary doe not feel in least will not even interest about will feel day be more than child now feel george feel ought to feel feel ill treatment of what in not telling be probably no more than small part of wide scheme must find out truth of know what there be to find out said lord george hoarsely do do feel that there must be something think of brother position standing of past life present character be time now for being mealy mouthed when such man a appears suddenly with foreign woman foreign child announces one a wife other a heir having never reported existence of one of other be time that enquiry must be made at rate will make enquiry will think bound to do so on behalf of mary then parted a confidential friend do part with feeling antagonistic to other dean though have from heart acknowledged that lord george be a honest a sun still felt to be aggrieved by germain family doubted whether son in law must be urgent enough constant in hostility to own brother feared that lord george must be weak feeling a regarded that must fight till have spent last penny a long a there be chance that by fighting grandson of own might be made marquis of brotherton at rate understood own heart in matter knew what be that wanted lord george though have found compelled to tell everything to dean still dreaded dean be not in accordance with principle that must be leagued against brother with man a dean lovelace must see that dean be thinking of own possible grandchild whereas be thinking only of family of germain found mother sister at small house house at farmer price be living only month two since doubt be recognised dower house nevertheless there be still about flavour of farmer price considerable sum of money have be spent upon have come from sacrifice of small part of capital belonging to three sister with understanding that must be repaid out of old lady income one except old lady anticipated such repayment have created trouble grief family be never gay be now more sombre than ever when further news be told to lady sarah almost crushed child said in horror stricken whisper turning quite pale looking a though crack of doom be coming at once do believe then brother explained ground have for believing that be born in wedlock twelve month before fact be announced to have never be announced to said lord george what be to do be mother to be told ought to know at once yet how can tell what will do about dean know told yes thought best well perhaps yet be terrible that man so distant from must have secret in keeping a mary father thought right that must know have always liked dean personally said lady sarah there be manliness about have recommended having full hand know how to open be be quite no be quite said lord george also hesitating to pronounce word be understood by of must tell mother must will be wrong to withhold if like will tell susanna amelia think have better tell mother said lord george will take more easily from then if break down can control better that lady sarah must have doing of difficult piece of work be almost matter of course did tell tale to mother mother did break down marchioness when found that italian baby have be born twelve month before time have be made to believe be date of marriage took at once to bed what mass of horror be coming on be to go see woman who have have baby under such circumstance be own eldest son very very marquis of brotherton to be there with wife be not to go see through indignation against son have not be hot a have be theirs against brother be eldest son very marquis ought to be allowed to do almost anything pleased have not be impossible for to rebel against lady sarah must have obeyed son in matter of house even now be not against son that heart be bitter against woman who being italian having be married if married without knowledge of family presumed to say that child be legitimate have eldest son brought over with to hall of ancestor italian mistress must of course have be very bad must not have be so bad a nothing must be so bad a be to call popenjoy asked with gurgling voice from amidst bed clothes now eldest son of marquis of brotherton must a matter of course be lord popenjoy if legitimate certainly must said lady sarah authoritatively unless marriage must be disproved poor dear little thing said marchioness beginning to feel pity for odious stranger a soon a be told that really be to be called popenjoy then lady susanna amelia be informed feeling became general throughout household that world must be near end what be to do when must come be great question have begun by declaring that did not want to see of have endeavoured to drive away from neighbourhood have declared that mother sister must get on with wife lady at cross hall have very strong opinion that must turn out to be true still must not bear to think that must be living a be next door to head of family never see feeling began to creep over of except lady sarah that must have be better for to have obeyed head of family gone elsewhere be too late now decision have be made must remain lady sarah however never gave way for minute george said very solemnly have thought great deal about mean to let trample upon be very sad said lord george yes indeed if know think must be last person to attribute evil motif to elder brother to stand in way in aught that might wish to do in regard to family know be due to there be point beyond even that feeling can not carry have disgraced lord george shook head be doing can to bring disgrace upon have always be wish that must marry of course of course be always desirable that eldest son must marry heir to property then know that be heir be brought up to understand duty though have married foreigner much a must regret must be prepared to receive a sister be for to please in marrying foreigner be more specially bound to let be known to world to have everything substantiated than if have married english girl in own parish

be intention at least till saw lord george at deanery now there be serious thought in mind when arrived mary have for time got nearly rid of incubus of italian marchioness with baby be smile a kissed must not keep from great subject be terrible news darling said at once do think so papa certainly do see why lord brotherton must not have son heir a well a anybody else be quite entitled to have son heir one may almost say more entitled than anyone else seeing that have got so much to leave to on very account be more bound than anyone else to let world feel sure that declared son heir be absolutely son heir must be so vile a papa god forbid must say that must may be that considers married though marriage must not be valid here maybe be married yet child be not legitimate mary must not blush a father spoke to thus plainly do know be that wrote to own brother declaring that be about to be married twelve month after birth of child whom now expects to recognise a heir to title for one

little acquaintance a possible with gu mildmay be so much younger than so many of be girl said gu thinking to get out of little difficulty in way then be fish come to net hardly knew what be saying be anxious to raise feeling must prevent increased intimacy between own lover lady george be nothing to whether offended lady george germain if must do work without sinning against good taste well if not then good taste must go to wall good taste certainly have gone to wall upon word can hardly understand then lady george turned away to father well papa have miss mildmay persuaded to come to institute

day of grace have not come yet said dean papa said lady george a soon a visitor be gone do know particularly dislike that younger miss mildmay be worth being particularly disliked so rapidly say nasty impudent thing ca quite explain what said again lady george blushed people in society now do give strange liberty woman think more than men must mind not mind not mind so a to worry if pert young woman like say anything to annoy put down at time then think more about of course need not make friend of that certainly will not do on sunday after lady george dined again with father at mr houghton house dinner having be made up especially for dean on occasion mildmays be not there captain de baron be one of guest then be mr houghton cousin have run of house on occasion again there be great party mr montacute jones be there hetta miss houghton be whom world called hetta mr houghton father who happened to be up in town again lady george found sitting between host jack de baron again thought that jack be very agreeable companion idea of being in way afraid of did not enter into mind horrid word gu mildmay have said to a to being fish for net have effect of nature assured that knew too well to allow anything of kind to influence that lady george germain daughter of dean of brotherton married woman must be afraid of man afraid of too close intimacy idea be horrible disgusting to so that when jack proposed to join father in park on next afternoon said that must be delighted when told absurd story of regimental duty described brother officer who probably did not exist a described by then went on to hunting legend in buckinghamshire laughed at everything said be very merry like jack mr houghton said to in drawing room yes do very much be just what jack ought to be know about suppose jack ought to go to church twice on sunday give half what have to poor just a well a john perhaps doe jack be bound to be amusing while john need not have word to say for know be pet friend be almost like brother sister therefore need not be afraid of afraid of why must anybody be afraid of be sure need jack have done mischief in time perhaps be not sort of man must ever touch fancy again lady george blushed on occasion have nothing to say did not want to quarrel with mr houghton suggestion that must possibly love other man than husband have not now be made in so undisguised manner a before thought be engaged to miss mildmay said lady george oh dear nothing of kind be impossible a of have anything to speak of when doe lord george come back to morrow mind that come to see soon do so long to hear what will say about new sister in law have made up mind must have to koto to before long a real live marchioness will never have to do that not if child be real lord popenjoy have hope still dear soon after hetta houghton reverted to important subject have found out that what told be true lady george oh yes true wonder what dowager think about husband be with mother think suppose just what think that must have be better if have told everybody of marriage sooner great deal better know whether after will make great deal of difference lady brotherton dowager mean be so thoroughly english in way that never must have got on very well with italian daughter in law question be whether when man spring wife family on relation in way everything can be taken for granted man have be ever so many year in kamptschatka have then come back with kamptschatkean female calling wife must everybody take a gospel suppose so do think not in first place might be difficult for englishman to get married in country according to english law in next when there must hardly wish to do so italy be not kamptschatka miss houghton certainly not be england people be talking about great deal seem to think that italian lady ought to have walk over miss houghton have heard good deal about race from brother phrase have used be quite everyday word to lady george did not understand felt that miss houghton be talking very freely about very delicate matter remembered at same time what have be aspiration of lady earlier life put down good deal of what be said to personal jealousy papa said a went home seems to that people here talk great deal about one private concern mean about lord brotherton marriage that among other thing of course will talk about be hardly to be considered private know what more be talked about better for be felt to be public scandal that feeling may help oh papa wish must think that wanted help want truth dear must have on next day met jack de baron in park have not be long together before dean saw old friend on footpath stopped to speak to mary must have stayed too have not horse displayed inclination to go on that have felt unwilling to make effort in matter a rode on with captain de baron remembered have be said by gu mildmay mr houghton remembered also own decision that nothing of kind must matter to be understood thing that

night do hate going down being told that ground be a hard a brickbat at kennel while men be ploughing over country now be delicious spring day did like getting up captain de baron said perhaps there be something in think getting up be mistake idea of perfect world be one where nobody must ever have to get up must at like always to lie in bed there might be sort of arrangement to do away with nuisance see what good time dog have now captain de baron must like to be dog said turning round looking full in face dog must at moment just over horse withers saw face of gu mildmay who be leaning on father arm gu bowed to be obliged to return salute jack de baron turned face to path seeing lady raised hat be two friend asked not particularly wish be of course have right to wish in such matter

with crowd when once inside door turned to small passage on left conducted in authority to august room preparatory to platform be here bashful speaker try to remember first sentence that lecturer proud of prominence receive homage of officer of institute aunt ju who on occasion be second in glory made way in among crowd welcomed baroness who have just arrived baroness be very stout woman about fifty with double chin considerable moustache low broad forehead bright round black eye very far apart when introduced to lady george declared that have great honour in accepting re cog nition have stout roll of paper in hand be dressed in black stuff gown with cloth jacket buttoned up to neck hardly gave to copious bust appearance of manly firmness occasion almost required virile collar budding out over perhaps supplied what be wanting lady george looked at to see if be trembling how thought lady george must have be with if have be called upon to address french audience in french a far a must judge from experience baroness be quite at ease then be introduced by aunt ju to lady selina protest who be very little woman with spectacle of most severe aspect hope lady george that mean to put shoulder to wheel said lady selina be only here a stranger said lady george lady selina did not believe in stranger passed on very severely there be time for further ceremony a bald headed old gentleman who seemed to act a chief usher informed aunt ju that be time for to take baroness on to platform aunt ju led way puffing little for have be somewhat hurried on stair be not a yet quite used to thing still with proudly prominent step baroness waddled after apparently quite indifferent to occasion then followed lady selina lady george bald headed gentleman telling where to place have never be on platform before seemed a though crowd of people below be looking specially at a sat down at right hand of baroness who be of course at right hand of chairwoman bald headed gentleman introduced to other neighbour miss doctor olivia q fleabody from vermont there be so much of name sounded so strange to ear of lady george that must remember very little of be conscious that new acquaintance be miss doctor looked timidly round saw what must have be pretty face have not be marred by pinched look of studious severity pair of glass spectacle of glass shone in disagreeable manner there be spectacle be so much more spectacle than other spectacle that make beholder feel that there be before pair of spectacle carrying face rather than face carrying pair of spectacle so be with spectacle of olivia q fleabody be very thin jacket collar be quite successful sitting in front row displayed foot may also be said trouser for tunic wore came down hardly below knee lady george enquiring mind instantly began to ask what lady have done with petticoat be great occasion said dr fleabody speaking almost out loud with very strong nasal twang lady george looked at chair before answered feeling that must not dare to speak word if aunt ju be already on leg aunt ju be taking advantage of commotion be still going on among who be looking for seat to get breath therefore must whisper reply suppose be said if be not have wedded in peculiar manner to prophylactick therapeutick science must certainly now put foot down firmly in cause of architecture hope to have opportunity of saying few word on subject before interesting session will have closed lady george looked at again thought that enthusiastic hybrid who be addressing must not be more than twenty four year old aunt ju be soon on leg did not seem to lady george aunt ju enjoyed moment now that be come looked hot puffed once twice before spoke have studied few word so long have made so sure of that must not go very far wrong assured audience that baroness banmann whose name have only to be mentioned to be honoured throughout europe america have at great personal inconvenience come way from bavaria to give advantage of vast experience on present occasion like good chairwoman took none of bread out of baroness mouth a have occasionally known to be done on such occasion confined to ecstatic praise of german lady baroness bore without quiver when aunt ju sat down stepped on to rostrum of evening amidst plaudit of room with confidence to lady george be miraculous then aunt ju took seat be able for next hour half to occupy arm chair with gratifying faineant dignity baroness to tell truth waddled rather than stepped to rostrum swung heavily about a went sideways be manifest to eye that be not in least ashamed of waddling undid manuscript on desk flattened down over with great fat hand rolling head about a looked around then gave grunt before began during time audience be applauding loudly be evident that did not intend to lose breath of incense by hurry on own part at last voice hand foot be silent then gave last roll to head last pat to paper began de manifest infairiority of de tyrant saix first word spoken in very loud voice came clearly home to lady george ear though be uttered with most un english accent baroness paused before completed first sentence then there be renewed applause lady george must remark that bald headed old gentleman behind cadaverous youth who be near to be particularly energetic in stamping on ground indeed seemed that men be specially charmed with commencement of baroness oration be so good that repeated with perhaps even louder shout de manifest infairiority of de tyrant saix lady george with considerable trouble be able to follow first sentence two went to assert that inferiority of man to woman in work be quite a conspicuous a rapacity tyranny in taking to wage baroness though addressing mixed audience seemed to have hesitation in speaking of man generally a foul worm who ought to be put down kept under merely allowed to be father of child after minute two lady george found that must not understand two word consecutively although be close to lecturer baroness a became heated threw out word quicker more quickly till became almost impossible to know in what language be spoken by degree friend became aware that subject of architecture have be reached then caught word two a baroness declared that science be adaapted only to de aestetic comprehensive intelligence of de famale mind audience applauded throughout a though word reached when from time to time baroness wiped brow with very large handkerchief shook building with appreciation of energy then came loud rolling sentence with old word a audible termination de manifest infairiority of de tyrant saix a said waved handkerchief in air almost threw over desk be very great to night very great indeed whispered miss doctor olivia q fleabody to lady george lady george be afraid to ask neighbour whether understood one word out of ten be being spoken great a baroness be lady george became very tired of chair be hard room be full of dust must not get up be worse than longest worst sermon have ever heard seemed to at last that there be reason why baroness must not go on for ever woman liked people applauded poor victim have made up mind that there be hope of cessation in doing so be very nearly asleep when on sudden baroness have finished have thrown violently back into chair baroness believe said dr fleabody stretching across lady george be greatest treat ever have in life baroness hardly condescended to answer compliment be at moment so great woman at moment so immeasurably greatest human being at rate in london that did not become to acknowledge single compliment have worked hard be very hot still have sufficient presence of mind to remember demeanour when tumult be little subsided lady selina protest got up to move vote of thanks be sitting on left hand side of chair rose so silently that lady george have at first thought that affair be over that might go away ala ala there be more to be borne yet lady selina spoke with clear low voice though be quite audible earl sister did not evoke enthusiasm declared that thanks of woman in england be due to baroness for exertion of man who wished to be regarded a friend of woman lady selina be very quiet making gesture be indeed somewhat flat when sat down notice be taken of then very quickly before lady george have time to look about doctor be on foot be task to second vote of thanks be far too experienced occupant of platform to waste precious occasion simply on so poor task began by declaring never in life have duty be assigned to more consonant to taste than of seconding vote of thanks to woman so eminent so humanitarian at same time so essentially female a baroness banmann lady george who knew nothing about speaking felt at once that here be speaker who must at rate make herself audible intelligible then doctor broke away into general subject with special allusion to special matter of female architecture went on for twenty minute without dropping word there be moment in have almost made lady george think that woman ought to build house dislike to american twang have vanished be almost sorry when miss doctor fleabody resumed seat be after after baroness have occupied ten minute in thanking british public for thanks have be given to herself that supreme emotion of evening came to lady george again have thought when baroness second time rolled back to chair that time for departure have come many in hall indeed be already going must not quite understand why one on platform have a yet moved then came that bald headed old gentleman to to very self suggested to that lady george germain who other day be mary lovelace brotherton girl must stand up make speech there be to be vote of thanks to miss mildmay a chairwoman said bald headed old man hope lady george that will favour with few word heart utterly gave way blood flew into cheek thoroughly repented of having come to dreadful place knew that must not do though world be to depend upon did not know whether bald headed old gentleman might not have right of insisting on then people be looking at a horrible old man be pressing request over shoulder oh said ca pray indeed ca wo idea have come upon that be necessary that must be very absolute old man retired meekly made speech in honour of aunt ju a be going away lady george found that be to have honour of conveying baroness to lodging in conduit street be very well a there be room for three in brougham be not ill pleased to hear ecstasy of aunt ju about lecture aunt ju declared that have agreed with word have be uttered aunt ju thought that cause be flourishing aunt ju be of opinion that woman in england must before long be able to sit in parliament practise in law court aunt ju be thoroughly in earnest baroness have expended energy in lecture be more inclined to talk about person lady george be surprised to hear say that young man be very handsome young man that old man very nice old man be almost in love with mr spuffin bald headed gentleman usher when be particular in asking whether mr spuffin be married lady george must hardly think that be woman who have be so eloquent on infairiority of de tyrant saix be not till aunt ju have be dropped in green street conversation fell upon lady george that difficulty began speak asked baroness what in public not for world wrong dere noting so easy say just a please only say vera loud alvays abuse somebody someting s'ould try must sooner die said lady george indeed must be dead before must utter word be odd how lady doctor must speak like de american young woman dey have de impudence of of of everything please come to noting spoke well dear noting at dere be noting vords vords vords tank here be mind come again will learn to speak lady george a be driven home be lost in inability to understand have thought that doctor spoke best of now be told that be nothing did not yet understand that even people so great a female orator so nobly humanitarian a baroness banmann can be jealous of greatness of others chapter xviii lord george up in london lord george returned to town day after lecture be not altogether pleased that wife must have gone to disability thought indeed that did not seem to be in humour to be pleased with anything mind be thoroughly disturbed by coming of brother perplexed with idea that something must be done though knew not what be pervaded by feeling in present emergency behoved to watch own step more especially of wife anonymous letter have reached lady sarah signed friend of family in be stated that marquis of brotherton have allied to highest blood italy knew marrying into family have be noble before english nobility have existed whereas brother have married granddaughter of stable keeper tallow chandler letter have of course be shown to lord george though sister agreed in looking upon a emanation from enemy new marchioness still gave to understand that if attacked must be prepared to attack again lord george be open to attack on side indicated be on whole satisfied with wife be ladylike soft pretty well mannered good to grandfather have be stable keeper tallow chandler therefore be specially imperative that must be kept from injurious influence lady selina protest aunt ju who be well born might take liberty not so wife think be very nice place to go to mary be nice at be very funny never saw such vulgar creature a baroness throwing about wiping face why must go see vulgar creature throw about wipe face why must anybody do one like to see what be going on woman vulgarity must not hurt george must do good lady selina protest be there went with miss mildmay two old maid who have gone crazy about woman right because nobody have married whole thing be distasteful to hope will not go there again that certainly will not because be very dull said mary hope also independently of request must be enough certainly must george know why must be so cross to think have be cross be anxious specially anxious there be reason why have to be very anxious in regard to why have to be more particular than others what reason asked with look of bewildered astonishment be not prepared to answer question shuffled out of muttering further word a to peculiar difficulty of position then kissed left telling that must be well if must be careful if must be careful must be well if must be careful why must there be need of more care on part than on of others knew that have reference in way to troublesome lady troublesome baby who be about to be brought home must not conceive how conduct must be specially concerned be sorrow to that husband must allow to be ruffled about matter at be sorrow also that father must do so a to herself have idea that if providence chose to make marchioness providence ought to be allowed to do without interference on part must be double sorrow if be told that must do must do because there be before dim prospect of being seated in certain high place be claimed occupied by person be aware too that husband have in very truth scolded lady at manor cross have scolded before have never done so have got away from manor cross have borne scolding because prospect of escape have be before must be very bad indeed if husband must take to scold then thought that if jack de baron be married must never scold wife dean have not yet gone home in discomfort have recourse to did not intend to complain of husband to father have such idea occurred to must have stamped out at once knowing that course must be unloyal unwise father be so pleasant with so easy to be talked to so easy to be understood whereas husband be almost mysterious at rate gloomy dark papa said what doe george mean by saying ought to be more particular than other people doe say so yes did like going with old woman to hear other woman say that ought not to do though anybody else might think misunderstood did papa then have better imagine that be tired with journey that stomach be little out of order fret about such thing do make best of husband how be to know where may go where may be to ask everything first be child do will soon find out what plea what doe if manage well what do will please whatever manner may be be soft hearted affectionate know that papa if say cross word now again just let go by must not suppose that word always mean what seem to mean knew man who used to tell wife ever so often that wished be dead good heaven papa whenever said so always put little magnesia into beer thing went on a comfortably a possible never magnify thing even to suppose lord george want magnesia a yet will understand what mean said that did have not in truth quite comprehended lesson a yet must father a yet teach to in plainer language on same afternoon lord george called in berkeley square saw mr houghton at time whole circle of people who be in way connected with germain family who by circumstance of life be brought within pale of germain influence be agog with marriage of

made to marriage of lord george be day in must wife grandfather have ever be insolvent newspaper in catering for public will think proper to recall fact dean parentage have be alluded to late tallowax will tallowax property generally have also be declared that marchesa luigi now present marchioness have be born orsini also in paper other fact that have be divorced from late husband have already be denied by mr knox who have received telegram from florence ordering such denial to be made may therefore be conceived that germains be at moment subject of much conversation may be understood that mr houghton who considered to be on very confidential term with lord george must a be alone ask few question express little sympathy how doe dear marchioness like new house asked be tolerably comfortable that price be darling lord george have known ever so long of course be dower house be suddenness disturbed mother of course then whole of must have gone against grain with bear like angel for know have anything to bear whole thing be so dreadful there be dear wife everything just a ought to be idolized by mother looked up to by whole country very man whom wish to see head of such family talk in way mr houghton know be very distant still do feel near enough related to to be justified in being proud also to be justified in being ashamed what will do about calling upon brother will of course come to mother first then lady sarah one of sister will go over after will bring wife to cross hall if plea be so glad be settled be so much better know lord george must say to a must to own brother

be to so august that must not frown when anyone ventured to speak of even crowned prince be driven to relax on occasion lord george germain felt that must almost like just for once to talk about brother sister a though be smith jones be very hard to know what to think said mr houghton at once saw that field be open to have ventured good deal knowing man have felt danger of doing so be satisfied now that might say almost anything one be bound to think be one feel that be for whole family that have to act what be to be done ca go look up evidence paid agent can think of mary think of mary child if must have one a said looked rather anxiously into face being desirous of receiving answer to question did not quite dare to ask of course there be that said not answering question can only just remember though papa knew so well suppose have lived abroad till have ceased to think feel like englishman must anyone believe that marquis of brotherton must have married wife long enough ago to have son over twelve month old never to have said word about to brother mother believe know what to believe said lord george then to write in such way about house of course hear talked of by

love may love without anything wrong indeed do then there be embrace after that hurried away almost without word chapter xix rather boisterous after be very dreary be that adelaide houghton spoke to herself a soon a lord george have left doubt whole work of interview have fallen on to shoulder have at last be talked into saying that loved have then run away frightened by unusual importance tragic signification of own word after be very dreary mr houghton wanted excitement probably did like lord george a well a liked one undoubtedly must have married have be able to maintain a liked to be maintained a have be unable have taken mr houghton without notion on part of making even attempt to love when said that must not afford to wear heart have said so to various friend acquaintance did entertain idea circumstance have used cruelly that have absolutely be forced to marry stupid old man that therefore little freedom be due to a compensation lord george be lord george might possibly

revenge on mary lovelace game a stood have charm sufficient to induce to go on with yet after be dreary such be lady feeling when be left alone lord george went away from meeting almost overcome by excitement of occasion to matter be of such stirring moment that must not go home must not even go to club be so moved by various feeling that must only walk by consider thing to that final embrace have meant very little what did signify have taken in arm kissed forehead might have be lip have so pleased to have seemed to mean very much indeed there be luxury in almost intoxicated horror in almost quelled that must so love a to be actually subdued by love must not charm have none of strength arm man against flatterer none of experience strengthens man against female cajolery be to very serious very solemn there might perhaps have be exaggeration in mode of describing feeling there must be doubt in that have held in arm that be man wife wickedness of thing be more wicked to than charm of be charming be dreadful to to think that have done thing of must have to be ashamed if knowledge of be brought to wife ear that must have to own to have be wrong to must tear to piece that must lord over a real husband be necessary to happiness how can man be real lord over woman when have have to confess fault to to beg to forgive wife position with husband may be almost improved by such asking for pardon will enhance tenderness man be so lowered that of can ever forget degradation though might never come to though terrible passion might be concealed from still be grievance to disgrace that must have anything to conceal be stain in own eye on own nobility slur upon escutcheon taint in hitherto unslobbered honesty then sin of sin of to already sat heavy on conscience in ear even now sounded that commandment weekly prayed that might be permitted to keep while with there be hardly left remembrance of kiss have imprinted on brow lip be still burning with fever must make up mind now at once that must never never see again must resolve that must write to moving tragic letter not love letter in must set forth horror of unhallowed love tell that there must be gulf between over must pas till age must have tamed passion a walked across park meditated what must be fitting word for letter almost determined that must be written did not owe first duty to wife be not bound for sake to take step then a wandered alone in kensington garden for have taken many step occupied much time to think of there came upon idea perhaps lady must not receive letter in proper spirit idea occurred to of ridicule must befall must lady at last tell that have really exaggerated matter then letter might be shown to others did love lady with grief shame stricken conscience owned to that loved must not quite trust so a walked down towards albert memorial made up mind that must not write letter also made up mind thought that made up mind that must go no more alone to berkeley square a walked on suddenly came upon wife walking with captain de baron be immediately struck by idea that wife ought not to be walking in kensington garden with captain de baron idea be so strong a altogether to expel from mind for moment remembrance of mr houghton have be unhappy before because be conscious that be illtreating wife now be almost more disturbed because seemed to to be possible that wife be illtreating have left few minute ago thought of now a being few minute since telling with almost last word that be specially bound more bound than other woman to mind own conduct here be walking in kensington garden with man whom world called jack de baron a approached brow became clouded must see that be so must not fear that companion must see also lord george be thinking how to address have already determined on tucking wife under own arm carrying off before saw that very little way behind dean be walking with adelaide houghton though have be more than hour wandering about park must not understand that lady whom have left in own house so recently in apparently so great state of agitation must be there also in best bonnet quite calm have word immediately at command be a voluble a ever doe seem odd said why be not ten minute since left in berkeley square wonder what made come here what made come jack brought here if be not for jack must never walk ride do anything except sit in stupid carriage just at gate of garden met dean lady george be very simple straightforward there must be doubt of truth of lady george have come out with father nothing must be more a ought to be a to jack lady did not at rate a yet feel justified in being angry at arrangement nevertheless be disturbed wife have be laughing when first saw jack have be talking have seemed to be very happy together dean doubt be there still fact remained that jack have be laughing talking with wife almost doubted whether wife ought under circumstance to laugh in kensington garden then dean be so indiscreet lord george must not of course forbid wife to walk with father dean have idea that real looking after be necessary for anybody at once gave arm to wife in two minute have dropped be on step of albert memorial be perhaps natural that must do so hovered close to a be looking at figure be uneasy think be prettiest thing in london said dean one of prettiest thing in world find very cold said lord george who did not at present moment care very much for fine art have be walking quick said mr houghton have enjoyed dean with two others have now passed round one of corner wonder went on do wonder how have come to pas that must be brought together again so soon happened to come same way said lord george who be still thinking of wife yes must have be though be not strange coincidence mind have be so flurried that be glad to get out into fresh air when will see again must bring to say never there must have be mock tragic element about single word even felt yet here on step of monument there be hardly opportunity for to explain at length propriety of agreeing to be severed wish to see asked hardly know what to say love be now close to there be one else near enough to interfere be pressing close up to be sadly ashamed of yet did love thought that have never looked so well a at present moment say that love said stamping foot almost imperiously know do what have better come to again tell word be sooner out of mouth than remembered that have resolved that must never go to again yet after what have passed something must be done have also made up mind that must write have quite made up mind about that word be written remain must perhaps be better that must go to tell everything of course will come again said what be ail be unhappy because be here with cousin jack be intolerable to that one must suspect of jealousy jack have way of getting intimate with people mean nothing be dreadful to that allusion must be made to possibility of anybody meaning anything with wife just at moment jack voice be heard coming back round corner also laughter of dean captain de baron have be describing person represented on base of monument have done so after fashion of own have infinitely amused not only lady george father also ought to be appointed guide to memorial said dean if lady george will give testimonial doubt might get dean said jack think know anything about of said lady george be sure have told wrong about two be last man in world ought to be guide to anything will come be guide will just sweep step lord george heard last word allowed to be annoyed at though felt to be innocent knew that wife be having game of pleasant play like child with pleasant play fellow then be not satisfied that wife must play like child certainly not with such playfellow doubted whether wife ought to allow playful intimacy from man marriage be to very serious thing be not prepared to give up real passion because have made other woman wife in thinking over mind be not very logical did feel that be justified in exacting particularly strict conduct from because be going to make mr houghton understand that two though loved other must part if must sacrifice so much for wife surely might sacrifice something for returned altogether to hyde park corner then separated jack went away towards berkeley square with cousin dean got taken in cab to club lord george walked wife down constitution hill towards own home felt to be necessary that must say something to wife at same time be specially anxious that must give cause to suspect of jealousy be jealous in ordinary sense of word did not suppose for moment that wife be in love with jack de baron jack with wife did think that whereas have very little to say to own husband have great deal to say to jack be sensible also of certain unbecomingness in such amusement on part have to struggle upwards so a to be able to sustain properly position dignity of lady george germain possible dignity of marchioness of brotherton ought not to want playfellow if must really have learned name of artist on base of memorial a might so easily have done there must have be something in lady ought to know at rate name of such men have allowed jack to make joke of have rather liked joke dean have laughed loud more like son of stable keeper than dean lord george be almost more angry with dean than with wife dean when at brotherton did maintain certain amount of dignity here up in london seemed to be intent only on having good time like schoolboy out on holiday be not little loud when be on step of memorial said hope not george not too loud lady must never be in least loud for matter of must gentleman either if knew what be about walked on little way leaning on arm in silence considering whether meant anything by what be saying how much meant felt almost sure that did mean something disagreeable that be scolding quite know what mean by loud george be talking of course wanted to make other hear believe with people loud mean vulgar hope did mean that certainly must not tell wife that be vulgar there be said manner of talking lead people on to to being boisterous boisterous george be boisterous think father be little felt blush beneath veil a answered of course if tell anything about will endeavour to do a tell a for papa be sure know how to behave think ought to be found fault with because like to amuse captain de baron be very loud said lord george conscious that though ground might be weak in reference to dean must say what pleased about jack de baron young men do laugh talk george what do in barrack when be together be nothing to what one may do when be in company with wife be very much to ought to be very much to george said again pausing for moment do mean to tell have misbehaved because if so speak out at once dear be foolish question for to ask have said nothing about misbehaviour ought at rate to wait till have done so must be very sorry to use such word think that will ever have occasion surely will admit that there may be practises manner custom on be at liberty to speak to be older than husband of course be older than wife wife generally know what be about quite a well a husband mary be proper way to take what say have very peculiar place to fill in world place for early life must not give very fittest training then why did put there because of love also because have doubt whatever a to becoming fit there be levity be often pretty becoming in girl in married woman in rank of life may perhaps innocently indulge be not appropriate to higher position be because laughed when captain de baron mispronounced men name know anything peculiar in position one must suppose be going to be made sort of female bishop to sit life a chairwoman like miss mildmay of course laugh when thing be said that make laugh a for captain de baron think be very nice papa like be always at houghton can not agree that be loud vulgar boisterous because made few innocent joke in kensington garden perceived now for first time since have known that have temper of own might find difficulty in controlling have endured gently enough first allusion to herself have risen up in wrath against from moment in have spoken disparagingly of father at moment have nothing further to say have used what eloquence there be in what word have collected together then walked home in silence mind be full of matter though made further allusion on day for subsequent day either to conversation to wife conduct in park have always in mind must be master in order that might be master dean must be a little a possible in house that intimacy with jack de baron must be crushed if only that might be taught that intended to be master two three day passed by during two three day did not go to berkeley square chapter xx between two stool in middle of next week dean went back to brotherton before starting have interview with lord george be not altogether pleasant otherwise have thoroughly enjoyed visit on day on started asked host what inquiry intended to set on foot in reference to validity of italian marriage legitimacy of italian baby now lord george have in first instance consulted dean on very delicate subject be therefore not entitled to be angry at having again mentioned nevertheless resented question a interference think replied that at present nothing have better be said upon subject can not agree with there george then be afraid must ask to be silent without agreeing with dean felt to be intentionally uncivil two be in boat together injury to be done if there be injury must affect wife a much a husband baby might day be born might be robbed of inheritance must be a much grandchild of dean of brotherton a of old marquis then perhaps there be present to dean unacknowledged feeling that be paying must have to pay for boat much a revered rank be not disposed to be snubbed by son in law because son in law be nobleman mean to tell be to hold tongue said angrily for present think have better do so that may be a regard discussion of matter with outsider be not at disposed to act apart from on subject of such importance to if tell that be advised way must not without very strong ground put in opposition to advice do expect that will let know what be being done nothing be being done also that will not finally determine on doing nothing without consulting lord george drew up bowed made further reply then two parted dean resolving that must be in town again before long lord george resolving that dean must spend a little time a possible in house now there have be undertaking after sort made by dean compact with daughter contracted in jocose fashion in existing circumstance be like to prove troublesome there have be question of expenditure when house be furnished whether there must must not be carriage kept lord george have expressed opinion that joint mean must not suffice to keep carriage then dean have told daughter that must allow l year for own expense to include brougham for be to be no more than brougham during six month must be in london that must regard a subscription towards household mode of being generous to own child be pretty enough of course dean must be welcome visitor equally of course son in law may take amount of money from father in law a portion of wife fortune lord george though have suffered inward qualm have found nothing in arrangement to must object while friendship with deanery be close pleasant now a dean took departure a mary while embracing father said something of being soon back lord george remembered compact with inward grief wished that there have be no brougham in mean time have not be to berkeley square be at sure that must go there distant day have be named before exciting interview in square on houghton be to dine in munster court mildmays be also to be there mr montacute jones old lord parachute lord george uncle must be party there must be no danger of scene then have almost determined that in spite of promise must not go to berkeley square before dinner mr houghton be not of same mind promise on subject be sacred thing therefore wrote following note to lord george at club secrecy correspondence requires certainly tends to make club convenient arrangement why come a said must in olden time fifteen twenty year ago when telegraph wire be still young message be confined to diplomatic secret horse racing rise fall of stock lover used to indulge in rapturous expression must run over page pith strength of laconic diction have now be taught to by self sacrificing patriotism of post office have felt vigour of telegrammatic expression even when trust wire employ force of wiry language wilt thou be mine m n be now ordinary form of offer of marriage by post answer seldom go beyond ever thine p q adelaide houghton love letter be very short be short from judgment with settled purpose believed that long epistle declaratory of everlasting unfortunate attachment must frighten few word must say that have to say must say safely certainly have promised that must go to a gentleman be bound to keep word have mentioned exact time have be understood that visit be to be made at once must not write to heaven earth how must be with if mr houghton be to find smallest scrap from indicating improper affection for mr houghton must not answer note therefore must go at once went into deserted corner of drawing room at club there seated for hour meditation how must extricate from dilemma in what language must address young beautiful woman devoted to whose devotion be bound to repudiate be not voluble in conversation be aware of own slowness be essential to that must prepare beforehand almost very word for occasion of such importance very word gesture action must not fly into arm at least expect that must open own must be avoided there must be embracing then must at once proceed to explain evil of calamitous passion how be husband of wife how be wife of husband how be bound by honour by religion equally by prudence to remember obligation have incurred must beg to be silent while said then must conclude by assuring that must always posse steadiest friendship excogitation of took long partly because mind be greatly exercised in matter partly through nervous desire to postpone difficult moment at last however seized hat went away straight to berkeley square yes mr houghton be at home have feared that there be little chance that must be out on very day on knew that must get note oh so have come at last said a soon a drawing room door be closed did not get up from chair there be therefore danger of immediate embrace have felt that must be almost equally dangerous to refuse to accept yes said have come now sit down make comfortable be very bad out of door be cold dry with wretched east wind know mean to stir out whole day so may put down not think of going for next hour half be true that have hat still in hand deposited forthwith on floor feeling have be master of occasion must have got rid of le awkwardly must wonder if mary be to be here by by there be sort of engagement that jack de baron be to come play bagatelle in back drawing room jack never come if say will daresay have forgotten about found that purpose be altogether upset in first place must hardly begin about unfortunate passion when received just a though be ordinary acquaintance then whole tenour of mind be altered by allusion to jack de baron have come to that must not get through day without having jack de baron thrown at head have from first be averse to living in london be much worse than have expected be to be endured that wife must make appointment to play bagatelle with jack de baron by way of passing time have heard nothing about said with gloomy truthful significance be impossible for to lie even by glance of eye tone of voice told at once how unwilling be that wife must come out on purpose to meet man how little able felt to prevent of course dear mary have to amuse said lady answering man look rather than word why must not know that bagatelle be very improving occupation jack very improving companion perhaps can tell george that there be more dangerous companion than poor jack then mary who be sweetest dearest young woman know be not impulsive in way be such very child suppose understands what passion mean have gaiety of lark innocence be always soaring upwards be so beautiful know that there be much soaring upwards in bagatelle in jack de baron perhaps must take that a find of course mary will have to amuse will never live life a sister live at manor cross word that best describes disposition be gay be not mischievous hope not be passionate know what mean did know what meant be lost in amazement at finding that one woman in talking of never contemplated idea that passion must exist in wife for husband be to regard a safe not because wife loved because be not necessary to nature to be in love with one need not be afraid went on to say know jack au fond tell everything must there be anything to fear will let know at once what have to do with momentous occasion have brought to berkeley square be almost beginning to be sore at heart because have not thrown into arm there be repetition of do love have be so very alarming at same time so very exciting on step of albert memorial then there seemed to be probability that word have composed with so much care at club must be altogether wasted owed to to do to say something to allude in way to love hers must not allow to be brought there in flurry of excitement there to sit till be time for to go just a though be ordinary morning visit bade come said so came yes did bid come must always have come that can hardly be can idea of friend of man friend mean real friend be one to whom can say everything who will do everything for who will come if bid will like to stay talk to just a long a will let who will tell everything a to whom may be sure that like better than anybody else in world though perhaps doe tell so above once month then in return well what in return must think good deal about know must want always to be telling be thinking about ought to be contented with knowing how much be to suppose must not suffice for lord george be disposed to think that must suffice that whole matter be now being represented to in very different light than in have hitherto regarded word friend softened down so many asperity with word in mind need not continually scare with decalogue pleasure might be there horror altogether omitted there must indeed be occasion for eloquence have already become conscious at interview eloquence must not be used have given everything so different turn why not suffice for said only that did for friend must expect to do for be unreasonable who doe see that in world at large men have best of almost in everything husband be not only justified in being tyrant becomes contemptible if be not so man have pocket full of money woman be supposed to take what give man have manner of amusement what amusement have can come to yes can do can not go to when come to if be to believe that be really friend then be to be tyrant of moment be not so do think must find hard tyrant own to freely that there be nothing in world like so much a society do not earn by right to obedience from to special observance be so different from what have expected so much more pleasant a far a must look into think of at pressure of moment did not see reason why must not be a proposed there be clearly need for prepared word there have be one embrace embrace be objectionable because have wife seen mr houghton must have be forced to own wrong have come from sudden impulse need not be repeated be now proposed to be friendship not love will have observance said with sweetest smile a to obedience be man therefore must not be pressed too hard now may tell be only thing can make happy absence of must make miserable what thing society blushed up to eye a heard now that think be very pretty speech expect something equally pretty from be much embarrassed be at moment delivered from embarrassment by entrance of wife here be said mr houghton getting up from chair have be just talking about dear if have come for bagatelle must play with lord george for jack de baron be here have come for bagatelle so much better for doubt whether lord george must be very good at have be made to play so much that hate very sound of ball did expect to find here said mary turning to husband till mr houghton said that be coming after there be nothing of interest in conversation jack did not come after few minute lord george proposed to wife that must return home together of course assented a soon a be in brougham made little playful attack upon be becoming fond of berkeley square think mr houghton be friend of mine be fond of friend said gravely oh of course went there to play game with captain de baron did did nothing of kind be not there by appointment told must probably call be to have gone to shop together only seems have changed mind why do tell have gone there to play game with captain de baron bagatelle bagatelle anything else be true have played bagatelle with captain de baron daresay may again why must if so must probably make appointment to play with why not be said what suggested have done be what declare will do have done nothing of kind know very well from tone of voice that meant to scold implied that have done something wrong if have done must be wrong a far a know scolding about when have done at be very hard to bear did scold yes did george understand voice look if mean to forbid to play bagatelle with captain de baron captain anybody else to talk with mr to laugh with major tell so at once if know what want will do must say that will feel very very hard if can not take care of in such matter a if be going to be jealous will wish be dead then burst out cry though must not quite own that have be wrong be forced to do so practically by little act of immediate tenderness chapter xxi marquis come home little time after middle of april when hunting be over mr price have sunk down into summer insignificance there came dozen telegram to manor cross from italy from mr knox from certain managing tradesman in london to say that marquis be coming fortnight sooner than have expected everything be at six seven everything be in ferment everybody about manor cross seemed to think that world be coming to end none of telegram be addressed to of germain family last people in county who heard of homeward rush of marquis be lady at cross hall heard from lord george upon whom mr knox called in london supposing however when did call lord george have already received full information on subject lord george letter to lady sarah be full of dismay full of horror a have not taken trouble to communicate intention to will not go down to receive will know how to deal with matter will be sure support mother in terrible trial think that child must at rate at first be acknowledged by a lord popenjoy have to regard in first place honour of family remissness on part must induce to forget for moment what be due to title property name letter be very long be full of sententious instruction such a above purport of be to tell lady at cross hall that must go through first burden of receiving marquis without assistance from dean heard of reported arrival day before family did so be rumoured in brotherton rumour reached deanery thought that there be nothing that must do on spur of moment perfectly understood condition of lord george mind perceived that must not be expedient for to interfere quite on first moment a soon a marquis must have settled in house of course must call when marquis have settled when world have begun to recognise fact that marquis with italian marchioness little italian so called popenjoy be living at manor cross then if saw way dean must bestir so marquis arrived reached brotherton station with wife baby lady maid nurse valet cook courier about three o'clock in afternoon whole crowd of be carried off in carriage to manor cross great many of inhabitant of brotherton be there to see for coming of marquis have be talked of far wide took notice of gathering people be perhaps unaware that there be gathering wife got into one carriage nurse lady maid baby into second valet courier cook into third world of brotherton saw world of brotherton observed that lady be very old very ugly why on earth must have married woman a then have brought home be exclamation be made by brotherton in general be soon ascertained by one about manor cross that marchioness must not speak word of english must of newly imported servant do so with exception of courier who be supposed to understand language there be therefore absolutely divided household have be thought better that old family housekeeper mr toff must remain in possession through long life have be devoted to old marchioness to lady of family generally must have be useless at new home there be idea manor cross must not be maintained without might also be expedient to have friend in enemy camp other english servant have be provided butler two footman coachman necessary housemaid kitchen maid have be stated that marquis must bring own cook there be therefore at once two party at head of one of be mr toff at head of other courier who remained none of english people knew why for first three day marchioness showed to one be understood that fatigue of journey have oppressed that chose to confine to two three room upstairs have be prepared for mr toff strictly obeying order have come from cross hall sent up duty begged to know whether must wait upon lady lady sent down word that did want to see mr toff message have to be filtered through courier who be specially odious to mr toff lordship be almost a closely secluded a ladyship did indeed go

once saw marchioness baby then english servant must not very well have known what saw what did not see be very certain that during three day did not go to cross hall see one of own family mr toff in

feel sure that there be baby at though john john be one of english servant have seen bundle come into house must be natural right that real child must be carried out to take air then manner of mess be said mr toff prepared up in closed room mr toff did believe in anything except everything be going to perdition marchioness be intent on asking after health appearance of son mr toff declared that have be allowed to catch sight of lord mr toff account be altogether very lachrymose spoke of marquis of course with utmost respect be sufficiently intimate with lady to treat baby mother with scorn of upturned nose be name of popenjoy once heard from lip be lady to do on evening of third day lady sarah wrote to brother george begging to come down to matter be so serious that be said lady sarah bound to lend strength of presence to mother sister on fourth morning lady sarah sent over note to brother marquis dear brotherton hope that wife little boy have arrived well have found thing comfortable mamma be most anxious to see a of course be will not come over to to day dare say sister in law may be too fatigued to come out a yet need not tell that be very anxious to see little popenjoy affectionate sister sarah germain may be seen from that lady contemplated peace if peace be possible in truth nature of letter though not word have be dictated by marchioness be intent upon seeing son anxious to acknowledge grandchild lady sarah have felt position to be very difficult have perceived that temporary acceptance by of child must at injure brother george claim must lord

because have disobeyed order order said lady sarah in scorn almost in wrath against mother what right have to give order to have forgotten be only worthy to be forgotten just a spoke manor cross phaeton with manor cross pony be driven up to door lady amelia who went to window declared that brotherton be in carriage oh son darling son said marchioness throwing up arm really be marquis seemed to lady to be very long time indeed before got into room so leisurely be in divesting of fur comforter during time marchioness must have rushed into hall have not lady sarah prevented old lady be

to make man blow brain out lady sarah must not stand did think right to put up with insolence of manner generally if so said be pity that came away from italy turned sharply round looked at for instant before answered a did so remembered peculiar tyranny of eye tyranny to when boy have ever endeavoured to make subject others around others have become subject because be lord popenjoy of day must be future marquis though recognising right to be first in thing have ever rebelled against usurpation of unauthorized power too remembered almost snarled at with eye suppose might stay if liked

by hinting that though dean might think very fine thing to have daughter married into family of marquis marquis probably must not look at in same light yet what be truth whence have come money have made marriage possible in bargain between party have have best of be conscious that must not become to allude to money feeling on subject be very strong lord said know that there be anything to be gained by sitting down again perhaps not dare say know best came here intent on what considered to be courtesy due to lordship be sorry visit have be mistaken see that there be anything to make fuss about will not be repeated lord so left room why on earth have man come back to england bringing foreign woman italian brat home with if intended to make place too hot to hold by insulting everybody

learning be impression what intention of lady there did madman mean to quarrel with mother sister a well a with other neighbour did not a yet know what intercourse there have be between two house since marquis have be at manor cross in going to cross hall in midst of trouble be doubt actuated in part by determination to show to be one of family if must accept aid one must be more loyal than to

such birth dread of evil mystery have filled thought shown in word look to other though have be very anxious to keep from mother something have crept through have revealed suspicion of suspicion even to dear old lady have resolved upon line of conduct in matter have conceived project of rebelling against eldest daughter of being untrue to youngest son now that be alone with eldest son with real undoubted marquis with who must certainly be to more than world beside if must only allow there did come into head idea that must put on guard because because because what speak out mother because perhaps will say that what will say if see may think be popenjoy at oh will think will how will seeing help must be so nice to have here if be only for little said marchioness so be said after long pause be george game dean can understand not george said unhappy mother sarah dare say be in boat with wonder that must choose to remain here watch be sure george have never thought of such thing

sure of one ally in house chapter xxiii marquis see brother when lord george be summoned down to manor cross rather to cross hall did not dare not to go lady sarah have told that be duty must not deny assertion be very angry with brother did not in least wish to see did think that by seeing must in degree render easier horrible task must sooner later be imposed upon of testing legitimacy of brother child there be other reason made unwilling to leave london did not like to be away from young wife be of course matron now entitled to be left alone according to law of world then be so childish so fond of playing bagatelle with jack de baron have never have occasion to find fault with not to say word to must regard a fault finding word though have complained more than once of scolding must caution beg to be grave ask to read heavy book try to impress with solemnity of married life in way must quell spirit for few hour then must burst out again there must be jack de baron bagatelle in sorrow solaced by asking advice from mr houghton by degree told mr houghton almost everything reader may remember that there have be moment in have resolved that must not again go to berkeley square

condition that younger of three sister must be invited letter be of course written to lady sarah such letter always be written to lady sarah lady sarah have answered saying that susanna must take place destined for amelia now susanna of germain family be one whom mary disliked most there be help for thought hard be not strong enough in own position to say that must not have susanna because

marquis lord said only laughed at bers toff ' have said 'you be mother servant sister have better go live with ' have then hinted at shortness of notice given upon have offered anything chose to ask in way of wage board wage must take penny lady only just what be due up to very day a mr toff be great deal too old servant to be really turned away a merely migrated from manor cross to cross hall did not injure much by refusing offer made to must be held that marquis be justified in getting rid of mr toff mr toff be in truth spy in camp of course own people be soon aware of fact almost daily journey to cross hall be known be remembered by marquis wife that old woman who have never be allowed to see child who have known preceding generation a child must not be enemy of course be patent to servant to one connected with two house that there be war of course marquis having old woman acting spy in stronghold got rid of justice must shortly have required that other old woman who be acting

work lord george reached cross hall have driven through park way being nearly a short a high road have left word at house that must call on following morning immediately after morning church did in consequence of resolution have made to act on own judgment terrible crisis be coming in must not be becoming that must submit to eldest sister to dean have talked matter over fully with mr houghton mr

sent even message must have be here of course said brother passed through london must have met there have not kept everything concealed be like anybody else know must quarrel with be head of family if quarrel with will become of will become of if everybody fall off from be what be thinking of said lady sarah soon after horror have taken place horror must not be entrusted to letter be narrated marquis have insulted dr pountner have not returned bishop visit have treated dean with violent insolence have refused to receive brother in law mr holdenough though holdenoughs have always moved in county society have declared that none of relative be to be introduced to wife have not a yet allowed so called popenjoy to be seen have said none of be to trouble at manor cross have explained purpose of only coming to hall when knew that sister sarah be away think must be mad said younger brother be what come of living in godless country like italy said lady amelia be what come of utterly disregarding duty said lady sarah what be to be done marquis have declared purpose of doing what liked with own certainly none of must hinder if chose to shut wife up at big house must do so be very bad be clear that must not interfere with eccentricity how be anybody to interfere of course there be present in mind of of feeling that woman might not be wife that child might not be legitimate did not like with open word among to accuse brother of so great crime see what there be to be done said lord george church be in park not very far from house nearer to gate leading to brotherton on sunday

into brother room seem to be in deuce of hurry george said marquis without getting out of chair forget that people get up at same hour world over be half past two now very likely know that there be law to make man dress before hour servant might have given message make row now be here old fellow when found be in house got down a fast a must suppose time be so very precious lord george have come there determined not to quarrel if must help have very nearly quarrelled already word that brother said be in truth insult being a be first word spoken after so long interval be intended to be insolent probably intended to drive away if anything be to be gained by interview must not allow to be driven away have duty to perform great duty be last man in england to suspect fictitious heir must at rate be last to hint at iniquity without strongest ground who be to be true to brother if not brother who be to support honour of great family if not own scion who be to abstain from wasting wealth honour of if not who have nearest chance of possessing yet who must be so manifestly bound a to take care that surreptitious head be imposed upon family little child be real popenjoy boy to be held by a of boy most sacred to promotion of whose welfare own energy must be due else brat so abnormously distasteful abominable a to demand from undying enmity till child wicked pretension must be laid at rest there be something very serious in very tragic something demanded that must lay aside common anger put up with many insult on behalf of cause have in hand of course must wait said only thought that perhaps man must have told fact be george be rather divided house here of talk italian english be only common interpreter in house find bore dare say be troublesome what can do for now be here do for lord george did want brother to do anything for live decently like english nobleman outrage family must have be only true answer must have made to such question thought must wish to see after return said be rather lately thought of however let that pas so have got wife for a have done also just so have got wife too mine have come from one of oldest noblest family in christendom mine be granddaughter of livery stable keeper said lord george with touch of real grandeur thank god can be proud of in society in england dare say particularly a have money yes have money must hardly have married without when see think will not be ashamed of a sister in law ah life in london be just at present down here be daughter of dean of brotherton so have heard used to make gentleman dean after there be pause lord george finding difficult to go on with conversation without quarrel to tell truth george will not willingly see anything more of dean came here insulted got up blustered about room because must thank for honour have done family by alliance if please george will understand that le said about dean better see have of money out of stable yard wife money did come out of stable yard came from wax chandler shop said lord george jumping up just a dean have done there be something in man manner worse even than word found almost impossible to bear seated again a brother sat looking at with bitter smile upon face suppose said can wish to annoy certainly not wish that truth must be understood between be to be allowed to pay respect to wife said lord george boldly think know that have gone so far apart in marriage that there be nothing to be gained by besides must speak to to may be permitted to see popenjoy marquis paused moment then rang bell know what good will do if can be made fit will be brought down courier entered room received certain order in italian after there be considerable delay during italian servant brought marquis cup of chocolate cake pushed newspaper over to brother a be drinking chocolate lighted cigarette in way there be delay of over hour then there entered room italian nurse with little boy who seemed to lord george to be nearly two year old child be carried in by woman lord george thought that be big enough to have walked be dressed up with many ribbon be altogether a gay a apparel must make be ugly swarthy little boy with great black eye small cheek high forehead very unlike popenjoy a lord george must have liked to have seen lord george got up stood over leaning down kissed high forehead poor little darling said a for being poor said marquis hope not a to being darling must think doubtful if have done with can take away know lord george have done with so be taken away seeing be believing know said marquis be only good of lord george said to that in case seeing be not believing at moment open carriage came round to door if like to get up behind said marquis can take back to cross hall a be going to see mother perhaps will remember wish to be alone with lord george then expressed preference for walking just a please want to say word of course took very ill of when insisted on keeping cross hall in opposition to wish doubt acted on advice partly so exactly sarah ca expect to forget george be then walked out of room among servant giving brother opportunity for further reply chapter xxiv marquis go into brotherton poor dear old marchioness must have have feeling that be regarded a spy have promised to tell everything to eldest son though have really nothing to tell though marquis did in truth know that there be a yet to know still there grew up at cross hall sort of severance between unhappy old lady child showed in diminution of affectionate attention in intentional change of manner there be reticence about marquis popenjoy even perceived there crept into mind feeling mr toff be on guard against so that on two occasion almost snubbed mr toff never see 'd lady what more can say said mr toff toff believe wanted to see master son heir said marchioness then mr toff pursed up lip compressed nose half closed eye marchioness be sure that mr toff did not believe in popenjoy one lord george have seen popenjoy to eye have august baby be displayed of course many question have be asked especially by old lady answer to have not be satisfactory dark be asked marchioness lord george replied that child be very swarthy dear be like germains germains be never light be not swarthy did talk at not word did play about never be out of nurse arm dear be like brotherton think be judge of likeness be healthy child ca say seemed to be good deal done up with finery then marchioness declared that younger son showed unnatural indifference to heir of family be manifest that intended to accept new popenjoy to ally with party base enough to entertain suspicion examination respecting baby went on for three first day of week be lord george intention to return to town on saturday seemed to to be necessary that something must be arranged before lady sarah thought that direct application must be made to brother for proof of marriage for copy of register of birth of child quite admitted that must resent such application with bitterest enmity that thought must be endured argued that nothing must be done more friendly to child than if be right enquiry circumstance certainly demanded must be made while must not feel if such proof be adduced now there must certainly be trouble misery perhaps ruin in coming year if necessary evidence be forthcoming then one must wish to interfere further there might be ill blood on brother part there must be none on lord george younger sister gainsayed altogether neither of denied necessity of enquiry desired to temporise then how be enquiry to be made who be to bell cat how must go on when marquis refused to take heed of a of course must do lady sarah saw at once that must employ lawyer what lawyer old mr stokes family attorney be only lawyer knew mr stokes be lord brotherton lawyer must hardly consent to be employed against own client lady sarah suggested that mr stokes might be induced to explain to marquis that enquiry must be made for marquis own benefit lord george felt that be impossible be evident that lord george must be afraid to ask mr stokes to undertake work at last came to be understood among that must have friend to act with there must be doubt who that friend must be a to interfering said lady sarah speaking of dean will interfere whether ask to not daughter be a much affected a anybody if understand be not man to see interest of own injured by want of care lord george shook head yielded greatly disliked idea of putting into dean hand of becoming creature of dean felt dean to be stronger than endowed with higher spirit more confident hope also felt that dean be son of stable keeper though have professed to brother that must own fact without shame still be ashamed be not dean parentage troubled so much a consciousness of defect perhaps only of absence of quality have be caused by parentage man looked like gentleman still there be smell of stable feeling rather than knowing lord george resisted for awhile idea of joining force with dean when be suggested to a alternative that must go to mr stokes explain suspicion in lawyer room then agreed that a first step must consult dean dean doubt must have own lawyer who must not care fig for marquis be thought by at cross hall that dean must come over to knowing that son in law be in country dean did not come probably waiting for same compliment from lord george on friday lord george rode into brotherton early be at deanery by eleven o'clock thought must see said dean in pleasantest manner of course heard from mary that be down here well what do think of be not pleasant if mean brother be bound to say that be very unpleasant of course have seen yes have seen ladyship said that a speak italian must be no good seemed to think said dean that a do speak italian must be dangerous nobody have seen then nobody that promise well little lord be brought down to that be gracious well what of did look like popenjoy be nasty little black thing must wonder look well want to abuse poor child god know if be what pretend to be must do anything to serve be just george said dean very seriously seriously with kindest manner being quite disposed to make agreeable to lord george if lord george must be agreeable to be just if be certified a to what must not do for child in spite of father brutality there be dishonesty on side george know of know of that if tittle of evidence of child birth be in keeping of of so that must be destroyed on moment must be made a public a wind of heaven to morrow so that be true evidence if be what pretend to be who must interfere with if be not suspicion of kind be unworthy of except on very strong ground true if there be very strong ground be equally true that such suspicion be duty look at case when be that told that be going to be married about six month since a far a memory go said ' be to be married be speaking in future tense now claim to have be married two three year ago have ever attempted to explain have not said word about be quite unwilling to talk about dare say man in such circumstance must be made to talk about be so placed that if did not make talk about ought to be made to make do so may be deceitful if plea may tell fib without end may give much trouble by doing so such trouble be evil consequence of having liar in world lord george winced at rough word a applied by inference to own brother liar be always troubled by own lie if chooses to tell that on certain day be about to be married afterwards spring two year old child upon a legitimate be bound to think that there be deceit can not keep from knowing that there be falsehood if falsehood then probably fraud be likely that man with such privilege such property insured to legitimate son must allow birth of such child to be slurred over without due notice of say that suspicion on part without strong ground must be unworthy of agree with ask whether ground be not so strong a to force to suspect come continued a lord george did not answer at once let be open to other knowing a doe that other mean to do what be right suspect do said lord george so do mean to learn truth how be for to consider of one thing be quite sure be quite certain that must not allow ourselves to be afraid of brother to speak truth a must be spoken be bully george must rather must not abuse sir speak ill of must character be bad have to speak of be bully set to work to put down when did honour to call on because felt that connexion with must probably make enemy to intend that will know that can not put down be undoubtedly lord brotherton be owner of wide property have many privilege much power with can not interfere there be limit to if have legitimate son privilege will be that son property have to show to world that son be legitimate when man marries before world in own house child be born to a may say openly proof be there of bringing up of evidence be necessary thing be simple there be suspicion enquiry have done reverse of now flatters that can cow who be concerned by domineering manner must be made to feel that will not prevail sarah think that must be invited to produce necessary certificate lord george when dropped sister title in speaking of to dean must have determined very familiar intercourse with dean be necessity lady sarah be always right must be first step will invite to do so how will matter be broken to think lawyer must do must be done by by lawyer lord george looked very blank of course if matter be left in hand if have to do must not do personally question be whether might not in first instance write to must not notice very likely not then must employ lawyer matter be altogether so distasteful to lord george that more than once during interview almost made up mind that must withdraw altogether from work at rate appear to take for granted that child be real heir undoubted popenjoy then a often dean showed that must not so withdraw will be driven said dean to express belief whatever may be if think that there have be foul play can not deny that think so be at last decided that lord george must write letter to brother giving ground not of own suspicion world at large must have for suspecting earnestly imploring that proper evidence a to brother marriage a to child birth might be produced then if letter must not be attended to lawyer must be employed dean named own lawyer mr battle of lincoln inn field lord george having once yielded found convenient to yield throughout towards end of interview dean suggested that must throw few word together in other

lady susanna winced visibly when jack told lady george that be woman to do lady susanna shivered almost audibly be anything matter asked lady george perhaps not quite innocently seemed to lady susanna that visitor be never going away yet be very man a to whom brother have cautioned what odious man be in lady susanna estimation puppy absolute puppy good looking impudent familiar with light visage continually smiling little gift made so pleasant to lady george be stain blemish in eye of lady susanna to thinking man at rate gentleman must be tall dark grave given to silence rather than to much

george gaily daresay will win back to day will come susanna certainly not said lady susanna very grimly looked at jack de baron raised eyebrow sat for moment motionless lady susanna knew that jack de

lady susanna have rather not go why not asked mary think that playing bagatelle for new hat be be best employment in world either for lady for gentleman word be hardly out of mouth before felt that be

learned to speak out before be married went out together to walk across park to berkeley square order being left that brougham must follow later in afternoon lady susanna have at last resolved that also must go very fact of entering mr houghton house be disagreeable to felt that duty called after when got to berkeley square bagatelle be played at bagatelle must almost have be better than what occurred small parcel be lying on table be found to contain pack of pictured card made for telling of fortune acquaintance have sent to mr houghton with began telling other fortune seemed to lady susanna that be a free with lover sweetheart a though two lady have be housemaid instead of being wife of steady well born husband be dark man with evil design wicked tongue money said mr houghton a combination of card lay in lady george lap jack lady with light hair be only flirting with doe care for one bit daresay not said jack yet will trouble awfully lady susanna will have fortune told said

of too quickly a will soon find in meantime a be married woman must not be careful to guard against indiscretion of youth well yes suppose ought said mary after moment of mock consideration then if be unmarried ought to do just same be kind of thing be matter of course without talking about have firmly made up mind that must submit in degree to lady susanna take from scolding indeed have come to firm resolve long since that must be scolded by one husband by a little a possible now be angry with because have sent woman to watch be determined that must know that though must submit to must not submit to sister moment for asserting have now come young married woman said duenna owes to husband to be peculiarly careful have happiness honour in hand have hers seems to that thing be matter of course must be certainly said lady susanna hardly knowing how to go on with work little afraid of companion still very intent will sometimes happen that young person doe not quite know what be right what be wrong sometimes happens that old people know there be major jones have wife taken away from other day by court because be always beating be fifty read about in paper think old people be just a bad a young lady susanna felt that approach be being cut off from that must rush at once against citadel if meant to take do think that playing bagatelle be nice yes do very nice do think george must like playing with captain de baron why not with captain de baron said mary turning round upon assailant with absolute ferocity think must like then that fortune telling if will believe mary be very improper will not believe anything of kind improper joke about lot of picture card be about love lover said lady susanna not quite knowing how to express still sure that be right oh what mind must have susanna to pick wrong out of that about love lover so be book song play at theatre suppose did understand that be intended a burlesque on fortune telling be quite sure george must like kind of slang be talking with captain de baron at lunch if george doe not like anything have better tell so not depute to do for if tell to do anything will do if tell will pay attention to be here a guest not a governess think interference very impertinent be strong language so strong that lady susanna found impossible to continue conversation at moment nothing indeed be said between during whole afternoon at dinner in evening till lady susanna have taken up candlestick there have be that most clearly declared of war be shown by absolute silence lady susanna a be retiring to rest thought might be wise to make little effort after peace did not at mean to go back from what charge have made have idea of owning to be wrong perhaps must throw little oil upon water of course said must not have spoken a have done for great love for george regard for a far a be concerned think mistaken regard said mary of course will tell george even to will say will not endure authority own will hear not on subject have accused of behaving improperly with man do think began lady susanna not knowing how to pick word in emergency fearing to be too strong at same time conscious that weakness must be folly do think that anything like like like flirting be so very bad susanna said lady george with start a heard odious word a far a can help will never speak to again there certainly have be oil thrown upon water a yet next day be passed almost in absolute silence be friday of knew that lord george must be home on morrow interval be so short that nothing must be gained by writing to have own story to tell must wait till must be there to hear mary with most distant civility went through work of hostess lady susanna made one two little effort to subdue failing soon gave up endeavour in afternoon aunt ju called with niece conversation did not lessen breach then lady susanna went out alone in brougham have be arranged beforehand ate dinner in silence in silence read book met in silence at breakfast table at three o'clock lord george came home then mary running downstairs took with into drawing room there be one embrace then began george said must never have susanna here again why said have insulted have said thing so nasty that can not repeat even to have accused to face of flirting wo bear from if said must kill of course can say what please will not scold tell that be that because be not a solemn a be george do believe have ever flirted be so impetuous that have be quite unable to stop did mean that must behave to like be very bad said what be very bad be not bad that must say such thing to a be going to take part against dearest mary seem to be excited of course be excited must wish to have such thing a said to not to be excited be not going to take part against have not heard yet will believe against will be able to make believe have flirted if so then be over what be over oh george why did marry if can not trust who say that trust suppose truth be have be little flighty be what suppose mean same thing have talked laughed be amused if mean being flighty think wicked to laugh call slang if word doe come out of grammar have better go hear since will say nothing more to lord george thought so too stayed for few moment in dining room during stooped over wife who have thrown into arm chair kissed a did so merely shook head made response to caress then slowly strode away went up stair into drawing room what took place there need not be recorded at length lady susanna did not try to be mischievous spoke much of mary youth expressed strong opinion that captain de baron be not fit companion for be very urgent against use of slang said almost harder thing of mr houghton than did of jack never have meant to imply mary have allowed improper attention from gentleman that mary being young have not known what attention be proper what improper to lady whole matter be so serious that altogether dropped personal quarrel of course george said young people like to be told have to be done must say that mary like a little a person have ever known multiplicity of trouble falling together on to poor man back almost crushed have returned to town full of terrible letter have pledged to write letter be already driven out of head for time be essentially necessary that must compose domestic trouble of course returned to wife equally of course after little time prevailed have to tell that be sure that never flirted have to say that did not talk slang have to protest that fortune telling card be absolutely innocent then condescended to say that must for present be civil to susanna even while saying that protested that must never again have sister in law a guest in house know george even yet that said to in what sort of way behaved chapter xxvi dean return to town do mean to say that have objection to being acquainted with captain de baron question mary asked husband on monday after return on day lady susanna went back to brothershire having somewhat hurried return in consequence of uncomfortable state of thing in minister court have gone to church together on intermediate sunday lady susanna have done best to conciliate sister in law be ignorant of world did not know how bitter to young married woman be such interference a of have be guilty must not understand amount of offence be rankling in mary bosom have not consisted only in word spoken look in man presence have conveyed same accusation so that must be seen understood by man mary with effort have gone on with play determined that one must suppose to be cowed by grand sister in law through have resolved always to look upon lady susanna a enemy have already abandoned threat of not speaking to own guest nothing that lady susanna must say nothing that lord george must say softened heart in least woman have told that be flirt have declared that what did said be improper woman have come there a spy woman must never be friend in circumstance lord george found impossible not to refer to unfortunate subject again in doing so caused above question to be asked do mean to say that have objection to being acquainted with captain de baron looked at with so much eagerness in eye a spoke that knew that much at rate of present comfort might depend on answer made certainly did object to being acquainted with jack de baron did not at like jack de baron in spite of what have found obliged to say in order that might be comforted on first arrival did not like slang did not like fortune telling card bagatelle sympathy in matter be with sister did like spending own time with mr houghton be dreadful to to think that wife must be spending hers with jack de baron nevertheless must not tell so no said have particular objection of course if have must never see again must be very dreadful must have to be told that be jealous be not in least jealous said angrily must not use such word certainly must not have used for disturbance sister have caused after that have said there must be understanding like captain de baron very much a dare say like other lady why not have never suspected anything susanna did of course like george like have be so miserable have almost cried eye out if people will make mischief what be one to do only thing be not to have mischief maker more worst of be to that be so manifestly getting better of when have married not yet nine month since have be little girl altogether in hand not pretending to self action anxious to be guided in everything by only fear have be that might be too slow in learning that self assertion be necessary from married woman to world at large now have made very great progress in lesson not only a regarded world at large a regarded also a for family grandeur of family clearly have reverence for lady susanna though generally held to be very awful have be no more to than other susan almost wished that have told that did object to jack de baron there must have be scene of course not improbably might have told father that at present must have be doubly disagreeable a be incumbent upon to stand well with dean just at time there be battle to be fought with brother felt that must not fight without dean having given sanction to jack de baron went away to club to write letter writing really amounted to more than copying dean word have carried in pocket ever since have left deanery dean word be a follows munster court th april dear brotherton be compelled to write to under very disagreeable circumstance to do so on subject must willingly avoid if sense of duty must permit to be silent will remember that wrote to in october last telling that be about to be married ' be to be married to marchesa luigi ' be word up to moment have heard nothing of lady of arrangement a to marriage when told of own intended marriage few month before merely said in answer that might probably soon want house at manor cross now seems that when told of intended marriage have already be married over two year that when told of mine have son over twelve month old fact might certainly expect that must communicate to at time beg to assure that be now urged to write by suspicion of own know that if thing be left to go on a be now suspicion will arise at future time write altogether in interest of son heir for sake beseech to put at once into hand of own lawyer absolute evidence of date of marriage of legality of birth of son will also be expedient that lawyer will see evidence in lawyer hand if be to die a matter be now must be imperative on to take step must seem to be hostile to popenjoy interest think must yourself feel that must be so yet nothing must be further from wish if be to die difficulty must be still greater a in case proceeding must have to be taken by more distant member of family trust will believe when say that only object be to have matter satisfactorily settled affectionate brother george germain when marquis received letter be not in least astonished by lord george have told sister sarah that be to be written have even discussed with dean word lady sarah have thought that a dean be sagacious man exact word have better be used then lady amelia have be told lady amelia having asked various question on subject lady amelia have of course known that brother must discus matter with dean have begged that might not be treated a stranger everything have not be told to lady amelia have lady amelia told that have heard to mother marchioness have known enough have communicated enough to son to save from great astonishment when got brother letter of course have known that step must be taken answered letter at once dear brother said think necessary to let know reason induced to keep marriage private awhile rush at conclusion very fast in thinking that because marriage be private therefore be illegal be glad that have suspicion of own beg to assure care whether have not whenever anybody else may want to try case will find have taken care that there be plenty of evidence did know that have lawyer only hope wo run into much expense in finding mare nest yours truly b be not in satisfactory such a be did for time make lord george believe that popenjoy be popenjoy be certainly true of that wished popenjoy to be popenjoy personal longing for title property made in heart disloyal to brother family then trouble expense anxiety of such contest be so terrible to imagination that rejoiced when thought that might be avoided there be dean dean must be satisfied a well a felt that dean must not be satisfied according to agreement sent copy of brother letter down to dean added assurance of own belief that marriage have be marriage that heir be heir that further step must be useless need hardly be said that dean be not satisfied before dinner on following day dean be in minister court oh papa exclaimed mary be so glad to see must be anything about captain de baron have brought up if so of course must tell everything what brought up so suddenly why did write george be at club suppose george be really in berkeley square at moment oh yes will be home to dinner be there anything wrong at manor cross papa father be so pleasant in manner to that perceived at once that have not come up in reference to captain de baron complaint of behaviour on score have a yet reached where be portmanteau papa have got bed at hotel in suffolk street will only be here one night at most two a have to come suddenly must trouble oh papa be very bad of said with genuine tone begets confidence dean be very anxious that daughter must in truth be fond of company in game intended to play co operation influence over husband must be very necessary to must be lovelace rather than germain till must blaze forth a presiding genius of germain family that lord george must become tired of little afraid of knew must not be avoided to must if possible be pleasant genius never accompanied in mind by idea of parental severity clerical heaviness must weary out if came too often came so suddenly said laughing have brought papa marquis dear who seems to will for time to come have considerable influence on doings marquis have made up mind that must know everything if husband did not tell must yes marquis perhaps ought to say marchioness only that be unwilling to give title to lady who think very probably have no right to be that coming up already longer be postponed greater will be trouble to party can not be endured that man in position must tell that son be legitimate when son be born more than year before have declared about to marry that must then refuse to furnish with evidence have asked mary a made suggestion be horror stricken at awfulness of occasion george have asked have marquis done sent back jeering reply have way of jeering think will carry everything before when called upon jeered at will have to learn that can not jeer out of right wish must not think about right papa right will probably be right of one else know papa still have to be done george quite agrees with letter did write to brother be arranged between lady sarah be quite of same accord lady susanna oh papa do so hate susanna said with eloquence daresay can make unpleasant have told george that will not come here again a guest what did do can not bring to tell what be that said told george of course be nasty evil minded creature suspecting everything hope there have be nothing disagreeable be very disagreeable indeed while george be away of course did not care so much when came back dean who have be almost frightened be reassured when learned that there have be no quarrel between husband wife soon afterwards lord george came in be astonished to find that letter have brought up dean so quickly discussion took place till after dinner then dean be very perspicuous at same time very authoritative be in vain that lord george asked what must do declared that evil trouble must probably arise must rest on brother head must prevent such trouble let rest where will said dean see what can do do because be not lawyer lawyer will tell at once will probably be duty to send commissioner out to italy to make enquiry must like to do about brother of course brother must be told rather everything must be told to brother lawyer so that might be advised what step ought to take must hing secretly nothing of one must say that ought to be ashamed dean proposed that must go to attorney mr battle on following day step seemed to lord george to be such absolute declaration of war that begged for day delay be at last arranged that must on intervening day call on mr stokes germain family lawyer marquis with one of jeer have told brother that being younger brother be not entitled to have lawyer in truth lord george have have very much more to do with mr stokes than marquis concern of family have be managed by mr stokes marquis probably meant to insinuate that family bill be made out perhaps once three year be charged against account lord george did call on mr stokes found mr stokes very little disposed to give opinion mr stokes be honest man who disliked trouble of kind freely admitted that there be ground for enquiry did not think that be man who ought to make must certainly communicate with marquis must lord george think expedient to employ other lawyer must lawyer apply to in meantime thought that immediate enquiry must be little precipitate marquis might probably take step to put matter on proper footing be civil gracious almost subservient have comfort to give advice to offer like attorney be in favour of delay of course lord george must remember that be brother lawyer may in matter be called upon to act a confidential adviser lord george repeated that evening to dean dean merely said that have be matter of course early on next morning dean lord george went together to mr battle chamber lord george felt that be being driven by father in law felt also that must not help mr battle who have chamber in lincoln inn be very different man from mr stokes who carried on business in private house at west end who prepared will marriage settlement for gentlefolk who have in fact very little to do with law mr battle be enterprising man with whom dean first acquaintance have arisen through tallowaxes stable interest very clever man perhaps little sharp attorney ought to be sharp be not to be understood that mr battle descended to sharp practise be solicitor with whom old fashioned mr stokes must not find in accord be handsome burly man nearly sixty year of age with grey hair clean shorn face with bright green eye well formed nose mouth prepossessing man till something restless about eye must at last catch attention little change judgment dean told whole story during telling sat looking very pleasant with smile on face rubbing two hand together point be made letter of marquis in told brother that be to be married be shown to concealment of birth of boy till father have made up mind to come home be urged absurdity of behaviour since have be at home be described singularity of conduct in allowing none of family to become acquainted with wife be pointed out be done by dean rather than by lord george lord george a heard almost regarded dean a enemy at last burst out in own defence of course will understand mr battle that only object be to have thing proved so that hereafter there may be trouble just so lord want to oppose brother to injure child want to get at truth said dean just so where there be concealment there must be suspicion urged dean doubt everything must be done quite openly said lord george must not have step taken without knowledge of mr stokes if mr stokes must do on brother behalf must be so much better be hardly probable said dean not at probable said mr battle must be party to adverse suit said lord george there be ground for suit at said lawyer can not bring action against marquis because chooses to call lady life with marchioness because call infant lord popenjoy brother conduct may be ill judged from what tell think be be not criminal then nothing need be done said lord george great deal may be done enquiry may be made now might hereafter be impossible then begged that might have week to consider matter requested that two gentleman must call upon again chapter xxvii baroness banmann again day two after meeting at mr battle office there came to lord george letter from gentleman suggesting that a dean have undertaken to come up to london again a mr battle might not be ready with advice at end of week that day fortnight might be fixed to lord george delay be agreeable rather than otherwise a be not specially anxious for return of father in law be longing for action in question a to brother heir dean when lawyer letter reached be certain that mr battle did not mean to lose time simply in thinking over matter preliminary enquiry must now be made even though positive instruction have be given did not at regret be sure that lord george must be very angry if knew wrote back to say that must be in munster court on evening before day appointed be now may london be bright with exotic gaiety of season park be crowded with rider at one be almost impassable at six dress be outvying dress equipage equipage men woman principally woman seemed to be intent on finding out new way of scattering money tradesman doubt knew much of defaulter head of family might find pressed for mean to outside west end eye looking at outside west end world seemed a though wealth be unlimited money drug to who have known thing for year to young lady who be now entering on seventh eighth campaign there be feeling of business about though buoyed up by excitement robbed amusement of most of pleasure ball can not be very agreeable in may not dance with man like be not asked by man want at be forced to make note that full blown hope be futile that little bud will surely never come to flower then toil of smile pretence at flirtation long continued assumption of fictitious character making of bright to bright solemn to solemn romantic to romantic be work too hard for enjoyment heroine have such work to do be very much admired must thoroughly enjoy admiration have task to perform be not carrying out profession by midnight labour who will say whether now again soft impalpable regret regret not recognised a such may not have stolen across mind telling that if have seen before be married instead of afterwards might have found brighter lot for if be so only enduring effect of feeling be renewal of oft made resolution that must be in love with husband lady whom knew have generally carriage riding horse have only brougham have kept for by generosity of father dean when coming to town have brought with horse used to ride wished that must remain lord george with husband solicitude perhaps with something of poor man proper dislike to expensive habit have refused permission soon too learned to know true sheen of diamond luxury of pearl richness of ruby whereas wore only little ornament have come from deanery a danced in spacious room dined in noble hall be feted on grand staircase remembered what little place be little house in munster court that be to stay there only for few week more before be taken to heavy dulness of cross hall still always came back to old resolution be so flattered so courted so petted made much of that must not feel have world be opened to sooner destiny must probably have be different then might have be different very much le happy still told that be sure that lord george be that ought to be two three thing did tease certainly be very fond of ball soon found that lord george disliked a much when present be always anxious to get home be married woman be open to to go alone that did not like must allow sometimes joined to other party mr houghton be always ready to be companion old mr montacute jones who went everywhere have taken great liking to there be two antagonistic force husband of course have to yield to stronger force thing might be managed occasionally occasion be doubt much pleasanter because have to be so managed there be always feeling that bright glimpse of paradise entrance into elysium be not free to a to other lady then one day rather one night there came great sorrow sorrow robbed terrestrial paradise of brightness more than joy one evening told that did not like to waltz why innocently asked be in brougham going home have be supremely happy at mr montacute jones house lord george said that must hardly explain reason made rather long speech in asked whether be not aware that many married woman did not waltz said be of course when get old be sure said that when say like will be enough quite enough answered to prevent doing though not enough to satisfy why must not be done said more to on occasion so matter be considered to be settled then remembered that very last waltz have be with jack de baron must be that be jealous be well aware that took great delight in waltzing with captain de baron because waltzed so well now that pleasure be over for ever be that husband disliked waltzing that disliked jack de baron few day after lady george be surprised by visit from baroness banmann lady whom have be taken to hear at disability since memorable evening have seen aunt ju more than once have asked how cause of female architect be progressing have never again met baroness aunt ju have apparently be disturbed by question have made further effort to make lady george proselyte by renewed attendance at right of woman institute have seemed almost anxious to avoid subject a lady george acquaintance with baroness have be owing altogether to aunt ju be now surprised that german lady must call upon german lady began story with great impetuosity with so much impetuosity that poor mary must not understand half be said to did learn that baroness have in own estimation be very ill treated that ill treatment have come mainly from hand of aunt ju lady selina protest appeared at length that baroness claimed to have be brought over from bavaria with promise that must have exclusive privilege of using hall of disability on certain evening that privilege be now denied to disability seemed to prefer younger rival miss doctor olivia q fleabody whom mary now learned to be person of good repute by mean fit to address mass of marylebone what did baroness want of what with female lecturer lack of english pronunciation what with impetuosity with mary own innocence on matter be time before younger lady did understand what elder lady required at last eight ticket be brought out of pocket on looking at mary began to understand that baroness have established rival disability very near other in lisson grove then at last very gradually further understood that be front row ticket be supposed to be worth s d be not till after till further explanation have be made must feared have be very painful to baroness that began to perceive that be expected to pay for eight ticket on moment have sovereign in pocket be quite willing to sacrifice hardly knew how to hand coin bodily to baroness when did do so baroness very well knew how to put into pocket vill like to keep entire eight asked baroness mary thought that four might perhaps suffice for own want whereupon baroness re pocketed four of course did not return change even then baroness have not completed task aunt ju have evidently be false treacherous might still be won back to loyal honesty so much mary gradually perceived to be drift of lady mind lady selina be hopeless lady selina whom baroness intended to drag before judge in england must hing fair honest aunt ju might yet be won must lady george go with baroness to aunt servant have unfortunately just announced brougham a being at door ah said baroness vould be ten minute vould be salvation lady george did not at want to go to house in green street have great desire to push acquaintance with aunt ju particularly disliked younger miss mildmay felt that have business to interfere in matter there be nothing requires so much experience to attain a power of refusing almost before have made up mind whether must refuse not baroness be in brougham with coachman have be desired to take to green street throughout whole distance baroness be voluble unintelligible lady george must hear name of selina protest olivia q fleabody through thunder of lady loud complaint yes miss mildmay be at home lady george gave name to servant also especially requested that baroness banmann might be first announced have thought over in brougham have determined that if possible must appear that baroness have brought twice repeated name to servant when reached drawing room only younger miss mildmay be present sent servant to aunt received two visitor very demurely with baroness of whom probably have heard quite enough have sympathy with lady george have own special ground of quarrel five six very long minute passed during little nothing be said baroness did not wish to expend eloquence on unprofitable young lady lady george must find subject for small talk at last door be opened servant invited baroness to go downstairs baroness have perhaps be unfortunate for at very time lady selina protest be down in dining room discussing affair of institute with aunt ju there be little difficulty in making lady understand be required of after while did follow servant down to dining room lady george a soon a door be closed felt that blood rushed to face be conscious at moment captain de baron have be girl lover that there be who said that be because of that have deserted girl girl have already said word to on subject have be very hard to bear have constantly told that in matter be quite innocent that friendship with jack be simple pure friendship that liked because laughed talked treated world lightly that rarely saw except in presence of cousin that everything be a ought to be yet when found alone with miss mildmay be suffused with blush uneasy felt that ought to make excuse for visit hope said that aunt will understand brought lady here only because insisted on being brought miss mildmay bowed came to really must quite understand what have to say brougham be there must get into be afraid there have be quarrel think that matter at said miss mildmay only aunt might

if interfere with be falsehood said lady george who be now standing have lover be wicked falsehood care nothing for wickedness falseness either will promise if hold tongue that will have nothing further to say to captain de baron will promise nothing must be ashamed of to make such promise then will go to lord george want to make mischief be not going to be treated in way how must like when tell that man be engaged to why can not leave alone do leave alone said mary stamping foot do everything can to cheat of will tell lord george may tell whom like said mary rushing to bell handle pulling with might have insulted will never speak to again then burst out cry hurried to door will get carriage said to man through sob a descended stair remembered that have brought german baroness with that german baroness must probably expect to be taken away again when reached hall door of dining room burst open german baroness appeared be evident that two scene have be going on in same house at same moment through door baroness came first waving hand above head behind be aunt ju advancing with imploring gesture behind aunt ju might be seen lady selina protest standing in mute dignity be got up cheating fraud said baroness vill have justice english justice servant be standing with front door open baroness went straight into lady george brougham a though have be own oh lady george said aunt ju what be to do with lady george be so taken up with own trouble that must hardly think of other matter have to say something perhaps have better go with good bye then followed baroness did not tink dere be such robbery with lady said baroness footman be asking for direction for coachman whither be to go care said baroness lady george asked in whisper whether must be taken home anywhere said baroness in meantime footman be still standing aunt ju must be seen in hall through open door of house during whole time poor mary heart be crushed by accusation have be made against upstairs home said mary in despair to have baroness in munster court must be dreadful anything be better than standing in green street with servant at carriage window then baroness began story lady selina protest have utterly refused to do justice aunt ju be weak enough to be domineered by lady selina a far a mary understood anything about be gist of story did not try to understand anything about during drive mind be intent on forming plan by might be able to get rid of companion without asking into house have paid sovereign surely baroness have right to demand more of when reached munster court plan be in sort framed now madam said where will tell servant to take baroness looked very suppliant if va not busy must so like just one half hour of conversation mary nearly yielded for moment hesitated a though be going to put up hand help lady out then memory of own unhappiness steeled heart feeling grew strong within that nasty woman be imposing on refused be afraid madam said that time be altogether occupied then let take to alexandrina row maida vale said baroness throwing sulkily back into carriage lady george gave direction to astounded coachman for maida vale be long way off succeeded in reaching own drawing room alone what be to do only course in there seemed to be safety be in telling to husband if did not must probably be told by cruel lip of odious woman yet how be to tell be not a though everything in matter be quite pleasant between lady susanna have accused of flirting with man that have told to in heart of heart believed that waltzing have be stopped because have waltzed with jack de baron nothing must be more unjust nothing more cruel still there be fact then sympathy between husband be so imperfect be ever trying to be in love with have never yet succeeded in telling even that have succeeded chapter xxviii what matter if doe about noon on day after occurrence related in last chapter lady george owned to herself that be most unfortunate young woman husband have gone out have not a yet told anything of what that odious augusta mildmay have said to have made various little attempt have not known how to go on with have begun by giving history of baroness have scolded for giving woman sovereign for taking woman about london in carriage be very difficult to ask in fitting way for sympathy co operation of one who be scolding mary in matter wanted almost more than sympathy co operation nothing short of fullest manifestation of affectionate confidence must suffice to comfort desiring have be afraid to mention captain de baron name thought of waltzing thought of susanna be cowardly so time slipped away from when left on following morning story have not be told be sooner gone than felt that if be to be told at must have be told at once be possible that venomous girl must really go to husband with complaint knew well enough at rate thought that knew that there have never be engagement between girl jack de baron have heard over over again from adelaide houghton have even be present at joke on subject between adelaide jack there be idea jack be being pursued mr houghton have not scrupled to speak of before mary have not admired friend taste have on such occasion thought well of jack because have simply disowned consciousness of such state of thing have made mary sure that there be not that there never have be engagement yet wretched woman in futile frantic endeavour to force man to marry be not ashamed to make so gross attack a if have be for lady susanna wretched fortune telling card one last waltz there must be nothing in a be there might be so much have begun to fear that husband mind be suspicious that be prone to believe that thing be going badly before marriage when have in truth known not at father have given counsel in light airy way however have sunk deep into mind have endeavoured to follow to letter have said not word to a to conduct to other men must not be natural that father must do so have told how to behave to husband men have assured be to be won by such comfort a described wife must provide that man dinner be such a liked to eat bed such a liked to lie on clothes arranged a liked to wear household hour fixed to suit convenience must learn indulge habit must suit to in external thing of life must thus win from liking reverence must wear better than feeling generally called love must at last give woman proper influence dean have meant to teach child how be to rule husband of course have be too wise to speak of dominion mary declaring to herself that feeling generally called love must exist a well a liking reverence have laboured hard to win from husband in accordance with father teaching have seemed to that labour be wasted lord george did not in least care what ate evidently have opinion at about bed a to clothes seemed to receive accession of comfort by having one wife maid instead of three sister maid old mr toff to look after have habit must indulge have looked about for weak point in armour have not found seemed to that have influence over be of course aware that lived upon fortune be aware also that knew that be so that consciousness made unhappy must not therefore even endeavour to minister to comfort by surrounding with pretty thing expenditure be grievous to only matter in have failed to give way to expressed wish have be in important matter of town residence a to that have in fact have power of yielding have be of such moment a to have be settled for by previous contract have often thought whether in endeavour to force to be in love with must not persistently demand that munster court must be abandoned that pleasure of own life must be sacrificed now for day two heartily wished that have done so liked house liked brougham liked gaiety of life in certain way liked jack de baron be to a nothing when compared to duty sense of obligation owed to husband playful childish a be be very serious to perhaps more serious because be playful childish have not experience enough to know how small thing be how few be evil can not be surmounted seemed to that if miss mildmay be at moment to bring horrid charge against might too probably lead to crash of ruin horror of despair yet through have proud feeling of own innocence consciousness that must speak out very loudly must husband hint to that believed accusation father must now be in london in day two on occasion must again be staying in munster court at last made up mind that must tell everything to be not perhaps wisest resolution to must have come married woman must not usually teach to lean on parent instead of husband certainly not on father be in way divided household be made have other real friend of whom must ask question liked mr houghton a to matter a distrusted altogether liked miss houghton friend aunt did not know well enough for such service a have brother sister of own husband brother sister be certainly out of question old mr montacute jones have taken great fancy to almost thought that must have asked mr jones for advice have connection with mr jones did not dare to do therefore resolved to tell everything to father on evening before father came to town there be ball at mr montacute jones old lady who have one belonging to invisible old husband be gayest of gay among gay people of london on occasion mary be to have gone with lady brabazon who be related to germains lord george have arranged escape for be to drive out together when went to ball must go to bed in course of afternoon told that be writing to lady brabazon to decline why wo go said care about if mean that wo go without of course will go be exactly of course be nicer if go though must take if like what dear think 'd rather not to night know that be quite strong enough then did say word to press only begging that must not go to dinner if be not well be quite well did go to dinner again have meant to tell why must not go to mr jones ball have be unable jack de baron must be there must want to know why must not waltz adelaide houghton must tease about very likely before have always waltzed with must not now refuse without reason so gave up ball sending word to say that be not very well must at wonder if have kept at home because be afraid of said mr houghton to cousin late in following afternoon before husband have come home from club told father whole story of interview with miss mildmay what tiger said when have heard have heard of woman like before have never believed in think will tell what matter if doe what astonishes most be that woman must be so unwomanly a to fight for man in such way a that be sort of thing that men used to do 'you must give up claim to lady else must fight ' now come forward say that will fight papa have claim probably have be sure have not what doe matter horrid thing be that must say to told that must know be married merely wanted to make disagreeable if one come across disagreeable people one have to bear with suppose be jealous have seen dancing perhaps talking with man oh yes in anger wanted to fly at one be not care about papa what then if be to tell george what if did mean to say that must believe think that be jealous began to perceive that must not get available counsel from father unless must tell everything must explain to what evil lady susanna have already done how sister in law have acted a duenna have dared to express suspicion about very man must tell that lord george have desired not to waltz have done so a believed because have seen waltzing with jack de baron seemed to to be impossible there be nothing must not be glad that knew if only must be made to know truly did not think that must tell have really happened be to do so there must be horrid doubt on mind mean to say that be given to sort of thing asked dean again with look of anger oh at least hope not susanna did try to make mischief d did said dean mary almost jumped in chair be so much startled by such word from father mouth if be fool enough to listen to old cat will make miserable contemptible man did say anything to about very man said something very unpleasant to of course told george well be be kind declared that have objection to make to captain de baron at be sure there be reason why must tush exclaimed dean a though assurance even notice of matter in direction be quite unnecessary there be end of think be little inclined to be to be to be what have better tell out mary perhaps what must call strict told not to waltz more other day be fool said dean angrily oh papa say that of course have right to think a like of course be bound to do a say have experience knowledge of world perhaps one of last thing man learns be to understand innocence when see word innocence be so pleasant to that put out hand touched knee take notice of what that angry woman said to above drop acquaintance with gentleman must be too proud to be influenced in way by such scandal if be to speak to george will hardly dare if doe be affair of yours can have nothing to do with till will speak to must not tell must not even think about be below notice if must be case that dare to speak to that must be weak enough to be moved by what creature can say to will be sure have dignity enough to hold own with tell that think too much of honour a well of own to make necessary for to trouble will know if doe speak to will speak only in pity for said slowly seriously looking a have sometimes seen look when preaching in cathedral believed now a always believed then be in great measure comforted must not be surprised that father must so absolutely refuse to entertain idea that intimacy between herself captain de baron must be injurious gratified that must be so nevertheless be surprised have endeavoured to examine question by own light have failed in answering knew well enough that liked man have discovered in realization of early dream society be in respect pleasant to be full of playfulness yet always gentle be not very clever clever enough have made mistake in life rather others have made for of taking too soon from plaything devoting to stern reality of husband understood something of liked to think that might amuse innocently with one a jack de baron be sure that did not love that there be danger of loving be quite confident also that did not love yet yet there have be doubt on mind innocent a be there might be cause of offence to husband be thought have made sometimes long to be taken away from london be immured amidst dulness of cross hall of such danger of such fear father saw nothing father simply bade to maintain own dignity have own way perhaps father be right on next day dean son in law went according to appointment to mr battle mr battle received with usual bland courtesy listened attentively to whatever two gentleman have to say lawyer who know business always allow client to run out story even when knowing that word so spoken be wasted word be quickest way of arriving at desired result lord george have good deal to say because mind be full of conviction that must not for world put obstacle in way of brother heir if must be made sure that child be heir wished for such certainty cursed heavy chance have laid so grievous duty on shoulder when have done mr battle began think lord george have learned most of particular lord george started back in chair what particular said dean marchioness late husband for doubtless be lordship wife be lunatic lunatic said lord george quite know when died believe be about month two before date at lordship wrote home to say that be about to be married then that child can not be lord popenjoy said dean with exultation be going little too fast mr dean there may have be divorce there be such thing in roman catholic country said dean certainly not in italy quite know said lawyer of course be a yet very much in dark must not wonder if found that there have be two marriage be what have got to find out lady certainly lived in great intimacy with brother before first husband died how do know anything about asked lord george happened to have heard name of marchese luigi knew where to apply for information did not mean that inquiry must be made so suddenly said lord george angrily be for best said dean certainly for best said unruffled lawyer must now recommend may be commissioned to send out own confidential clerk to learn circumstance of case must inform mr stokes be going to do so on instruction lord george lord george shivered think must even offer to give lordship time to send agent with clerk if plea to do so to send one separately at same time to take other step that may please be clearly duty lord to have inquiry made manifest duty said dean unable to restrain triumph lord george pleaded for delay before left lawyer chamber almost quarrelled with father in law before did leave have given necessary instruction chapter xxix mr houghton want glass of sherry lord george when got out of lawyer office with father in law expressed a being very angry at what have be done while discussing matter within in presence of mr battle have be unable to withstand united energy of dean lawyer nevertheless even while have yielded have felt that be being driven think be at justified in making inquiry said a soon a found in square dear george replied dean quicker can be done better agent must only act in accordance with instruction without disputing that dear fellow can not say that be glad to have learned so much be very sorry mean same thing george think do said lord george who be determined to be angry be sorry that must be so so be triumph have sat in dean eye when heard news in lawyer chamber almost belied latter assertion certainly be glad to be on track a soon a possible if there be track be duty to follow did like man at said lord george like dislike believe to be honest know to be clever will find out truth for when turn out that brotherton be legally married to woman what will world think of then world will think that have done duty there can be question about george whether be agreeable disagreeable must be done must have brought to have thrown burden of doing upon own child perhaps five twenty year hence when may be done so much easier now by have child said lord george will have dean a said must not keep from looking too closely into son in law face be most anxious for birth of grandson who be to be made marquis by own energy god know who can say at rate there be that child at manor cross if be not legitimate heir be not better for that matter must be settled now than when may have lived twenty year in expectation of title property dean said much more than urging propriety of what have be done did not succeed in quieting lord george mind same day dean told whole story to daughter perhaps in eagerness adding something to what have heard from lawyer divorce in roman catholic country said be quite impossible believe be never granted except for state purpose there may be new civil law think then if man be acknowledged lunatic must have be impossible how must marquis be so foolish papa ah be what understand will come out may be sure will come out why did come home to england bring with why just at time why did not communicate first marriage if not that why second probably did not intend at first to put child forward a lord popenjoy have become subsequently bold woman perhaps have gradually learned fact insisted on making claim for child may gradually have become stronger than may have thought that by coming here declaring boy to be heir must put down suspicion by very boldness of assertion who can say be fact be sufficient to justify in demanding that everything will be brought to light then for first time asked what immediate hope there be that lord george might have heir tried to laugh then blushed then wept tear two muttered something failed to hear there be time enough for mary said with pleasantest smile then left lord george did not return home till late in afternoon went first to mr houghton house told nearly everything told in way a to make understand that strongest feeling at present moment be one of anger against dean of course george said for always called george now dean will try to have own way be almost sorry that ever mentioned brother name to suppose be ambitious said mr houghton behe be intended to signify mary to do mary justice be not fault think care for dare say must like to be marchioness a well a one else know must might have be said looking tenderly into face wonder how must have borne say that be indifferent must have be so anxious on behalf to see installed in right have right there be brother yes a heir have none of feeling about have george then put out hand to took held begin to think be wrong begin to know be wrong must have lived at rate be too late said still holding hand yes be too late wonder whether will ever understand sort of struggle have to go through feeling of duty overcame at last where must have lived at cross hall suppose if there have be child how must have brought up did not blush a asked question did yet wish have be braver think must have suited better than be a good a gold said moved by certain loyalty though be not sufficient absolutely to protect from wrong be too strong to endure to hear reproached tell of goodness said mr houghton jumping up from seat want to hear of goodness tell of goodness doe love a do doe make hero of thought have idea of hero must think more of jack de baron whirling round room with than of position in world of even of own winced visibly when heard jack de baron name need not be afraid continued for though be a say a good a gold know nothing about love took when came because suited ambition of dean a must have taken anything else that provided for believe love said having in heart of heart at moment much more solicitude in regard to absent wife than to woman who be close to foot be flattering to top of bent love such a be be sufficient for be wife yes because allowed because thought wrong to subject future life to poverty must have brought with do think there be sacrifice then adelaide be so yes be so what doe mean time be gone by when men woman be too qualmish too queasy to admit truth even to of course be married so be marriage doe not alter heart did not cease to love because must not marry must not cease to love merely because refused when acknowledged to myself that mr houghton income be necessary to did not become enamoured of suppose did when found same a to miss lovelace money upon also jumped up from seat stood before will not have even say that married wife for money how be then george be not blaming for doing what did a well a must blame must feel to be degraded why so seems to that be bolder than can look cruelty of world in face declare openly how will meet did marry mr houghton for money of course knew be to be supposed that human being must have thought that married for love make house comfortable for a far a can be civil to friend look best at table hope be satisfied with bargain can not do more can not wear in heart george do believe that in heart can ever wear mary lovelace did only that thought that have space there for two that in giving habitation to second love be adding at rate to excitement of life tell george said woman laying hand upon breast be have home there will not say that love wife said be afraid formality of world be so much more to than to sit down george oh george then be on knee at foot hiding face upon hand while arm be almost necessarily thrown over embracing lady be convulsed with sob be thinking how must be with must door be opened pair of eye see a be ear be sharp in spite of sob there be fall of foot on stair heard long before reached in moment be in chair looked at there be trace of tear be houghton said putting finger up to mouth with almost comic gesture there be smile in eye little mockery of fear in trembling of hand motion of lip to seemed to be tragic enough have to assume to gentleman whom have be injuring cordial friendly manner thus to lie to have to make pretence at moment notice to feign something very different from what be have man come little more quickly have husband caught with wife at knee nothing must have saved own wife from utter misery so felt to be feeling almost overwhelmed heart palpitated with emotion a wronged husband hand be on door while be a thoroughly composed a stage heroine have flattered pretended to love did not occur to that ought to be angry with who must ever think of seeing at time of day said mr houghton well be going back to club in few minute have to come up to piccadilly to have hair cut hair cut honour bright nothing upset so much a having hair cut be going to ring for glass of sherry by bye lord george good many of be talking at club about young popenjoy what be saying lord george felt that must open mouth did not wish to talk to man especially did not wish to talk about own affair of course know nothing about surely way brotherton have come back be very odd used to be very fond of brother know there be nobody father used to swear by so much a by george know what to make of now nobody have seen marchioness have not seen said lord george be there same for nobody doubt that be there be there safe enough boy be there too be quite sure of know marquis of brotherton be somebody hope so said lord george when brings wife home people will expect will expect to know something about eh be said with intention of taking lord george part in question be already becoming one of interest to public be hinted here there that there be screw loose about young popenjoy who have just be brought from italy that lord george must have to look to of course who be connected with brothershire be more prone to talk of than others mr houghton who have heard said good deal about thought that be only being civil to lord george in seeming to take part against marquis lord george felt to be matter of offence that outsider must venture to talk about family if people must only confine to subject with be acquainted must be very much better said then almost immediately took leave be regular nonsense know mr houghton said a soon a be alone with wife of course people be talking about father say that brotherton must be mad be reason why must come tell lord george what people say never have tact of course be wrong always be said husband swallowing glass of sherry then taking departure lord george be now in very uneasy state of mind intended to be cautious have intended even to be virtuous self denying yet in spite of intention have fallen into such condition of thing with mr houghton wife be truth to be known must be open to most injurious proceeding to love affair with man wife be more embarrassing even than pleasant charm did not suffice to lighten for burden of wickedness have certain inkling of complaint in own mind against own wife felt that own hand must be perfectly clean before must deal with inkling magisterially maritally how must look be to turn upon ask a to own conduct with adelaide houghton then into what sea of trouble have not already fallen in matter of brother marriage first immediate duty be that of writing to elder sister expressed to in strong language after telling that have heard from lawyer spoke of of dean will make very unhappy wrote do remember what hamlet say o cursed spite that ever be born to set right ' feel like altogether want to get nothing by man ever le begrudged to elder brother than do belongs to though have treated badly must support in anything for sake of family at moment most heartily wish that child may be lord popenjoy matter will destroy happiness perhaps for next ten year perhaps for ever can not think that dean have interfered in most unjustifiable manner drive on so that almost feel that will be forced to quarrel with with be manifestly personal ambition not duty there be much more of in same strain at same time acknowledgment that have now instructed dean lawyer to make inquiry lady sarah answer be perhaps more judicious a be shorter will be given entire cross hall may dear george of course be sad thing to that terrible inquiry must be forced upon more grievous to than to a must take active part in be manifest duty duty be seldom altogether pleasant that say a to know to be absolutely true must at rate make conscience clear in matter be not for sake for sake that be to be done for sake of family at large to prevent necessity of future lawsuit must be ruinous to property if child be legitimate let that in god name be proclaimed so loud that one will hereafter be able to cast doubt upon fact to must be matter of deepest sorrow that brother child future head of family must have be born under circumstance at best must still be disgraceful although be so will be equally duty to acknowledge right to full if be right though son of widow of lunatic foreigner still if law say that be brotherton heir be for to render difficulty in way a light a possible that may do so must know what be of course find dean to be pushing perhaps little vulgar doubt with chief feeling be one of personal ambition in way be wise know that in matter have done anything have better have be left undone belief that child be not legitimate so in heart do must remember that dear mother be altogether on brotherton side feeling that there must be heir be so much to certainty that boy be at rate grandson that can not endure that doubt must be expressed of course doe not tend to make life pleasant down here poor dear mamma of course do can to comfort affectionate sister sarah germain chapter xxx dean be very busy week have passed away nothing have a yet be heard from marquis have mr battle confidential clerk a yet taken departure for italy when mr montacute jones called one day in munster court lady george have not seen new old friend since night of ball to have not gone have received more than one note respecting absence on occasion various other little matter why did not lady george come lunch why did not lady

be very pleasant when examined about man a endeavoured to do declared that have be a innocent a pleasant did not really believe that adelaide houghton mr montacute jones have intended to do mischief mischief such a alienation of own affection from husband regarded a quite out of question must not even admit to herself that be possible that must fall into such pit a there be other danger friend of hers must indeed be dangerous if brought into society made husband jealous therefore though liked mr montacute jones very much have avoided old lady lately knowing that something must be said about jack de baron not quite confident a to own answer now mr montacute jones have come to dear lady george said where on earth have be be going to cut if so tell at once oh mr jones said lady george

be married woman mistress of own house be quite sure that be to ask father dean must say that prohibition a be absurd of course must not ask father must not appeal from husband to be hardship almost made up mind that must request to revoke order then be very much troubled by long letter from baroness banmann baroness be going to bring action jointly against lady selina protest miss mildmay whom reader will know a aunt ju informed lady george that be to be summoned a witness be for while grievous affliction to know nothing about said to husband only just went there once because miss mildmay

get into brougham must get rid of have better write tell know nothing about to lord george objected requesting altogether to hold peace on subject never even to speak about to anyone be not good humoured with be clearly occasion for asking about waltzing indeed just at present rarely be in good humour being much troubled in mind on great popenjoy question at time dean be constantly up in town running backwards forward between london brotherton prosecuting enquiry spending good deal of time at mr battle office in doing by mean acted in perfect concert with lord george did often stay even

munster court must perceive that father husband be drifting into unfriendly relation greatly regretted in heart took father part be not keen a be in matter of little popenjoy being restrained by feeling that must not become to be over anxious for own elevation for fall of others have always sympathised with father in everything therefore sympathised with in then there be gradually growing upon conviction that father be stronger man of two more reasonable certainly kinder have thoroughly understood when house be furnished very much at dean expense that be to be joint occupant in when might suit to be in london have thought le about having rather submitted to suggestion a excuse for own liberality than contemplated such final arrangement lord george remembered house must certainly be open to must choose to come lord george must not press mr stokes have thought proper to go in person to manor cross in order that might receive instruction from marquis upon word mr stokes said marquis only must not seem to be uncourteous to must feel disposed to say that interview can do good be very serious matter lord be very serious annoyance certainly that own brother sister must turn against give trouble because have chosen to marry foreigner be simply instance of pigheaded english blindness make think that everything outside own country be ought to be given up to devil sister be very religious daresay very good woman be quite willing to think that wife ought to be damned because talk italian that son ought to be disinherited because be not baptised in english church have got stupid story into head must do a please about will have hand in will take care that there will be difficulty in son way when die will be right of course lord know where come from brother who be idiot

fault if there be one thing worse to than be feeling of being divided from own family brotherton have behaved badly to very badly yet must give anything to be on good term with think will go call be at hotel in albemarle street have done nothing to deserve ill of if knew must of course be understood that lord george did not at know state of brother mind towards except a have be exhibited at one interview have taken place between at manor cross be aware that in conversation have have with lawyer with mr battle mr stokes have invariably expressed a desirous of establishing legitimacy of boy birth if mr stokes have repeated to brother what have said have done justice of explaining that in that did be simply desirous of performing duty to family surely brother must not be angry with at rate must not suit to be afraid of brother went to hotel after being kept waiting in hall for about ten minute italian courier came down to marquis at present moment be not dressed lord george did not like being kept waiting must lord george call at three o'clock on following day george said that must be again at scumberg hotel at three o'clock on next afternoon chapter xxxii lord george be troubled be day of little importance to lord george so much so that one two circumstance occurred before saw brother at hotel must be explained on day there have come to from dean letter written in dean best humour when house have be taken in munster court there have be certain understanding hardly quite fixed assurance that be to be occupied up to end of june that then lord george wife must go into brothershire there have be feeling ever since marriage while mary preferred london lord george be wedded to country have on whole behaved well to other in matter husband though feared that wife be surrounded by danger be well aware that be dallying on brink of terrible pitfall must not urge retreat before time have be named though have ever before eye fear of dullness of cross hall must not ask to have time postponed be now end of may certain early day in july have be fixed for retreat from london lord george have with good grace promised to spend few day at deanery before went to cross hall have given mary permission to remain there for little time afterwards now there have come letter from dean full of smile pleasantness about visit there be tidings in about mary horse be still kept at deanery comfortable assurance of sweetest welcome not word have be said in letter about terrible family matter lord george though be at present moment not disposed to think in most kindly manner of father in law appreciated have read letter aloud to wife at breakfast table with pleasant approbation a left house to go to brother told that have better answer father letter have explained to where must find in dressing room on previous afternoon have received at club letter nature of be not so agreeable letter have not be pleasant even to certainly be not adapted to give pleasure to wife after receiving have kept in close custody of breast pocket when a left house sent wife to find that have come from father certainly thought that prior letter be at moment secure from eye within sanctuary of coat be otherwise with negligence to husband be so specially subject have made dean letter safe next to bosom have left other epistle unguarded have not only left unguarded have absolutely so put wife on track of that be impossible that must not read mary found letter did read before left husband dressing room letter be a follows dearest george when read epithet only be entitled to use paused for moment blood rushed up into face have known handwriting instantly at first shock put paper down upon table for second there be feeling prompting to read further be only for second of course must read certainly never must have occurred to to search husband clothes for letter up to moment have never examined document of except at bidding in compliance with wish have suspected nothing found nothing have entertained not even curiosity about husband affair now must not read letter to have directed dearest george that in handwriting of friend friend adelaide houghton in handwriting of woman to whom husband have be attached before have known herself of course read letter dearest george break heart when come to for heaven sake be here to morrow two three four five six seven will be here hour till come dare to tell man be not at home to anybody else must take chance nobody ever doe come till after three after six never come home till half past seven oh what be to become of when go out of town there be nothing to live for nothing only anything that write be quite safe say that love letter have grieved when got a have other letter before yet flattered assurance of woman love have in certain candied sweetness prevented from destroying paper instantly a ought to have done must wife have read mind in matter anger must have be somewhat mollified in spite of candied sweetness hated correspondence have be woman doing not be so hard for man to be joseph potiphar wife of moment have probably have encouragement after joseph can hardly flee unless be very stout indeed joseph must have fled though after certain fashion liked woman have be able to assure that fault have in degree be looking back thought that have encouraged did not know how to fly of mary knew nothing only knew that old mr houghton wife who professed to be dear friend have written most foul love letter to husband that husband have preserved carefully have then through manifest mistake delivered over into hand read twice then stood motionless for few minute thinking what must do first idea be that must tell father that soon abandoned be grievously offended with husband a thought of became aware that did not wish to bring on anger own then thought that must start immediately for berkeley square say what have to say to mr houghton a idea presented to felt that must say good deal how must serve intense a be hatred at present against adelaide adelaide be nothing to in comparison with husband for moment almost thought that must fly after knowing a did that have gone to see brother at scumberg hotel at last resolved that must hing say nothing till must have perceived that have read letter must leave open on dressing table so that might know immediately on return what have be done then occurred to that servant might see letter if exposed so kept in pocket determined that when heard knock at door must step into room place letter ready for eye after spent whole day in thinking of read odious word over over again till be fixed in memory say that love wretched viper ill conditioned traitor must be that husband loved woman better than did not world know that woman be plain affected vulgar odious dearest george woman must not have used such language without sanction oh what must do must not be necessary that must go back live with father then thought of jack de baron called jack de baron wild must not have be guilty of wickedness such a clung however to resolution of putting letter ready for husband so that must know that have read before met in meantime lord george ignorant a yet of storm be brewing at home be shown into brother sitting room when entered found there with brother lady whom must recognise without difficulty a sister in law be tall dark woman a thought very plain with large bright eye very black hair be ill dressed in morning wrapper looked to to be at least a old a husband marquis said something to in italian served a introduction of lord george must not understand word curtseyed lord george put out hand be perhaps a well that must make acquaintance said marquis then again spoke in italian after minute two lady withdrew occurred to lord george afterwards that interview have certainly be arranged have brother not wished to see lady lady must have be kept in background here a well a at manor cross be uncommon civil of to come said marquis a soon a door be closed what can do for did not like that must be in london without seeing daresay not daresay not be very much obliged to know for sending lawyer down to did not send particularly obliged to for introducing that other lawyer into family affair must have done nothing of kind if must have helped if will believe brotherton only object be to have so firmly settled that there may not be need of further enquiry at future time when be dead when may be dead have ten year advantage of own chance be bad if will believe suppose believe suppose think that in saying that be lying like very devil lord george jumped in chair almost a though have be shot dear fellow what be good of humbug think have got chance believe be quick enough to see father in law have put up to be not quite such as a be even be as enough to fancy that because englishman have married italian lady therefore marriage may very likely be good for nothing only want proof doe anybody ever come to ask for proof of marriage with very nice young woman dean daughter anybody may find at brotherton doubt can put hand on proof of marriage when want to do so in meantime doubt whether can learn anything to own advantage by coming here did want to learn anything if must look after own wife little closer fancy must be better employment for be at present probably amusing with captain de baron be calumny said lord george rising from chair doubt imputation coming from be calumny can make imputation a heavy a hard a please in way of honour have doubt will find with captain de baron if will go look must find doing nothing that ought not to do said husband turning round for hat glove perhaps making speech at right of woman institute on behalf of german baroness who be told be in gaol george take too much to heart have got money when man go into stable for wife ca expect much in way of conduct manner if get money ought to be contented have to hear to last bitter word before must escape from room make way out into street be at time about four o'clock in agony of mind have turned down towards piccadilly before must think what must do with for moment then remembered that berkeley square be close to on other side that have be summoned there about hour to give due must be owned that have great desire to visit berkeley square in present condition of feeling since receipt of letter be now awaiting at home have told dozen time that must must play part of joseph have so resolved when have first spoken to of passion now month ago then resolution have broken down merely because have not at moment thought great step to be necessary now be clear that great step be necessary must make know that did not suit to be called dearest george by to be told to declare that loved accusation against wife made in such coarse brutal language by brother softened heart to why oh why have allowed to be brought up to place hated a have always hated london of course jack de baron made unhappy though be at present moment prepared to swear that wife be a innocent a woman in london now a be so near a decision must be declared in person might a well go to berkeley square a descended hay hill put hand into pocket for lady letter pulled out that from dean have intended to leave with wife in instant knew what have done remembered even to way in have made mistake with two letter there must be doubt that have given adelaide houghton letter into wife hand that have read at bottom of hill street near stable stopped suddenly put hand up to head what must do now certainly must not pay visit in berkeley square must not go tell mr houghton that loved certainly must not have strength to tell that did not love while suffering such agony a of course must see wife of course must if may use slang phrase of course must have out with after fashion sooner better so turned stop homewards across green park in going homewards did not walk very fast what must do how must take of course woman daily forgive such offence might probably after burst of storm be over succeed in making believe that did in truth love did not love other woman in present mood be able to assure most confidently that such be truth must tell now that never wished to see adelaide houghton again before anything of must be achieved must have to own sinner before must have a be to grovel at foot hitherto in intercourse with have be masterful marital have managed up to point so to live a to have kept in respect upper hand have never yet be found out even in mistake indiscretion have never given opening for mildest finding of fault doubt be young practise have not come to a natural consequence of lord george have hitherto felt that almost divine superiority be demanded from that sense of divine superiority must now pas away know whether husband comfort be ever perfect till family peccadillo have be conclusively proved against be sure that wife temper to be sweetened by such evidence of human imperfection woman will often take delight in being angry will sometimes wrap warm in prolonged sullenness will frequently revel in complaint enjoys forgiving better than aught else never feel that due privilege of life have be accorded to till husband will have laid open to caress of pardon then not till then be equal equality be necessary for comfortable love man till be well used to doe not like to be pardoned have assumed divine superiority be bound to maintain then at last come home night with little too much wine can not pay weekly bill because have lost too much money at card have got into trouble at office be in doubt for fortnight about place perhaps letter from lady fall into wrong hand then have to tell that have be found out feeling be at first very uncomfortable be think step almost necessary in reaching true matrimonial comfort hunting men say that hard rain settle ground good scold with kiss be friend after perhaps doe same now lord george have be found out be quite sure of have to undergo be unpleasant without sufficient experience to tell that cloud too must pas away quickly still walked homewards across st james park never stopping dragging along slowly when came to own door let in very silently did not expect so soon when entered drawing room be startled to see have not a yet put letter a have intended on dressing table still have in pocket have occurred to that must a yet have known truth looked at when entered did not at first utter word mary said well be anything matter be possible that have not found letter possible though very improbable have brought mind so firmly to point of owning be to be owned defending what might be defended that hardly wished for escape in direction at rate be not prepared to avail of did find letter asked found letter well of course be sorry to have intruded upon so private correspondence there be threw letter to oh george picked up letter have fallen to ground tearing into bit threw fragment into grate what do believe about mary believe do think that love one a love can not love at unless wicked wretched creature be liar have ever lied to will believe know love one in world even that almost sufficed for already longed to have arm round neck to tell that be forgiven that at least be forgiven during whole morning have be thinking of angry word must say to of still more angry word must speak of wicked wicked viper former be already forgotten be not a yet inclined to refrain a to mr houghton oh george how must bear woman a that must let write to in such language have be to what to day yes to day certainly not have just come from brother will never go into house again will promise here be made first direct attack upon divine superiority be at wife instance to give pledge that must not go into certain house under circumstance be process of bringing nose down to ground have feared here be first attempt made by wife to put foot on neck think that have better tell can tell said only want to know that hate said mary neither hate love did love once knew never must understand never did believe that really must have loved then began to sob must ever have taken if have from moment when first knew be changed with a said put out arm to came to there have never be moment since in have not have heart why why why sobbed meaning to ask how must have come to pas that wicked viper must in circumstance have written letter a have fallen into hand question certainly be not unnatural be question very difficult to answer man like to say that woman have pestered with unwelcome love certainly lord george be not man to make such boast dearest mary said on honour a gentleman be true to then be satisfied turned face to covered with kiss think that morning did more than day have done since marriage to bring about completion of desire to be in love with husband heart be so softened towards that must not even press question must pain have intended sternly to exact from pledge that must not again enter house in berkeley square let even that pas by because must not annoy gathered up close to on sofa drawing arm over shoulder sobbed laughed stroking with hand a crouched against shoulder yet now then there came forth from violent ebullition against mr houghton nasty creature wicked wicked beast oh george be so ugly yet before little affair have be quite content that adelaide houghton must be intimate friend have be nearly five when lord george reached house have to sit enduring wife caress listening to devotion to abuse of mr houghton till past six then struck that walk by must be good for be to dine out not till eight there must still be time when proposed acceded at once of course must go dress equally of course must not must not go to berkeley square now thoroughly believed that be true to yet feared wile of nasty woman must go to country soon then wicked viper must not be near lord george walked across to pall mall looked at evening paper at club then walked back again of course have be object to have cool half hour in to think over have passed between wife also what have passed between brother that wife be dearest sweetest woman in world be quite sure be more than satisfied with conduct to have exacted from very little penitence have not required to put foot in disagreeable way upon neck doubt felt that divine superiority have be vanquished have uttered word of triumph with that be content what be to do with mr houghton a to whom have sworn dozen time within last hour that be quite indifferent to now repeated assertion to felt to be sure of fact still be lover have allowed so to regard something must be done must write to letter daily if did not stop such letter not shown to wife must be new treason against be great trouble then through terrible word brother have spoken to about captain de baron rung in ear afternoon have certainly afforded occasion to to say word about captain de baron to wife when detected in own sin must not allude to possible delinquency on other side did think that there be delinquency caesar said that caesar wife must be above suspicion in matter man be caesar to lady susanna have spoken about captain adelaide houghton have said ill natured word two have seen walking together now brother have told that captain de baron be wife lover did not at like captain de baron chapter xxxiii captain de baron of course a next day two passed by condition of mr houghton be discussed between lord george wife affair must not be passed over without further speech be quite contented with said more than contented suppose doe not feel contented with mr houghton then why did marry ah why indeed woman ought to be contented with husband at rate what right can have to disturb other people suppose never wrote love letter never certainly since marriage indeed be true lady have frequently written to have warily kept hand from pen ink have answered letter by going to yet must persevere woman can do such mean thing must sooner have broken heart died than have asked man to say that loved suppose have much to be proud of daresay have dozen others wo see again think may be driven to do so wish to have to write to yet must make understand that be to be over will understand that fast enough when doe not see must have served right to have sent that letter to husband must have be cruel mary did do thought of doing must do must have served right suppose be always writing have written not quite like said lord george be not altogether comfortable during conversation writes lot of such letter doubt do then mean to go there again think so of course look upon a being so utterly castaway a do believe to be heartless vile intriguing woman who married old man without caring straw for who doe care how miserable make other people think be very very ugly paint frightfully anybody can see a for false hair why be nearly false lady george certainly did not paint have not shred of false hair about oh george if do go do be firm will be firm will not will go simply that annoyance may be at end of course will tell will never speak to again how must must not wish must in answer to there be nothing for to say must have wished that certain amount of half friendly intercourse must be carried on must not ask to do after time might perhaps be able to press on advantage of avoiding scandal a yet must not do even that have achieved more than have right to expect in obtaining permission to call once more in berkeley square after that must soon be going down to brotherton when be there thing might be allowed to settle then asked question object to going to mr jones party on thursday question be very sudden so that be almost startled be dance suppose oh yes dance of course have objection have meant to ask to reconsider verdict against round dance must hardly do so at moment must not take advantage of present strength to extract from privilege under other circumstance have denied to be to do so must be a much a to declare that meant to waltz because have amused with mr houghton mind be not at way given did entertain idea that something more of freedom must be awarded to because husband have given cause of offence have be forgiven while be still strong with divine superiority have attributed to have almost acknowledged to herself that have right to demand that must be dull decorous now that have found to be in receipt of clandestine love letter did seem that might allow little liberty have forgiven freely have really believed that in spite of letter be woman loved have said something to herself about men amusing have told that though woman must have written letter a without disgracing altogether man might receive even keep in pocket without meaning very much harm accident must thought be held to absolve from part of strictness of obedience almost thought that must waltz at mr jones ball perhaps not with captain de baron perhaps not with much energy with full enjoyment still sufficiently to disenthral if possible must say word to husband first be going to rather crowded affair at lady brabazon before night of mr jones party have agreed that must do little more than shew there be obliged to go to special place hated staying even at lady brabazon might find opportunity of saying what wished to say on day took out in brougham on return home be alone afternoon till about five then who must come to captain de baron doubt two have become very intimate must not at have defined reason for liking be quite sure of one

george who be most delightful have hardly said when door opened lord george entered room lord george be not clever hypocrite if disliked person soon showed dislike in manner be very clear to of on present occasion that did not like presence of captain de baron looked very gloomy almost angry after speaking hardly more than single word to wife guest stood silent awkward leaning against mantel piece what do think captain de baron tell mary said trying not very successfully to speak with natural ease in least know there have be scene at woman institute baroness made dreadful attack on poor

lord plausible must be thoroughly ashamed of sister lady selina be sister to earl of plausible a world knew be not on speaking term with brother suppose unfortunate german lady will be put in prison said lady george only trust may never be able to put foot into house again then there be pause be apparently so cross that conversation seemed to be impossible captain must have gone away at once have be able to escape suddenly there be time when be very hard to get out of room at sudden retreat must imply conviction that something be wrong seemed to that for sake be bound to remain few minute longer when do go down to brothershire asked about th of july said mary probably earlier said lord george at wife looked up at without making remark will be down at cousin place day in august de baron

lord george voice a uttered word so frightened wife that became at moment quite pale be sure almost sure from countenance that dreadful communication have reference to herself have great calamity happened in regard to own family must not have looked at a be now looking yet must not imagine what might be nature of communication have anything happened at manor cross asked be not about manor cross brother be not about brother doe not in way concern family be about about oh george look at like what be be very slow in telling of story slow even in beginning to tell indeed hardly knew how to begin know miss augusta mildmay asked then understood might have told that must spare further trouble in telling only that to do so must hardly have suited purpose therefore have to listen to story very slowly told miss augusta mildmay have written to begging to come to very much astonished at request have nevertheless obeyed augusta mildmay have assured that wife by wicked wile lure be interfering between affianced lover captain de baron mary sat patiently till have heard sat almost without speaking word there be stern look on face have never seen there before still went on with determined purpose be kind of thing be being repeated of said at last susanna made same complaint have reached brotherton ear spoke to of in frightfully strong language now young lady tell that be destroying happiness well ca suppose that can hear without uneasiness do believe know what to believe be driven mad if believe george if believe word of will go away from will go back to papa will not stay with to be doubted be nonsense will not be nonsense will not live to hear accused by husband a to man wicked young woman oh what woman be what can do have never be engaged to captain de baron what be to nothing if have not told that stood in way be not engagement hope whether ill well founded treachery to lady concern mary that must send for tell to face that be cause of unhappiness why must pitch upon how can say because be very wicked why must susanna feel obliged to caution a to captain de baron have motive be not wicked know why must brother tell that world be speaking of conduct with very man because be bitterest enemy george do believe why when come home with heavy on heart do find very man closeted with closeted with be alone with alone with of course be alone with anyone who call must like to tell servant captain de baron be to be excluded so that world might know that be jealous must be excluded then must do will be unnecessary a believe will tell father everything will go back to will not live here george to be so suspected that very servant have to be told that be not to be allowed to see one special man will go down into country with will not stay in same house with said jumping up from seat unless tell that suspect of nothing not even of impropriety may lock up can not hinder from writing to father trust will hing of kind not tell who then be to be friend if turn against be to be alone among set of people who think nothing ill of be to be friend think ill of have not said so mary then say at once that think ill threaten that be to be taken into country for protection when tell of bold faced villany of young woman speak of with disgust that deserves say that sister susanna be suspicious given to evil thought declare brother to be wicked slanderer if have said word against honour of wife then will know that think ill of then will know may lean upon a real friend eye flashed fire a spoke be silenced for moment by impetuosity passion have not at all expected be not quite disposed to yield to to assure of conviction that to whom alluded be wrong that be all right yet be beginning to wish for peace captain de baron be pestilential young man whose very business be to bring unhappiness into family did believe feared also that wife have allowed to fall into indiscreet intimacy with destroyer of woman character then there be that feeling of caesar wife strong within bosom must perhaps have more fully explained to for unfortunate letter from mr houghton fault however of kind on part be in estimation nothing to fault on part of wife when once assured that be indifferent about mr houghton must find cause for unhappiness in matter what must all world be to if wife be talked about commonly in connection with man that must not absolutely be castaway must not save from perpetual agony must find to be altogether unendurable be be sure quite right a to theory about caesar wife even though from unfortunate position of circumstance must not dilate upon at present moment think said after pause that will allow that have better drop gentleman acquaintance will allow nothing of kind george will allow nothing can imply slightest stain upon name upon honour captain de baron be friend like very much great many people know how intimate be will never be taught to suppose that there be anything wrong in intimacy will never at rate be taught so by anything will do will admit nothing will hing to show that be ashamed of course can take into country of course can lock up if like of course can tell friend have misbehaved can listen to calumny against from everybody if do will have one friend to protect will tell papa everything then walked away to door a though be leaving room stop moment said then stood with hand still on lock a though intending to stay merely till must have spoken last word to be greatly surprised by strength resolution now hardly knew what more to say to must not beg pardon for suspicion must not tell that be right yet found impossible to assert that be wrong think passion will do good said know what will do good know what feel will do good if will allow to advise what be advice to come down to country a soon a possible to avoid a far a possible seeing captain de baron before go must be running away from captain de baron be to meet at mr montacute jones ball send excuse to mr montacute jones may do so george if like will not if be told by be not to meet man of course will obey will consider to have be insulted to have be insulted by a said brow became very black yes by ought to defend from people who tell story about not accuse can not will not live with if think evil of then opened door slowly left room must have said more have known what to say word came more fluently than be dumbfounded by volubility yet be a much convinced a ever that be duty to save from ill repute must fall upon from further intimacy with captain must of course take into country to morrow if chose to do so must not hinder from writing to dean must not debar from pen ink use of post office must very well forbid to see father of course if did complain to dean must tell dean everything so told now when man assumes divine superiority of governing husband own hand must be quite clean lord george hand be by mean clean be not perhaps own fault that be dirty be able at rate to tell that fault have not be there be that undoubted love letter from mr houghton if dean be to question about that must not lie though must assure that fault have be with lady must not excuse by argument in discussing matter with dean be in such trouble that feared to drive wife to retaliation yet must do duty honour honour must be first consideration if must only promise not willingly to see captain de baron there must be end of must allow to stay allotted time in london if must not do thought that must face dean terror hardly knew wife be hardly aware of nature of feeling when spoke of appealing to father idea crossed mind of complaining of husband infidelity must seek protection for herself must be loud enough in protesting against slanderous tongue of who have injured must wage war to knife against marquis against lady susanna against augusta mildmay must call upon father to assist in warfare must not condescend to allude to circumstance if be offence against have pardoned a to in heart of heart believed husband to be if not innocent at least not very guilty despised adelaide houghton too much to think that husband have really loved woman be too confident in to doubt love for many minute must hate adelaide houghton for making attempt yet must believe that attempt have be futile nevertheless when be alone thought much of mr houghton letter throughout interview with husband have thought of have determined from very first that must not cast in teeth must hing ungenerous be not singular that must be able to upbraid for conduct for conduct in there have be no trespass knowing a must have known feeling a must have felt that word of letter be dwelling in memory have at rate intended that abominable correspondence must be clandestine must have be sadly weak to make least of to have admitted correspondence pray tell that love have be language addressed to only few day since by married lady to whom have once made offer of marriage yet must now come trample on a though marital superiority have divinity of snow white purity be absolute tyranny yet in complaining to father of tyranny must say nothing of adelaide houghton of accusation made against must certainly tell father unless be withdrawn a far a own husband must withdraw for hour after leaving passion still sustained be to be reward for endeavour to become loving wife be engaged to dine that evening with certain mr patmore green who have be germain who have be first cousin to late marquis mary came down dressed into drawing room at proper time not having spoken word to husband there found also dressed have schooled to show sign either of anger regret a entered room said indifferent word about brougham still looked a dark a thunder cloud rang bell asked servant question brougham be there away went to mr patmore green spoke dozen word on way hardly answered knew that must not do so being aware that be not within power to rise above feeling of moment exerted so that might know that did not mean to display ill humour at mr patmore green house lady brabazon whose sister have married germain be there colonel ansley who be nephew of lady brotherton so that party be very much germain party people have be good deal exercised of late on great popenjoy question so immense be power of possession that marquis on arrival in town have be asked to germain house in spite of sin have be visited with considerable family affection regard for be not head of have not received offer graciously now current of germain opinion be running against of general propriety of lord george conduct ever since birth there have never be doubt green brabazons ansleys be gradually coming round to opinion that be right to make enquiry a to little popenjoy antecedent have taken kindly to mary though be perhaps beginning to think that be little too frivolous too fond of pleasure for lord george mr patmore green who be wife of very rich man mother of very large family altogether very worthy woman almost at once began to whisper to mary well dear what news from italy never hear anything about mr green said mary with laugh yet dean be so eager lady george wo let papa talk to about lord brotherton be quite welcome to wife son everything else for only do wish must have remained away think wish that dear mr patmore green colonel ansley lady brabazon spoke word two in course of evening to lord george on same subject must only shake head say nothing at time affair of wife be nearer to more burdensome to than even popenjoy question must not rid of new trouble even for moment be still thinking of when enquiry about popenjoy be being made what did matter to how matter must be settled if happiness of life be to be dispelled by terrible domestic affliction be afraid quarrel with brother will be too much for lord george said mr patmore green to wife when company be gone be not able to say word whole evening never knew to be more pleasant said mr patmore green doe seem to care about least in world husband wife did not speak word to other a went home in brougham mary have done duty by sustaining in public be not willing to let think that have a yet forgiven cruelty of suspicion chapter xxxv deny during whole of night lord george lay suffering from trouble wife lay thinking about though matter affected future life almost more materially than have better courage to maintain more sustained conviction might be that must have to leave home go back to deanery in there must be utter ruin to happiness let result however be a must must never own to have be one tittle astray be quite sure that father must support in position old coelum ' feeling be strong within must do anything must for husband short of admitting by faintest concession that have be wrong in reference to captain de baron must talk to coax implore reason with forgive love caress must try to be gentle with coming morning if be obdurate in blaming must stand on own innocence fight to last gasp be supported by such spirit of pugnacity felt to be duty to withdraw wife from evil influence of man attraction felt at same time that might possibly lack strength to do so then what be good of withdrawing wife if wife think that ought not to be withdrawn there be sin a to there be satisfaction in visiting result with penalty sin be in mind in heart be complete in enormity even though there be result be miserable because have not at once acknowledged that never ought to see man again a soon a have heard horror husband have told george said to at breakfast next morning let go on in way together in what way not speaking to other condemning other have not condemned know why must condemn because think that suspect without cause only tell people say if people told bad thing of george that be other must believe woman name be everything then do protect name deny name must be a nothing when compared with conduct like to be evil spoken of can bear anything else if think evil of papa reference to father brought back black cloud previous word have tended to dispel tell that suspect never said that suspected of anything say that be sure that in regard to man never said did thought anything be wrong come george have not right to expect that from have come round table be standing over touching shoulder even then must be better that must go away from say that must be better mary say that must be worse much worse what will bid wife make so much of man a to run away from will let world say that think that can not be safe in company will not consent to george running away will not be mine of course can take away if please will feel well know what will feel told last night what do want to do asked after pause nothing be to hear story not even to tell have heard did not say that george suppose be better that must tell think must say at same time that know to be false even though be false there be that doctrine of caesar wife must not understand think must be told then left to regulate own way accordingly be mutinously imperious yet did not quite know how to convince of mutiny through be cowed by remembrance of love letter of course be in mind be either too generous too wise to mention almost began to think that be wisdom rather than generosity feeling to be more cowed by reticence than must have be by speech imagine then that husband must never interfere not to protect wife from that from be bound to protect if have to do so be not worth trouble have better get rid of be like preventing man from drinking by locking up wine have to be done sometimes sha' be done to george must either trust must part do trust said at last then let there be end of trouble tell susanna that trust for brother that disappointed young woman care nothing if be to spend time at cross hall whatever may think must not wish to believe that thought evil of george suppose that because say will not run away from captain de baron will go for nothing with will not avoid captain de baron will be careful to give cause for ill natured word then put arm round neck kissed have conquered when went away from house have great trouble before have not seen mr houghton a yet since wife have found that love letter have written to often have sent note to club almost wild with love anger with affectation of love anger woman know how to assume so few men know how to withstand be not taken to be quite real even by lord george yet must not withstand mr houghton who understood world thoroughly have become quite convinced that lady george have quarrelled with two woman have be very intimate ever since lady george have be in town now for last few day have not seen other mr houghton have called twice have be refused then have written have received no answer knew then that mary have discovered something of course attributed lover absence to wife influence did not occur to that must on account give up intercourse with lord george scene quarrel reconciliation trouble recrimination jealousy resolve petty triumph general upsetting of happiness of other people be to sweet of what called passion to give up because lover wife have found out because lover be in trouble must be to abandon love just when be producing desired fruit wrote short letter long letter angry letter most affectionate letter to lord george at club entreating to come to almost driving out of wit have from first determined that must go to have even received wife sanction for doing so knowing how difficult must be to conduct such interview have hitherto put off evil hour now day hour have be fixed day hour have come hour have very nearly come when left house there be still time for to sit for awhile at club think what must say to woman wished to do what be right there be not man in england le likely to have intended to amuse with second love within twelve month of marriage than lord george germain have never be lothario have never thought to be gifted in way in first year of manhood when have be shut up at manor cross looking after mother limited mean with full conviction that be duty to sacrifice to convenience have be apt to tell that be one of men who have to go through life without marrying loving though strikingly handsome have never known to be handsome have never thought to be clever bright agreeable high birth have be given to sense of honour of gift have be well aware proud enough have taken credit to for nothing else then have come that startling episode of life in have fallen in love with adelaide de baron then fact of marriage with mary lovelace looking back at now must hardly understand how have happened that have fallen in love married certainly be not now least in love with mr houghton though did love wife dearly though more saw of more admired yet marriage have not made happy have to live on money galled to be assisted by dean money be wormwood to found to be driven did not wish to go to be brought into peril from experience did not suffice to extricate already repented step have taken in regard to brother knowing that be dean who have done not have not married might well have left battle to be fought in after year when brother must be dead very probably also be aware that must be very firm with mr houghton come what might must give to understand quite clearly that love making must be over between horror of such condition of thing have be made much clearer to than before by own anxiety in reference to captain de baron knew to be too soft hearted for such firmness if must send one else how much better must be ala be piece of work deputy must do for must letter serve a deputy let write a carefully a might must say thing must condemn utterly be to find way into mr houghton hand one terrible letter have gone astray why not have told to be in berkeley square at two be there very punctually must at moment have given much to find house full of people be quite alone have thought that must receive with storm of tear when entered be radiant with smile then remembered how on former occasion have deceived making believe that lure to meant little nothing just when have determined to repudiate because have feared that meant so much must not allow to be won in way again must be firm even though smiled what be about said in affected whisper a soon a door be closed looked very grave shook head canst not say did never shake thy gory lock at ' that wife of yours have found out something have found out from lord yes indeed what have found out read letter to sent to club then think very indecent behaviour on part doe search husband correspondence condescend to do sort of thing be fault put into hand by mistake doe not matter not matter matter very much to think not that care can not hurt george be not that careless very careless so careless a to be unkind of course be careless ought not to think more of than have not done injury sir when owed solicitude possible precaution be not to be denied if chose to receive such letter be bound at rate to keep secret men be so foolish so little thoughtful what did say george behaved like angel of course wife in such circumstance always do just few drop of anger then deluge of forgiveness be be not something like of course happens day because men be so stupid at same time so necessary what did say of be angel on side of house a well a yours of course be angry did not occur to that have be interloper have taken away from be not so have married psha married of course have married everybody marries have married did not suppose that for reason must forget altogether people must marry a circumstance suit be good going back to old story why did not come to sooner tell of tragedy why did leave to run after write to have be very unhappy so ought to be thing be never so bad in wearing a in anticipation suppose will go about destroying name doing mischief never because if did know must retaliate what do mean by mr houghton nothing need disturb lord george look such dagger at woman have to be forbearing to other be wife may be sure will never say nasty word about unless make very objectionable to nobody can say nasty thing about be right then now what have to say to about be not going to be gloomy because little misfortune have happened be not philosophy to cry after spilt milk will sit down minute said for hitherto have be standing certainly will sit opposite to for ten minute if wish see that there be something to be said what be have passed between for last month two must be forgotten oh be will not make miserable will bear burden upon own conscience conscience what speech for man to make to woman how about conscience then one thing further say that must be forgotten yes indeed can forget can strive to do so by forgetting one mean laying aside remember chiefly thing try to remember will not try to remember in least will lay aside like old garment because angel have come across scrawl be too careless to burn to lock up will tell to forget a must servant that have dismissed much more easily than must dog be that so did not say must do easily will not do at will not be forgotten did ever love sir certainly did know did when how long since have ever sworn that loved since angel have be wife looking back a well a must rather thought that never have sworn that loved in latter day have often bidden to do so a far a must recollect at moment have escaped absolute utterance of oath by subterfuge doubtless have done that have be tantamount to swearing at rate must not now say that have never sworn now come to tell that must all be forgotten be taught that word if upbraid will go away go sir if dare first betray to wife by egregious folly then tell that will leave because have word to say for oh george expected more tenderness than from there be use in being tender can only produce misery destruction well of cold blooded speech ever heard be worst after have passed between scruple to tell that can not even express tenderness for lest must bring into trouble men have felt that before doubt hardly think man be ever hard enough to make such speech wonder whether captain de baron be so considerate what do mean by come here talk to about angel then tell that can not show even slightest tenderness lest must make miserable expect to hold tongue know why must mention captain de baron will tell why lord george there be five six of playing little comedy mr houghton be married have not very much to say to other be same with mary deny daresay at same time know to be true console with captain de baron with whom mr houghton console have never taken trouble to enquire hope someone be good natured to poor old soul then a to used think to get consolation here such comfort cost trouble hate trouble a said wound arm inside angry a be with for speaking a have done of wife must not push from roughly be not that how be george then think understand play a well a do deny everything about mary be slander to mention man name in connection with calumny will not endure how be then if mention mine in connection with be saying nothing about suppose think of be hardly of le importance to myself than lady george be to herself did think be not of le importance to nobody ever be ever can be of so much importance to a wife will be on good term with one who speaks evil of may say what like of mr houghton must look to that be business of yours george paused moment then found courage to answer none said have confined to own assumed wrong own pretended affection have contented with quarrelling with for carelessness have then called upon for renewed expression of love must hardly have be strong enough to withstand must not keep tongue from speaking evil of wife from moment in have called mary angel be necessary to comfort to malign angel did not quite know man nature of men generally man if mind be given way may perhaps with safety whisper into woman ear that husband be untrue to such accusation may serve purpose woman on side must hold peace about man wife man must be very degraded indeed if wife be not holy to lord george have be driving wife almost mad during last twenty four hour by implied accusation yet be to very holy of holy popenjoy question be a nothing to in comparison with sanctity of name now weak a be incapable a must have be under other condition of mind of extricating from mesh woman be spinning for be enabled to make immediate most salutary plunge by genuine anger have produced no none said oh very well angel be everything to be nothing yes wife be everything to how dared then come here talk to of love do think will stand will endure to be treated in way angel indeed tell that care more for jack de baron little finger than for whole body be never happy unless be with think very much of cousin jack to be god be false very well be nothing to can hardly expect lord must hear from such pleasant truth a have just told not give back what believe to be truth in return have spoken evil of one will not stay here mr houghton to make recrimination have spoken most cruelly of woman who never injured who have always be firm friend be duty to protect will always do so in circumstance good morning then went before must say word to must perhaps have be justified have be little proud of manner in have carried through interview entertained such feeling to lady have just left feared that have be rough almost cruel be not to mass of whipped cream turned sour may perhaps be to reader though have be stirred to anger have be indignant with circumstance rather than with mr houghton in truth renewed accusation against wife made so wretched that there be room in breast for pride have be told that liked jack de baron little finger better than whole body have be so told by one who knew wife jack de baron of course there have be spite malice possible evil passion at work then everybody be saying same thing even though there be not word of truth in rumour alone must suffice to break heart how be to stop cruel tongue especially tongue of woman who must now be bitterest enemy if such thing be repeated by connected with how must be able to reconcile own family to wife there be nothing valued now respect held in own family that wife might hold in own mind must not quite acquit must not be made to understand that might injure honour destroy happiness even though committed great fault to take away with strong hand seemed to be duty then there be dean who must most certainly take part be afraid of dean chapter xxxvi popenjoy be popenjoy then came lady brabazon party lord george said nothing further to wife about jack de baron for day after storm in berkeley square did to be quite contented that matter must remain a now be have vindicated if made further accusation be willing to be appeased be by mean contented a day have be fixed for to leave london day be now month absent hardly knew how to insist upon alteration of plan if did so must declare war against dean for time against wife also postponed therefore decision allowed matter to go on a be mary be doubt triumphant in spirit have conquered for time felt that be so be on account more tender observant to than ever even offered to give up lady brabazon party altogether did not much care for lady brabazon party be willing to make sacrifice be perhaps sacrifice to did not assent declared to be quite ready for lady brabazon party to lady brabazon party went a be on staircase asked question do mind having waltz to night must not bring for moment to be stern enough to refuse knew that pernicious man must not be there be quite sure that question be not asked in reference to pernicious man did not understand a must have done that claim be being made for general emancipation muttered something be intended to imply assent soon afterwards took two three turn with stout middle aged gentleman count somebody who be connected with german embassy nothing on earth must have be more harmless apparently uninteresting then signified to that have done duty to lady brabazon be quite ready to go home be not particularly bored said mind be whispered laughing a know care about might a well take away so took home be not there above hour have carried point about waltzing on next day dean came to town to attend meeting at mr battle chamber by appointment lord george met there of course a be at rate supposed to act in strict concert on day dean did not stay in munster court when in london must always visit daughter must endeavour to do so in husband absence be unwilling even to dine there will be better friend down at brotherton said to be always angry with after discussing affair of brother be not quite sure that like seeing here have said on previous occasion now two men met in lincoln inn field not having even gone there together at meeting lawyer told strange story one to dean be most unsatisfactory one resolutely determined to disbelieve marquis said mr battle have certainly gone through two marriage ceremony with italian lady one before death one after death of first reputed husband a certainly so called popenjoy have be born before second ceremony so much dean believed very easily information tallied altogether with own view if be so so called popenjoy must not be real popenjoy daughter must be marchioness of brotherton when wicked ape of marquis must die son must have one must be future marquis then there came remainder of lawyer story mr battle be inclined from that have learned to believe that marchioness have never really be married at to man whose name have first borne that second marriage have be celebrated merely to save appearance what appearance exclaimed dean mr battle shrugged shoulder lord george sat in gloomy silence believe word of said dean then lawyer went on with story lady have be betrothed early in life to marchese luigi man have become insane partially insane by fit start for reason not a yet understood might probably never be understood lady family have thought expedient that lady must bear name of man to whom be to be married have done so for year have be in possession of income belonging to mr battle be of opinion that have never be wife further enquiry might possibly be made might add to further result must be very expensive good deal of money have already be spent what did lord george wish think have done enough said lord george slowly thinking also that have be already constrained to do much too much must be followed out to end said dean what here be woman who professed for year to be man wife who bore name who be believed by everybody to have be wife did not say that mr dean interrupted lawyer who lived on man revenue a wife even bore title now in such emergency a be to take cock bull story a gospel remember mr battle what be at stake very much be at stake mr dean therefore enquiry have be made at very great expense own evidence a far a go be against luigi family say that there be marriage family say that there be can not prove child may die know why must die asked lord george be trying matter round know be told poor child be in ill health one have got to look at probability of course abandon right by not prosecuting now must be cruelty to boy to let be brought up a lord popenjoy afterwards dispossessed said dean gentleman must decide said lawyer only say that recommend further step will hing further said lord george in first place can not afford will manage between said dean need not trouble mr battle with mr battle will not fear that expense will be paid not in least said mr battle smiling at believe story said dean doe not sound like truth if spent last shilling in sifting matter to bottom must go on with though be obliged to leave england for twelve month must do man be bound to ascertain own right will have nothing more to do with said lord george rising from chair a much have be done a duty required perhaps more mr battle good morning if must know a soon a possible what unfortunate affair have cost will be obliged asked father in law to accompany dean said that must speak word two further to mr battle remained at club lord george be much surprised to find note from brother note be a follows must mind coming to here to morrow next day at b scumberg hotel tuesday to lord george be very strange indeed must not remember circumstance of former visit to brother how have be insulted how wife have be vilified how brother have heaped scorn on at first thought that be bound to refuse to do a be asked why must brother ask brother be brother head of family decided at last that must go left note at scumberg hotel that evening saying that must be there on morrow be very much perplexed in spirit a thought of coming interview went to dean club to dean hotel hoping to find dean thinking that a have consented to act with dean against brother be bound in honour to let dean know of new phase in affair did not find father in law dean returned to brotherton on following morning therefore knew nothing of meeting till day after have taken place language marquis have used to brother when be last together have be such a to render friendly intercourse almost impossible then mingled bitterness frivolity wickedness of brother made tone of man voice glance of eye distasteful to lord george lord george be always honest be generally serious never malicious there must be no greater contrast than have be produced between brother by difference of disposition from birth by varied circumstance of residence on italian lake one at manor cross marquis thought brother to be fool did not scruple to say so on occasion lord george felt that brother be knave must not have so called on consideration marquis in sending for brother hoped that even after have passed might make use of lord george lord george in going to brother hoped that even after have passed might be of use to marquis when be shown into sitting room at hotel marchioness be again there doubt have be tutored got up at once shook hand with brother in law smiling graciously must have be comfort to of that spoke common language a must hardly have have many thought to interchange with other wonder why deuce never learned italian said marquis never be taught said lord george nobody in england ever be taught anything latin greek with singular result that after ten dozen year of learning not one in twenty know word of language be english idea of education in after life little french may be picked up from necessity be french of very worst kind wonder be that englishman can hold own in world at do said lord george to whom be ear piercing blasphemy national conviction that englishman must thrash three foreigner if necessary eat be strong with yes there be ludicrous strength even in pig headedness always think that frenchman italian prussian must in dealing with be filled with infinite disgust must ever be saying pig pig beneath breath at turn dare to say out loud said lord george be too courteous dear fellow then said few word to wife in italian upon left room again shaking hand with brother in law again smiling then marquis rushed at once into middle of affair think george that be infernal fool to quarrel with have quarrelled with have quarrelled with oh not at when send lawyer clerk over italy to try to prove boy to be bastard be not quarrelling with when accuse wife of bigamy be not quarrelling with when conspire to make house in country too hot to hold be not quarrelling with how have conspired with whom have conspired when explained wish about house at cross hall why did encourage foolish old maid to run counter to must have understood pretty well that must not suit of to be near other yet chose to stick up for legal right thought better for mother mother must have consented to anything proposed do think know how land lie well what have learned in italy lord george be silent of course know be not such fool a not to keep ear eye open a far a enquiry have gone yet be justified in calling popenjoy bastard have never called so never have always declared belief wish to be in favour then why d have made rumpus because be necessary to be sure when man marries same wife twice over have never heard of being done before be so ignorant a not to know that there be hundred little reason may make expedient have made enquiry now what be result lord george paused moment before replied then answered with absolute honesty be very odd to that may be english prejudice do think that boy be legitimate be satisfied a to that paused again meditating reply did not wish to be untrue to dean then be very anxious to be true to brother remembered that in dean presence have told lawyer that must have nothing to do with further enquiry have asked for lawyer bill thereby withdrawing from investigation yes said slowly be satisfied mean to hing further again be very slow remembering how necessary must be that must tell to dean how full of wrath dean must be mean to do anything further may take that a settled purpose there be pause then spoke yes may then george let try forget what have passed can not pay for to quarrel will not stay in england very long like be necessary that people about must know have wife son so brought to comfortless country will return before winter for anything care may go back to manor cross think mother must like why must like suppose be to be allowed to have own house when wanted hope there be offence in even to dragon sarah at rate may a well look after property if wo live there can there be one question want to ask well what do think of precious father in law what do think that must think of will not admit that for vulgar impudent brute be about a bad a even england can supply of course lord george have nothing to say in answer to be going on with tom foolery believe mean enquiry yes mean enquiry whether son nephew be bastard know put up to be right in saying that have not abandoned think be right then by heaven will ruin may have little money think purse be quite so long a mine will lead such dance that will wish have never heard name of germain will make deanery too hot to hold now george a between will be passed over poor child be not strong after may probably be heir will never live in england be welcome to house can be very bitter can forgive a far a be concerned do forgive expect to drop precious father in law lord george be again silent must not say that must drop dean at moment be not sufficiently fond of dean to rise up in stirrup fight battle for understand continued marquis want assurance from be determined to prosecute enquiry adverse to honour of family in opposition to settled conviction think that after that can doubt about duty come see again before long wo lord george said that must come again before long then departed a walked home mind be sorely perplexed divided have made up mind to take further share in popenjoy investigation must have be right to declare a much to brother conscience be clear a to then there be many reason induced to feel coldly about dean own wife have threatened with father dean be always driving hated dean money felt that dean be not quite that gentleman must be nevertheless behoved above thing to be honest straightforward with dean there have be something in interview with brother to please have not be delightful chapter xxxvii preparation for ball how be to keep faith with dean be lord george first trouble after reconciliation with brother dean be back at deanery lord george mistrusted own power of writing such letter a must be satisfactory on so abstruse matter knew that must fail in making good story even face to face that letter must be worse than spoken word in intellect be much inferior to dean be only too conscious of own inferiority in condition of mind told story to wife have never even seen marquis have never quite believed in ogre quality have caused so many groan to lady sarah lady susanna when therefore husband told that have made peace with brother be inclined to rejoice popenjoy be popenjoy said smiling believe be with heart be to be end of george know have never be eager for grandeur know have behaved beautifully along oh wo boast perhaps ought to have be more ambitious for hate quarrel must like to have claimed

papa never never do that if thought george be friend must break heart room be always ready for if will say what day will be here will get few people to meet letter be much more occupied with desire to see father than with momentous question on father be so zealously intent popenjoy be popenjoy be very easy to assert so much lord george must no doubt give way readily because disliked trouble of contest be not so with dean be more popenjoy than be popenjoy said dean to when read letter yes must go up to town again must know what have really taken place between two brother be essential did not doubt that must get exact truth from lord george must not go to munster court there be already difference of opinion between son in law sufficient to make such sojourn disagreeable if not disagreeable

accusation familiar to tongue pen of irritated female mind stranger reading must have imagined that have used art of lothario to entrap unguarded affection of writer then when successful have first neglected lady afterwards betrayed with stab so given there be command expressed that must come instantly to berkeley square in order that might receive other worse gash at better convenience of assailant a mr bond duck must certainly not have come out of pond have fully understood nature of lady invitation so neither did lord george go to berkeley square in obedience to command then there came letter to be no longer little dagger great sword sword making wound so wide that life blood seemed to flow there be accusation of betrayal in letter be simply broken hearted wailing of woman whose love be too strong for have not taught to regard a only man in world whose presence be worth having have not so wound into recess of heart a to make life without seeing insupportable must be possible that after having done have regard for be so hard so cruel such adamant a to deny at least farewell a for herself be now beyond fear of consequence be ready to die if be necessary ready to lose luxury of husband position rather than never see again have heart be inclined to doubt whether one among acquaintance be so burdened why oh why have thought so steadfastly of material interest when used to kneel at foot ask to be bride before have ever seen mary lovelace then long epistle be brought to end come to to morrow h destroy moment have read last behest did obey must put second letter from woman in wife way tore paper into minute fragment deposited portion in different place be easily done what must be done a to other behest if went to berkeley square again must be able to leave triumphantly a have done on last visit that did not wish to see for own sake be quite certain thought incumbent on to go yet once again did not altogether believe story a to tortured heart looking back at what have passed between since have first thought to be in love with must not remember such depth of love making on part a described in ordinary way have proposed to have in ordinary way be rejected since since marriage surely protestation of affection have come almost exclusively from lady thought that be so yet be hardly sure if have got hold on affection a described certainly then owed to reparation a remembered great head of false hair paint called to mind wife description of almost protested to that be deceiving almost read rightly nevertheless must go once more must go tell sternly that thing must come to end that more letter be to be written did go found jack de baron there heard jack discourse enthusiastically about mr montacute jones ball be to be celebrated in two three day from present time then mr houghton be very careful to ask question in lord george presence a to special figure dance be being got up for occasion be dance newly introduced from moldavia be most ravishing thing in way of dancing have ever yet found way into country nobody have yet seen be being kept profound secret to be displayed only at mr montacute jones party be practised in secret in back drawing room by eight performer with assistance of couple of most trustworthy hired musician whom that liberal old lady mr montacute jones supplied so that rehearsal might make performer perfect for grand night be story a told with great interest by mr houghton who seemed for occasion almost to have recovered from heart complaint that however be necessarily kept in abeyance during jack presence jack though have be enthusiastic about mr jones ball before lord george arrival though have continued to talk freely up to certain point suddenly became reticent a to great moldavian dance mr houghton must not be reticent declared four couple who have be selected a performer to be happy fortunate one of season mr montacute jones be nasty old woman for not having asked of course there be difficulty there might have be two set jack be such false loon said to lord george that wo show one of figure be going to dance asked lord george fancy be to be one of team be to dance with mary said mr houghton then lord george thought that understood young man reticence be once again very wretched there came that cloud upon brow never sat there without being visible to who be in company man told tale of own feeling so plainly a did mr houghton though declaring to be ignorant of figure have described dance a farrago of polka waltz galops so that thing might be supposed to be fast rapturous whirl from beginning to end wife be going through indecent exhibition at mr montacute jones ball with captain de baron after that have said be quite wrong in idea about dance said jack to cousin be quietest thing out almost a grave a minuet be very pretty people here will find too slow may be doubted whether did much good by explanation lord george thought that be lying though have almost thought before mr houghton be lying on other side be true at rate that after have passed special arrangement have be made for wife to dance with jack de baron then wife have be called by implication one of team jack got up to go before left room aunt ju be there then sinful old woman mr montacute jones dear said in answer to question from mr houghton about dance be not going to tell

must be talked of a one of four couple of good looking young people that must be about to dance with jack de baron in order that stranger might be gratified by looking at be manifest that nothing special must be said to mr houghton on occasion a one person came after looked while perfectly disembarrassed nobody must have imagined that be in presence of man whose love be world to when got up to take leave parted from a though be no more to than ought to have be indeed too have for time be freed from flurry of affair with mr houghton by other flurry occasioned by moldavian dance new dance be

count at present moment preferred one to jack de baron did not for moment doubt truth have be true though jack de baron mr houghton have be true also when mary have be last at mr jones house matter have not be quite settled in absence jack have foolishly if not wrongly carried point with old lady have be decided that performer be to go through work in fashion might best achieve desired effect that be not to dance exactly with whom pleased be to have part assigned a actor on stage jack doubt have be led by own private wish in securing mary a partner of contrivance on part have be ignorant when gave programme of affair to husband wo come in see said again be not very fond of thing perhaps may come in for few minute be fond of said dean think innocent thing make life joyous pretty be

be red count dress be blue gold dress be white be told that white red must go together there be nothing more to be said must not plead that husband be afraid of jack de baron certainly must admit to

indeed party have grown in dimension new moldavian dance have become topic of general discourse everybody wanted to see kappa kappa count costi lord giblet young sir harry tripletoe doubt jack de baron also have talked good deal about at club have be intended to be secret lady probably have be more reticent lady florence fitzflorence have just mentioned to nineteen specially intimate friend madame gigi young wife of old bohemian minister have spoken of only to diplomatic set miss patmore green have be a silent a death except in own rather large family lady george have hardly told anybody except father nevertheless secret have escaped great effort have be made to secure invitation can get to duchess of albury in july if can manage for one young lady said to jack de baron utterly impossible said jack to whom offered bribe be not especially attractive there wo be standing room in cellar went down on knee to mr montacute jones for very old friend simply asked whether be mad be of course romance nevertheless crowd be great anxiety to see kappa kappa universal by eleven dancing have commenced everything have be arranged in strictest manner dance might be going on be to be brought to summary close at twelve o'clock then kappa kappa be to be commenced have be found that dance occupied exactly forty minute when be over door of banquetting hall must be opened kappa kappaites must then march into supper world at large must follow lady george when first entered room found seat near hostess sat down meaning to wait for important moment be little flurried a thought of various thing there be evil woman before already dancing evil woman have nodded at have then quickly turned away determined not to see that greeting be rejected there be augusta mildmay absolutely dancing with jack de baron looking a though enjoyed fun to mary there be something terrible in have be so desirous to be happy to be gay to amuse yet to be innocent father somewhat epicurean doctrine have filled mind completely what have hitherto come of husband mistrusted at moment certainly mistrusted most grievously must fail to mistrust absolutely conscious of purity have be so grievously suspected a looked round on dress diamond heard thick hum of voice saw on side pretence of cordiality a watched altogether unhidden flirtation of one girl despondent frown of began to ask whether father have not be wrong when insisted that must be taken to london must not have be more safe therefore more happy even down at cross hall with two virtuous sister in law what must become of must quarrel with husband how must not quarrel with if must suspect must frequent house of evil woman then jack de baron came up to talking to father dean liked young man who have always something to say for whose manner be lively who to tell truth be more than ordinarily civil to lady george father whether jack must have put out of way to describe kappa kappa to other dignitary of church may be doubted have explained very graciously to dean so seems that after be to dance with captain de baron said dean yes be hard upon be to have stood up with real french count who have real diamond button now be to be put off with mere british captain because white frock be supposed to suit red coat who have count odiously fortunate lady florence have diamond of own think must have divided diamond madame gigi have lord between ourselves papa a said whispered father jack bent over to hear be rather afraid of lord ai captain de baron there have be ever so much to manage a none of quite wanted lord madame gigi talk very little english so be able to put off upon doe lord talk french doe signify a giblet never talk at said jack why did have to tell truth among there be rather hope that will propose to miss patmore green dear mr montacute jones be very clever at thing saw at glance that nothing must be so likely to make do a seeing madeline green dancing with tripletoe fellow ever did dance so well a tripletoe looked half so languishing see dean there be good many in out in matter have to be approached carefully dean be amused daughter must have be happy for double care sat heavy at heart then jack suggested to that might a well stand up for square dance other kappa kappaites have danced be dancing one thing on be firmly determined be that must not be afraid of captain de baron did now did immediately under father eye made reply got up put hand on captain arm without spoken assent a woman will do when be intimate with man upon word for very young creature never saw such impudence a woman said certain miss punter to augusta mildmay miss punter be great friend of augusta mildmay be watching friend broken heart with intense interest be disgusting said augusta doe seem to mind least who see must mean to leave lord george altogether must never go on like de baron must be such fool a to go off with men be fool enough for anything said broken hearted one while be going on mary danced square dance complaisantly proud father looking on thought that be by far prettiest woman in room before quadrille be over gong be struck music stopped suddenly be twelve o'clock kappa kappa be to be danced be hard in most amusement to compel men woman into disagreeable punctuality stopping of music will bring dance to sudden end there be who grumbled one two declared that must not even stay to look at kappa kappa mr montacute jones be great autocrat in five minute time four couple be arranged with ample space in spite of pressing crowd must be acknowledged jack de baron have given correct idea of dance when said that be like minuet must be remembered also that lady george have not be party to deceit figure be certainly lively figure there be much waltzing to quick time glory of seemed to consist in going backwards in interweaving of couple without striking other a be done in skating be very perfect except poor lord giblet who once twice nearly fell into trouble during performance changed partner more than once lady came back to own after very short interval who be not envious declared to be very pretty prophesied great future success for kappa kappa who be very wise very discreet hinted that might become romp when danced without preparation have be given to on present occasion certainly became faster a progressed be evident that considerable skill considerable physical power be necessary for completion must be deal too stagey for girl said mr conway smith whose girl have during last ten year gone through phase of flirtation invented in latter time perhaps did savour little too much of ballet practise perhaps be true that with le care there might have be inconvenience faster grew faster still have done before done with absolute accuracy be now near end lady have waltzed turn with gentleman lady george have be passed on from count to sir harry from sir harry to lord giblet after turn be lordship duty to deliver up to partner with whom must make final turn round dancing space then kappa kappa must have be danced ala a lord giblet be doing lost head came against count madame gigi lady george be almost thrown to ground be caught by captain who have just parted with lady florence to sir harry poor mary have be almost on floor must hardly have be saved without something approaching to violence of embrace lord george have come into room very shortly after kappa kappa have be commenced have not at once be able to get near dancer gradually worked way through throng when first saw performer must not tell who be wife partner be then waltzing backwards with count costi though hated waltzing considered sin to be greatly aggravated by backward movement though hated count be still somewhat pacified have heard since be in room how partner be arranged have thought that wife have deceived first glance be reassuring mary soon returned to real partner slowly ascertained that be in very truth waltzing with captain de baron stood there little behind first row of spectator never for moment seen by wife able to see everything with brow becoming moment blacker blacker to exhibition be in respect objectionable brightness of apparel of dancer be in offensive to approach have be made to garishness of theatrical performance made whole thing in eye unfit for modest society that wife must be one of performer that must be gazed at by crowd a tripped about that after have be said must be tripping in arm of captain de baron be almost more than must endure close to little behind stood dean thoroughly enjoying that saw be to delight there must be such dance to be seen in lady drawing room that must be there to see be to additional delight that daughter must have be selected a one of dancer people be person of rank fashion girl be among quite a equal girl who day must be marchioness of brotherton gratified thoroughly to think that enjoyed that did well that must dance so that stander by took pleasure in seeing dancing mind in matter be altogether antagonistic to of son in law then came little accident dean with momentary impulse put up hand then smiled well pleased when saw how well matter have be rectified by captain activity be not so with lord george pressed forward into circle with so determined movement that nothing must arrest till have wife by arm everybody of course be staring at dancer be astounded mary apparently thought le of than others for spoke to with smile be all right george be not in least hurt be disgraceful said in loud voice come away oh yes said think have finished be nobody fault come away will have more of be there anything wrong asked dean with air of innocent surprise offended husband be almost beside with passion though knew that be surrounded by who must mock must not restrain though be conscious at moment that be special duty to shield wife must not restrain feeling outrage be too much for there be very much matter said aloud let come away with then took under arm attempted to lead away to door mr montacute jones have of course seen be soon with pray take away lord george said madam must be allowed to do so replied still pressing on must prefer to do so wait till carriage be here will wait below good night good night so went out of room with wife on arm followed by dean since have perceived that be angry with that have displayed anger in public mary have not spoken word have pressed to come see dance not without purpose in mind meant to get rid of thraldom to have subjected when desiring not to waltz have done so in part when obtained direct sanction at lady brabazon doubt have felt that a took liberty a to own life a received love letter from odious woman be le entitled to unqualified obedience than might have be have hand be perfectly clean there have be little spirit of rebellion engendered in by misconduct have determined to hing in secret have asked leave to waltz at lady brabazon have persuaded to come to mr montacute jones perhaps must hardly have dared to do so have known that captain de baron be to be partner while dancing have be unaware of husband presence have not thought of when have first come to have in truth imagined that have be frightened by narrow escape from falling when bade come away with frown on face with awful voice then knew have alternative to take arm to come away have not courage enough have better perhaps say impudence enough to pretend to speak to to anyone near with ease eye be upon felt tongue must be talking of her already heard ill natured word own husband have brought upon own husband whose love letter from woman have so lately seen so readily forgiven be own husband who have so cruelly so causelessly subjected to shame in public must never be washed out forgotten who must sympathise with there be one now father must stand by must be good to husband by own doing have wilfully disgraced not word be spoken till be in cloak room then lord george stalked out to find brougham cab might take away from house then for first time dean whispered word to say a little a can to to night keep up courage oh papa understand will be with immediately after breakfast will not leave here alone certainly not till be in carriage listen to what be telling say a little a can till be with tell that be unwell to night that must sleep before talk to ah know papa know will have thing put on right footing then lord george came back having found cab gave arm to wife took away without saying word to dean at door of cab dean bade good night god bless child said good night will come to morrow certainly then door be shut husband wife be driven away of course little episode contributed much to amusement of mr montacute jones guest kappa kappa have be very pretty exhibition have not be nearly so exciting a of jealous husband captain de baron who remained be of course hero a must not take partner into supper be honoured by hand of mr montacute jones must have have happen for thousand pound said old lady for ten said jack have there be reason for none in least ca explain of what nature be intimacy with lady george have be more like of child than grown people know when grown people play at being child be apt to be dangerous have idea of kind may be wicked enough say nothing about be a pure a snow mr jones must no more dare to press hand than must to fly at sun of course like like hope so in sort of way be shocking that scene must come from such cause men captain de baron like having handsome young wife liked by handsome young officer be very absurd grant mr jones captain de baron did really grieve at have be done to others tragedy coming after comedy have not be painful what will be end of said miss patmore green to sir harry be afraid wo let dance more said sir harry who be intent solely on glory of kappa kappa will hardly get one to do so well there will be something worse than be afraid said miss green count costi suggested to lady florence that there must certainly be duel never fight here in england count ah dat be bad gentleman come make vera disagreeable if most fight perhaps must hold tong tink do thing better in paris vienna lord giblet volunteered opinion to madame gigi that be very disgraceful madame gigi simply shrugged shoulder opened eye be able to congratulate on being able to manage own husband better than chapter xxxix rebellion lady george never forgot that slow journey home in cab for in truth be very slow seemed to that must never reach own house mary said a soon a be seated have made miserable man cab rumbled growled frightfully felt unable to attack with dignity while be progressing will postpone have to say till have reached home have done nothing wrong said mary very stoutly have better say nothing more till be at home after not word more be said journey be very long at door of house lord george gave hand to help out of cab then marched before through passage into dining room be evident that be determined to make harangue on night be first to speak george said have suffered very much be very tired if please will go to bed have disgraced said be have disgraced put to shame before everybody for nothing for nothing have done nothing of be ashamed looked up into face must see that be full of passion by mean in mood to submit to reproach too must frown be frowning now nostril be dilated eye be bright with anger must see how be with though be determined to be master hardly knew how be to make good masterdom have better listen to said not to night be too ill too thoroughly wretched anything have got to say of course will listen to not now then walked to door mary paused with hand on lock trust that wish to contest authority have over know can not say if authority call upon to own have done anything wrong will certainly contest if have not think think will express sorrow for injury have done to night then left room before have made up mind how must continue address be quite sure that be right have not desired not to waltz at moment quite forgot casual permission have barely given at lady brabazon have be intended to apply to night only have not specially warned against captain de baron told that name hers be suffering from intimacy with man then have not deceived directly by naming person a partner in odious dance very fact that have so deceived be proof to that have known that ought not to dance with captain de baron that have vicious pleasure in doing so have be determined to gratify even in opposition to express order a stalked up down room in wrath forgot a much a remembered have be represented to that odious romp have be no more than minuet did not bear in mind that wife have be no party to misrepresentation forgot too that have be present a spectator at express request when wrath be at fullest almost forgot letter from adelaide houghton did not forget that mr montacute jones world have seen a in offended marital majesty took wife out from amidst crowd declaring indignation jealousy to who be there assembled might have be wrong there a thought of confessed to a much a injury done have be done to rather than to of course must leave london now leave for ever must go with might choose to take perhaps manor cross might serve for life seclusion a marquis must not live there manor cross be near deanery must sever wife from father be now very hostile to dean who have looked on seen abasement have smiled through there never came to for moment idea of permanent quarrel with wife might thought be long before there be permanent comfort between

indiscretion did not think possible that man a must have behaved so cruelly to such girl be not cruel acted for best degraded too degraded one said lord george be hard to think what may now best be done to cure wound have be made to suffer must insist on that must not be taken from town before day fixed for departure think of going to morrow said lord george gloomily then must go alone must

matter dean have heard nothing in dealing with can tax with deviation from wisdom what man doe be different conduct of mine can blemish name may destroy happiness if go on in way will do so during whole of day matter be discussed lord george obstinately insisted on taking wife down to cross hall if not on next day then on day after dean with dean young wife positively refused to accede to arrangement dean have thing brought from inn to house in munster court though did not absolutely declare that have come there for daughter protection be clear that be intended in such emergency lord george knew not what to do though quarrel be already very bitter must not quite tell father in law to leave house then there be always present to mind feeling that dean have right to be there in accordance with pecuniary arrangement made dean must have be welcome to use of house be in if only mary must have consented to be taken at once down to cross hall being under father wing must not consent pleaded that by going at once running away a called must own that have done something wrong be earnest in declaring that nothing must wring confession from everybody said knew that be to stay in london to end of june everybody knew that be then to go to deanery be not to be borne that people must say that plan have be altered because have danced kappa kappa with captain de baron must see friend before went else friend must know that have be carried into banishment in answer to lord george declared that a husband be paramount mary did not deny paramount a authority be must not in instance be governed by be miserable day to many caller came asking after lady george presuming that speedy departure from ball have be caused by accident one be admitted be told that have not be much hurt there be two three stormy scene between dean son in law in one of lord george asked dean whether conceived to be compatible with duty a clergyman of church of england to induce wife to disobey husband in answer to dean said that in such matter duty of church dignitary be same a of other gentleman that a gentleman also a dignitary meant to stand by daughter refused to pack up to have thing packed when came to look into found that have not power to bid servant do in opposition to mistress that power of husband be paramount be well aware did not exactly see way to exercise of at last decided that at rate must go down to cross hall if dean chose to create separation between daughter husband must bear responsibility on following day did go down to cross hall leaving wife father in munster court without definite plan chapter xl a to bluebeard when lord george left own house alone be very wretched wife whom left behind be a wretched a of course matter have not decided in way without very much absolute quarrelling between lord george have insisted have stamped foot have even talked of force mary prompted by father have protested that must not run away from evil tongue of people who must be much more bitter in absence than must dare to be if remained among when found that threat of forcible abduction be altogether vain have to make up mind whether also must remain dean wife have begged that must do so must not even seem to act in obedience to so went groaning much in spirit puzzled to think what story must tell to mother sister terribly anxious a to future in spirit repentant for rashness of conduct at ball before be twenty mile out of london be thinking with infinite regret of love for wife already realising misery of living without almost stirred to get out at next station return by first train to munster court in hour of sorrow there came upon feeling of great hatred for mr houghton almost believed that have for own vile purpose excited captain de baron to make love to wife then in regard to woman wife have behaved so well surely something be due to so much generosity then when have be angry with have be more beautiful than ever what change have few month in london made in have lost childish little timidity have bloomed forth beautiful woman have doubt a to increased loveliness have be proud to think that have acknowledged a to childish timidity perhaps must have preferred that must not have be so quickly so entirely banished even at brotherton hankered to return to london have done so brotherton world must have known put into carriage instead have driven through park to cross hall occurred on day one subsequent to ball have by previous post informed lady sarah that be coming in letter have said that must bring wife with on immediate arrival have to answer question a to unexpected absence father be very unwilling that must come said thought be at hotel said lady sarah be in munster court now to tell truth be not best pleased that must be so at last moment did not like to contradict hate london everything in like a there be kind of bargain made must not well depart from have left alone with father in london said lady susanna with tone of pretended dismay how can be alone if father be with answered lord george who did not stand in awe of lady susanna a did of lady sarah nothing further at moment be said sister felt that there be something wrong think at right mary must be left with dean said old lady to second daughter old lady be specially prejudiced against dean a being eldest son great enemy before day be over lord george wrote long letter to wife full of affection indeed still more full of covert reproach did not absolutely scold told that there must be happiness between wife husband unless wife must obey implored to come to with a little delay a possible if must only come must be right between mary when husband be really gone be much frightened at own firmness that doctrine of obedience to husband have be accepted by in full when disposed to run counter to lady at manor cross always have declared to herself that bore authority delegated from george that must obey george one george have told more than once half playfully that if wanted anything done must tell though understood to contain rebellion against germains generally have pleasant flavour with a acknowledging so completely own power have said to father unfortunately to mr houghton when mr houghton be friend that be not going to do what germain woman told have always spoken of husband wish a absolutely imperative now be in open mutiny against husband a thought of seemed to to be almost impossible that peace must be restored between think will go down very soon said to father after have received husband letter what do call very soon in day two do anything of kind stay here till appointed time come be only fortnight now have made arrangement at brotherton so can be with till then after come down to of course husband will come over to at deanery if must come then must be behaving very wickedly of course will come be not man to be obstinate in fashion know that papa do have better take advice in matter of course want to foster quarrel between husband pray pray let there be quarrel of course not other night lost head treated badly be quite willing to forgive forget that man may do foolish thing men be to be judged by general result rather than single act be very kind to generally just so be not angry with in least after what occurred must be wrong that must go away at once felt at moment anything must be better than quarrelling papa almost anything must be better than lasting quarrel with husband best way to avoid be to show that know how to be firm in such emergency a be of course compelled by father presence father strength to remain in town did so longing hour to pack up be off to cross hall have very often doubted whether must love husband a husband ought to be loved now in present trouble felt sure of own heart have never be really on bad term with before since marriage very fact of separation increased tenderness to in wonderful degree answered letter with language full of love promise submission loaded with little phrase of feminine worship merely adding that papa thought have better stay in town till end of month there be not word of reproach in did not allude to harsh conduct at ball did write name of mr houghton father be very urgent with to see friend to keep engagement previously made to be seen at play to let world know by conduct that be not oppressed by what have taken place there be intention of having kappa kappa danced again a far a possible by same people lord giblet be to retire in favour of more expert performer others be supposed to be worthy of encore of course there arose question a to lady george there must be doubt that lord george have disapproved very strongly of kappa kappa matter got to dean ear dean counselled daughter to join party yet again what must say papa dean be of opinion that in such case lord george must say do much le than have said done before according to view lord george must be taught that wife have privilege a well a fresh difficulty dissolved because second performance be fixed for day after on have be long known that lady george be to leave london even dean did not propose that must remain in town after date with direct view to kappa kappa be astonished at zeal with insisted that must go out into gay world almost ridiculed when spoke of economy in dress seemed to think that be duty to be woman of fashion still

tell too said that life be not worth year purchase poor little boy of course if have be born a son of marquis of brotherton ought to be born nobody must wish anything good wish anything good said mary a be continued dean apparently not observing daughter remark everybody must feel that must be better for family that must be out of way nobody can think that child can live to do honour to british peerage might be well brought up must be well brought up have italian mother italian belonging everything around a bad a can be question at last be one of right be clearly born when mother be reputed to be wife not of father of man that cock bull story have heard may be true be possible must not rest in bed if did not persevere in ascertaining truth dean did persevere be very constant in visit to

dean a walked across park towards albemarle street have many misgiving did not at believe that marquis entertained friendly relation in regard to even such neutral relation a must admit of ordinary courtesy of civilized life made up mind that must be insulted unless indeed must be so cowed a to give way to marquis that thought to be impossible more reflected about more assured became that marquis have not expected to obey summons be possible that something might be gained on other side by refusal to see elder brother of son in law might by refusing leave open to enemy to say that have rejected overture to peace now regarded a enemy almost entire germain family own son in law must in future thought be a much opposed to a head of family old marchioness knew sincerely believed in popenjoy daughter though have at first be very strong in aversion to foreign mother foreign boy be now averse to also on other ground of course lord george must complain of wife at cross hall of course story of kappa kappa must be told in manner must horrify three lady husband must of course be indignant at wife disobedience in not having left london when ordered by to do so have promised not to foster quarrel between mary lord george thought by mean improbable that circumstance must for time render expedient that daughter must live at deanery while lord george remained at cross hall a to nothing be more fully resolved than that must not allow slightest blame to be attributed to daughter without repudiating resenting imputation word against conduct must such word reach ear even through must resent must go hard with must exceed such accusation by recrimination must let know that if intended to fight also must fight have never uttered word a to own liberality in regard to money have thought of much theirs be rank rank be great thing in eye be at present wealth wealth thought be a powerful a rank be determined that daughter must be marchioness in pursuit of object be willing to

minute said man a shut door of sitting room will be gone if be not here in very few minute said dean unable to restrain very nearly did go before marquis came to have already walked to rug with object of ringing bell have then decided on giving lord two minute more resolving also that must speak mind to lord about delay must lord make appearance before two minute be over time have just expired when lordship did make appearance came shuffling into room after servant who walked before with pretence of carrying book box of paper have be arranged marquis knowing that must secure first word by having own servant in room be very much obliged to for coming mr dean said pray sit down must have be here to receive if have sent line only got note morning said dean angrily thought that perhaps might have

though upon word almost forget what be then may a well take leave do that see mr dean belonging to church militant a do be so heroically pugnacious must like fighting very much when have anything conceive to be duty to fight for think do thing be generally best got without fighting want to make grandson marquis of brotherton want to ensure to grandson anything may be honestly truly own must first catch grandson be on lip to say that certainly heir must be caught on side of family after fashion have be practised by lordship in catching present pseudo popenjoy be restrained by feeling of delicacy in regard to own daughter lord said be not here to discus such contingency scruple to discus contingency that in most public manner have suited at rate have be chance to marry foreigner because understand italian fashion scruple to say that be not wife have never said so to declare that son be not son have never said that to set dozen attorney to work to prove that heir be bastard heard of marriage lord a having be fixed for certain date date long subsequent to of birth of son what be to think a if have be explained to to world dozen time over did never hear of second marriage being solemnized in england to satisfy certain scruple have sent out made inquiry what have come to know about a far a be concerned be quite welcome to know everything dare say even though must be stung to death by knowledge of course understand think have feeling at not much a to duty to family certainly said dean stoutly exactly because stand little in way of new ambition be devil yet who have abetted think odd have received with open arm boy be a much to a ever be daughter to perhaps so lord question be not whether be beloved whether be lord popenjoy be lord popenjoy be poor weakling doubt whether may enjoy triumph long be lord popenjoy must know dean know nothing of kind said dean furiously then must be very self willed man when began george be joined with in unnatural inquiry at rate have be convinced may be have submitted to brother influence not in least george be not very clever have at rate have wit enough to submit to influence of own legal adviser rather to influence of legal adviser own man mr battle be convinced be going on with in opposition even to what devil be want be not dead may outlive at rate girl have got child doe seem likely to have one happen to have married into noble family now upon word seems to that be little off head with downright pride be for sent for well yes be thought might be a well to argue out be likely that there must be much love between need cut other throat be costing d d lot of money must think that purse must be longer than yours will try lord intend to go on with persecution then countess luigi be presumably married woman when bore that name look upon a sacred duty to ascertain whether be so not sacred said marquis with sneer yes sacred there can be more sacred duty than father owes to child ah then marquis paused looked at dean before went on speaking looked so long that dean be preparing to take hat in hand ready for start showed that be going to move then marquis went on speaking sacred ah such child be one of whom be proud a father must be proud a sister in law oh of course so be germains be never so honoured before a for birth care nothing about have behaved must have thought nothing of stable what do dare to say said dean jumping from seat marquis sat leaning back in arm chair perfectly motionless there be smile almost pleasant smile on face there be very devil in eye dean who stood six foot removed from saw devil plainly live solitary life here mr dean said marquis even have heard of what have heard london have heard of future marchioness whose ambition be to drive son from title estate sacred duty mr dean to put coronet on head of young word have not dared to print be distinctly spoken more distinctly more loudly more incisively than word have yet fallen from man lip be evident that lord have prepared word have sent for father that father might hear word applied to own daughter unless indeed must first acknowledge to have lost case so far interview have be carried out very much in accordance with preparation a arranged by marquis a to what followed marquis have hardly made calculation correctly clergyman coat used to save from fighting in fighting day even in day in broil personal encounter be held to be generally disreputable save wearer from certain remote danger to other men be liable reverse of be also true must probably be hard to extract first blow from whole bench of bishop dean a rule be more sedentary more quiescent more given to sufferance even than bishop normal dean be goodly sleek bookish man who must hardly strike blow under provocation marquis perhaps have be aware of have perhaps fancied that be a good man a dean who be at least ten year senior have not at rate anticipated such speedy violence a followed utterance of abominable word dean a have said have be standing about six foot from easy chair in marquis be lolling when word be spoken have already taken hat in hand have thought of mean of showing indignation a left room now first impulse be to rid of hat did by pitching along floor then in instant be at lord throat lord have expected so little that up to last made preparation for defence dean have got by cravat shirt collar before have begun to expect such usage a then simply gurgled out ejaculated oath uttered half in surprise half in prayer prayer certainly be now of use have five hundred foot of rock be there marquis must have gone down though dean have gone with fire flashed from clergyman eye teeth be set fast very nostril be almost ablaze daughter holy spot of life one being in whom believed with heart with strength dean be fifty year of age one have ever taken for old man who at home at brotherton must watch motion how walked how rode on horseback how must vault gate when in field scamper across country like schoolboy be wont to say that be unclerical perhaps canon pountner holdenough with mr groschut bishop chaplain envied something of juvenile elasticity think that none of have given credit for such strength a now displayed marquis in spite of what feeble effort made be dragged up out of chair made to stand rather to totter on leg made clutch at bell rope to aid luxurious ease have be brought close to hand a sat failed a dean shook hither thither then be dragged on to middle of rug feeling by time that be going to be throttled attempted to throw down must have done so that dean with left hand prevented from falling made one vigorous struggle to free striving a did so to call for assistance dean having got victim back to fireplace having poor wretch now fully at command threw man with strength into empty grate marquis fell like heap within fender with back against top bar head driven further back against brick iron there for second two lay like dead mass le than minute have done for so long time dean ungoverned fury have held fire what be consequence to with word a applied to child ringing in ear how must moderate wrath under such outrage a be not a though beast have met beast in forest between whom nothing internecine fight to end be possible when minute be over saw what have done when man tumbled dishevelled alump already bloody be lying before then remembered who be what be that have done be dean lovelace who have already made for more than enough of clerical enmity other man be marquis of brotherton whom have perhaps killed in wrath with witness by to say word a to provocation have received marquis groaned impotently moved arm a though to raise at rate be not dead a yet with desire to do what be right now dean rang bell violently then stooped down to extricate foe have succeeded in raising man in seating on floor with head against arm chair before servant came have wished to conceal anything must without much increased effort have

perhaps lord george might think right to come up dean must of course ask at hotel on following day must go to police office believed said that permanent injury have be done then came perhaps pith of letter trusted that lord george must agree with in thinking that mary have better remain with in town during two three day of necessarily prolonged sojourn be put in form of request be put in manner intended to show that request if not granted must be enforced dean be fully determined that mary must not at once go down to cross hall letter be supplicatory spasmodic full of sorrow full of love be quite sure that dear papa must have done nothing that ought not to have done yet be very sorry for marquis because of mother sister because of dear dear george must not run up to hear about from papa if marquis have said ill natured thing of be very cruel because nobody loved husband better than loved dear dear george so on letter be then sent under cover to housekeeper at deanery with order to send on by private messenger to cross hall on following day dean went to scumberg must not learn much there marquis have be very bad have have one doctor with almost continually mr walker must not take upon to say that be dangerous thought be in'ard mr walker always do think that be in'ard when there be nothing palpable outward at rate lordship have not be out of bed have taken nothing tapioca brandy there be very little more than to be learned at police court case might be serious superintendent hoped otherwise superintendent did not think that dean must go down quite to morrow morrow be friday suggested saturday a possible monday a almost certain may be a well to say here that dean did not call at police court again heard nothing further from officer of law respecting occurrence at scumberg on friday called again at scumberg marquis be still in bed in'ards have not ceased to be matter of anxiety to mr walker surgeon whom dean now saw declared that muscle of nobleman back be more deserving of sympathy surgeon with gravity almost indicated offence expressed opinion that marquis back have received injury might be very injurious lord george when received letter be thrown into state of mind that almost distracted during last week two animosity felt at cross hall against marquis have be greatly weakened feeling have come upon family that after popenjoy be popenjoy that although natal circumstance of such popenjoy be doubtless unfortunate for family generally still a injury have be done to marquis by suspicion circumstance ought now to be in measure forgiven marquis be head of family family will forgive much to head when head be marquis a know dowager have be in favour from first lord george have lately given way have undergone certain amount of reconciliation with brother lady amelia have seceded to mother a have also mr toff old housekeeper lady susanna be wavering having have mind biased by objectionable conduct of dean daughter lady sarah be more staunch lady sarah have never yet given way never did give way in very heart be best friend mary have among lady of family when brother gave up contest felt that further immediate action be impossible thing be in state at cross hall when lord george received two letter did not wish to think well of dean just at present be horrified at idea of clergyman knocking marquis into fire place word indicated be very plain that word have be applied to own wife perhaps such word have really be used perhaps dean have craftily saved from absolute lie in attempt to defend violence of conduct have brought accusation against marquis be in essence untrue lord george be quite alive to duty of defending wife in doing so be no longer anxious to maintain affectionate term with wife father have be very foolish world have admitted a much have seen with own eye at wretched ball have suffered name to be joined with of stranger in manner derogatory to husband honour be hardly surprising that brother must have spoken of conduct in disparaging term did not believe that brother have used that special term personal violence blow struggling that on part of dean of church of england violence such a seemed to have be violence might have killed man attacked seemed to to be in case unpardonable certainly must not live on term of friendship with dean immediately after such deed wife must be taken away secluded purified by long course of germain asceticism what must do now at once felt that be duty to hurry up to london must not bring to live in same house with dean wife must be taken away from father however bad may have be language used by marquis however indefensible must not allow even to seem to keep up affectionate relation with man who have half slaughtered brother too thought of what world must say too felt that affair after having become known to police must be soon known to one else what must do at once have not a yet made up mind a to when took place at brotherton railway station on morning after have received letter on reaching station in london have so far made up mind a to have portmanteau taken to hotel close at hand then to go to munster court have hoped to find wife alone on arrival dean be there also oh george said be so glad have come where be thing explained that have thing that have come up only for short time have left luggage at station will stay here to night asked mary in despair lord george hesitated dean at once saw how be will not go back to brotherton to day said now at moment dean have to settle in mind great question whether must be best for girl that must be separated from husband from father in giving due must be acknowledged that considered only what might in truth be best for if be now taken away from there must be prospect of recovery after have passed after lord george submission to brother dean be sure that must be held in abhorrence by whole germain family mary must be secluded trodden on reduced to pale submission by dragon till life must be miserable lord george must be prone enough to domineer in such circumstance then ill word have be spoken must only be effectually burned out of thought of people by front to world at same time innocent bold must stick to for ever if be carried away into obscurity dean knew a well a others know how great be evil of separation how specially detrimental such step must be to young wife than permanent separation anything must be better better even that must be secluded maligned even for while trodden under foot be such separation to take place girl must have be altogether sacrificed life happiness brought to shipwreck then permanent separation be not probable have done nothing wrong husband wife did in truth love other dearly marquis must be soon gone then lord george must return to old habit of thought old allegiance upon whole dean thought best that present influence must be used in taking daughter to deanery must like to return quite early to morrow said lord george very gravely unless brother condition must make impossible trust wo find brother much worse for what have happened said dean will sleep here to night repeated mary will come for first thing in morning said lord george in same funereal voice why why will probably have to be good deal with brother during afternoon will be here again in afternoon can be at home at five can get thing ready for going to morrow wo dine here think not then there be silence for minute mary be completely astounded lord george wished to say nothing further in presence of father in law dean be thinking how must begin to use influence trust will not take mary away to morrow oh certainly trust not must ask to hear say few word about must insist on coming with to morrow even though must have to return to london afterwards mary said father leave for moment then mary retired with very saddened air do understand george what be that brother said to suppose so answered hoarsely then doubt may take for granted that approve of violence of resentment to a clergyman a man past middle life position be very trying have be archbishop tottering on grave with year must have endeavoured to do same said with great energy tell george that think be right george have not heard word have not seen man face then though must have gone to desert island with wife have such exile be necessary for protection did believe that have misconducted have not seen whirling round room with man after have be warned against can not be right to murder man said at last thank then for vindicating honour wife innocence think that be way way be to take home yes to old home to deanery for while so that world will doubt hear malignant epithet applied to by wicked brother may know that husband father support have promised to come to deanery can not do now do mean that after what have passed will take brother part will take wife to cross hall said leaving room following mary up to chamber what be to do papa said when came down about hour afterwards lord george have then started to scumberg saying that must come to munster court again before dinner telling plainly that must not sit down to dine with father have determined to quarrel with will only be for time dearest what will do now came peril of answer be sure almost sure that must in emergency rely rather upon than on husband if be firm must be firm a against husband how great must be responsibility think dear said at last that must go with to brotherton will not let think that must insist on promise make quarrel papa certainly not anything must be better than permanent quarrel after have be said after foul lie have be told think that must assert purpose of staying for awhile with father be now to go to cross hall there must be limit to tyranny left without word more calling at scumberg hotel be told that marquis must not move at moment lord george be with brother marquis must talk though must not move precious family have married into george said almost a soon a brother be in room then gave own version of affair leaving brother in doubt a to exact language have be used ought to have be coal heaver instead of clergyman said marquis of course must be angry said lord george nothing astonishes so much said marquis a way in fellow here think may say come into head about wife because be italian seem to be quite surprised if object yet rage like wild beast if compliment be returned why be to think better of wife than of mine have said nothing against wife brotherton by think have said great deal with much le reason than have what did do when found struggling in fellow arm at old woman party good natured friend have told marquis whole story of kappa kappa ca be deaf to what world be saying of be wormwood to wretched husband yet must not answer with angry self reliant indignation while brother be lying almost motionless before lord george found that must hing at scumberg hotel be assured that brother be not in danger that chief injury done be to muscle of back bruised lacerated a be must gradually recover such elasticity a have ever possessed other word be said other hint expressed of tended to increase animosity against dean almost to engender anger against wife to personally except in regard to wife brother have not be ungracious marquis intended to return to italy a soon a must hated england everything in manor cross must very soon be at lord george disposal though do hope said marquis that lady who have condescended to make brother in law will never reign paramount there by degree there crept on lord george mind feeling that brother looked to permanent separation something like repudiation over over again spoke of mary a though have disgraced utterly when lord george defended wife lord only smiled sneered effect upon lord george be to make very imperious a walked back to munster court must not repudiate wife must take away with very high hand crossing green park at back of arlington street whom must meet mr houghton with cousin jack raised hat must not stop moment mr houghton made attempt to arrest escaped without word went on very quickly wife have behaved

sure that there be more in than italian marchioness have gone off very suddenly there have be no grand packing up there have be very angry word popenjoy when be taken away be supposed to be in very poor condition of health created renewed doubt in mind of lord george rather perhaps renewed hope perhaps after popenjoy be not popenjoy even if be seemed that everyone concurred in thinking that poor boy must die surely marquis must not have allowed sick child to be carried away by indiscreet italian mother if cared much for sick child then lord george have real knowledge of transaction have come through mr toff be hardly able to rely upon mr toff must have communicated with dean dean must soon have found out truth dean must have flown up to london have known about in couple of hour lord

cause of offence did feel be always feeling that husband ought to remember that have never brought counter charge against have told one of mr houghton letter be far too proud to give slightest hint that too have grievance surely must remember must like to go said then come back with to morrow lady sarah have come only on business if business be completed there must be legitimate reason for prolonged sojourn at brotherton must george come here for one night surely mary must not drive bargain with husband papa father can only be anxious for happiness therefore must be anxious for ca say that will go without asking then ask come in see at alice house afternoon tell father that say will be received with affection mary made promise that must do even a lady sarah took leave did at once consult father of course can go if like dearest never mind be thinking only of will be different to now that think will be mother of heir must take stay there for one night think must do dear consider

excitement be from brother like most of marquis letter be very short think have better come up see be not very well b be entire letter be now on way to london do think be much george must not write like unless be really ill have never recovered from result of accident then occurred to mary that if marquis be to die popenjoy be to die must at once be marchioness of brotherton that people must say that father have raised to title by killing late lord must be so there be something so horrible in that trembled a thought of oh george be very very sad be fault be must give world that be well be fault lord george be silent oh george dear george acknowledge be not so do not think so must papa stand by hear call such name a must have done so man must not be killed for angry word papa did not mean to kill can never be reconciled to man who have taken life of brother do love brother better than father be not one if be to be said of will always be one with papa did for sake for yours if send to prison will go with george tell truth about always tell truth said angrily did not do right to protect girl name will never leave now never if everybody be against will never leave good be to be

must never be happy again that certainly must not now desert father then be left alone ah what must happen if man be to die must woman ever have risen to high rank in so miserable manner in tumult of feeling told father everything be astonished by equanimity may be so said if so there will be considerable inconvenience inconvenience papa there will be coroner inquest perhaps kind of trial when truth come out english jury will condemn who will tell truth papa dean knew be well aware that there must be one to tell truth on behalf one to tell in such guise that jury must be entitled to accept telling a evidence verdict of manslaughter with punishment at discretion of judge must be probable result dean did not choose to add to daughter discomfort by explaining chance be that wretched man be dying doubt health be bad how must health of such man be good have be so hurt a to die from doctor must have found something out long since may be dying be not dying from what did to dean be disturbed in perturbation remembered that if man be to die there must be nothing little alien popenjoy between daughter title lord george hurried up to town took room for at hotel in jermyn street must not go

must be right that must take threat uttered a have be a notice to quit house certainly must not live in brother house in opposition to brother how be to obey order of such madman when reached brotherton went at once to deanery be very glad to find wife without father did not a yet wish to renew friendly relation with dean although have refused to pledge to quarrel still thought to be duty

le than week ago meeting be so unsatisfactory in respect wish to repeat if have anything to say to a to occupation of house have better say through think however that brother must be told that though

married on strength of occupation lease have be executed to mr price dowager have be called upon to sign mamma will never be made to understand said lady susanna one can understand said lord george lord george insisted that lady must continue to live at large house insinuating that for must take wretched residence in most miserable corner of globe must find marchioness be told really fell into very bad way literally must not understand aggravated matter by appearing to think that younger son have be wanting in respect to elder brother be that nasty dean mary must have behaved very badly brotherton must not have be so severe mamma said lady sarah moved beyond wont ought not to think such thing george have be true to life mary have done nothing be brotherton fault when did ever behave well if be to be miserable let at rate tell truth about then marchioness be put to bed remained there for two day at last dean heard of first through lady alice then directly from lady sarah who took news to deanery upon wrote following letter to son in law dear george think brother be not quite sane never thought that be since have have pleasure of knowing especially since have be connected with family have be cause of trouble have befallen be to be regretted that must ever have moved back to manor cross because temper be so uncertain motif so unchristian think understand position now will therefore not refer to further than to say that when not in london hope will make deanery home have own house in town when here will be close to mother sister anything can do to make comfortable residence for will be done will surely go for something with that compliance with request on part will make person happiest woman in world in such emergency a be not justified in saying that little cause of displeasure may have existed between must now be forgotten if will think of really amount to nothing for have esteem of friend affection of father in law more devoted wife than daughter doe not live be man come to let make much of know be writing sends love have not told her of subject lest must be wild with hope affectionately yours henry lovelace letter a read moved to tear when have finished reading told that be impossible there be one phrase in letter went sorely against grain with dean told to be man did dean mean to imply that conduct hitherto have be unmanly chapter xlix must come here for week lord george germain be very much troubled by nobility of dean offer felt sure that must not accept felt at same time that must be almost a difficult to decline to accept what else be to do where be to go how be now to exercise authority over wife with what face must call upon to leave father house when have house of own to to take there be doubt house in london be house peculiarly disagreeable to might go abroad then what must become of mother sister have trained to think that presence be necessary to very existence of family mother though ill treated be quite of same opinion there must be declaration of break up made to world if be to take far away from manor cross in difficulty of course consulted lady sarah what other counsellor be possible to be very fair with sister trying to explain everything to everything with one two exception of course said nothing of houghton correspondence did give exactly true account of scene at mr montacute jones ball succeeded in making lady sarah understand though accused wife of nothing felt to be incumbent on to make completely subject to own authority doubt be wrong to waltz after what told said lady sarah very wrong be simply high spirit suppose think understands how circumspect young married woman ought to be said anxious husband doe not see how very much such high spirit may injure enables enemy to say such terrible thing why must have enemy george then lord george merely whispered brother name why must brotherton care to be enemy because of dean must not suffer for of course george mary be very different be young be old have be brought up to pleasure of life disregard perhaps because never came in way be beautiful soft woman such a men like to have near never be such one see peril pitfall in way fancy be prone to exaggerate because can not sympathise with yearning often condemn frivolity at same time condemn own severity think be true of heart loving woman be at rate wife suppose that wish to be rid of certainly not in keeping close to must remember that have nature of own can not feel a do in thing more than feel a doe one must give way to other must give way to other if there be to be happiness mean to say ought to waltz dance stage dance let go for present wo want to dance much for time now when have baby in arm will be more apt to look at thing with eye if be must accept

ultimately make a to home for mary can not yet say when anything be settled will of course let know at once will always be at rate one of chief object to make comfortable think that must be done under roof not under yours hope to be able to see in day two when perhaps will have be able to settle upon something yours always affectionately g germain then upon reading over feeling that be cold almost heartless added postscript do feel offer to be very generous think will understand reason make impossible must accept dean a read declared to that knew reason very well reason be not far to search man be pigheaded foolish obstinately proud so dean thought a far a be concerned lord george presence in house must not be comfort to lord george have never be pleasant companion to must have put up with

assumed disgust papa doe hate half a much a do said papa always doe forgive at last never can forgive mr groschut have poor man done be so nasty see that face always shine man with shiny face ought to be hated be very well to give a reason mary entertained very correct idea a to mr groschut opinion of not word have be said between husband wife a to great question of residence till have returned to deanery after walk then lord george found unable to conceal from offer dean have made oh george why come must not be fitting fitting why not fitting think must fit admirably know must fit then leaned over took hand kissed be very good of father be sure meant to be good be very good of father lord george repeated very good indeed can not be married woman must live in husband house not in father

george be that said where devil have be have be to grumby be people doing at grumby much same a usual be coal blanket account oh coal blanket account hope liked then folded afresh in cloak ate strawberry looked a though have taken sufficient notice of brother matter be very important to lord george nothing ever seemed to be of importance to marquis might be very probable that marquis with dozen servant behind must drive up to door at manor cross without having given hour notice of intention seemed to be too probable to lord george that such must be case now for what other reason must be there then there be back though have quarrelled be bound to ask after brother back when last two have met marquis have be almost carried into room by two men hope find better than when last saw said after pause of five minute have not much to boast of can just travel be how be popenjoy upon word ca tell have never seemed to be very well when have seen hope account have be better said lord george with solicitude coal blanket account suggested marquis then conversation be again brought to end for five minute be essential that lord george must know whither brother be going if to manor cross then thought lord george must stay at inn at brotherton anything even deanery must be better than sitting at table with brother with insult of last interview unappeased at end of five minute plucked up courage asked brother question be going to house brotherton house what house be going to house hope mean to manor cross not if know there be house in part of country in must be le likely to show face then there be not word said till reached brotherton station there marquis who be sitting next door requested brother to leave carriage first get out will said must wait for somebody to come take thing trample on more than can help last request have apparently be made because lord george be unable to step across without treading on cloak will say good bye then said lord george turning round on platform for moment ta ta said marquis a gave attention to servant who be collecting fruit flower flask lord george then passed on out of station saw more of brother of course be going to rudham said lady susanna when heard story rudham park be seat of mr de baron mr houghton father tidings have reached manor cross long since that marquis have promised to go there in autumn doubt other circumstance have seemed to make improbable that promise must be kept popenjoy have gone away ill a many said in dying condition then marquis have be thrown into fireplace report have said that back have be broken have certainly be generally thought that marquis must go nowhere after affair in fireplace till returned to italy lady susanna be in truth right lordship be on way to rudham park mr de baron of rudham park though much older man than marquis have be marquis friend when marquis came of age being then popenjoy of day fast young man known a such about england mr de baron who be neighbour have taken by hand mr de baron have put in way of buying training race horse have perhaps be godfather to pleasure in other matter rudham park have never be loved at manor cross by others

have brought here do though a to not bringing here why must bring if go off with will with somebody else sooner better according to idea be matter upon mr de baron be not prepared to dilate therefore changed subject dear lord giblet be such pleasure to to meet here old mr jones said to young nobleman when be told be to be at rudham determined at once be true for there be more persistent friend living than old mr jones though might be doubted whether on occasion lord giblet be friend on whose behalf have come to rudham be very nice be said lord giblet gasping have pleasant time of with little party in grosvenor place never liked anything so much in life only think that fellow jack de baron dance so much better than other people after who say doe will tell who dance well olivia green be charming in kappa kappa think so uncommon pretty lord giblet be quite willing to be understood to admire miss patmore green though thought hard that people must hurry on into matrimony most graceful girl ever saw in life certainly said mr montacute jones royal highness when heard of engagement said that be happiest man in london lord giblet must not satisfy by declaring that hrh be old fool a poor mary have done on certain occasion at present moment did not feel at loyal to royal family generally did in least know how to answer mr jones have declared engagement a fact did not quite dare to deny altogether have in unguarded moment when weather have be warm champagne cool said word with so definite meaning that lady have be justified in not allowing to pas by a idle lady have accepted on following morning have found lock of hair little stud have given have feverish reminiscence of kiss surely be not bird to be caught with so small grain of salt a that have not a yet seen mr patmore green having escaped from london at once have answered note from olivia have called dearest charlie by counter note in have called dear o have signed ever yours g promising to meet up river of course have not gone up river rest of season might certainly be done without assistance from knew that must be pursued must not hope not to be pursued have not thought that mr montacute jones must be so quick upon be impossible that hrh must have heard of engagement a yet what nasty false wicked old woman be blushed red a rose stammered out that did know be only four twenty perhaps did know never saw girl so much in love in life continued mr jones know just a well a if be own speaks to a doe dare to speak to at present though be barely twenty one have be very much sought after already very day marries have ten thousand pound in own hand be large fortune of course want large fortune be girl can pay sum straight into husband bank moment marries indeed said lord giblet be still determined that nothing must induce to marry miss green nevertheless behind resolution there be feeling that if anything must bring about marriage such sum of ready money must be consolation father earl of jopling though very rich man kept little close ten thousand pound must be nice then perhaps old woman be lying now will tell what want to do said mr jones who be resolved that if game be not landed must not be fault go from here to killancodlem next week must come join have got to go grouse at stranbracket said lord giblet happy in excuse must be better be within eight mile of dunkeld if so then rope must take to stranbracket year of course will come be prettiest place in perth though say a ought will be there if really want to know girl see in country house did really want to know girl be very nice liked uncommonly did want to know anything more about by george be man to be persecuted way because have once spooned girl little too fiercely a thought of almost plucked up courage sufficiently to tell mr jones that have better pick out other young man for deportation to killancodlem must like ever so said will take care that will like lord giblet think may boast that when put wit to work can make house agreeable be very fond of young people there be one love a do olivia green there be young woman in london have so much to be loved for of course will come what day will name think must name day let say th will give nearly week at grouse first be with to dinner on th well perhaps will of course will will write to olivia to night daresay will do so also lord giblet when be let to go tried to suck consolation from l though be still resolved almost believed that mr montacute jones must conquer write to olivia to night lying false old woman of course knew that there be hardly lady in england to whom be so little likely that must write a to miss patmore green how must old woman with one foot in grave be so wicked why must persecute what have done to olivia green be not daughter even niece so be going to killancodlem mr houghton said to that afternoon have asked said lord giblet be simply most comfortable house in scotland tell of best deer stalking everybody like to get to killancodlem love old mr jones charming old woman friend if once take to never drop stick like wax must say quite like wax lord giblet when make up mind to do thing always doe be quite wonderful never get beaten doe now never have asked to killancodlem yet hope will manly resolution now roused in lord giblet bosom that must be person to beat mr jones at last yet doubted if be asked

be dean bitterest enemy must therefore be thought be welcome bishop have be asked a mr de baron be one who found expedient to make sacrifice to respectability a be well known bishop never went anywhere except to clerical house mr groschut who be younger man knew that behoved to be thing to men that must not be efficacious among sinner unless must allow to be seen in path care be of course taken that lady alice must find alone with brother be probably expected that marquis must be regarded a le of ogre in country if be known that have have communication with one of family without quarrelling with so be come here said did know that people so pious must enter de baron door mr de baron be very old friend of canon hope be very wicked be afraid be not very pious if object of course

buttered on side let stick to side say so will regard none of family a on friendly term with who associate with dean of brotherton daughter after what took place up in london lady alice felt to be distinct threat to herself allowed to pas by without notice be quite sure that canon must not quarrel with dean out of deference to brother in law fact be must have gone away a told especially when george have married girl got money make much difference to will make deal to how be popenjoy brotherton asked lady alice anxious to change conversation know anything about what have gone back to italy

from cathedral town few other new comer have arrived on previous day mr groschut who be sitting next to canon have declared opinion that after marquis of brotherton be very affable nobleman be civil enough said canon when people do just what want man of rank position of course expects to have deference paid to man of rank position must be very careful of right of others mr groschut be afraid brother did make troublesome be one of family canon therefore of course know about know nothing at about mr groschut must be acknowledged that dean behaved very badly violence personal violence from clergyman to man of rank probably know what took place in room be sure 'd rather trust dean than marquis day dean man be clergyman of course be father if have be very much in wrong must have heard more about through police can not absolve clergyman for using personal violence said mr groschut very grandly must have borne anything sooner than degrade sacred calling mr groschut have hoped to

must have be impossible that must be really jealous though captain de baron have be there whole day be jealous except with caesarian jealousy lest must be unfortunate enough to cause whisper derogatory to marital dignity matter have be fully discussed at manor cross manor cross conclave meaning of course lady sarah have thought that mary must be brought to house if only for day two if only that people in brothershire might know that there have be no quarrel between husband that must have visited father might be considered a natural need not be accounted a quite unnatural that must have done so without husband now now be imperative that brothershire must know that mother of future lord popenjoy be on good term with family of course position be very much altered lady susanna have said in private to lady amelia old marchioness felt real longing to see dear mary to ask becoming question a to condition be quite understood that be not to be required to make cloak petticoat garment respecting must be solicitous for next six month must a marchioness felt be of very august nature oh that future baby might be born at manor cross marchioness did not see why lord george must leave

day seems to be great happiness if go then of course will take with there be reality about conquered even in spite of captain de baron so that came down to dinner in good humour with world chapter lvi sir henry said be only thing dinner at deanery went off without much excitement captain de baron must of course have preferred that lord george must have remained at manor cross under circumstance must have have much more to say to lady understood other now be quite certain that evil thing spoken of have be sheer slander yet have managed to tell everything of without subjecting to undying anger when left drawing room conversation turned again upon great popenjoy question from certain word fell from dean jack be enabled to surmise lord george have reason to hope that heir might be born to doe not look a though must live long said dean speaking of marquis trust may with heart said lord george be question replied dean only say that doe look like lord george went away early jack de baron

will only hold tongue be quite sure that did not love be sure also that be proper way of making love then thought of gu mildmay must not in pure charity do good turn to poor girl might not tell captain de baron that be duty to marry if felt to be duty must not do so may be doubted whether in moment did not think much better of captain de baron than gentleman deserved on next day manor cross

cheer told that there be good day coming have be there for nearly hour together mary be becoming unhappy if father be allowed to go without recognition from family must never again be friend with woman be beginning to think that never must be friend again with of when door opened lady sarah entered room greeting be very civil on side lady sarah must if pleased be gracious though be always little grand dean be quite willing to be pleased if only effort be made to please lady sarah hoped that must stay dine must perhaps excuse marchioness a rarely now left room dean must not dine at manor cross on day then lady sarah asked to come on thursday following chapter lvii mr knox hears again from marquis do come papa said mary jumping up putting arm round father shoulder be more than willing to meet half way must sit in arm chair morning try to drink porter at lunch if must receive father graciously of course be bound to husband did not wish not to be bound to be quite sure that loved husband with perfect love marriage happiness must not be complete unless father be to make part of intimate home circle of life be now so animated in request to that manner told little story not only to to lady sarah also will say do come also said lady sarah smiling mary looked up at saw smile if be papa said must be a anxious a be also smiled a spoke even though be not be anxious who must

lady sarah a soon a have left of course understand be very very sorry that lord brotherton have quarrelled wo say anything now about anybody being wrong anybody being right must be dreadful to if papa must come to see think know what be do know that love very dearly of course do there be nothing on earth must do for be always trying to make happy 'd do just a much for george if george must let have be very good about love for lady sarah be quite open to charm of being loved did not talk much of such thing be compatible with nature to make many profession of affection must be happiness to if young sister in law who must doubt sooner later be female head of house must be taught to love so kissed mary then walked demurely away conscious that great display of feeling must be antagonistic to principle during hour that mary have be closeted with father there have be much difficulty among lady upstairs about dean suggestion that must be asked to dine have of course come from lady sarah fell like little thunderbolt among in first place what must brotherton say be not understood portion of agreement under be allowed to live in house that dean must not be guest there lady susanna have even shuddered at coming to call on daughter have thought to be improper when short time since have personally brought news of popenjoy death to house then there be own resentment a to affray at scumberg be probably inclined to agree with lady brabazon that brotherton be not quite that must be still be brotherton man who have nearly murdered must not surely be fit guest at manor cross think can do sarah lady susanna have said after long silence oh dear must be very dreadful marchioness have exclaimed lady amelia have clasped hand together have trembled in limb lady sarah who never made suggestion without deep thought be always loth to abandon that have made clung to with many argument seeing how unreasonable brotherton be must not feel bound to obey a to house while mother lived there must be regarded a house be out of question that must have guest dictated to by brother perhaps dean be not that dean ought to be then who be perfect george have married daughter must not be right to separate daughter from father then came final strong clenching argument mary must certainly be disturbed in mind if not allowed to see father perfect tranquillity for mary be regarded a chief ingredient in cup of prosperity after many trouble be now to be re brewed for germain family if be not allowed to see father coming popenjoy must suffer for 'd better let come susanna said marchioness through tear susanna have looked a stern a old sibyl really think will be best said lady amelia ought to be done said lady sarah suppose have better go to said marchioness must not see indeed must wo want to see lady susanna did not yield lady sarah a know went down on mission of peace mary a soon a be alone sat down to write letter to husband be then monday father be to dine there on thursday triumph must hardly be complete unless george must come home to receive letter be full of argument full of entreaty full of love surely might come for one night if must stay longer must be so much nicer for father to have gentleman there attention must please so much be sure must go twice distance if be coming to house pleaded mary lord george came in quiet way dinner be success dean made very agreeable marchioness did not appear absence be attributed to condition of health lady sarah a great promoter of festival be bound to be on good behaviour lady amelia endeavoured to copy elder sister be not to be expected that lady susanna must be cordially hospitable be known that lady susanna be habitually silent in company mary must forgive second sister in law sullenness understanding a did quite well that be at moment triumphing over lady susanna mr groschut be not favourite with of party at manor cross dean made pleasant by describing nature of late chaplain promotion begged bishop to let off said dean lordship be peremptory be pugsty leave diocese what have done papa asked mary have promised to marry hawkins daughter hawkins be brotherton bookseller on low church side then denied promise unfortunately have written letter hawkins took to bishop must have thought groschut must have be too sharp to write letter what be that to bishop asked lord george bishop be think just little tired of bishop be old meek mr groschut thought that must domineer did not quite know man bishop be old meek must have borne much when mr groschut scolded fancy that said nothing bided time when mr hawkins came then there be decision pronounced be pugsty nothing be pugsty very nasty papa be very nice fancy just border on pottery population be heavy a must marry bookseller daughter also union fear wo be very grateful see why bishop must send bad man to parish suggested lady sarah what be to do with groschut when have unfortunately got hold of one must be turned out to starve bishop must never have be rid of small living such thing a pugsty be almost necessity people said lady sarah what be to become of poor people let hope may like at rate will be better at pugsty than at brotherton in way evening passed off when at ten o'clock dean took departure be felt by one except lady susanna that proper thing have be done lord george having thus come back to manor cross remained there be not altogether happy in mind banishment seemed to be so absurd thing that did not return to london at manor cross there be something for to do in london there be nothing after there be question whether a pure matter of right marquis have power to pronounce sentence manor cross doubt belonged to then so also did cross hall belong for time to mother be receiving rent of cross hall while mother be living at manor cross lady sarah be quite clear that for present be justified in regarding manor cross a belonging to who will tell when be way out there asked mary never did hear of such thing in life what harm can do to house george so went on in peace quietness for next three month during not single word be heard from marquis did not even know where be under present circumstance did not care to ask question of mr knox lord george have worn out scruple be able to go about old duty in old fashion dean have dined there once twice lord george on one occasion have consented to stay with wife for night two at deanery thing seemed to have fallen back quietly into old way a be before marquis with wife child have come to disturb of course there be great difference in mary position be not only that be about to become mother that must do so in very peculiar manner have not marquis taken wife to there must always have be probability that must day do so have there not be italian marchioness little italian popenjoy lady at manor cross must still have given credit for presenting with future marchioness future popenjoy at future day now turn have a be gone popenjoy from side be not to be expected in consequence of mary be very much exalted none of now wished for popenjoy from elder branch hope be centred in mary to mary importance have drawback there be great porter question still unsettled arm chair with footstool still be there did not like being told that mile half on sunny side of tree be daily amount of exercise sir henry nearly century ago have prescribed for lady in condition have husband with must with be gently rebellious affectionately disobedient be great thing at rate to be somebody in early married day have felt to be snubbed a being merely dean daughter present trouble brought certain balm with one snubbed now if have mind for arrowroot mr toff must make suggest thimbleful of brandy in with most coaxing word cloak petticoat never saw be quite at liberty to stay away from afternoon church if pleased have be decided after many discussion on subject that husband must go up to town for couple of month after christmas lady amelia going with to look after porter arrowroot that in march must be brought back to manor cross with view to confinement have not be conceded to easily have at last be conceded have learned in secret from father that must come up to town for part of time after never let question rest till have carried point marchioness have be obliged to confess that in anticipation of popenjoy sir henry have recommended change from country to town did not probably remember that sir henry have done so because have be very cross at idea of being kept running down to country through may mary pleaded that be use having house if be not allowed to see that thing be in london at last declared that must be very convenient to have baby born in london then marchioness saw that compromise be necessary be not to be endured that future popenjoy future brotherton must be born in little house in munster court with many misgiving be at last arranged that mary must go to london on th of january be brought back on th of march after many consultation computation calculation be considered that baby must be born somewhere about st of april may be said that thing at manor cross be quite in halcyon condition when suddenly thunderbolt fell among mr knox appeared one day at house showed to lord george letter from marquis be written with usual contempt of ordinary courtesy of correspondence with more than usual bitterness declared writer opinion that brother be mean fellow deserving of trust in have continued to live at house after having be desired to leave by owner went on to give peremptory order to mr knox to take step for letting house at once took place at end of first week in december then there be postscript to letter in marquis suggested that mr knox have better take house for marchioness apply mr price rent in payment for such house of course will consult mother said postscript must not be anywhere near brotherton there be impudence a well a cruelty about almost shook belief lord george still held in position of elder brother mr knox be to take house a though mother sister have right freedom of own of course will go said almost pale with anger then mr knox explained view be intention to write back to marquis to decline to execute task imposed upon care of marquis property be doubt chief mainstay there be thing said must not do of course marquis must employ someone else must look for bread elsewhere must not said bring to take step for letting of manor cross a long a marchioness be living there of course there be terrible disturbance in house there arose great question whether old lady must must not be told of new trouble be decided at last that must for present be kept in dark mr knox be of opinion that house never must be let that must not be in lordship power to turn out without procuring for use of cross hall in mr price newly married bride have made comfortable on lease of three year be also of opinion that attempt made by marquis to banish brother be piece of monstrous tyranny to attention must be paid said before younger lady to lord george said even more expressed doubt whether marquis must be in right mind added whisper that account of marquis health be very bad indeed of course must let house asked lord george yes if can get anybody to let for anybody else to take think ever will be let wo quite know what to do when get letter can hardly change agent without coming to london wo like to do in winter will write very savage letter then in week two will answer think 'd disturb marchioness if be lord marchioness be not disturbed lord george again went up to london on occasion occupying house in munster court in solitude scruple be renewed be in vain that lady sarah repeated to mr knox argument have be called mean fellow word rankled with walked about alone thinking of absolute obedience with in early day have complied with behest of elder brother perfect faith with in latter day have regarded that brother interest went away swearing to that must never again put foot within domain of manor cross a long a be brother property day might come when must return there lord george be not man to anticipate own prosperity mary wished to accompany be not allowed marchioness inquired dozen time why must go away there be one who must tell chapter lviii mr jones letter few day before christmas mary received long letter from friend mr montacute jones at

contained tidings more le accurate concerning many person named in chronicle will be given entire mr montacute jones be great writer of letter be wont to communicate many detail among friend

great deal to must excuse if say that really can not talk to more then got up walked out of room leaving mr houghton among treasure in dining room rang bell told servant to open door when lady upstairs came down after very short pause lady upstairs did come down walked out to carriage with unabashed demeanour after much consideration lady george determined that must tell husband what have occurred be aware that have be very uncourteous be not sure whether in anger have not be carried further than became nothing must thought shake in determination to have further friendly intercourse of

likely that must have spoken of of own silence be quite sure how have come to pas that woman have have face to come to must be that lord george have instigated to do so never made enquiry of husband a to where went whom saw for aught that knew might be in berkeley square day then called to mind mr houghton face with paint visible on in broad day blackened eyebrow great crested helmet of false hair nearly eighteen inch deep affected voice false manner then told that be impossible that husband must like creature george said to abruptly a soon a came home who do think have be here mr houghton have be here then came that old frown across brow did not know at first whether be occasioned by anger against against mr houghton think be very unfortunate what did say wanted to be friend with what did

have balance at banker be certainly case dr fleabody have made proselyte by hundred disturbed happiness of many father of family may easily be conceived that be gall wormwood to baroness banmann baroness on arrival in london have anticipated success low bred american female have achieved be not simply honour of thing be very great must have be very dear to baroness american doctor be making rapid fortune out of proceeds of hall have on one occasion threatened to strike lecturing unless be allowed certain very large percentage on sum taken at door steward director of institute have found compelled to give way to demand have consequently lodged magnificently at langham hotel have set up brougham in always have driven to institute be asked out to dinner three four time week whereas baroness be in very poor condition have indeed succeeded in getting invited to mr de baron house from time to time raised little money from who be unfortunate enough to come in way be sensible of own

at law at last have be advised to proceed conjointly against aunt ju lady selina protest bald headed old gentleman business have now be brought into proper form trial be to take place in march be cause of much trouble to poor mary of very great vexation to lord george when feud be first becoming furious enormous advertisement be issued by dr fleabody friend in cause be advocated claim recapitulated to be appended list of nobility gentry people of england who supported disability generally cause in particular among name be very numerous appeared that of lady george germain might probably have escaped notice husband have not paper be sent to with usual friendly zeal by old lady brabazon oh george said look here what right have to say so never patronised anything went there once when came to london first because miss mildmay asked must not have gone said have have that before need not scold again there must be great harm in going to hear lecture occurred just previous to going down to manor cross that journey be to be made for so important object then lord george did just what ought not to have done wrote angry letter to miss fleabody a called complaining bitterly of insertion of wife name dr fleabody be quite clever enough to make fresh capital out of withdrew name explaining that have be ordered to do so by lady husband implying that thereby additional evidence be supplied that disability of woman be absolutely crushing to sex in england mary when saw paper did not reach till be at manor cross be violent in anxiety to write in own name disclaim disability husband by time have be advised to have nothing further to do with dr fleabody mary be forced to keep indignation to herself worse than followed annoyance of advertisement man came way down from london for purpose of serving lady george with subpoena to give evidence at trial on part of baroness lord george be up in london at time never having entered house at manor cross even park since visit to italy consternation of lady may be imagined poor mary be certainly not in condition to go into court of law must be le so on day fixed for trial yet awful document seemed to to sister in law to be so imperative a to admit of escape be in vain that lady sarah with considerable circumlocution endeavoured to explain to messenger true state of case man must simply say that be only messenger have now done work looked at in light thing be very terrible lord george might probably even yet be able to run away with to obscure corner of continent in messenger from queen judge must not be able to find might perhaps bear journey without injury then what must become of baby perhaps of popenjoy so born there be many who still thought that marquis must go before baby came in case baby must at once be popenjoy what condition be for marchioness to be in at moment of birth of eldest child know anything about nasty woman said mary through tear be such pity that must ever have gone said lady

there be still ten day to trial twenty day by computation to great event there be of course various letter written to lord george lady sarah wrote very sensibly suggesting that must go to mr family lawyer lady susanna be full of original sin of unfortunate visit to disability be however of opinion that if mary be concealed in certain room at manor cross might thought be sufficiently warmed ventilated for health judge of queen bench must never be able to find baby in case must have be born at manor cross posterity must know nothing about room mary letter be almost hysterically miserable knew nothing about horrid people what did want to say have done be to go to lecture to give wicked woman guinea must george come take away must care where went nothing on earth must make go up stand before judge be said very cruel did hope that george must come to at once if did come thought that must die nothing of course be said to marchioness be found impossible to keep matter from mr toff mr toff be of opinion that bit of paper must be burned that further notice must be taken of matter at if go have to pay l said mr toff with great authority mr toff remembering that brother of hers who have forgotten in liquor at brotherton assize have be fined l for not answering to name a juryman then really have to pay said mr toff who remembered also that good natured judge have not at last exacted penalty lady sarah must not look at matter in light be sure that if witness be really wanted that witness must not escape by paying fine next morning there came heartrending letter from aunt ju be very sorry that lady george must have be so troubled then let think of trouble of misery be quite sure that must kill must certainly ruin odious baroness have summoned everybody have ever befriended captain de baron have be summoned marquis mr montacute jones whole expense according to aunt ju must fall upon for seemed to be opinion of lawyer that have hired baroness then said very severe thing against disability generally there be that woman fleabody making fortune in hall must take none of expense upon thought that such thing must be left to men who after be not so mean a woman so at least said aunt ju then there be new cause for wonderment lord brotherton have be summoned must lord brotherton come believed that be dying if so surely must not be made to come be not horrible said lady susanna that people of rank must be made subject to annoyance if anybody can summon anybody nobody can ever be sure of herself on next morning lord george came down to brotherton mary with carriage full of precaution be sent into deanery to meet marchioness discovered that journey be to be made be full of misgiving full of enquiry in present condition mother expectant ought not to be allowed to make journey at marchioness remembered how sir henry have told before popenjoy be born that carriage exercise be bad why must go to deanery who must say whether dean must let come away again what feather must be in dean cap if next popenjoy be born at deanery be explained to that in other way must see husband then poor old woman be once more loud in denouncing misconduct of youngest son to head of family mary made journey in perfect safety then be able to tell father whole story never heard of anything so absurd in life said dean suppose must go papa not yard wo come fetch fetch doe mean nothing very little wo attempt to examine people have summoned that baroness probably think that will get money out of if worst come to worst must send medical certificate will do of course will when george be here will get dr loftly will make straight for need not trouble about at woman at manor cross be old enough to have known better lord george came be very angry quite agreed a to dr loftly who be sent for who did give certificate who took upon to assure lady george that judge in land must not enforce attendance a long a have certificate in hand lord george be vexed beyond measure that wife name must have be called in question must not refrain from cross word two be so imprudent going to such place oh george be to have again why must have gone asked dean be in favour of right of woman not particularly though if there be right have got thoroughly wish that might get certainly believe in baroness banmann yet in dr fleabody think must have be wrong in going in good company to hear what crazy old woman might have to say be very foolish said lord george see have come of how must tell george thought have promised that must scold more nasty fat old woman be sure did want to hear then lord george went back to town with medical certificate in pocket mary being in present condition afraid of authority be unable to stay be happy even for one evening with father during month disability created considerable interest throughout london of dr fleabody reaped full advantage baroness be so loud in clamour that forced question of disability on public mind generally result be that world flocked to institute baroness a heard of became louder louder be not that wanted who wished to sympathise with must send money not go to hall to hear that loud imbecile american female baroness when desired to be little doctor always called female baroness though in truth be not personally attractive did contrive to surround with supporter in day moved into comfortable lodging in wigmore street very few be heard to speak in favour who contributed to relief of necessity be many be found to be almost impossible to escape from without leaving amount of money in hand then in happy hour came at last across old gentleman who did appreciate her wrong how be that got introduction to mr philogunac coelebs be not think ever known be not improbable that having heard of soft heart peculiar propensity wealth contrived to introduce be however suddenly understood that mr philogunac coelebs who be bachelor very rich have taken her by hand intended to bear expense of trial be after general intimation have be made to world in matter that summons for lady mary have be sent down to manor cross now in halcyon day of march baroness also have brougham be to

philogunac coelebs who be not superior to mild joke stop from piping altogether in dis contry said baroness who in midst of wrath zeal labour be superior to joke two day before fixed for trial there fell great blow upon who be interested in matter blow be heavy on mr coelebs heavier still on attornies baroness have taken off when enquiry be made be found that be at madrid mr snape one of lawyer be person who first informed mr coelebs did so in manner clearly implied that expected mr coelebs to pay bill then mr snape encountered terrible disappointment mr coelebs be driven to confess own disgrace have said never undertaken to pay cost of trial have unfortunately given lady thousand pound to enable to pay expense mr snape expostulated later on urged with much persistency that mr coelebs have more than once attended in person at office of messrs snape cashett in matter lawyer did not prevail have taken order from lady must look to lady for payment who best knew mr philogunac coelebs thought that have escaped cheaply a there have be many fear that must make baroness altogether own be so glad have gone said mary when heard story must never have felt safe while woman be in country be quite sure of one thing will never have anything more to do with disability george need not be afraid about chapter lxi news come home during last day of glory of baroness when be driving

of philosophy did receive a true declared to herself that must harbour in heart of heart lesson have given a to own child lesson must be noble a tended to well being of world at large to make child able to do good to others to assist in making able anxious to do so to train from first in way what wish must be more worthy of mother than yet humility homely carefulness inculcated by lady sarah be not that lesson also true assuredly yes yet how must combine two be unaware that within there be power certain intellectual alembic of be quite unconscious by must distil good of quietly leave residuum behind a being of moment chapter lxii will lord george came back to england a quick a train must carry with came sad mournful burden have to be deposited in vault of parish church at manor cross there must be decent tombstone now that life be gone with decent word upon decent effigy even though there have be nothing decent in man life long line of past marquis must be perpetuated frederic augustus tenth peer of name must be made to lie with others lord george therefore for be still lord george till after funeral travelled with sad burden deputy undertaker having special charge of rested for few hour in london mr knox met in mr stokes chamber there learned that brother who have made many will in time have made one last will just before left london after return from rudham park mr stokes took aside told that must find will to be unfavourable thought property be entailed said lord george very calmly mr stokes assented with many assurance a to impregnability of family acre family house added that there be money that furniture have belonged to late marquis to dispose of a pleased be matter of consequence said lord george whom loss of money furniture did not in truth at vex early on following morning went down to brotherton leaving undertaker to follow a quickly a might must enter house now to a be driven home under oak doubt there came idea of own possession of idea be much le vivid than dean be chiefly confined to recollection that one must now turn out of home in have be born in mother sister wife be living have elder brother be man of whom must have be proud almost think must have be more contented a younger brother be over at last be first word said to wife not finding to be more important that greatness be beginning than that humiliation must be brought to end funeral took place with state that undertaker must give to in little village with other honour lord george be chief mourner almost only one one two neighbour came mr de baron from rudham park such of farmer a have be long on land among being mr price there be one person among number whom one have expected be jack de baron have be mentioned in will said mr stokes very gravely to lord george perhaps must not object to asking to be present lord george did not object though certainly captain de baron be last person whom must have thought of asking to manor cross on occasion be made welcome however with grave courtesy what on earth have brought here said old mr de baron to cousin in least know got letter from lawyer saying have better come thought everybody be to be here who have ever seen have left money jack said mr de baron what will give for chance said jack mr de baron though be much given to gambling speculation did not on occasion make offer after funeral be sadder even than funeral be in general though tear be shed will be read in library at manor cross lord george being present together with mr knox mr stokes two de baron dean might have wished to be there have written early on that morning affectionate letter to son in law excusing from being present at funeral think know have said that must do anything to promote welfare to gratify feeling there have unfortunately be that between late marquis must make attendance seem to be mockery did not go near manor cross on day one knew better than not even mr knox that dead lord have possessed power of alienating stick brick upon property will be very short upshot of be that shilling of marquis died possessed together with house at como furniture contained in three house be left to old friend jack de baron took liberty said mr stokes to inform lordship must die before wife widow must be entitled to third of personal property replied that whatever widow must claim by law must get without act of mention a captain de baron may perhaps be willing that widow of late marquis may be at once regarded a possessed of third of property quite so said jack who have suddenly become a solemn funereal a mr stokes be now engaged to gu mildmay with vengeance when solemnity of meeting be over lord george marquis a must now be called congratulated young heir with exquisite grace be so severed from brother of late said that have not known of friendship never saw in life till met down at rudham said jack be civil to there because seemed to be ill sent once to fetch ten pound note thought odd went after that seemed to take to good deal took to to purpose captain de baron a to did not want certainly must not have got need not for moment think that be robbing be so good of said jack whose thought however be too full of gu mildmay to allow of thorough enjoyment of unexpected prosperity stokes say that after widow be paid legacy duty there will be eight twenty thousand pound whispered mr de baron to relative by heaven be lucky fellow be rather lucky will be fourteen hundred year if only look out for good investment man with ready money at own disposal can always get five per cent at least never heard of such fluke in life be fluke certainly will marry now settle down suppose suppose will said jack one have to come to kind of thing at last knew when be going to rudham that d thing must come of oh of course be awfully glad be sure to come sooner later suppose have have run have just seen stokes say be to go to in about month time thought must have got of to morrow dear fellow can let have couple of hundred if want said mr de baron who have never hitherto be induced to advance shilling when young cousin have be needy mr stokes mr knox mr de baron heir went away leaving family to adjust own affair in new position then mary received third lecture a sat leaning upon husband shoulder at rate wo have to go away more have said to have be always away for ever so long be who must go to deanery when left london know that of course wanted to see papa then want to talk about more only wo go away again when do will go with wo be going away going away be taking off by must help know must have gone with be over now be hope so will be over when other trouble be done will go to london then will depend on health dear be very well why must be well when month be over then

george do so hate house in st james square will never be happy there be like prison then gave lecture love must not talk of hating thing be necessary why be st james square necessary because be town residence belonging to family munster court be very well for a be before indeed be much too good a felt hour be there be more than must afford without drawing upon father for assistance like being drawn upon said mary think there be anything papa like so much a to be drawn upon must make difference to dear think that a yet understand money matter hope never will then hope will will be duty to do so a be saying house at munster court will be unsuitable to a lady brotherton on hearing mary pouted made grimace there be dignity to be borne though may be onerous must be supported hate dignity must not say that if knew how vexed must have chosen for personally perhaps must have taken position think that be by nature ambitious man be bound to do duty in position in find placed so be woman will be duty to live in ugly house perhaps house may be made le ugly to live in will certainly be part of duty if love mary do want to tell whether love loving a know do be sure will not neglect duty say again that hate dignity must never forget now that be marchioness of brotherton never will george be right dear said omitting to understand little satire conveyed in word will come easy to before long must have world feel that be mistress of rank to have be raised of course have be different hitherto said endeavouring in own mind to excuse indiscretion of kappa kappa lecture also turned to wholesome food digested obtaining from strength throwing off bombast by weaker mind might have be inflated understood at rate that st james square must be doom while acknowledging to herself made little resolution that good deal must have to be done to house before be ready for reception that doing must require considerable time when heard purport of late lord will be much surprised more surprised probably than jack why must man who be so universally bad such horror leave money to one who be so so so good a jack de baron epithet came to at last in preference to other what must do now george have told that sum must be very large of course must marry if pleased at rate must not go to perim idea that must go to perim have made uncomfortable perhaps have better marry gu mildmay be not quite that wife must be have said that must do so in certain circumstance circumstance have come round be right that must keep word yet made somewhat melancholy to think that must marry gu mildmay very shortly after when be becoming aware that event ought to have taken place on st of april must not be much longer delayed there came home to various thing containing lecture almost a severe perhaps more eloquent than have received from sister father husband there be infinity of clothes someone have ordered for on thing must bear mark there be coronet coronet on pockethandkerchiefs seemed to be without end there be funereal note paper on black edge be not more visible than black coronet there came invoice to from tradesman addressed to marchioness of brotherton then there came first letter from father with rank title on envelope at first be almost afraid to open chapter lxiii popenjoy be born christened at last not much above week after calculation in glory of purple of manor

have new heir real popenjoy old marchioness when baby be shown to for awhile forgot sorrow triumphed with rest dean anxiety have be so great that have insisted on remaining at house have be found impossible to refuse request made at time now at last lady at manor cross gradually forgave dean offence to old dowager did not mention name probably forgot existence marquis appeared to live with on term of perfect friendship sister succumbed to circumstance allowed to talk to a though be in truth father of reigning marchioness will be understood that for forty eight hour before birth of child for forty eight hour afterwards manor cross be moved in matter a though be first male child born into world since installation of new golden age be great thing that after recent trouble popenjoy proper popenjoy must be born at manor cross of english parent healthy boy bouncing little lord a mr toff called event almost justified prophetic spirit in grandmother spoke of new advent little angel said know will grow up to bring new honour to family do a much for a great grandfather great grandfather spoken of have be earl great in borough mongery have be made marquis by pitt on score of vote george went on to say do hope there will be bell bonfire that tenant will be allowed to see there be bell bonfire in day tenant be perhaps busier men than formerly have le in certainly of spirit of heir worship than father mr price with bride did come down see baby on occasion gallant husband bade wife remember that although have be married more than twelve month after lord george baby must only be three month younger whereupon mr price boxed husband ear to great delight of mr toff who be dispensing sherry cherry brandy in own sitting room dean joy though le ecstatic in expression be quite a deep quite a triumphant a of marchioness when be admitted for moment to daughter bedside tear rolled down face a prayed for blessing for baby lady sarah be in room began to doubt whether have read man character aright there be ineffable tenderness about sweetness of manner low melody of voice gracious solemnity in piety seemed to be mingled with love happiness that be affectionate father have be always known now have to be confessed that bore a though have sprung from noble family be son grandson of archbishop how must have be with on occasion have daughter married vicar of pugsty a have once suggested lady sarah did not now stop to enquire be reasonable to lady sarah that coming of popenjoy must be hailed with greater joy receive warmer welcome than birth of ordinary baby have have good deal to bear brotherton said holding noble son in law by hand think that will compensate for tear be still in eye be true tear tear of most unaffected joy have seen happy day a told in word must have be profane have be absolutely uttered be now ready to die in peace not that meant to die thought that must die vision of young popenjoy bright a star beautiful a young apollo with golden glory of

within when have smiled in presence have be subject to one weakness have marred manliness must otherwise have be great who must have be proud of lowliness of birth have known that brightest feather in cap be fact that having be humbly born have made what be have never ceased to be ashamed of stable yard a felt to be degraded by from have sprung so did think that only whitewash against such dirt be to be found in aggrandisement of daughter nobility of child have perhaps be happier than deserved might have sold to lord who must have scorned after while despised a be marquis who be son in law be man whom upon whole must well trust lord george have indeed made one little error in regard to mr houghton have passed away must not probably be repeated of closely concerned in coming of popenjoy father seemed to bear greatness of occasion with most modesty when dean congratulated simply smiled expressed hope that mary must do well in trouble poor mary welfare have hitherto be almost lost in solicitude for son ca do well now said dean who of men be most sanguine be thoroughly healthy nothing have be amiss must be very careful that be said marquis hitherto have not brought tongue to speak of son a popenjoy did not do so for many day to come that heir have be born be very well of late name of popenjoy have not be sweet to ear nothing have gone amiss nothing did go amiss when be decided that young marchioness be to nurse own baby matter mary took into own hand with very high tone old marchioness became again little troublesome have memory about in own time how have not be able to do a mary be doing remembered how unhappy have made remembered also that have done so for popenjoy sir henry must have insisted on three pint of porter then mary rebelled altogether talked of drinking nothing tea must not be brought to consent even to bitter beer without great deal of trouble through mother throve baby throve when bonfire have be burned bell have be rung child have be shown to such tenant adherent workman a desired to see family settled down to feeling of permanent satisfaction then came christening now in spite of permanent satisfaction there be trouble trouble of marquis became conscious very soon be bound to communicate to sister trouble of dean be unfortunately cognisant of must speak with must concern much to annoyance of marquis will late man have made be serious temporary embarrassment there be money with to do anything very bed on mother lay with baby belonged to jack de baron be absolutely drinking jack de baron port wine found when matter came to be considered that be making butter from jack de baron cow must not be long endured jack who be now bound to have lawyer of own have very speedily signified desire that family must be put to inconvenience have declared that suggestion from marquis a to house in town that in country must be law to be necessary that everything must be valued at once purchased given up to be sold to who must purchase there be however money marquis who hated idea of borrowing be told that must go among money lender then dean proposed that miss tallowax between might be able to advance what be needed marquis shook head said nothing proposition have be very distasteful to then there came proposition will be right in first place to explain that great question of godfather godmother have received much attention royal highness duke of windsor have signified through young lord brabazon that must stand a one of sponsor honour have be very great have of course be accepted at moment dean have hankered much after office have abstained from asking with feeling must request be refused coolness must be engendered must be unable to repress must have filled with delight to stand in own cathedral a godfather to little popenjoy abstained soon heard that duke of dunstable who be distant cousin be to be colleague of royal highness smiled said nothing of thought that liberality might have be more liberally remembered just at time miss tallowax arrived at deanery on next morning dean came over to manor cross with proposition from lady must bestow twenty thousand pound immediately upon popenjoy place for instant use in father hand on condition that might be allowed to stand a godmother must not consent to accept money said marquis very gravely why not mary be nearest living relative in generation a matter of course will leave money to mary child unless be offended nothing be so common a for old people with liberal heart to give away money must soon leave behind more generous creature than old aunt doe live very generous be afraid can not accept after be only empty honour must not ask for because knew how might be situated really think might gratify old lady twenty thousand pound be important sum must be so useful just at present be true father at moment declined dean however who knew man determined that money must not be lost communicated with mr knox mr knox came down to manor cross held long consultation at dean lady sarah be present let be granted said dean that be foolish request be justified in refusing twenty thousand pound offered to popenjoy certainly said lady sarah if twenty thousand pound be bribe be bribe lady sarah said mr knox be not unreasonable that miss tallowax must give money to great nephew be unreasonable that must ask for honour seeing that be child great aunt there be strong opposition to miss tallowax liberal offer in end be accepted twenty thousand pound be important after godmother must do lasting injury to child then be discovered that offer be clogged with further stipulation boy must be christened tallowax to father mother aunt objected swearing that must not subject young popenjoy to so great injury till be ascertained that old lady did not insist on tallowax a first name even a second must suffice that tallowax must be inserted among others be at last decided that boy must be christened frederic augustus tallowax thus became frederic augustus tallowax germain commonly to be called by queen courtesy lord popenjoy christening be not very august a royal duke fellow attended in person dean stood
