at oxford in year that young man sat in college room at balliol wretched victim to unsuccessful competition have be everything to to come out a first in classic have dared to dream even of double first have failed in list have just appeared be only second class man now second class man be not much thought of at balliol have lost chance of immediate fellowship be perhaps hardly worst of arthur wilkinson for such be gentleman name have hitherto run race in life alongside friend rival named george bertram in almost phase of life have hitherto be beaten same moment have told wilkinson of failure have told also that bertram have obtained place have so desired bertram be only double first man of year a two young men will play foremost part in following page will endeavour to explain in a few word a possible who of be a bertram seems to have be favourite with fortune will begin with father at time alluded to be still alive son george have seen little of sir lionel bertram have be soldier of fortune generally believe mean soldier without fortune in capacity be still in sort fighting country battle at present moment held quasi military position in persia where have be for last five year previously to that have served in canada india cape of good hope on special mission at monte video have therefore seen good deal of world very little of only child mr bertram george mother have died early in life mr afterwards sir lionel bertram have roamed world free from encumbrance rev arthur wilkinson vicar of hurst staple on border of hampshire berkshire have married first cousin of mr bertram when young george bertram at age of nine be tossing about world rather in want of fixed home mr wilkinson undertook to give home to educate with own eldest child till must be sent to school for three year george bertram lived at hurst staple be educated accordingly during year used to go annually for one month to house of uncle who in due time will also be introduced to reader therefore not unnaturally month be regarded by boy a holiday now may a well be explained in place sir lionel bertram though very gallant man peculiarly well adapted to do business with outlandish people have never succumbed to habit of punctuality in pecuniary matter arrangement have be perhaps rather named than made that one hundred thirty pound per annum must be paid for young bertram need a be to include pocket money clothing washing a well a such trifle a boy maintenance education perhaps bargain be not very hard one a regarded sir lionel first seventy five pound be paid after up to end of second year mr wilkinson have received no more a be poor man with six child of own little besides living then thought better to mention matter to sir lionel brother in balance be instantly paid mr wilkinson have further trouble on head have much trouble on other head a regarded young bertram lad be perhaps not fit to be sainted gave mr wilkinson usual amount of trouble a regarded jacket pantaloon on whole be good boy free generous in temper quick in part affectionate in disposition full of humour who examined most closely among whom perhaps mr wilkinson be not included might have observed that be hardly a steady a might have be in liking dislikings that made too little of task learnt without trouble that in fact be not sufficiently solicitous about anything be however undoubtedly lad of great promise one of whom father might have be proud be not handsome boy did become handsome man face be too solid cheek too square forehead too heavy eye though small be bright mouth be wonderfully marked by intelligence when grew to be man wore beard not even slightest apology for whisker perhaps added to apparent heaviness of face probably best understood own appearance for in day face bore on more legible mark of acute mind at age of twelve be sent to winchester a holiday be still passed with uncle then ceased to regard hurst staple a home twice year a went up to town stayed there for couple of day be soon looked on a visitor little wilkinson no longer regarded a brother in reality quite brother in love arthur wilkinson be very nearly of same age be just older than young bertram by three month so just sufficiently to give to wilkinson feeling of seniority when first met consciousness a be senior in age must be senior in scholastic lore consciousness wilkinson be not able to attain during early year of life be making vain struggle to be a good man a cousin be a good in scholarship a good in fighting a good in play a good in spirit in look at rate arthur be superior to george much consolation did mother receive from conviction young wilkinson be very handsome lad grew up to be handsome man beauty be of regular sort be more pleasing in boy than in man also be excellent lad parent must be so thankless a to be other than proud of men said good thing of so that mr wilkinson must not be contented nevertheless one must always wish to see one own son not le bright than one friend son arthur wilkinson be also sent to winchester perhaps must have be better for cousin that must have gone to different school matter however have be left to mr wilkinson a thought winchester good for own son naturally thought same school good for sir lionel son bertram be entered a commoner whereas wilkinson be in college who know winchester will understand though a regarded school business school hour be at same establishment be not together at much more important hour of eating sleeping playing did not cease to be friend did cease to live together a friend generally do live when educated at same school at winchester did fairly well bertram did much best got prize whereas cousin did nearly get went up from class to class above other when last tussle for pride of place came on at close of boyish career bertram be victor stood forth to spout out latin hexameter to receive golden medal while wilkinson have other privilege to sit still listen to believe master seldom recognize agony of spirit with boy endure being beaten in contest boy on such subject be very reticent hardly understand own feeling enough to speak of be too much accustomed to ridicule censure to look anywhere for sympathy favourite sister may perhaps be told of hard struggle bitter failure not word be said to one else father so think boy be angry at failure even mother kiss will hardly be warmed by such subject be too apt to think that if child eat pudding make noise require sympathy boy may fail at school afterwards eat much pudding make much noise ah how young heart may sigh for one to grieve with over failure wilkinson be unfortunate at school be great object with father that must get scholarship at new college to a world know path lay through college of winchester when time came be successful be not successful vacancy in year be few in number only three of two be preoccupied according to then rule of place by heaven born wykamists called founder kin be only second best on list lost prize bertram having be commoner have have no right to think of new college at time when be to be removed to oxford uncle gave to understand money be great object to father mind be still too fully absorbed in affair of country to enable to think much of son expenditure uncle at period took fit of disgust on subject very well said george will give up oxford if can not do something for myself went up however to trinity became candidate for scholarship there obtained to great surprise of wilkinson of in day lad of eighteen who must get scholarship at trinity be considered to be nearly safe in career know how far may be altered now uncle when heard of nephew success immediately allowed what must have be amply sufficient for have be in possession of income from scholarship bertram therefore have be almost rich man during residence at oxford young wilkinson though lost new college received small scholarship from winchester also be sent by father to oxford to enable to do mr wilkinson be forced to make great struggle have five other child four daughter one younger son be with difficulty that must make up necessary allowance to carry arthur through university did do so disappointed wykamist went up to balliol with income amounting to about cousin enjoyed need not follow very accurately through college career became prizemen one by force of intellect other by force of industry went through little go other go with sufficient zeal up to important day on great go of be to be undergone belonged to same debating society at oxford though thought very differently on most important subject remained with few temporary interruption fast friend through four year of oxford residence there be period when balliol man be considered by friend to run better chance of academical success than brighter cousin at trinity wilkinson worked hard during three first year bertram did not style of mind too of former be more adapted to win friend at oxford in day tract be new read by everybody have since be called puseyism be in robust infancy wilkinson proclaimed while yet little more than boy to be admirer of poor froude follower of newman bertram on other hand be unsparing in ridicule of remains set in full opposition to sewells came out a poet successfully a far a newdegate be concerned in direct opposition to keble faber for three year wilkinson worked hard regularly eclat attending on success somewhat injured in fourth year at rate in earlier part of talked more than read gave way too much to delight of society too much at least for one who be so poor to whom work be so necessary must not keep position by dint of genius a bertram might do consequently though be held to have taken honour in taking degree missed high position at have aimed on day enabled to write bachelor of art be in debt to amount of couple of hundred pound sum be of course utterly out of power to pay nearly a far out of power of father have always be bertram delight to study in such manner that men must think did not study there be affectation in perhaps not uncommon to men of genius be deleterious to character a affectation be be however fact that during last year before examination did study hard there be set round at college among whom be esteemed a great man little sect of worshipper who looked for idol to do great thing be point of honour with to assist pretence of gloried in bertram idleness told story not quite veracious of doings at wine party proved to satisfaction of admiring freshman that thought of nothing horse boating must do without study more than other man must do with a for plodding balliol hero might look to be beaten out of field without effort balliol men have be very confident in hero up to last half year then began to doubt poor wilkinson be beaten by rival out of field though probably not without effort may say that man ever get double first in anything without effort be that a may wilkinson be sitting alone very unhappy man in room at balliol while bertram be being feted to heart content at trinity be grievous thing to have to write home to one father to say that one have failed when father have so anxiously longed for success arthur wilkinson must have be made man for life made according to making father at time thought most desirable if name have appeared in first class list double first father have not hoped for in resolving not to hope for have consoled with thinking that hope did form be more certain of success then there must always be that further chance of happiness in store now arthur wilkinson have to tell father that be first double first degree be very respectable for man who have not looked for much for one who have not be talked of in high place be not respectable for wilkinson of balliol vae victis be indeed unhappy a sat there alone meditating how must frame letter there be telegraph telegram in day behoved to write if did not father must be at oxford before next night be over how must write must not be better to write to mother then what must do what must say about accursed debt pen ink paper be on table have got into chair for

manly voice of triumphant friend slowly wilkinson got up undid lock tried to smile a opened door attempt be failure however must still speak few word heavy a heart be have to congratulate said to bertram do with heart there be very little heart in tone in be spoken then what must be expected thank'ee old fellow be sure do come wilkinson give hand be better to have out at once wish 'd have more luck there be end of be luck know be not said wilkinson barely able to suppress tear bit of if chap get headache fit of colic be up with if happens to have be loose a to pet point of examiner be up

with little hesitation wilkinson made friend understand that have not yet written home that must not go out till have done so then will give ten minute to write letter ca possibly take more not even if put into love to aunt cousin can not do while be here nonsense gammon will do while be here will not allow to make miserable as for nothing come write if be not written in ten minute will write so saying took up play of aristophanes wherewith to amuse by way of light reading after heavy work of week poor wilkinson again drew chair to table heart be very heavy vae victis chapter ii breakfast lunch wilkinson took pen in hand bent over paper a though be going to write not ink mark fell upon paper how must write task might have be comparatively light to for dreadful debt bertram in meantime tossed over page of book looking now then at watch then turning sharply round exclaimed well wish 'd leave said wilkinson 'd rather be alone may be doomed to live die don if do style of life next to of english bishop look on a most contemptible in world queen royal beef eater come next think must endure a state of hingness be not so absolute quantity come how far have got give paper will write letter in time thank 'd rather write own letter be just what want to do wo then again turned for two minute to frog well see write come will have try at see who will have done first wonder whether father be expecting letter from so saying seized hold of pen paper began to write dearest father weary affair be over at last will be sorry to hear that event be not quite a well a might have be a far a be concerned have intended to be first lo be only second if ambition have be confined to second class probably might have come out first be very sorry for chiefly for sake in day man can count on highest honour a certainty a will be home on tuesday wo say more ca give tidings about fellowship yet bertram have have old luck again sends love to mamma girl very affectionate son arthur wilkinson there scribble that off will do just a well a anything else poor wilkinson took paper having read to see that contained absurdity mechanically copied writing merely added one phrase to say that friend better luck consisted in being only double first of year one short postscript took good care that bertram must not see then fastened letter sent to post tell mamma not to be very unhappy be postscript added that letter be very anxiously expected at vicarage of hurst staple father be prepared to be proud of successful son mother who have over over again cautioned not to overwork be anxious to know that health be good have little fear a to success fear be that must come home thin pale wan just at breakfast time postman brought letter youngest girl running out on to gravel brought up to expectant father be from arthur said be papa be sure know handwriting vicar with little nervousness opened in minute mother knew that be not right be ill said do tell at once ill be not ill well what be have not lost degree have not be plucked papa have said sophia oh have got degree second in classic be threw letter over to wife a went on buttering toast will be home on tuesday said eldest girl looking over mother shoulder so george be double first said mr wilkinson yes said vicar with mouth full of toast not evincing great satisfaction at success of late pupil when mother read short postscript heart be touched put handkerchief up to face poor arthur be sure have not be own fault mamma have george done better than arthur said one of younger girl george always doe do better think doe have made too sure of said father in almost angry tone not that be angry be vexed rather a must be if wheat crop failed potato did not come up properly felt sympathy with son never occurred to to think of agony with few line have be written of wretchedness of young heart have hoped so much failed so greatly of misery son felt in disappointing father be good kind parent who spent long day longer night in thinking of family welfare must too have greatly triumphed in triumph of son went beyond power of heart to sympathize with in misery seem to be vexed with when come home said mother vexed with mean angry of course be not angry have done best suppose be unlucky be then breakfast be continued in silence know what be to do said father after awhile will have to take curacy suppose thought meant to stop up at oxford take pupil said mary know that can get pupil now besides will not have fellowship to help wo get fellowship at papa very probably not must think then family finished meal in silence certainly be not pleasant to have one hope disappointed mr wilkinson be hardly just in allowing to be so extremely put about by son failure in getting highest honour did remember what other father feel when son be plucked did reflect that arthur have at rate done much better than nineteen out of twenty young men go up to oxford then mr wilkinson have double cause for grief have george bertram failed also might perhaps have borne better a soon a letter have be written made up wilkinson suffered to be led out of room now for parker said bertram will be glad to see harcourt indeed will not harcourt very well just at present must much rather see nobody well then will be glad to see will be quite same thing come along mr harcourt be young barrister lately called to bar who have be at oxford spending last year when bertram wilkinson be freshman having be at bertram college have be intimate with of be now beginning to practise men said that be to rise in world in london be still very young man at oxford be held to be one who from three year life in town have become well versed in world way be much in habit of coming to oxford when there usually spent good deal of time with george bertram so wilkinson walked forth into street arm arm with cousin be grievous trial to have feeling within that sooner sorrow be encountered sooner must be over turned into high street a went met crowd of men who knew of course be to be expected bertram friend must congratulate be not worst of be so ill advised a to condole with wilkinson get over at once whispered bertram to then will be over now for ever then arrived at parker there found whom bertram have named many others mr parker be be believed pastrycook by trade very commonly dabbled in more piquant luxury than jam tart bath bun men who knew what be what who be willing to pay to promise to pay for knowledge be in habit of breakfasting there lunching now breakfast lunch at parker generally meant champagne harcourt be seated on table when got into back room other men be standing timbrel beat drum see conqu'ring hero come sung out a bertram entered room make way for double first hero of age gentleman be told that mean to put up alabaster statue to in common room at trinity however will vote for nothing more expensive than marble make in pie crust said bertram let parker be artist yes will celebrate installation with champagne pate de foie gras said twisleton afterwards devour object of idolatry to show how short lived be fame for work so hard said madden must be delighted at such token of regard gentleman harcourt have seen wilkinson harcourt turned round shook hand warmly with other friend upon word did not see master wilkinson have habit of hiding under bushel one always miss well so great day be over great deed done be bore out of way trampled under foot got rid of idea of degree wilkinson merely smiled harcourt saw at once that be deeply disappointed man barrister however be too much man of world to congratulate condole with there be fewer first year than there have be for last nine year said gerard thinking to soften asperity of wilkinson position may be because examiner required more because men have le to give said madden forgetting about wilkinson why what noodle be said bertram not to know that be settled by chance at roulette night before list come down if be not ought to be average result must be just a fair come harcourt know that with temple experience wo drink oxford wine good nature will condescend to see child feeding wilkinson sit opposite there give twisleton of pie that be talking of so sat down to banquet harcourt in spite of refinement london have doubtless given to taste seemed perfectly able to appreciate flavour of university vintage gentleman silence for one moment said harcourt when graver work of eating began to lull men torpidly peeled pear then cut up into shape instead of eating be always said at breakfast go to be not breakfast said bertram be lunch well lunch then god bless be always said at matutinal meal by by must be nicest thing in world only one doe know what on earth to do when be over be time to go to dinner then said twisleton may do for 'dura ilium ' of freshman now that be ba will find that power fails greatly for heaven sake let go on with speech will not get away to dinner to supper be commonly declared say that there must be speaking at delicious little morning repast do call that little repast said madden who be lying back in chair with cigar in mouth of hardly have strength enough left to puff out smoke mean offence to feed of kind have be only too good if be to be allowed to go on will say that rule be always laid down be always broken therefore feel hesitation in breaking on occasion long speech be long bore little speech be little bore bore must be endured ca do very well without now bore will be very short bore if be allowed to make end of without interruption right harcourt said bertram go ahead be only too delighted to hear be day have london barrister here be day that have double first at old trinity gentleman there be think five six trinity men here including will be point of honour with to drink health prosperity to friend bertram with honour have many men of whom can boast at trinity if have insight into character power of judging what man will do must be remembered that mr harcourt though very young man in london be by mean young man at oxford there have be very few before who have achieved higher place than will fall to lot whose name will be more in men mouth than there be also here four gentleman of other college will not be sure begrudge triumph be old friend will be a proud of oxford man a be of trinity man gentleman here be prosperity to friend double first health to enjoy fruit of labour whereupon toast be drunk with great deal of fervour be astonishing that ten men must make so much uproar even wilkinson whose heart wine have just touched sufficiently to raise little from depth to have fallen even cheered madden overcoming by degree not unnatural repugnance to rise produced from certain vast depth double bass hurrah bertram said when voice glass be once more silent be credit to college have regard for so mind running risk for once must beg may not be asked to repeat bertram of course returned thanks to guest with mawkish modesty usually mark such speech rather with modesty must be mawkish be not so completely matter of course then sat down then with face rather heightened in colour got upon leg again in spite of madden difficulty of utterance said very visible disinclination to move be not going to do more shouting said madden even though propose health of chancellor vice chancellor two member not even though throw proctor into bargain said twisleton may shout not a like at risk of giving temporary pain to a good friend a have in world will ask to drink health of one whom on occasion fortune have not favoured mean cousin arthur wilkinson list a come down be dare say made out with tolerable fairness be not at rate for to grumble at of be quite sure that did there exist infallible test for finding out best man man name in year must have be placed before be not so jovial a rest of now because have partly failed time will come when will not fail then arthur wilkinson health be toasted with somewhat bated enthusiasm still with sufficient eclat to make glass in mr parker house ring on shelf poor wilkinson ear tingled when heard name pronounced must at moment have given anything to be allowed to be quiet may be doubted whether must not have be more hurt have be left there without notice be very hard to tune aright to disappointed man will break ice for at rate said bertram to when be used to talk about will suffer le wilkinson have be accounted good hand at speaking in debating society though rather more prolix than bertram not quite so vivacious have be considered almost more than match for cousin on account of superior erudition more practised delivery now voluble gift of word deserted be much obliged to said though perhaps on whole be better that men who placed in mediocre condition must be left to mediocrity have doubt of justness of list must be useless for to say that have not aspired world be world to knew too well that have aspired have received lesson might probably be useful to for rest of life a for failing not failing that depended on hope man might form for trusted that must henceforth be so moderate in nature a to admit of probability of being realized having uttered very lugubrious word almost succeeded in throwing wet blanket over party sat down now be not going to do anybody else be said madden only twisleton gerard hopgood answered bertram fortescue look a if expected perhaps however will let off till day after to morrow then with round of milk punch cigar apiece little more chat party broke up bertram harcourt remained together bertram endeavoured to induce wilkinson to stay with however wished to be alone got home to college by always overrated that man said harcourt think not time will show after good degree be not everything in world who in london care about senior wrangler double first when be done see use of nobody care much about wrangler double first be men nevertheless who get best of what be going wood will swim in one water will swim in water will find wilkinson will swim yet be wo sink say will nine tenth of men in world swim sink just go along with bow above wave dreadfully water logged barely able to carry burden thrown on yet not absolutely sinking fighting hard fight for little more than mere bread forgetting other desire in great desire to get that when man doe get bread ca be said to sink ah wilkinson will do more than that something more something a case may be believe be not man to make other men fall before industry alone never doe that certainly not that sort of industry break down once in six month come mr parker champagne make head buzz let take walk up river twisleton idea of going to dinner requires far too much pluck for so walked out along towing path discussing many thing of much importance to there be tide in affair of men taken at flood lead on to fortune in nine case out of ten flood tide come once in life then in early year man may have second third chance for decent maintenance hardly second chance for fortune brighter favour horse be to win race need not make best running at once start badly will rarely do so when young man discus what will be future walk in life be talking of concern success a far a world be concerned be so hard for youth to know to make even fair guess a to what own capacity be right man be wanted in right place how be lad of two twenty to surmise what place will be right for yet if surmise wrong fails in taking tide at single flood how many lawyer be there who must have be soldier how many clergyman who must have be lawyer how many unsuccessful doctor who might have done well on 'change in capel court bertram have inkling of harcourt have more than inkling path in life be chosen have much self confidence that have chosen well have never doubted much since have once determined have never doubted at have worked hard be prepared to work hard not trusting over much in own talent trusting greatly in own industry

chapter iii new vicar poor arthur wilkinson be in very unhappy frame of mind when left party at parker indeed a went to bed night be in state not to be envied nevertheless when end of week came be able to enter parsonage with cheerful step to receive mother embrace with smiling face god be good to heals wound with rapidity seems to impossible when look forward be regarded with very insufficient wonder when look backward before left oxford have seen head of college tutor have also felt bound to visit tradesman in whose black book be written down a debtor none of august person made so dreadful to a have expected master indeed be more than civil be almost paternally kind gave manner of hope came a balm poured into sick heart though have failed reputation known acquirement must undoubtedly get pupil then if resided might probably even yet have college fellowship though doubt not quite immediately master advised to take order to remain within college a long a rule permitted if must get fellowship must all be delighted to have a one of body there must so thought master be doubt that might in meantime maintain at university by pupil tutor be perhaps not quite so encouraging be working man of harder temperament than head thought that wilkinson must have got first that have owed to college to do so that having failed to pay debt must not be received with open arm at rate just at first be therefore cool not generous yes be sorry too be pity be said when wilkinson expressed own grief even be not so bad a arthur have expected on whole left college with lightened heart be creditor very obdurate did not smile so sweetly on a must have done have name be bruited down high street a of successful university pet have such be condition must have begged not to distress ear by anything so unnecessarily mundane a mention of very small account that must have wanted of must have be continuation of favour a be be very civil six month must do very well oh must not quite undertake to pay in six month must certainly do so by instalment in two year two year be long time certainly must not mr wilkinson senior prefer quicker arrangement oh mr wilkinson senior must hing ah be unfortunate so arrangement for two year with interest of course be accepted thus mr wilkinson junior began swimming match of life a so many others do with slight millstone round neck well may be questioned whether even be not better than air puffed swimming belt when got home mother sister hung about a always have done protected in measure from cold serenity of vicar to father said little on subject father said a little to talked indeed by hour a to future arthur in spite of having resolved not to do so told whole story of debt of arrangement for payment perhaps must do something in spring said mr wilkinson indeed father will hing said son have enough must have lived on a did not must live closer now so that matter be settled in very few day arthur found going into society with gay heart sister laughed at because must not dance have now made up mind for church must thought be well for to begin to look to amusement must be befitting future sacerdotal life practised singing therefore fasted on friday learnt to make chessman with lathe though sister laughed at adela gauntlet daughter of neighbouring vicar at west putford did not laugh so far approved that by degree almost gave over dancing waltz polka utterly abandoned though did occasionally stand up for quadrille did in very lack daisical way a though must have refused that also have dared to make so peculiar thus on whole arthur wilkinson enjoyed that winter in spite of blighted prospect almost a well a have on previous winter that remembered now again a walked along little river bank that ran with so many turning from hurst staple down to west putford must think of past hope lament that must talk of to one father be very good to be too cold for sympathy mother be affection kindly suggested that perhaps what have happened be for best kindly suggested more than once imagination carried further have not four daughter hitherto without husband also ala without portion be not enough for to sympathize with a for sister sister be well enough excellent girl be so gay so light hearted so full of fun laughter that must not talk to of sorrow be never pensive given to sober sadness be prone to sympathy if indeed adela gauntlet have be sister so walked along river to west putford have now fully made up mind to go into church while yet thinking of high academical honour brighter path of ambition also have dreamed of bar young men believe do who have high ability taste for labour scanty fortune senior wrangler double first when not possessed of mean for political life usually find way to bar be on bench of judge not on bench of bishop that must look for in after life arthur therefore have thought of joy of chancery wig have looked forward eagerly to fourteen hour daily labour in purlieu of lincoln inn when like many found disappointed in earliest hope consoled by thinking that after church be safer haven when walked down to west putford there be one there who told that be so can not follow too closely in early day did go into church did take pupil at oxford went abroad with two of in long vacation after lapse of year did get fellowship have by time with great exertion paid half of moiety of debt have promised to liquidate lapse in purposed performance sat heavy on clerical conscience now that have fellowship must do better so somewhat more than year passed away during be little at hurst staple very little at west putford still remembered sweetly pensive brow have suited so well with own feeling ever again heard from one of girl at home that little fool adela gauntlet be a bad a parson now have gone so far that nothing must induce to dance at so matter stood when young wilkinson received at oxford letter desiring instant presence at home father have be stricken by paralysis house be in despair rushed off of course arrived only in time to see father alive within twenty four hour after return found head of wailing family of whom must be difficult to say whether want grief be most heartrending mr wilkinson life have be insured for six hundred pound that with one hundred year have be settled on widow be now sole mean left for maintenance of five child sole mean excepting such aid a arthur might give let thank god have got fellowship said to mother be not much will keep from starving be not destined that wilkinson must be reduced even to such poverty a vicarage of hurst staple be in gift of noble family of stapledean late vicar have be first tutor then chaplain to marquis vicarage have be conferred on by patron in late year none of wilkinson have seen anything of stapledean family marquis though not old man be reported to be very eccentric very cross though have beautiful seat in neighbourhood not in parish of hurst staple in of dean staple adjoins be chiefly property never came to lived at much le inviting mansion in north of yorkshire here be said to reside quite alone having be separated from wife whereas child have separated from daughter be married son lord stanmore might more probably be found under roof in country than of father living have now to be given away by marquis wilkinson family who of late year have have communication with did not even think of thinking of fortnight after funeral arthur received letter with postmark of bowes on on being opened be found to be from lord stapledean very curtly requested attendance at bowes lodge now bowes lodge be three hundred mile from hurst staple journey thither at present moment must be expensive troublesome marquis be usually obeyed especially when have living to give away when order be given to young clergyman so arthur wilkinson went off to north of england be middle of march east wind be blowing bitterly at twenty four east wind doe not penetrate deep trachea be invulnerable left shoulder know twinge arthur arrived at cold cheerless village of bowes with red nose with eager hope found little inn there hardly knew whether to leave bag lord stapledean have said nothing of entertaining at lodge have only begged if be not too much trouble to do honour of calling on living on northern border of westmoreland have asked man in hampshire to call on a though house be in adjacent street have said nothing about dinner bed given of comfortable hint seem to betoken hospitality will do harm if put bag into gig said arthur so having wisely provided for contingency started for bowes lodge wisely a regarded probability quite uselessly a regarded event hardy a be that drive in gig from bowes did affect unpleasantly that appleby road have few sheltered spot when about three mile from bowes turned off to right country did not improve bowes lodge found to be six mile from village when drove in at gate be colder than have be since left hurst staple there be very little be attractive about house ground be dark sombre dull dingy tree be stunted house of window be closed be green with effect of damp be large enough for residence of nobleman of moderate pretension have about none of spruce clean well cared for appearance be common to country house of wealthy in england when descended from gig thought that might a well leave bag there sombre looking servant in black clothes who opened door made inquiry on subject therefore merely told jehu to drive into yard wait for further order lordship be at home said sombre dingy servant in minute arthur found in marquis study in marquis presence with nose red moist foot in agony of cold finger benumbed teeth chattering be barely allowed time to take off greatcoat a did so felt almost disinclined to part with so good friend how do do mr wilkinson said marquis rising from chair behind study table putting out end of finger so a to touch young clergyman hand pray take seat arthur seated a indeed have alternative on straight backed old horsehair bottomed chair stood immediately under tall black book case be mile asunder from fire have be nearer to must have availed little for grate be one of grandfather cleverly invented for transmitting heat up chimney marquis be tall thin gray haired be in fact about fifty looked to be at least fifteen year older be evident from face that be discontented moody unhappy man be one who have not used world over well who be quite self assured that world have used shamefully be not without good instinct have be just honest in dealing except in with wife child believed in justness honesty of one else regarded men a enemy especially of own flesh blood for last ten year have shut up rarely appeared in world unless to make statement generally personal to in house of lord to proffer in plaintive whine to brother peer complaint a to neighbour magistrate to one cared to listen in latter year newspaper have declined to publish arthur who have always heard of marquis a father old pupil be astonished to see before man so aged father have be only fifty five when died have appeared to be hale strong man marquis seemed to be worn out with care year to be one whose death might be yearly expected father however be gone marquis be destined to undergo yet many more day of misery be very sorry to hear of father sudden death said lord stapledean in cold thin voice be very sudden lord said arthur shuddering ah yes be not prudent man always too fond of strong wine be always temperate man said son rather disgusted be never got drunk dare say not a parish clergyman be not likely that must be imprudent man in manner of living very arthur remained silent thinking better to say nothing further on subject suppose have not left family well provided for not very well lord there be something have fellowship something said marquis with almost sneer how much be something whereupon arthur told lordship exactly extent of mother mean ah thought a much that be beggary know father be very imprudent man have fellowship thought broke down in degree whereupon arthur again have to explain fact of case well well well now mr wilkinson must be aware that family have not slightest claim upon lordship be also aware that have made none of course have not must have be very improper on part on mother have done so very people make claim upon who have be enemy through life who have injured to utmost of power who have never ceased striving to make wretched yes very people make claim on here here be clergyman asking for living because be friend of lord stanmore because went up pyramid with encouraged in manner of stupidity sooner well never mind sha trouble to answer letter now a happened that lord stanmore be promising young nobleman already much thought of in parliament a clergyman alluded to be known by arthur to be gentleman very highly reputed considered best to hold tongue one have claim on allow one to have such claim what want pay for be indebted for nothing must put one into living yes lordship must of course one wilkinson said so much a marquis have stopped expecting answer can only say if clergyman in hampshire do duty a badly a do here parish must be better off without parson think father did duty well perhaps so have very little to do a never suited to reside there there be never one to look after however make complaint here be intolerable intolerable self sufficient impertinent upstart full of crotchet of own bishop be weak timid fool a for never go inside church ca must be insulted if did have however gone so far now that will take permission to bring matter before house of lord what must wilkinson say nothing so sat still tried to drive cold out of toe by pressing against floor father certainly ought to have made better provision continued lord stapledean have not done so seems to that unless something be arranged mother child will starve now be clergyman yes be in order can hold living distinctly understand that mother have claim on surely none have be put forward lord stapledean say have may perhaps fancy by what say that admit that there be claim mind do such thing not in least quite understand what mean be well that must under circumstance if have power must put in curate pay over extra proceeds of living for mother maintenance have such power arthur must not think that be very well lordship have such power if patron in general be so privileged there must be thought little chance for clergyman a law stand can not do a be luckily in order can put in on understanding that will regard income a belonging rather to mother to sister than to yourself if lordship will see fit to present to living mother sister will of course want nothing can give ah h h h young friend will not be sufficient for must have pledge from word a gentleman clergyman that take living on understanding that income be to go to father widow why must give five hundred pound year eh tell that why must nominate young man like to such living whom never saw in life tell that arthur wilkinson be man sufficiently meek in spirit a ordinary meekness go ordinary meekness be of young clergyman of church of england be not quite inclined to put up with be obliged lord to say again have not asked for so great favour from indeed till received letter desiring to come here have other thought of living than of vacating house whenever nominee must present be very well said lord stapledean must be very unnatural son if on account refuse to be mean of providing for unfortunate mother sister refuse why lord regard a much duty to keep mother sister from want a father did whether be to have living will live together have will be theirs be very well mr wilkinson question ask be if make vicar of hurst staple will after deducting fair stipend for a curate say one hundred fifty pound year if will will make over rest of income to mother a long a life be question to wilkinson found very difficult to give direct answer hardly knew whether must not be guilty of simony in making such promise felt that at rate arrangement must be improper one if knew said at last term on mother live together must perceive that promise be not needed will not le think necessary to exact be putting great trust in a be very great trust more so perhaps than be justified in doing lordship here alluded merely to disposition of vicarial tithe not at to care of soul be going to put into young man hand arthur wilkinson again sat silent for awhile one must think said lordship that must be glad to have mean of securing mother from beggary imagined that must have be in measure gratified by good intention towards family so be lord so be doubt whether must be justified in giving such pledge justified will make almost doubt mr wilkinson whether will be justified in putting living into hand at rate must have answer what time can allow to consider answer what time never struck that must require time well can let have decision to morrow morning send in writing so that may have before ten post go out at twelve if hear from before ten will conclude that have refused offer so speaking marquis got up from chair arthur also got up promised that must send letter over from bowes first thing on following morning tell messenger to wait for answer said lordship pray express definitely so that there may be doubt then muttering something a to hope that inn be comfortable saying that state of health prohibited from entertaining visitor marquis again put out finger arthur soon found in gig on journey to bowes intended returning to town on following day by twelve o'clock mail of lord stapledean have spoken before that have difficult task to perform have friend to consult one of whom must ask advice nothing to rely on own head own heart suggestion a to simony perplexed have right must have to appropriate income of living according to term laid down by lay impropriator at one time thought of calling on old clergyman of parish asking then remembered what marquis have said of neighbouring parson felt that must not well consult one of on matter in lordship be concerned in evening considered matter long painfully sitting over cup of exquisitely detestable concoction called tea by bowesian landlady if have only left to myself thought arthur must do at least a much a for be for want a for myself must be more comfortable at oxford then thought of west putford adela gauntlet arrangement of lord stapledean must entirely prevent possibility of marrying then burden of mother sister must prevent that equally under circumstance must be great thing for mother to be left in old house among old friend in possession of old income a regarded money must all be sufficiently well provided for for fellowship prescribed stipend must be more than enough there be something in proposition be very distasteful to did not begrudge money to mother did begrudge right of having from one yet matter be of such vital moment where else be to look for living from college in course of year might get one must get none must be equal in value to of hurst staple to fellowship combined if must refuse whom loved must in truth suffer great privation privation must not be rendered more endurable by knowledge that offer have be refused thus turning matter over painfully in mind resolved at last to accept offer of marquis payment after be to be made to own mother fund of living be not to be alienated be not in truth to be appropriated otherwise than must have be have such condition a be insisted on how must be able to endure mother poverty if must throw away on behalf so comfortable provision determined therefore to accept good god have provided clogged though be with alloy like so many other gift of fortune accordingly wrote letter to lord stapledean in stated that must accept living subject to stipulation named namely payment to mother during life of three hundred fifty pound per annum out of tithe to received answer from marquis very short very cold nevertheless satisfactory presentation to living be in fact made in favour returned home to family laden with good news dear old vicarage must still be own tree have planted flower bed have shaped hive have put up must not go into hand of stranger more than want longer stared in face arthur be welcomed back with thousand fond caress a one be welcomed who bringeth glad tidings yet heart be sad what must now say to adela gauntlet chapter iv prima donna when arthur first explained to mother term on living have be given to refused to receive income such promise with reference to money matter between mother son must be binding be not moreover one same household must not be in end same if arthur must keep money if be paid to must only pay back again so on vicar declared that must adhere strictly to promised engagement mother soon fell into way of thinking arrangement not altogether bad one have received intimation through lord man of business of exact step have be taken for relief of great pecuniary distress so letter be worded be not long before regarded income a fairly own be so apt to be generous in hot moment of impulse so equally apt to be only coldly just even if coldly just in long year of ordinary existence so family again settled down commenced packing be again unpacked preliminary arrangement for living on very small income be thrown to wind pony be to have be sold with object be being fattened up on boiled barley be put on accustomed ration old housekeeper warning be revoked a be also that of old gardener be astonishing how soon new vicar seemed to fill old vicar shoe in eye mind of people of hurst staple have mr wilkinson come up from grave at end of three month must hardly have found that be missed very elegant little tablet have be placed to memory there apparently be end of widow cap did make change in appearance of family circle be astonishing how soon get used even to widow cap there have of course be visit of condolence between west putford hurst staple hurst staple girl adela have be a much perhaps more together than usual arthur walk along river have not be frequent however be not thought of by one have have new duty to assume old duty to put off have be fortnight up at oxford when at home have be calling on parishioner have be attending to dilapidation of vicarage rearranging book in book room dingy volume of thirty year since have be made to give way to new brighter binding have brought from college therefore one have remarked that have once be at west putford thought of often longed to go thither a often feared to do so when next went must be to tell adela not that loved that such love be forbidden to family at west putford consisted only of vicar daughter mr gauntlet have be long dead there have be no other child maiden sister of mr gauntlet occasionally visited have indeed lived there altogether while adela education have required lady preferred own lodging at littlebath adela therefore be in general sole mistress of parsonage beg reader not to imagine that there have be love passage between arthur wilkinson adela gauntlet nothing of sort have occurred have known loved other a child together now that be no longer child still knew loved other be be true that arthur when have wished to talk of own disappointment have found better listener at west putford than that must find at hurst staple be true that adela have always be glad to listen to that have have pleasure in cheering fainting heart telling that work of soldier of christ be worthier of man than bickering of statesman quibble of lawyer that have gravely yet withal so sweetly spoken to of comfort of rural life made almost in love with own failure such passage there have be between arthur have never taken hand sworn that must be own have adela ever blushed while half refusing to give asked why then need trouble about west putford why not let matter rest a be miss gauntlet must still be friend though seeing that must never be more might not be well for to walk so often along river a there have be no love passage one must say that nothing else be necessary must not content that must be so adela must think strange if must say nothing to of future prospect true have spoken word of love have not looked at a though be in mind to speak such be not incumbent on to make understand why threw from such golden hope then a to did not flatter that loved at least not much yet might be well to let know that be now at liberty to love other swain so at last once more went way to west putford adela gauntlet be for once will venture to have heroine without describing let reader make what will of fancy her of outward shape colour that please endow with amount of divine beauty for inner character let take that from a go on if so be that can succeed in making clear to others that be clear enough to own mind eye have called heroine be novelist customary name for prima donna so use many opera company have more than one prima donna there be donna prima if one may so say donna primissima now adela guantlet be more than donna prima donna primissima will be guess sort of lady altogether arthur a walked along communed with a to what be going to say at rate will know will be more comfortable when meet afterwards not that will make difference to then sighed deeply cut at river rush with walking stick found a usual alone in drawing room a usual smiled sweetly when saw since day on have first gone up to oxford have always called mr wilkinson so instructed by aunt penelope in other respect manner to be almost that of sister only that be softer more gracious declare thought be never to see again mr wilkinson ah adela whom did mean be possible that girl must live fairly before world without little insincerity have be so occupied adela there be so much to do in taking up parish even though know people so well there have be so much to do yes yes be sure of now that be settled do so hope that will be comfortable saw mary other day told that mother be quite well again yes be pretty well be very well now think do so love that old lord for giving living though say be such turk be such good thing in to do so considerate to everybody yes have made mother girl comfortable that of course be what have first to think of a for have doubt must have done better at oxford must have got home for like old home must of course not said arthur answering almost at random thinking how best might explain sacrifice have made without taking too much credit to then if have remained up there must only have become musty old don think must have be happy not so happy a in parish when man be clergyman said in lower somewhat solemn voice surely can not be so well placed a in charge of parish think so mr wilkinson certainly be life for be intended for must have intended be sure be happy life look at papa know happier man only that poor mamma died upon hint spake yes father be sure have be happy man be excellent clergyman be not even still so active be so glad now to have near wish have received living a did not that must make real difference got know from bishop do dislike being lord stapledean nominee must be ungrateful to say that certainly like lord stapledean however have taken living must not complain did not know that there be anything disagreeable there be adela have rather tell came over to day in part to do so will see that matter be one must not be talked about looked down on floor poking about on carpet pattern with stick being unable longer to meet clear gaze of soft eye oh be sorry if there be anything to distress not exactly to distress perhaps will tell when marquis offered living did on stipulation must pay over to mother three hundred fifty pound year during life doubt whether be right to accept on condition did so living therefore be rather hers than mine oh arthur how good of in spite of aunt penelope lesson old habit must sometimes get better of know be afraid that be not good why ca understand surely must be good to give up time labour hope adela did not say heart for mother sister good why how can be else than good think good will think so at rate adela must not withstand offer when be made to be sure must not so be little more than curate in parish a far a income be concerned with difference ca change curacy for living must chance offer adela have never before known to be solicitous about money for now felt that did not understand have got fellowship said yes have got fellowship oh a far a be concerned be better off than must ever have expected to be nevertheless one feel feel crippled by such arrangement be quite impossible know for instance that must do great many thing courage failed a be about to make fatal announcement what thing said adela with boldness of innocence be necessary that must say why for instance continued be quite impossible though perhaps doe not make much matter be quite impossible must ever marry still looking down upon ground poked sedulously among pattern with stick oh said adela with tremour in voice eye be no longer able to rest upon face there be pause during of said word saw other a far a adela be concerned immediate speech be impossible cried sighed sobbed became hysterical be simply dumb must not answer little announcement of neighbour heretofore when have come to with sorrow have sympathized with poured balm into wound have balm for now sympathy there sat mute poking while at carpet while did not even move limb then gradually came home to of that utter silence prostration of power of self management told to secret of other felt that moment of prolonged silence committed of deeper why must not adela be able to speak when thus informed of neighbour intended celibacy why must sit like fool before merely because have told that on have long decided be clearly wilkinson duty to have disembarrassed lady a soon a possible be almost unmanly in to be put thus beyond power of speech action still poked carpet said nothing be adela who first broke that tell tale silence grievous be effort cost to do so will have mother sister with mr wilkinson so perhaps wo mind that yes will have said then there be silence seemed about to be equally dangerous equally difficult adela who be fully aware of error have already committed strove hard to save from repeating will have family round if a say ground that approached be so hot that must not walk on must not get further in direction therefore merely added be sure hope will always be happy at length arthur shook positively shook a though be only mode by must collect faculty then getting up from chair standing with back against wall spoke out a follows perhaps adela there be necessity for to have mentioned subject at least be sure there be necessity have ever be friend to have so understood feeling when one else seemed to do so that must not tell a have told everything else hope have not annoyed by doing so oh not at doe make little sad to think that will never be own master never mr wilkinson have arthur known there be balm there be sympathy in word have intellect be a sharp a feeling must have known passed unperceived a have fallen from unawares said other word must encourage if be cold at least must be equally so certainly not during mother life know how good ground have for hoping that life will be long then there be sister duty to will be same a to mother even though a regard may not be tied down a be with regard to can not have everything here said adela trying to smile be sure need not teach that can not have everything arthur thought that in spite of clerical austerity be about to assume must very much like to have adela gauntlet will make happy to know that be making mother happy dear girl have doubt will very soon get used to many clergyman know think that ought not to marry yes never made up mind to perhaps not now perhaps will think of more seriously indeed used to have idea that parish clergyman must be married man there be so many thing can do better when have woman to assist who think exactly a think will have sister know mary sophia be always active in parish jane fanny have school yes uttered gentle sigh a paused before answered be not quite same thing adela love sister dearly one always longs to have one heart will be entirely be own have come over to tell in same breath with informed that marriage be privilege quite beyond reach what did think of of what did imagine that be made there be cruelty in of adela became immediately conscious must hardly help wishing to resent have performed object of visit why did not leave have made thoroughly understood why did not go former many sweet visit have created hope be certain have said nothing of love coming there a have come gazing at a have gazed adela must not doubt that be loved that be now set at rest why must remain there breaking heart with allusion to own past tenderness must put up with world a find mr wilkinson oh yes of course when one have have such happy dream waking reality know doe make one sad be too happy in friend position to be object of pity how many clergyman be there of age who must look upon lot a almost beyond ambition how many men be there with mother sister for whom can not provide how many who have made rash marriage have led to happiness surely mr wilkinson with there be more cause for thankfulness than for complaint thus a be necessary that must say something moralized to very wisely be true said perhaps be for best might probably have be made more wretched in way yes very likely oh adela adela begin to know that man must not be sanguine have always hoped for more than have have right to expect therefore have always be disappointed be so at school at oxford be so now show how true be that man must not look for happiness here well good bye adela see that think be wrong to have regret useless regret be always foolish laugh at child who cry for what be quite out of reach yes laugh at dare say be right say that mr wilkinson have never laughed at did not wish to be actually unkind to though have be so cruel to at last went shook hand with other in accustomed manner wilkinson felt that missed something from touch warmth from soft pressure scintillation of sympathy such last moment of visit have usually communicated to yes there be much to miss a went back along river heart be sad within have made up mind to give up adela gauntlet have not made up mind to discover that did not care for that be indifferent to happiness unable to sympathize with feeling fact be that though have resolved that duty circumstance required to remain single nevertheless have at bottom of heart sort of wish that adela must be in love with have wish be not sharp enough to discover that have never thought unfeeling before said to world be alike well a be doe not signify might have be must have half broken heart to find so unfeeling more cause for thankfulness than complaint yes be true of be unfriendly nay unfeminine in to say so when must have known how much be giving up so walked on complaining understanding perhaps accurately want of own heart being quite in dark a to want of other heart grief discontent be mild in comparison with hers shook hand with when went endeavoured to say last word of farewell in usual tone nay for few minute after departure retained seat calmly fearing that possibly might return then when door have closed on have seen from window passing across lawn then spirit gave way bitterly made moan what be that have said to must not marry because have mother sister to support must not have helped to support must not have thrown in lot with for better for worse let that lot have be ever so poor must be possible that have not known have not read heart a have read must be that have come there day after day looking to for love sympathy kindness that sort of kindness man demand from one love one can give unless love must be that have done then thought that meant nothing that interchange of such feeling have further signification money have asked about money in day when father still lived when there be question of living belonging to must have waited for for year have year be necessary even though must be counted by ten ten nay must have be contented to wait even though waiting must never have be rewarded have given privilege of regarding a money must have be contented to live on potato paring must have be contented to live with on potato have over over again questioned a to love reminded that a yet have said nothing to to justify a often have answered that with must have doubt be impossible that must so look into eye so speak to if did not love so have resolved to risk happiness upon conviction of faithfulness have so risked now came to telling coldly that must not afford to marry to tell of happy dream waking reality who have not courage to realize bliss of dream when bliss be within reach to talk of sympathy of woman thinking with exactly a thought who be so timid of world that feared to love le perchance supply of bread meat must fail what must heart wound signify to hurt feeling have not arm sound head clear if having must not venture for love sake to meet world burden must hardly have heart enough to know what love really meant flinging on sofa with outstretched arm thus adela made moan not in word for spake none such be thought ran through mind a bewailed that have risked that have lost what must not have done for suddenly exclaimed aloud a rising from sofa stood erect upon ground pressing hand upon heart fool have be fool fool fool then with hand still close to side walked up down room with quick step have be fool according to world wisdom of what use have be aunt penelope teaching strictly enacting a did nice propriety of young lady life seeing that have not sufficed to guard heart against first comer unasked have given away have poured out to last drop of warm flood now be told that be not wanted that article be one not exactly in gentleman walk of life might well call fool what be to call be quite impossible know must ever marry why have not asked whether be possible if not now then in ten year time if not in ten year then in twenty have not be a faithless to be not a much man sworn a though thousand oath have passed between oath between lover be cupid phrase made to enable to talk of love be plaything of love a kiss be when lover trust other be sweet bond will never bind who trust when have told that only understood feeling that only knew mood when have answered by encouragement of soft smile must be that more be necessary between ah yes adela much more never know

well what mean be when therefore people at hadley spoke of modest household be apt to speak of a being very insufficient for such millionaire hitherto george have always passed part of vacation at amusement there be not of very exciting nature london be close even at hadley there be pretty girl with whom must walk flirt mean of keeping horse couple of pointer even if hunting shooting be not conveniently to be have few day after glory of degree when name be still great on high street of oxford have even be touched by true fame in very flattering manner in column of daily jupiter came home

in opposition line by oxford may be reached never omitted opportunity of doing little business be ready for dinner know whether be eat lunch suppose john be two minute past half hour why have dinner

call idle a must have delighted to do have occasion permitted must not condescend to congratulate on being great in greek mighty in abstract mathematics well george said pushing bottle a soon a cloth be gone suppose have done with oxford now not quite sir have fellowship to receive beggarly two hundred pound year suppose not that mean to say must not be glad to have added thus correcting impression word might otherwise have made a have be so long getting will be better to have than nothing fellowship wo make necessary for to live at oxford will oh then may perhaps go into church oh church eh well be respectable profession only men have to work for nothing in wish did sir if have voluntary system can have if like know that independent minister must not think of leaving church of england on account have decided then to be clergyman oh not decided indeed really think that if man will work may do better at bar very well indeed if have peculiar kind of talent necessary then doubt whether practising barrister can ever really be honest man what have such dirty work to do spend day in making out that black be white worse still that white be black pshaw have little more charity master george be so over righteous of greatest men of country have be lawyer being great men wo alter fact will being charitable when two clear headed men take money to advocate different side of case

literature literature though grandest occupation in world for man leisure be take slavish profession grub street eh yes must think so never heard of commerce suppose commerce yes have heard of doubt whether have necessary genius old man looked at a though doubted whether be being laughed at necessary kind of genius mean continued george very likely not genius be adapted to dispersing perhaps rather than collecting dare say be sir suppose never heard of man with what be call degree double first going behind counter what sort of men be double last wonder be rather think who go behind counter said george who have idea of allowing uncle to have raillery on side be sir rather think come out last when pudding be to be proved by eating success in life be not to be won by writing greek verse not though write ever so many ship load of must not fetch value of glass of wine at market in world commerce be grand thing said george with air of conviction be proper work for men said uncle proudly have always heard replied nephew that man in country have right to look to commerce a profession unless posse capital mr bertram feeling that table have be turned against finished glass of wine poked fire few day afterwards same subject be again raised between must choose for george said old man must choose quickly if must choose for be aware that can not do for circumstance after will have decision if must choose must go into parliament go where said mr bertram who must have thought a reasonable if nephew have proposed to take house in belgrave square with view of earning livelihood into parliament sir be parliament profession never knew before perhaps not ordinarily money making profession must wish to make so what county what borough do intend to honour by representing perhaps university will return perhaps may of day in meantime mean to live on fellowship suppose on anything else can get mr bertram sat quiet for time without speaking george also seemed inclined to muse awhile upon subject george said uncle at last think will be better that must thoroughly understand other be good fellow in way like well enough must not get into head idea that be to be heir sir wo because must only ruin idea be that man must make own way in world a made mine if be son may be presumed must do a other men do give money most probably must make better use of than son of other men who like have made money be not son quite true sir therefore will be saved danger at rate will not be victim of disappointment be very glad to hear said mr bertram who however did not give proof of gladness seeing that evinced little addition of acerbity in temper asperity in manner be hard to have to deal with nephew with whom must find so little ground for complaint have thought right to warn continued be aware that up to present moment expense of education have be borne by sir not education not education how then have be borne speak of residence at oxford have have great many indulgence there have paid for expense of education must have paid be fair on george part have not asked uncle for liberal allowance be hardly open to blame for having taken only know have paid regularly one hundred fifty pound year to order find from pritchett pritchett be man of business be paying still sent last quarter other day have not touched never mind let pas know what father view be about never must find out will ask mean to go see go see why be at bagdad yes if start at once will just catch there perhaps meet at damascus then will be great fool for pain greater fool almost than take to be what do expect father can do for belief be that if four hundred pound must take to heaven must make up money think must raise either in europe asia be sure of must lend in case a sir personal security must go for so little personal security have always gone for little a be saying have consented ever since went to wilkinson to allow father to throw burthen of expense on shoulder thought pity that must not have chance of decent education mind claim gratitude a will expect father to pay have advanced how on earth can do sir perhaps can can very well then can settle with listen to listen to for moment uncle george think be hard on father certainly hard on when went to wilkinson what did know of who paid bill who say knew anything sir counting on from time at what period ought to have begun to know when must have first learnt to feel be burden to one who have talked about burden say be not to be heir certainly not never thought of being heir care straw about being anybody heir what have given freely have taken freely a for father if felt so harshly towards why did let incur debt be to see kicked out of wilkinson house starve in ditch suppose now if can control fine feeling for one moment will listen to have never blamed in matter at blame now at least not yet hope never will be about money matter now do listen to seems to that be quite astray about profession like commerce what said other day about capital be quite true count man knave who go into trade without capital in small way might perhaps have managed in very small way must not have liked neither small great sir very well need not be afraid that anything very great will be thrust upon seems to that what be most fitted for be lawyer young bertram paused moment uncle really hardly know sometimes have strange desire to go into order very strange indeed now if will listen to have be speaking to mr dry messrs dry stickatit have done business for for last forty year now george will advance three thousand pound at four per cent what must want with three thousand pound suppose can get into house like without money do be attorney said george with look of horror almost penetrated thick skin of old man feeling what have taken double first be leading man of year spouted at debating club driven nearly dizzy with aristotle for for desk in office of messrs dry stickatit attorney of old bucklersbury not for uncle not for uncle net four thousand pound year said mr bertram in process of time must be working partner have at rate full half of business george be not to be talked into such scheme a by offer of loan by mention of number of thousand positively refused to consider proposition uncle with equal positiveness refused to hold further converse with on subject of profession pritchett will pay present allowance said for two year longer be if live can do without sir said george pritchett will pay amount for two year said uncle with great positiveness after will be discontinued for next three month will be happy to see here a guest will be readily believed that george bertram did not overstay three month chapter vi jerusalem there be quarrel between george bertram uncle george bertram nephew though in such conversation a have about business be not over civil to other still went on together a good friend at rate a ever have be indeed after last scene have be reported old man became more courteous to nephew before three month be over be almost cordial there be that about george younger made old uncle respect despite london merchant have thorough contempt for brother soldier of fortune have acted a have done on behalf of brother son almost more with view of showing contempt getting thereby opportunity for expressing than with fixed idea of doing kindness have counted also on despising son a have despised father here found foiled george have taken that have given a youth must take what uncle gave have never asked for more have done a well a be possible for to do in line of education have be tendered to now though must not become attorney merchant be prepared to earn own bread professed that be able to support without further assistance from one before three month be over uncle have more than once asked to prolong visit george have made up mind to leave hadley purpose be to spend three four month in going out to father then to settle in london in meantime employed with studying law of nation amused leisure hour with coke blackstone will never find father said mr bertram at rate will try if miss will see something of world will see more in london in three month than will there in twelve moreover must not lose time george be inexorable before three month be over have started on trip beg pardon mr george said mr pritchett to day before went uncle have requested to call on pritchett in city beg pardon mr george if may be allowed to speak word so do hope will write line now then to old gentleman while be away now george have never written line to uncle in life communication a to journey proposed arrival have by uncle special direction be made to housekeeper have present intention of commencing correspondence write to mr pritchett suppose will take uncle doe not much care for such letter a must write ah must mr george must be too quick to take person by appearance be million of money know mr george million of money mr pritchett put great stress on numeration of patron presumed wealth million be well that be great deal doubt fully see force of excellent argument fear there be nothing to be done in line be not born to be heir to million of money might see that in face mr pritchett stared at very hard well ca say that do mr george take word for old gentleman be very fond of very fond be little too strong be be if be very fond of anything now said to yesterday 'pritchett say 'that boy going to bagdad ' 'what mr george ' say 'yes say 'and to hong kong too suppose before come back be going after father then gave one of bitter look know be pity say for know one must humour be fool say uncle 'and always will be ' be sure mr pritchett be very much obliged for trouble be at in telling oh think nothing of trouble know more about money ' say uncle 'than ostrich ca go to bagdad out of allowance ' 'of course ca ' said have better put three hundred pound to credit ' said old gentleman so mr george have must have done very well without mr pritchett perhaps so three hundred pound never hurt anybody never mr george can tell if play card well may be old gentleman heir in spite of say to contrary at rate mr pritchett be very much obliged to so parted will throw three hundred pound in teeth next time see said george to good a mr pritchett advice undoubtedly be bertram did not take uncle received line from during whole period of absence hero search after father be not quite of so intricate nature a be supposed by uncle so difficult a made by japhet under similar circumstance route be to be by paris marseille malta alexandria jaffa jerusalem damascus have written to sir lionel requesting to write to of address in france malta egypt did receive letter in little town of jaffa where first put foot on asiatic soil despatch from father be awaiting sir lionel be about to leave persia be proceeding to constantinople on public service must go out of course to meet son at jerusalem tone of sir lionel letter be very unlike of mr bertram conversation heartily congratulated son on splendid success of degree predicted for future career brilliant rich declared that be dearest wish of heart to embrace son spoke of spending few week together at jerusalem almost with rapture letter very much delighted george have natural anxiety to think well of father have not altogether believed evil have be rather hinted than spoken of by mr bertram colonel have certainly not hitherto paid very much parental attention have generally omitted to answer few letter george have written to son be not ill inclined to accept act of new grace from father there be something so delightful in tone manner of sir lionel letter be so friendly a well a affectionate so perfectly devoid of dull monotonous lecture giving asperity with ordinary father too often season ordinary epistle that be in rapture with newly found correspondent must not miss seeing for world wrote sir lionel although have be ordered to constantinople with immediate haste civil service grandee always use in addressing military slave will go hard with will steal fortnight from in order to pas with at jerusalem suppose will scarce know when see old gentleman in military frock with bald head hook nose rather short allowance of teeth may then be sure that look upon father however will be at z hotel believe honour caravansary with name a soon a possible after th uncle have at rate be quite wrong in predicting that father must keep out of way so far be from being case sir lionel be going to put to considerable inconvenience to meet might be doubt be case mr bertram merchant have put together great deal more money than colonel bertram soldier putting together of money be virtue in george eye if sir lionel have not remitted portion of pay a regularly a perhaps must have done must not now be counted a vice may perhaps be surmised that have george bertram suffered much in consequence of father negligence in remitting might have be disposed to look at matter in different light have brought one servant with dragoman whom have picked up at malta with started on ride from city of orange orange grow plentifully enough in spain in malta in egypt in jamaica other place within five mile of jaffa nothing else be grown if except hedge of prickly pear divide garden orange garden succeeds to orange

dragoman among whose various accomplishment that of speaking english must hardly be reckoned a most prominent at last two mountain more two go down be performed george be informed that wall saw rising sharp from rocky ground be jerusalem there be something very peculiar in first appearance of walled city have suburb extramural adjunct be like of fortress of card built craftily on table with in england be always difficult to say where country end where town begin even with walled town of continent one rarely come upon so a to see sharp angle of gray stone wall shining in sun a do in old

place one in city one ride up to gate a one now have matured opinion a to taking of casemated battery inefficiency of granite bastion one first idea be how delightfully easy must be to take jerusalem be at rate easy enough to enter for dirty turkish soldier even look at soon become pleasantly aware that be beyond region of passport george bertram have promised that moment in first saw jerusalem must be one of intense mental interest when riding away from orange garden at jaffa have endeavoured to urge arab steed into enduring gallop be to carry up to city of sepulchre heart be ready to melt into ecstatic pathos a soon a gallop must have be achieved time for ecstatic pathos have altogether passed away before rode in at portal be then swearing vehemently at floundering jade giving up to

upstairs in gallery down to dark corner where cock crew yes mr pott why must not cock crow there a well a anywhere else be so beautiful to believe george bertram found seated next to lady like well dressed englishwoman of middle age whom heard called miss baker next to again sat angel whom miss baker called caroline whom odious man sitting on other side of called miss waddington reader will probably at different time have made part of table d'hote assemblage most of especially who have travelled with small party will know how essential be to one comfort to get near to pleasant neighbour young man idea of pleasant neighbour be of course pretty girl what young lady idea may be pretend to say certainly doe seem to be happily arranged by providence that musty fusty people nicy spicy people witty pretty people do severally assemble get together a ought to do bertram next door neighbour be certainly of nicy spicy order did not satisfy must have be very well pleased to talk to miss baker have not be for close contiguity of miss waddington even once removed vicinity must not have made unhappy have not that odious man on left have so much to say about village of emmaus valley of ajalon now be known to men caroline waddington be donna primissima personage of most importance in page be for that be to weep with that be to sympathize at that be to wonder must must find compatible with duty to introduce to circle without minute detail of bodily mental charm have already be idle in case of adela gauntlet feel that donna primissima have claim to description can not get over only not exactly now in few chapter hence will have miss waddington actively engaged upon scene then will be described must suffice now to say that be orphan since father death have lived with aunt miss baker chiefly at littlebath that miss baker have at niece instance be to egypt up nile across short desert short having travelled from cairo to jerusalem now thoroughly sick of oriental world be anxious only to get back to littlebath while caroline more enthusiastic much younger urged to go on to damascus lebanon to beyrout smyrna thence home merely visiting constantinople athens on way have bertram heard term in miss waddington spoke of youth who be so great about ajalon when aunt be in own room also word in aunt spoke of perhaps might have be le provoked aunt mr m'gabbery be as be sure

of mr bertram what papa mr bertram yes father mr bertram therefore if old mr bertram must die young man must be heir must have charge of money 'd better be gracious to how odd what be like be one of cleverest young men of day have heard that have distinguished very much at oxford certainly be most agreeable companion so be arranged between that must not start to damascus a yet in spite of evil that mr m'gabbery might inflict on on next morning at breakfast bertram managed to separate aunt from niece by sitting between be long however before mr m'gabbery gave up battle when found that interloper be interfering with peculiar property began to tax conversational power to utmost be greater than ever about ajalon propounded very startling theory with reference to emmaus recalled over over again interesting bit of past journey how tired have be at gaza where have worked for lady like slave how terribly miss baker have be frightened in neighbourhood of arimathea where mr m'gabbery have specially looked to pistol with view of waging war on three four supposed bedouin who be seen to be hovering on hill side must not do miss waddington be almost tired of gaza arimathea miss baker seemed to have decided preference for london news so at last mr m'gabbery became silent grand betook to association map of palestine in corner bertram when fortified with night rest good breakfast be able to recover high toned feeling thus armed proceeded alone to make first visit to church of holy sepulchre be sunday last sunday in lent determined to hear mass in greek church ascertain for how much devotion english protestant must experience in midst of foreign worship one mass be over not begun when reached building have thus time to follow dragoman to various wonder of very wonderful

disagreeably warm though to oriental be probably matter of interesting excitement for dragoman bertram must never have succeeded however so pulled hauled anxious devotee so thrust in who endeavoured to come out clawed back who strove to get in passage became for moment clear hero having bent low head found standing with hand on marble slab of tomb who be there around seemed to be outcast of world exactly whom must have objected to meet unarmed on road of greece among hill of armenia cut throat looking wretch with close shaven head dirty beard angry eye men clothed in skin huge skin like

chamberman colonel sir lionel bertram be there chapter viii sir lionel bertram personal peculiarity sir lionel have mentioned in letter to son a being characteristic of be certainly true be old perhaps rather elderly gentleman in military frock with bald head hook nose short allowance of teeth be more than though elderly be tall upright be distinguished looking for old man handsome in spite of lost teeth though bald a to top of head have yet enough hair to merit considerable attention to be cause of considerable pride whisker also mustache though iron gray be excellent in way have baldness be of uglier description want of teeth more disagreeably visible probably might not have alluded to in truth sir lionel be not little vain of personal appearance thought that in matter of nose be quite equal to duke in aristocratic firmness superior to sir charles napier in expression general design though vain man sir lionel be too clever to let vanity show in offensive manner ar celare artem be forte be able to live before world a though never cast thought on coat pantaloon ever did more than brush smooth iron gray lock with due attention to cleanliness be going to say that sir lionel appearance be best thing about in saying so must belie manner with be certainly difficult for one to find fault be what world call happy meaning thereby so great be possessor luck that be able to make pleasant to men to woman for while mr bertram have not lived to be lady have believe not always found so joined to readiness in use of one two language besides own be qualification have given sir lionel title have caused to be employed in so many mission in so many country on duty too must not be said to be of military nature never made difficulty enemy of own must generally smooth down difficulty enemy left behind by others perhaps of more sturdy temperament now catalogue of virtue be complete be not man of genius even man of talent have performed no great service for country have proposed carried through valuable project of diplomacy have shown close insight into habit feeling of people among whom have lived have be useful a great oil jar from whence oil for quiescence of troubled water might ever anon be forthcoming expediency be god have hitherto worshipped with successful devotion that have not be good husband have be hinted that have be very indifferent father have be made apparent at moment of meeting with son atoned for past sin in respect by excellence of manner before evening be over george liked father who have owed everything given nothing ten time better than have ever liked uncle who have given everything though have owed nothing be odd place for to have met in at last be not sir said george be sitting after supper very close together on one of stationary sofa be found affixed to wall in room in east son be half holding half caressing father arm sir lionel to tell truth did not much care for such caress under peculiar circumstance of present interview permitted see be always in odd place george have be in jerusalem before never be not on road anywhere on road at a one may well see never knew such place to get to now there be road of sort even about bagdad damascus oh damascus be highway nobody come to jerusalem except pilgrim who like to look after pilgrim be just in thick of now believe yes sir there be thirteen thousand here be sure will like place be delighted with although have be here a yet only two day perhaps more so than will be when have be ten think be not city seems poor dirty enough must not mind dirt if place be true sir lionel did not quite understand said nothing be country round immediate vicinity of jerusalem fascinates so wonderfully ah scenery be good be well in one way be mean can not explain to morrow will go to mount of olive with mount of olive eh be not very good at climbing up hill master george must remember difference between twenty three sixty three what be there to see there what be there to see there be said in tone made george feel rather indisposed to describe if describe must what there be there to be seen have quite wit enough to perceive that father be not enthusiastic about bible history then changed conversation began to talk about george bertram elder be eighteen year since have seen brother said sir lionel be usually cross enough then suppose have hardly improved ca exactly call cross have be very kind to know kind well if be contented be considering that be natural heir think have done so very much if mean to be kind why doe bother other month with long account of postage come to heaven know how much ah sir be not heir not heir said sir lionel with more of sharpness in tone than be at usual with with little sharpness also in eye a george quickly observed not heir who be heir then ah that know corporation perhaps hospital know be that be not that have told quite plainly be very right to do so added george after pause sir lionel repressed exclamation of anger against brother be in heart have risen to tongue have not be wandering for thirty year on foreign mission for nothing must find out more of lad disposition feeling before spoke out plainly before what thought have intended not only that son must be rich uncle heir rich uncle adopted child also so that portion of vast wealth might be made use of certainly by george perhaps even in modest degree by without unnecessary delay of waiting for brother death must be bad enough to wait seeing how probable be that brother might outlive now to be told not only that hope in respect be vain that old miser have absolutely repudiated connection with nephew be almost too much for diplomatic equanimity almost say for in fact did restrain did say george in so many word that meant to give nothing yes very plainly in so many word told a plainly in a many that wanted nothing from be that prudent boy be truth sir must tell whole offered loan of three thousand pound well took that indeed offered on condition must be attorney attorney with double first ah doe not much value double first of course be not going to make attorney of course not what be doing about allowance for have be very liberal have given hundred fifty year yes sent bill of with great regularity son did not remind father that regularity in matter have ended there that bill so sent have never be paid must not help thinking that in justice might do so that expense will soon be over sir a regard allowance will be discontinued next year what be going to stop even that school boy pittance why not sir have claim on a have not forgotten to tell so once twice be always vulgar fellow said sir lionel how came to have spirit of trade in very blood ca conceive god know have none of sir well hope not doe expect to live upon air be bad news george very bad of course have always intended to go into profession have never looked at in same light a do have always intended to make own way have doubt that will do so have quite made up mind about now about what george will go into order take college living order said sir lionel expressed more surprise almost more disgust at idea than at other one respecting attorney scheme yes have be long doubting think have made up mind do mean that wish to be parson that after taking double first see what double first have to do with sir only objection have be system of establishment like established church then why go into said sir lionel not at understanding nature of son objection love liturgy like ritual what want be voluntary principle like to put in position can in fact hold whether do duty of do wish well understand very little about george have hoped something better for now army be beggarly profession unless man have private fortune upon word look on church a worst of two man may be bishop of course take have to eat deal of dirt first mean to eat dirt said son to be bishop perhaps replied father be quite unable to understand other on subject in sir lionel view of matter profession be profession word be understood well enough throughout known world signified calling by gentleman not born to inheritance of gentleman allowance of good thing might ingeniously obtain same by exercise of ability more of good thing might be obtained better profession easier labour also better profession le restriction might be laid on man in pleasurable enjoyment of world better profession be sir lionel view of profession must be acknowledged that though view be commonplace be also common sense that looked at matter a great many people look at that idea be at rate sufficiently intelligible george bertram view be different much le easy of explanation have idea that in choosing profession must consider not so much how must get mean of spending life how must in fact spend must have in making choice to select pursuit to must devote that amount of power amount of life god must allot to father mother uncle aunt guardian grandfather be not singular view for young man to take in looking at subject in truth george be somewhat afflicted by tete monte in matter say afflicted because having imagination ideality to lead to high view have not sufficient counterbalance in firmness of character if father be too mundane be too transcendental a for instance approved at present moment in theory of life of parish clergyman must have commenced life to morrow must at once have shrunk from drudgery did not understand other perceiving sir lionel gave up subject be determined not to make disagreeable to son at rate intended to make allowance to give fortune be aware therefore that have right to interfere otherwise than a advice might be asked indeed have wish to do so if must only instil into young man mind few not precept precept be harsh disagreeable few comfortable friendly hint a to tremendous importance of game might be played with mr george bertram senior if must only do pleasantly without offence to son must attempt nothing further turned conversation talked agreeably on other matter of oxford of wilkinson of harcourt by degree also little of uncle george what sort of house doe brother keep at hadley eh george dull enough used to be well be dull not that be dull can always talk to uncle when will talk to see company suppose not much never go into society dines out in london sometimes sometimes give dinner too what at tavern yes at blackwall greenwich of place have be at dinner never spare anything doe feel year then be not infirm rheumatism anything of sort strong on leg eh a strong a be sir be ten year senior know yes know be be not nearly so young man a be really think be a strong be wonderful man for year certainly be delighted to hear said sir lionel keen judge of character however scrutinizing colonel face closely must not then have read much warm delight therein depicted rather like on whole then eh george well really think do be sure ought to like well george speak out need have secret secret have secret uncle have way of saying too much about what doe for one sends in bill too often eh george if be to be bill let say so for one will not blame there be reason must give anything situated a have be at oxford must have be almost absurd in to refuse allowance quite absurd when knew be coming out to made pritchett know pritchett handwriting very well indeed made pritchett put three hundred pound to credit be over above allowance well did almost make up mind to return that a be have not touched think will repay for heaven sake do such thing must be offence must never forgive sir lionel did say so much with something of parental energy in tone manner yes sir to be told of doe not ask to pay back again if asks be not that same thing hardly understand either think understand george wonder whether must give cup of coffee here of course can george rang bell perhaps so a far a experience go wherever englishman frequent there coffee be spoilt englishman a far a can see have partiality for chicory none at for coffee what mean sir be connected a uncle be together seeing that have life here george paused moment for what be about to say might have seemed to imply censure on father paid school bill sort of thing filled in sir lionel yes a have always done that seemed so natural must take what gave quite natural must have done nothing else now speaks of a though a though of course be under obligation to very deep obligation understand must not fret at think of a though have be to blame in spending money when see next will say something of same sort about three hundred pound can do be to remind did not ask for tell that may have back again hing of kind george said sir lionel who regarded a little le than lunacy on son part declared intention to refund money to rich man know very well what mean be disagreeable to be reminded of money that have spent have spent well of money that have received what can do be not fault a truly say must be absurd ungrateful too if be to decline to take such trifle from own uncle especially seeing what have done for be manner be always disagreeable especially in money matter so having given to son best advice have to offer sir lionel sipped coffee very bad very bad indeed always be at english place if must have own way must always keep out of english haunt in respect sir lionel have have own way during greater portion of life before parted for evening george communicated to father great fact of miss todd picnic a settled for next day sir lionel expressed a willing to make one of party if miss todd must be induced to extend to light of countenance on head young bertram though own acquaintance have certainly be short thought that might take on to answer people soon get intimate with other at such place a jerusalem when have be up great pyramid with lady chance be know more about than must do from year acquaintance fostered by dozen london party journey up nile with man may be considered quite equal to three year spent together at same college be if fellow traveller be young after certain age men never become really intimate let relation with other be ever so close there will be miss baker there sir who say know miss waddington very fine girl who at rate know name what caroline waddington yes caroline waddington be ward of uncle so miss baker tell never heard uncle mention indeed never mention anything will be very desirable that must know miss waddington there be saying what uncle may do with money yes will go to picnic only hope place be not distant so matter be settled chapter ix miss todd picnic that matter of obtaining permission for sir lionel to join picnic be not found difficult of arrangement good looking pleasant mannered sir lionels who bear queen commission have pleasant military way with be welcome enough at such party a even though be sixty year of age when george mentioned matter to miss todd that lady declared delighted have heard said of distinguished arrival at hotel have be almost afraid to ask man a sir lionel to join foolish little party then miss baker who in affair bore next authority to miss todd declared that have intended to ask taking upon freedom of old acquaintance so that matter be arranged party be not to be large one there be miss todd compounder of maiden lady fat fair perhaps almost forty jolly jovial lady intent on seeing world indifferent to many of prejudice formal restraint if threw in sir lionel way people must of course say that wanted to marry did not care straw what people said if found sir lionel agreeable must throw in way so told miss baker with perhaps more courage than occasion required then there be mr miss jones miss jones be young lady who lost parasol on mount of offence so recklessly charged arab child of siloam with theft mr jones be also in jerusalem must not be persuaded to attend at miss todd behest be steadily engaged in antiquarian research being minded to bring out to world startling new theory a to certain point in bible chronology topography always went about city with trowel big set of tablet certain among more enthusiastic of visitor to jerusalem have put down a infidel there be also mr mr hunter bridegroom bride now on wedding trip somewhat fashionable couple who be got up with considerable attention a to oriental costume mr hunter seemed to think good deal about trouser mr hunter mind be equally taken up with fact that have ceased to wear have knowing way of putting on turban carried sash gracefully however who have seen mr hunter roll into sash be of opinion that sooner later must suffer from vertigo in head miss baker niece have fallen in with people be considered to be of same party there be clergyman to be there one mr cruse gentleman who have be so keenly annoyed at absence of potato from dinner board be travelling in charge of young gentleman of fortune mr pott by whose fond parent joint expense of excursion be defrayed mr cruse be university man of course have be educated at trinity college cambridge piqued much on being far removed from danger of puseyism be man not of happy frame of mind seemed to find that from dan to beersheba everything in truth be barren be good looking unmarried not without talent seemed to receive from lady there assembled more attention than merit altogether deserved mr m'gabbery have talked of not going have be over persuaded by good natured miss todd have become almost overwhelmed by intensity of feeling in regard to sacred association of place since george bertram have contrived to seat between miss baker miss waddington up to moment one have be merrier than have so have flattered altogether cut out mr cruse in special quarter good grace namely of two lady have be prepared to take on own shoulder hard work of picnic now thing be altered with have doubt whether sacredness of valley must not be desecrated by such proceeding consulted mr cruse on matter hitherto gentleman have not be close friend now allied a against common enemy mr cruse did not care much for association seemed indeed to think that special attention to sacred place savoured of idolatry professed willing to eat dinner on of hill in of valley round jerusalem fortified with so good opinion relying on excellence of purpose mr m'gabbery gave way renewed offer of assistance to miss todd there be also mr pott mr cruse young charge son of man largely engaged in linen trade youth against whom very little can be alleged time at present be chiefly given up to waiting on miss jones luckier in respect than tutor mr cruse have rival to interfere with bliss miss baker miss waddington made up party of former little more need be said little must be in praise be lady like soft mannered easy tempered woman devoted to niece not strongly addicted to personal exertion on own part fact that be now at jerusalem so far away from own comfortable drawing room sufficiently proved that be devoted to niece now for caroline waddington donna primissima quality attribute virtue must be given more in detail than of companion at picnic seeing that be destined to fill prominent place upon canvas at time of be speaking might perhaps be

lady must take advantage of such unguarded moment to get into catastrophe ala again ala unfortunately mr m'gabbery have be first to descend to pool have calculated cunningly enough that in being there seeing that space be not very large duty must fall to lot of receiving into arm such lady a chose to come down miss waddington who be known to be very adventurous among number be sooner there however than george bertram jumped in almost upon hitherto have not have opportunity of touching miss waddington glove now seemed that fortune be to reward good heaven cried mr m'gabbery a dashed boldly into flood thereby splashing water well up into caroline face there be not much occasion for display for gentleman must have assisted lady quite a effectually without even wetting toe common misfortune do create common sympathy at least must do must not be natural that miss waddington mr m'gabbery when wet through up to knee must hang together in suffering make common cause of talk of what other felt

porter know intend to do such thing said have already told idea a to waiting upon young lady there be however at last whispering between miss baker niece in mr m'gabbery vainly attempted to join matter ended in one of groom being sent into town laden with bunch of key written message for miss baker servant before dinner time miss waddington have comfortably changed stocking in upper story of

calico rag passed over head acting also a shawl by contrivance intended only to last while christian be there concealed one side of face chin one must behold without wishing that eclipse have be total epithet commonly applied to woman in country must adequately describe want of comeliness kept face to work except that held rag between teeth gave sign of knowing that stranger be standing by be different with jewess when be stared at stood up boldly stared again well worth looking at be there be three four of young woman though already mother for child be playing on grass behind bore on head that moon shaped head dress be there symbol of jewess more graceful tiara can woman wear be wonderful that same land must produce woman so different a be close neighbour mahomedans be ape like jewess be glorious specimen of feminine creation be somewhat too bold perhaps there be too much daring in eye a with naked shoulder bosom nearly bare met eye of men be looking at there be nothing immodest in audacity be defiant rather scornful there be one among girl perhaps of eighteen who might have be sculptor model not only for form figure for expression of countenance beautiful turn of head shoulder be very unlike jewess be ordinarily pictured to have beaky nose thin face sharp small black bright eye be fair a esther be fair forehead face be broad eye large open yet be jewess plainly jewess jewess a be many still to be seen in palestine at least if not elsewhere when came upon be pressing dripping water from large piece of linen sheet probably in doing have cunningly placed one end firmly under foot upon stone then with hand raised high above head twisted retwisted till water oozing out fell in heavy drop round foot arm neck be bare a be also foot be clear that put forth to work a much strength a usually fall to lot of woman in country be very fair to look at there be about feminine softness laugh reader unless have already stopped to think thinking have decided that girl of eighteen being washerwoman must therefore be without feminine softness must not myself say that be so here at least there be feminine softness tenderness in eye young shame at being gazed at paused for moment in work gave back to look gave then a though be beneath notice strained once more at task so dropped linen to ground if knew how to set about bargain must take that woman home with mould to be wife such be george bertram outspoken enthusiasm moulded wife never answer well said sir lionel think must prefer one have be dipped whispered miss todd to colonel allusion to miss waddington little accident on water to chandler ware be not thoroughly appreciated have be said that hamper be to be sent to tomb of zachariah agreed to dine immediately opposite to of st james le be situated in middle of valley of jehoshaphat in centre of myriad of jewish tomb directly opposite to wall built with huge temple stone not many foot over then dry water course of brook cedron such be spot chosen by miss todd for cold chicken champagne of course wandered about little in pair trio while dainty be being prepared for st james tomb be little temple built on side of rock singularly graceful front towards city be adorned with two three roman pillar bearing if remember rightly plain capital there be think pediment above other adjunct of architectural pretension pillar so unlike anything else there so unlike other sepulchral monument at least have seen make tomb very remarkable that be built for tomb be suppose not to be doubted though for whose ash be in fact erected may perhaps be questioned be not aware that claimant have be named a rival to st james most conspicuous of monument be that tradition allots to absalom close to other have just described consists of solid square erection bearing what for want of better name must call spire with curved side side curving inwards a fall from apex to base spiral roof too low dumpy to be properly called spire be very strong built with stone laid in circle flat on other circle becoming smaller a rise towards top why absalom must have have tomb who can say that bone be buried there jew at least believe for jewish father a walk by with child bid boy cast stone there to mark displeasure at child who rebelled against parent be now nearly full of such stone while miss waddington be arranging toilet within tomb of st james admirer below be not making agreeable to other be awkwardest thing ever saw said mr cruse to mr m'gabbery in low tone not so low what bertram be intended to hear very said mr m'gabbery men be awkward by nature seem indeed a though be never intended for lady society then to hing laugh at mischief have caused that may be way at oxford used to flatter at cambridge that have more politeness cambridge said bertram turning round speaking with most courteous tone must command be at cambridge thought have understood that be educated at st bee mr cruse have be at st bee have afterwards gone to university be scholar at st john sir replied mr cruse with much dignity m'gabbery will take stroll across valley till lady be ready so having sufficiently shown contempt for awkward oxonian moved away two very nice fellow be not said bertram to mr hunter be stroke of good fortune to fall in with such men a at place a be very well in own way said mr hunter who be lying on grass flattering that looked more turkish than turk have yet seen seem to to be quite at home here in east few englishman in fact be cruse be always wanting boiled vegetable m'gabbery ca eat without regular knife fork give pilau bit of bread can make capital dinner without anything to help own finger cruse be bad kind of coach said young pott never interferes with fellow only fault be that be so spoony about woman be gentlemanlike men said sir lionel very one ca expect know that one must set thames on fire cruse wo do at rate put in mr pott mr m'gabbery perhaps may suggested george at rate made little blaze just now at brook above then lady came down business of day commenced seeing two injured one returned to post be very fond of picnic said sir lionel a seated on corner of tombstone stretched out glass towards miss todd who have insisted on being cupbearer for occasion excessively fond mean eating drinking part of course there be only one thing like better be having dinner under roof upon table with chair to sit on oh ungrateful man after be doing for spoke of picnic generally miss todd must always have nectar filled to by goddess must be content with room expect to recline on cloud have thunderbolt ready at right hand what beautiful jupiter father must make mr bertram yes what happy king of god with juno a miss todd have have have oh dear pretend to role higher than of hebe mr m'gabbery may thank for slice of ham declare tomb be very nice table be not only suppose be very improper mr cruse be so sorry that have potato there be salad know talking of chair said mr hunter after there have be seat yet invented by man equal to divan either for ease dignity grace mr hunter have long be practising to sit cross legged be now attempting on on grass for first time in public have at rate inconvenient effect that be perfectly useless for when once seated must neither help one else cigar divan be very nice lounge when one have nothing better to do suggested mr pott have capital coffee there divan sofa be much same suppose said george to mr hunter demurred explained at length be true essential quality of real turkish divan long before have finished however george have got up to get clean plate for miss waddington in sitting down have turned back upon turk unfortunate turk must not revenge a in present position motion be very difficult to picnic dinner be much same in part of world chicken salad be devoured at jerusalem very much in same way a be at other place except indeed by few such proficients in turkish manner a mr hunter little arab child stood around expectant of scrap a have seen child do also in england conversation be dull enough at commencement of feast became more animated when few cork have flown a afternoon wore on mr m'gabbery became almost bellicose under continual indifference of lady love have not be for better sense of hero such better sense may be expected from gentleman who be successful something very like quarrel must have taken place absolutely in presence of miss todd perhaps miss waddington be not free from blame in matter must be unjust to accuse of flirting of flirting at least in objectionable sense of word be not in nature to flirt be in nature to please without thinking much of manner in did be in nature also to be indifferent a to what others thought of though have never before known george bertram there be between sort of family knowledge of other justified greater intimacy than between actual stranger then too pleased while mr m'gabbery only bored have not yet thought enough about world inhabitant to have recognized adjudicated on difference between who talk pleasantly who felt that be amused by young double first oxonian have idea of giving up amusement when came in way of such amusement have hitherto known little miss baker be perhaps rather dull miss baker friend at littlebath be not very bright caroline have never in heart accused of being other than amusing be only by knowing contrast that recognize bore when meet be in manner that now began to ascertain that mr m'gabbery certainly have bored ascertaining threw off at once perhaps without sufficient compunction will cut cock comb before have done with said m'gabbery to friend mr cruse a rode up towards st stephen gate together rest of cavalcade following sir lionel have suggested to miss todd that might a well return somewhat early though be seeing that there be cause why feast of reason that flow of soul must no longer be continued by round yet only half emptied hamper so lady have climbed up into tomb there adjusted hat gentleman have seen to steed fork have be packed up when mr m'gabbery made state of mind known to mr cruse be on way back to jerusalem close to garden of gethsemane will cut young cock comb yet before have done with repeated mr m'gabbery now mr cruse a being clergyman be of course not fighting man must take notice of said indeed of think be worth oh be about said m'gabbery be two woman together therefore be inclined to show attention know how thing go on from one thing to have come to that have depended on for everything for last three four week have paid money for have well ca exactly say have paid money for be to say have paid own bill have not lent anything dare say know that man never travel with lady in free easy way without feeling in pocket one be apt to do twenty thing for must do for for if have to pay piper now here very useful moral may be deduced lady take care how permit yourselves to fall into intimacy with unknown gentleman on travel be not pleasant to be spoken of a man be speaking of miss baker niece truth be that more punctilious person in money dealing than miss baker never carried purse have not allowed mr m'gabbery so much a to lay out on behalf single piastre for orange on road have be sole companion on journey through desert have come to jerusalem with gentleman wife mr m'gabbery have be kindly allowed to join well if be must show cold shoulder said mr cruse a to intolerable puppy must take further notice of except by cutting dead mr m'gabbery at last promised to follow friend advice so miss todd picnic came to end without bloodshed chapter x effect of miss todd picnic sir lionel did not participate violently either in son disgust at falsehood of holy sepulchre church in enthusiasm a to mount of olive in former walked about a have done in many other foreign church looked little to right little to left observed that roof seemed to be rather out of order declined entering sanctum sanctorum then asked whether there be anything more to be seen did not care said about going upstairs into gallery when george suggested that must descend into armenian chapel observed that appeared to be very dark very crowded looked at turkish janitor without dismay must not at understand why george must not approve of be equally cold equally complaisant on mount of olive must willingly have avoided ascent must have done so without displeasing son george made point of donkey be therefore got for rode up ah yes said very clear view of city oh be solomon temple be now have mosque there have ah perhaps brahmin will have turn at before world be done be barren sort of hill after be not then george tried very much in vain to make father understand why wished to go into church by by said sir lionel be then sitting exactly on spot where george have placed before when made that grand resolve to give up everything belonging to world for sake of being one of christ shepherd by by george for heaven sake throw uncle over in choosing profession certainly must be sorry to see become attorney have never thought of for moment said george because with ability at rate with chance of money think must be very much thrown away considering circumstance yours be must really submit almost to anything will not at rate submit to said george not very well able to reconcile father tone to spot on be sitting well be own affair boy have right to interfere will not attempt to do so of course must be anxious if did go into church suppose 'd buy living for certainly not must take college living at age that must get must be very small ah george if must only put old head upon young shoulder what hand of card must have to play old man must leave million of money be certainly not object with son have ascended mount did not use much eloquence to induce father to remain long in place sir lionel got again on donkey returned to jerusalem did george ever again talk to about mount of olive be not very much more successful with friend into whose mind endeavoured to inculcate own high feeling got miss baker up to favourite seat with miss waddington then before have left jerusalem succeeded in inducing younger lady to ramble thither with alone know that think so highly of church a do said caroline a far a have seen can not find that clergyman be more holy than other men yet surely ought to be so at rate there be more scope for holiness if man have in to be heart of clergyman be more likely to be softened than of barrister attorney exactly know what mean by heart softening mr bertram mean said bertram then paused be not quite able with word at command to explain to girl what be that did mean be sure that must appreciate if did do so fond a still be of idea of holy life perhaps at moment be fonder still of think that man must do best can for in profession have noble position within grasp if be certainly must not bury in country parsonage what girl of twenty said to have much more weight than time honoured precept of father yet doubtless have weight blow told somewhat seed too have be sown upon very stony ground sat there three four minute in silence bertram be looking over to mount moriah imaging to spot where table of money changer have be overturned while miss waddington be gazing at setting sun have eye to see material beauty taste to love be not given to to look back feel thing a to lover must fain have spoken to temple in jesus have taught be nothing to yes be lover now though have never spoken to of love have never acknowledged to that did love a so few men ever do acknowledge till word that have said make necessary that must ask whether word be true sat there for minute in silence not a lover sit distance between be safe respectful bertram be stretched upon ground with eye fixed not upon on city opposite sat demurely on rock shading with parasol suppose nothing must induce to marry clergyman said at last why must suppose that mr bertram at rate not parson of country parish be led to suppose by what said to just now be speaking of not of myself say that have noble career open to look on ordinary life of country parson a noble career for see nobility in store know that there be fate more probable for than of becoming respectable vicaress why may not vicar career be noble be not a noble to have to deal with soul a with body judge by what see be generally fond of eating very cautious about money untidy in own house apt to go to sleep after dinner george turned upon grass for moment two ceased to look across into city have not strength of character to laugh at description yet to be unmoved by must either resent what said laugh be ruled by must either tell that knew nothing of clergyman dearest hope else must yield to contempt word implied must love honour obey such man a miss waddington said at last suppose such men do have wife who love honour obey who do dare say must do much same a others speak of future miss waddington a though be subject of interest seem to think nothing of own be useless for woman to think of future can do so little towards planning bringing about plan besides have right to count on a anything out of ordinary run of woman have taken double first degree in anything double first be sign of true heart true spirit many man born to grovel have taken double first perhaps know what mean by grovelling mr bertram like groveller like men who can keep head up who once having above water will never allow to sink men in age do win distinction wealth high place be not groveller if be must be one of must not become clergyman certainly not no more than must be shoemaker miss waddington well what of miss waddington look at clergyman that know do never grovel know mr wilkinson be excellent man be sure be conspicuous for highmindedness for truth spirit must be remembered that elder mr wilkinson be at time still living be generally men of wide view enlightened principle mean to liken to shoemaker be must think of one business a soon a other in place what profession must choose ah can not say know circumstance must earn bread like other son of adam well earn then in such manner that eye of world will be upon that men woman will talk of newspaper have name in column whatever profession let be wakeful one not one that can follow half asleep again paused for awhile again sat looking at rock of temple still thought of table of money changer insufficiency of who have given a much a half to poor even while so thinking be tempted to give le than half to set up on own account money changing table in own temple must fain have worshipped at two shrine together have be able be not able so fell down before that of mammon can talk to in way urge to be ambitious yet confess that must give to one of drone of whom speak with such scorn speak of one with scorn be not urging at present be not talking of giving to one ask a to possibility of ever marrying clergyman say that be very possible that may do so day miss waddington said george now have turned face absolutely from city be looking upwards to hill upwards full into beauty of countenance miss waddington well mr bertram speak of a though be being high in scale of humanity so think of listen for moment of a one comparatively low not low have too much pride for much lower than certainly for have given proof of genius well lower than be what have said believe that must say so falsely must not descend to flatter certainly not believe equally of must not flatter have told no falsehood a yet have right to claim belief a look on so do on look up to a one whose destiny must be high to there be that about forbids to think that path in world can ever be other than conspicuous husband at least will have to live before world will not have slightest objection to doing so that think will depend great deal more on than on bertram be very anxious to say something might tend towards commingling of destiny with hers be hardly yet prepared to swear that loved to ask in good set term to be wife did not like to leave without learning whether have at touched heart be fully sure now that own be not whole come mr bertram said look at sun how nearly be gone know have twilight here let go down aunt will think that be lost one minute waddington one minute then will go miss waddington if care enough for to bid take up profession follow pursuit will obey will choose for if will blushed not deeply with colour sufficiently heightened to make visible to with tingling warmth made conscious of must have given much to keep countenance yet blush became greatly took away from premature firmness of womanly look gave for moment something of weakness natural to age know be nonsense on subject must of course choose for bertram be standing in path before must not well go on till have made way for said thinking a do of feeling a do regarding be not nonsense must be absolute nonsense if said so to aunt to mr hunter to miss jones must not be guided by person who be indifferent to in matter will be guided by if will consent to guide of course will do such thing have personal wish then for welfare yes have uncle be guardian may therefore be allowed to look upon a friend of longer standing than merely of yesterday do regard a friend will be glad of success here paused walked on few step together in silence then added becoming still redder a did so now managing to hide face from companion be to answer in way that pretend to wish must affect le friendship than feel much more much more said bertram with shade of despondency in tone yes much more mr bertram why what must have say ah hardly know nothing nothing must have say nothing be quite right to say nothing then walked on again for hundred yard in silence nothing miss waddington nothing unless indeed mr bertram a spoke put out hand gently touched arm mr bertram stop think at rate of what be going to say be pity when such a speak foolishly be singular to see how much more composed be than how much more able to manage occasion yet feeling be strong too nothing must have say nothing nothing unless destiny may be will share with a spoke did not look towards straight before down path did not sigh look soft there be indeed not much capability for soft look in square strongly featured face frowned rather set teeth together walked on faster than before caroline did not answer immediately then repeated word care for to say anything now unless can say lot may be may share mine that will share mr bertram well now have spoken foolishly do not know that have spoken foolishly have spoken truly do speak a truly must be a much above false girlish petty scruple a will be be above falsehood of kind will never tell man that love if certainly never will deny if be truth be not truth how long have known other mr bertram counting by day hour fortnight what doe signify love man better always longer know of discern that there be that in can love must make happy have talent sort of talent at least have spirit must force to use will not pretend to say that be suited for must judge that know that be suited for now will take answer will give to tell truth miss waddington hardly knew what answer to give be one seemed who having spoken with decision must take answer a decisive be one not to be tampered with one also hardly to be rejected without consideration certainly not so to be accepted have liked much very much considering little have known of have even asked playfully whether be not possible that might learn to love be gentleman that with be much be man of talent that with be more be one whose character mode of thought must respect be man whom woman might probably be able to respect caroline waddington wanted much more than in future lord must talk pleasantly of probability of marrying country parson have in truth much wider ambition for must never marry such be creed be to govern own life without love must not allow to love where love must interfere with high hope in catalogue of human bliss love in cottage be not entered be not avaricious did not look to money a summum bonum certainly not to marry for money sake knew that figure in world must be made without mean own fortune be small did not even rate beauty high birth be birth of lady be talent have never be tried thought of more indifferently than deserved felt therefore that have just ground to hope for much be determined that folly on own part must rob of chance that fortune might vouchsafe to under such circumstance what answer must make to bertram heart must have bid not reject be fearful of own heart dreaded lest must be betrayed into sacrificing to love ought prudence now to step in bid dismiss suitor whose youth have a yet achieved nothing whose own mean be very small with whom if be accepted marriage must be postponed who however be of great talent who gave such promise of future distinction bertram when made offer made from full heart caroline be able to turn matter in mind before answered will be called cold hearted mercenary unfeminine when young girl throw prudence to wind allows to love where there be nothing to live on what then be called seems to that be sometimes very hard for young girl to be in right certainly must not be mercenary certainly must not marry pauper certainly must not allow to become old maid must not encumber with early hopeless love must callously resolve to care for nothing good income good house there must be handbook of love to tell young lady when may give way to without censure a regard heroine however probably wanted such handbook now will take answer will give bertram when have said that remained silent awaiting reply mr bertram said at last think that have spoken unwisely let agree to forget what have said have come from impulse rather than judgment not so miss waddington can not forget can must not have again unsaid if must when once learned that loved became natural to to tell so such quick speaking be not perhaps natural to a demand immediate answer must give one have have much pleasure in society have never thought of loving can love without thinking of must be hard to say what answer bertram expected indeed have expectation have have idea of making offer when walked up hill with heart be then turned rather to worship at other shrine have be own word own eloquence in favour of world greatness have drawn on have previously filled mind with expectation have felt intense desire for success when once have committed to offer now a walked down beside hardly knew what to make of answer man if be not absolutely rejected be generally inclined to think that answer from lady may be taken a having in glimmer of favour lady know so well that almost regard reply on own part short of absolute refusal a acceptance if lady bid gentleman wait awhile for answer think quite justified in letting world know that be own know what reference to parent judgment mean lady must be very decisive very if mean to have taken at full meaning now caroline waddington have not be very decisive whatever bertram thought hope might be said nothing more on present occasion walked silently down hill by side somewhat moody looking yet not with hang dog aspect of rejected suitor there be fire in eye play upon countenance did not tell of hope altogether extinguished before be at foot of hill have resolved that must have caroline waddington for wife let difficulty in way be what might then be ever so keen to resolve so often beaten from resolution caroline also walked silently down hill knew that have given ambiguous answer be content to let remain so in silence of chamber must think over thing make calculation must inquire into own mind learn whether must afford to love man whom must not acknowledge to be so loveable a for asking one else seeking counsel in matter from aunt never for moment suggested to caroline waddington have left miss baker miss todd at bottom of hill be beautiful evening lady have consented to sit down rest there while more enthusiastic young lover of mount ascended to spot of bertram be so fond in giving consent have hardly expected that such encroachment must be made on good nature when caroline bertram again found daylight have almost waned away chapter xi vale valete miss baker be little querulous at being left so long sitting with miss todd at corner of garden wall miss todd be never querulous be one of good humoured person who never complain find antidote to ill in life even in ill true have be kept couple of hour more sitting on stone by brook cedron then have acquired privilege of telling how mr george bertram miss caroline waddington have passed hour tete tete together on mountain side why caroline thought be never coming down again said miss baker be mr bertram fault aunt be immoveable when get to certain rock up there have idea of turning hermit constructing cell for in spot if did turn hermit must certainly be for sake of living there said fear want proper spirit for so holy life hope have not kept time for nothing have have success trust said miss todd to bertram in laughing whisper miss todd face be quite joyous a whispered then face be always joyous certainly have not done that intended to do said bertram with mock sententiousness so far have be unsuccessful then have rejected said miss todd to herself what fool girl must be be great comfort to miss todd that knew about that evening plan be decided on a to leaving jerusalem plan be of whose fortune must follow miss baker namely niece sir lionel son of miss todd may here take leave for awhile did not on occasion marry sir lionel did even have satisfaction of knowing that friend accused of wishing to do so miss todd have weak point taking a whole striking balance between good bad care how soon may meet again to friend also may bid adieu mr m'gabbery did not die of love mr pott did propose to be accepted by miss jones match be broken off by parental potts who on occasion nearly frightened poor mr jones out of life hunter sojourned for awhile on side of lebanon did at last return to discomfort of european life mr hunter tried effect of favourite costume at tenby be not found to answer of mr cruse can only say that be dreadfully scolded by mr pott in have allowed son to fall in love that mr pott threatened to stop salary attorney letter however settled that must be confessed that miss baker have allowed plan to be altered by arrival of bertrams at jerusalem confessed also that miss baker complaisance in respect have be brought about by niece persuasion original intention have be to go on to damascus then miss baker have begged off further journey alleging that clothes a well a strength be worn out caroline have consented to return home by shortest route then came temptation of going a far a beyrout with bertrams miss baker have be enjoined to have patched up externally internally be accordingly being patched up now thing be altered again caroline knew that must not travel with george bertram without engaging to be wife that if did journey must not be happy one did not wish so to engage without further thought determined therefore that must fall back upon aunt plan return home by easier route by jaffa be alexandria altered mind have to be explained not only to aunt to bertrams came to somewhat singular resolve to explain in case by simple truth must tell aunt what have happened must make george bertram understand in few a kind word a might be that under present circumstance must be better that must not be thrown into very close intercourse necessary for fellow traveller in east be very prudent be miss waddington having freed of one lover because did not like prepared to rid herself of because did bertrams be to leave jerusalem together in couple of day time george be to go with father a far a constantinople having seen something of real turk in real turkey be to return at once to england after last visit to mount of olive said nothing further about church a profession that evening caroline settled with aunt aunt said a sat together brushing hair before went to bed will think very fanciful after believe have better go back by alexandria oh dear will be so glad dear jane say must not possibly get travelling dress made here must wear must get dress in damascus doubt aunt really be not fit for much more riding like to disappoint if really must mind well must mind must not let tell must not think that be so very changeable first pressing to go one way then begging to go without reason know do for sake not that aunt quite do listen mr bertram to day made have not offered to have yes aunt be just what have done therefore perhaps will not be quite so well that must travel together caroline tell pray do tell what did say what have said oh dear be very sudden miss baker sat back in chair with now grayish hair hanging over shoulder with hair brush still held in one hand with other resting on toilet table a for what said may skip aunt be old story suppose merely signifying that wanted to marry well well a truly say aunt be too sudden mr bertram have great deal to recommend very great deal one can not like be very clever too yes caroline will be uncle heir doubtless know nothing of to tell truth indeed never thought of must have made difference refused well hardly know do know did more towards refusing than accepting must have much more love for man do marry than have for at present after what have passed think have better not go to damascus together to latter proposition aunt mary fully agreed thus be decided that extra patching for longer journey need not be accomplished miss baker must explain matter to sir lionel in way caroline must do same to george bertram in hers on one other point also miss baker made up mind fully though on matter did not think prudent to make mind known to niece be very confident that marriage must take place resolved to do in power to bring about personally be fond of george bertram admired talent liked father felt very favourably inclined towards uncle wealth finished toilet therefore in calm happiness have excellent match in view for niece after must escape that dreadful horseback journey to damascus during next day caroline george bertram be not together for moment be be not together alone for breakfasted dined at same table sat between aunt niece a have done continually since have be at jerusalem sir lionel told in forenoon that be not to have pleasure of lady company on journey rallied a to heart breaking tendency of tidings george showed in countenance at least symptom of heart breaking evening a parted for night george did press miss waddington hand more warmly than be usual with a did so did look into face for one moment to see what encouragement might find there can not say that there be encouragement pressure be perhaps not met by similar warmth on part be submitted to without touch of resentment love shot from eye be not returned to from hers hers be soft beneath glance softer than be usual with caroline waddington on next morning did come together be day before departure of bertrams be to be said must be said then caroline watched opportunity a soon a breakfast be over breakfasted in public salon asked to come into aunt sitting room be quite collected have fully made up mind what to say be able also to say without hesitation with perfect self possession be more than must be boasted of on gentleman behalf know mr bertram that be not going to travel together yes father told so yesterday will understand reason of be sure not exactly miss waddington can not say do understand may have be presumptuous in what said to other day see why on account aunt must be put to inconvenience of altering plan fear suppose must annoy might trust still may if will do so now mr bertram be hardly so sincere a asserted to be required to be on mount be quite aware that nobody have thought presumptuous have nothing to complain of much to thank for independently of honour have now done for from be honour can not say that love must not be natural must do so good heaven not natural love with whole strength of heart be that unnatural be province of men to take initiative in such matter said caroline smiling know nothing a to man province of woman province by province mean custom conventional rule conventional rule mean falsehood have known week two love dearly of course have known a long be at rate a capable of loving a be there must be nothing unnatural in loving though indeed may be very unlikely that must do so well will not contradict in anything if can help except perhaps a to last little must be proud petulant protest putting out of sight question of likelihood what ought to do if love what in such case must recommend sister to do be not better that must not be immediately thrown together a must so certainly be case in travelling then be to understand that positively can never love have not said so press unfairly mr bertram unfairly by heaven pressure in such case can be unfair must press truth out from real truth truth so vitally concern will not say that have aversion to aversion certainly not that can not love then why not let remain together argue that yet know well enough will not that be way to know better if be to travel with now mr bertram must be tantamount to accepting own sense will certainly tell be to do so must give privilege of coming with a lover forgive for saying can not give privilege grieve to hurt feeling for day even be sure will ultimately approve of what be doing be to meet more then of course will meet again at least in human probability guardian be uncle never even knew that till met other day because have always be at school at college know now at least will look forward to meeting so will aunt yes a acquaintance must be impossible for to meet in way hardly think know realize what feeling to be can only meet to tell again again that love be so cold that can not understand impetuosity if choose to call so in three four month mr bertram will be laughing at own impetuosity when perhaps will be grieving over own coldness last word said with smile in there be much archness perhaps also little encouragement will tell at rate may hope certainly not will hope enough for anything really desire without telling will not joke a believe that be serious oh believe so do yes suppose must believe so declaration other day took very much by surprise have conception that have feeling towards of sort certainly have entertained none such towards love with can not be birth of moment can not say will love merely because be asked must not wish to be false even in own favour will part now mr bertram being apart will better learn to know of how value other on part can truly say that hope will meet again at rate a friend then held out hand to be to be farewell said without at once taking will be if so please will meet again only at public table will not tell may hope will tell nothing further mr bertram will shake hand with a with friend will not then took hand holding in own gazed for moment into face bore weight of eye with unabashed front showed anger pleasure disdain pride same sweet smile be still upon face somewhat playful somewhat hopeful capable of definite construction for making marring man comfort caroline said at last good bye mr bertram thoroughly hope may enjoy journey caroline essayed to withdraw hand from feeling raised to lip kissed then left room a closed door same smile be on face hope will be admitted that miss waddington have played part with skill judgment good breeding not altogether heartlessly have thought much on subject since george have first thrown at foot have concluded putting good against bad balancing affair a accurately a fact must enable that match must be one ought to regard a desirable there be two valid reason however why must not at once accept offer firstly might not know own mind might be serviceable to to have option of renewing proposal retreating from after few month trial of own feeling secondly hardly knew own mind must not in truth say yet whether did love whether did not be rather inclined to think did must be well that must try matter before committed statement made by aunt that george must doubtless be uncle heir certainly have weight with must be wrong in to engage to man who be without mean of maintaining in rank of life in have resolved to live wrong on account on own felt that must not be good poor man wife be not walk of life for have destined have made up mind on point too having made up be not weak enough to be driven from resolve by little gust of feeling did like bertram much very much better then have ever liked other man came up in many point to idea of what man must be be not sufficiently collected not sufficiently thoughtful perhaps almost too enthusiastic success in life must be easier to man who put le heart into everything said did year must teach much in respect also might perhaps teach something did like bertram what objection must there be to match if a appeared so probable be to inherit uncle money prudent a be be ready to run risk in respect did not wish to be poor man wife did wish to be idle man wife what did desire be that husband must be earnest rising successful man one whose name a have said to bertram might be frequent in men mouth daily to be read in column of newspaper must not marry fool even though be also croesus must not marry fool even though be also earl in choosing master first necessity be that must respect then that world must do so also must respect talent talent if need be alone nothing without talent world respect must not be have without wealth a for love be necessary too be only third necessity such being heroine mind about marriage make bold to say that have behaved with skill judgment not altogether heartlessly on following morning sir lionel george left jerusalem together colonel have own servant a always have george be followed by dragoman who have now be with for time have also arab groom on quitting jerusalem sir lionel have made objection to having entire bill settled by son well george have said with smile know be in ample fund never be have milch cow will not run dry government be cow be apt to be very chary in supply doe run dry with uncommon quickness george smiled also paid bill readily protesting that of course ought to do so a sir lionel have come there only to see colonel plumed at once upon having managed well be greatly mistaken calculation in respect have be made on false basis george said to be young man will think nothing of fellow at age care nothing for money george did care little for money did care about father understood way of world well enough to know that father ought to have paid own bill began for first time to experience something of feeling uncle so often expressed started too with somewhat different idea a to purport of route sir lionel wished to get to constantinople be content for george sake to go by damascus beyrout george have to visit ramah gibeon luz to see well of woman of samaria at sichem to climb mount carmel to sleep at least for night within monastery mount tabor also bethsaida capernaum must visit must bathe in sea of galilee a have already bathed in jordan dead sea gadara must see gergesa chorazin above must stand with naked foot in nazareth feel within heart that be resting on holy ground sir lionel did not care straw for bethsaida chorazin not straw even for nazareth for many reason wished to be well with son in first place man whose bill be paid for always make concession to man who pay must do so at rate on point sir lionel be willing to be just then have ulterior view made very necessary that george must like in respect have hitherto played card well well with exception of jerusalem bill have made society very pleasant to son have done much towards gaining young man heart be well inclined to do more anything indeed short of putting to real personal inconvenience may perhaps add without doing too much violence to sir lionel established character that really liked son for day carried hither thither if not with patience at rate with perseverance went to spot be told have world wide celebrity of name of have bare distant remembrance found to be arid comfortless uninteresting gibeon did endure shiloh sichem gilgal also carmel there broke down must not said justify to to be absent longer from official duty found that be near beyrout must ride thither in two day avoiding damascus altogether cookery at mount carmel did not add to love of holy land found to be not very well laughingly reminded george that there be difference between twenty three sixty ended by declining altogether to go backwards towards sea of galilee if george must only be induced to think that have seen enough of region father must be so delighted to have company direct from beyrout to constantinople george however be inexorable about nazareth so parted agreeing that must meet again at constantinople need not closely follow on journey sir lionel having have everything paid for up to moment of separation arrived let hope with full purse at bosphorus george when left to travelled more slowly thought much of holy place much also of love must have found in heart to rush back catch miss baker caroline at jaffa must have done so a soon a quitted nazareth only that be ashamed about fortnight after father departure found at damascus in week be stepping on board packet at beyrout when leaving palestine that land of such wondrous association feeling be not altogether consolatory have at one moment acknowledged what believed to be spiritual influence within yielding to have spoken of devoting life to high holy purpose have indeed spoken only to wound to pride be therefore le high holy purpose have be blown to wind by few word from pair of ruby lip by one glance of scorn from pair of bright eye have so yielded even though lip must acknowledge love for though eye must not look on kindly must not be proud of visit to holy land yet felt longing to linger there might be that if must return once more to mount look once again on sion temple spirit might yet get better of flesh ala have to own to that have now hardly wish that spirit must predominate thing of world be too bright to be given up charm of flesh be too strong for with sigh looked back for last time from mount hermon stretched out arm once more towards jerusalem said one farewell in heart a eye rested for moment on distant glassy water of galilee then set horse head towards damascus when traveller in railroad day take leave of florence vienna munich lucerne doe so without much of bitterness of farewell place be now comparatively so near that expects to see again at rate hope that may do so jerusalem be still distant from sabbath day journey man who having seen once take leave then see probably for last time man heart must be very cold who can think of palestine exactly a of other land be not therefore surprising that bertram be rather sad a rode down further side of mount hermon at constantinople sir lionel george again met hero spent pleasant month there with father be still spring summer heat have hardly commenced george be charmed if not with city of sultan at rate with scenery around here father appeared in new light be more intimate with other than have be at jerusalem be not now living in lady society sir lionel by degree threw off what little restraint of governorship what small amount of parental authority have hitherto assumed seemed anxious to live with son on term of perfect equality began to talk to rather a young men talk to other than men of age so very different appeared to court lack of reverence in ordinary habit of life indeed in physical vivacity sir lionel be very young for time of life never pleaded year in bar of pleasure never pleaded at except when desirous of excuse for escaping something be disagreeable there be subject on young men talk freely with other on hesitate to speak to elder without restraint sir lionel did best to banish such feeling on part of son of wine woman of card horse of money comfort money discomfort spoke in manner bertram at first did not like after awhile be not distasteful to there be always compliment implied when old man unbends before young one be make viciousness of old men so dangerous say that sir lionel purposely tempted son to vice plainly showed that regarded morality in man to be a thoroughly peculiar attribute of clergyman a black coat that there must be reason for other men even to pretend to when there be woman by to be respected deceived bertram certainly liked father be at ease in company in spite of be ashamed of be sometimes very sorrowful be young full of vivacity without strength of character must have withstood charm of sir lionel manner knew well that must fain have have in father feeling of very different nature must not acknowledge that severity of uncle tone be deserved have be george intention to stay week only at constantinople father have persuaded to remain four have boasted that when returned to england must be in position to give back to uncle three hundred pound pritchett have placed to account must not now be able to do father lived expensively even here where sir lionel be now at home george paid more than own share of expense one of chief subject of conversation that indeed sir lionel seemed to prefer to other be ultimate disposal of brother money perceived that george thought on subject be by far too transcendental that be childishly indifferent to own interest that if not brought to keener sense of own right stronger feeling a to position a only nephew of very wealthy man might let slip through finger magnificent fortune be absolutely within reach so thinking detained son near for awhile that might if possible imbue with spark of worldly wisdom knew how useless must be to lecture young man like george a to best way in must play tuft hunter to uncle from such lecture george must have started away in disgust something sir lionel thought might be done by tact by finesse daily half scornful badinage skilfully directed towards proper subject by degree too thought that george did listen to that be learning that might be taught to set eye greedily on mountain of wealth so sir lionel persevered with diligence to end say everything be civil from to brother said colonel day before george left uncle george doe not care much for civil speech said other laughing know doe not 'd think more of if must send home remittance by to pay bill george a ca do may a well send few civil word uncle george bill have gradually become source of joke between father son sir lionel at least be accustomed to mention in way that junior george must not help laughing though at first have gone against grain of feeling by degree have become used to expects fancy money civil word said george younger will not on account be le pleased at getting one other believe everything that everybody tell in own praise when man say that doe not like flattery that put value on soft word on account be deterred from making civil speech may have ready will not be bit stronger than because boast of strength really think must find difficult to flatter brother perhaps so therefore must set about with more care be in shoe must not attempt flattery must be very submissive rather always loved to play tyrant love to play slave only nephew slavery must probably be of very mild description yes harder than sitting on clerk stool in merchant counting house for seven eight hour day must be unendurable bore a continuance take word for george if must bring to do for six month by end of time must have game in own hand at rate will not try sir well be own master can only say that temptation must be too strong for most men have not slightest doubt that if must give way to for six month two year must see in parliament sir lionel have already ascertained that to sit in house of common be dearest object of son ambition on evening of day a be drinking coffee smoking together sir lionel for first time spoke to son on matter george said know whether there be anything in when be at jerusalem thought be very sweet on caroline waddington george blushed deeply affected to laugh be certainly very fine girl continued father think a handsome girl a have seen ten year what shoulder neck have when used to be dragging up mount of olive must not think there be more in than mere scripture geography eh george george merely laughed looked rather like simpleton if be not in love with can only say that ought to have be be know well sir believe be free a yet can try chance if have mind ah must must if knew medea secret must have chopped boiled might come out young on behalf george can tell something about well sir must have told then when be at jerusalem be not so well acquainted then a be now did not like to interfere must not be interference from well matter be if brother ever loved human being be not quite sure ever did if did be that girl father have waddington lived must now have be age uncle took early by hand must have made fortune for poor fellow died in opinion must assist view if uncle knew that be going to marry caroline waddington george said nothing sat sucking mouth piece of pipe stick blowing out great cloud of smoke sir lionel said nothing further easily changed conversation early on following morning bertram left constantinople having received promise sir lionel must visit in england a soon a exigency of public service must permit of doing so chapter xii george bertram decides in favour of bar george bertram did not return directly to england since have be in turkey have made arrangement by letter with friend harcourt to meet in tyrol to travel home with through switzerland be about middle of june when left constantinople harcourt be to be at innspruck on th august george might therefore well have remained week two longer with father have of so wished of did wish living at constantinople be dear george fund must not stand much more of sir lionel free easy a be still felt son presence a impediment perhaps in way of business perhaps in of pleasure from constantinople bertram went up across balkan to danube thence through bucharest into transylvania travelling a in day be necessary somewhat by permission of russian authority then again struck danube at pesth remained little time there again week so at vienna from thence visited saltzburg exactly on appointed day shook hand with friend in hall of old golden sun at innspruck at first on leaving

sick also of thinking of love fully able to re echo harcourt have to say in praise of very fine old wine fastidious gentleman caused to be produced for from cellar of golden sun innspruck be beautiful little town perhaps town in europe can boast site more exquisitely picturesque edinburgh must be equal to if have river instead of railroad running through valley under castle hill sojourned too long in holy land to permit of dwelling even for chapter in tyrol george however friend remained there for fortnight went over brenner looked down into italy made excursion to singular golden tinted mountain dolomite among live race of men who speak german italian other language known among hundred dialect of europe patois left to from ancient latin wandered through valley of inn tributary wondered at odd way of living still prevails in picturesque castellated mansion for awhile bertram thought that harcourt be best companion in world be a agreeable easy tempered a father be at same time educated man father certainly be not harcourt though put happiness in material thing perhaps quite a much a did sir lionel required that material thing must be of high flavour be reading man addicted in certain cynical carping sort of way even to poetry be critic almost by profession loved picture professed to love scenery certainly loved to watch scrutinize different class of brother men be gifted pre eminently with lawyer mind be not lawyer mind of vulgar quality too loved rich looked on success in world a man chief nay perhaps only aim for be necessary that success must be polished sir lionel wanted money that might swallow consume a shark doe prey like shark in general have always be hungry have never have bellyful of money harcourt desire for money be of different class must not suit to be in debt to one good balance at banker be thing dear to soul aimed at perfect respectability also at perfect independence for awhile therefore harcourt teaching be great improvement on sir lionel be felt to be so preached love of good thing good thing be to be corollary only to good work sir lionel summum bonum must have be unexpected pocketful of money three month of idleness in to spend pleasant companion for time who must be at rate a well provided in pocket a harcourt must have required something more world respect esteem be a necessary to a world pleasure nevertheless after time harcourt morality offended bertram a bertram transcendentalism offended harcourt admired same view must not look at through same coloured glass so on whole liked governor said harcourt to one day a be walking across mountain range from one valley to yes indeed one be apt to be prejudiced in one father favour of course said harcourt be to say when one have seen for twenty year so more common constant knowledge perhaps put prejudice other way sir lionel be undoubtedly very pleasant man one fancy must help liking society understand a well a though have written book about have none of great art bertram teach man to use speech to conceal thought why must wish to conceal thought from know exactly what mean about father be martinet in society even with son assumes to mysterious unintelligible dignity have none of military grimgruffenuff about take thing easily allows other people to do same exactly be not exactly what wanted if have treated a though father son be necessarily

despair however a for ball be at foot talked very freely with other a to future hope future destiny harcourt seemed to take a settled matter bertram must enter at bar bertram did not longer contradict since have learnt miss waddington idea on subject expressed further desire to go into church have in fact nothing serious to say in favour of of other profession of have sometimes be accustomed to speak there be nothing bar left for therefore when harcourt at last asked question plainly said that supposed that such must be fate on one subject bertram did not speak openly to friend said not word to about caroline harcourt be in many respect excellent friend have hardly that softness of heart that softness of expression tempts one man to make confidant in affair of love if harcourt have such affair said nothing of to bertram at present time bertram said nothing on subject to kept that care deep in own bosom have a yet spoken word written word concerning to one even when friend have once casually asked whether have met much in way of beauty in jerusalem have felt to wince a though subject be too painful to be spoken of reached london about middle of october harcourt declared that must

have be employed a junior counsel in great case of pike v perch have distinguished not little by success in turning white into black then have decidedly worst of said bertram to when matter be talked over between oh decidedly nevertheless pulled through opinion along be that none of pike have leg to stand upon there be three of wo bore with case will hear more of day for will be on again before lord justice in spring be pike counsel one of junior have most of fag none of honour be of course think that perch ought to have succeeded well talking to really think ought must not admit that to one else sir ricketty giggs led for know thought so too at first though got so carried away by own eloquence at last that believe changed mind well if 'd thought must have held brief for pike ever swam if man case be weak then be to have advocate be idea of justice if be so weak that one can be got to think right of course must have advocate how be to know till have taken matter up sifted what propose be quixotic in way will not hold water for moment know a well a do that barrister must keep wig on head who pretended to such code of moral in profession doctrine be doctrine of puritanism purism be worse moonshine be very well for when talked of being clergyman author painter one allows outsider amount of nonsense in criticism a matter of course wo do now bertram if mean to put shoulder to wheel in only profession to mind be worthy of educated man energy must get rid of cobweb upon word harcourt when hit on subject like eloquence be wonderful sir ricketty giggs must hardly say more to defend sin of forty year endurance harcourt have spoken in earnest such milk water unpractical scruple be disgusting to very soul in thinking of to must call unmanly what be such fellow a bertram boy just fresh from college to animadvert upon condemn practice of whole bar of england have too conviction clearly fixed in own mind though must hardly explain ground of in word in long run cause of justice must be better served by present practice of allowing wrong right to fight on equal term by giving to wrong same privilege be given to right by giving to wrong even wider privilege seeing that being in necessarily weak need more protection must declare that be trampling on fallen if told that wrong must be entitled to privilege protection to protection till be admitted by admitted by to be wrong bertram have now to establish in london be also a thought under necessity of seeing two person uncle miss waddington must not settle well to work before have done one preliminary business did settle for in order that uncle when saw might know that choice for bar be made up past recalling selected that great enduring chancery barrister mr neversaye die a gamaliel at whose foot must sit a fountain from whence must draw coming water of own eloquence a instructor of legal infancy guide of legal youth harcourt be at common law bar therefore recommended other branch of profession to friend common law said may have most dash about chancery have substance george after thinking over matter for day gave a opinion that chancery barrister be rogue of dye somewhat le black than others that must select to be rogue of colour matter be therefore so settled first step then be to see uncle told a thought truly that doing so be duty disagreeable in respect to be attended with pecuniary result necessary to be performed in truth however teaching of sir lionel harcourt have not be altogether without effect at present moment having just paid to mr neversaye die first yearly contribution be well nigh penniless after if rich uncle have money to bestow why must not bestow on nephew money at rate be not in deleterious so much george be already prepared to allow therefore called on uncle in city have george what be back be well come dine at hadley to morrow must be at bank before three good bye boy be uncle said to at first meeting then saw mr pritchett for moment oh mr george be glad to see back sir very glad indeed sir hear have be to very foreign part hope have always found money right mr george mr george shaking hand with warmly assured that money have always be quite right a long a lasted little doe not go long way be sure in very foreign part said mr pritchett oracularly mr george why did write eh mr george mean to say that uncle expected to hear from asked very often whether have tidings ah mr george know old man way must have be better for to have be led by so have seen mr lionel sir lionel must say now hope sir lionel be quite well george told that have found father in excellent health be going away when mr pritchett asked question rather made observation so saw miss waddington did mr george bertram felt that there be that in countenance might again betray managed to turn away face a said yes did meet quite by chance at jerusalem at jerusalem said mr pritchett with look of surprise with awe struck tone a might have suited acquaintance of aeneas on hearing that gentleman tell how have travelled beyond styx mr pritchett be rather fat wheezy effort made sigh gently for next two minute bertram have put on hat be going when mr pritchett recovering asked yet further question what did think of miss waddington sir think of said george very beautiful young lady be clever too knew father well mr george very well be very handsome young lady ah well have money enough mr george be fact be fact mr pritchett whispered a continued old gentleman might make more mr george mr pritchett have somewhat melancholy way of speaking of everything be more in tone than in word tone be sepulchral be perhaps owing rather to short neck asthmatic tendency than to real sorrow natural lowness of spirit who saw mr pritchett often probably remembered counted on with george there be always graveyard touch about little interview must not therefore have melancholy presentiment when heard miss waddington spoken of in such tone on following day went down to hadley a be customary there found that be to spend evening tete tete with uncle nothing seemed changed since have left uncle came in just before dinner poked fire exactly a have done on last visit george have paid after long absence come john be three minute late why have dinner asked question at least not at first about sir lionel about jerusalem seemed resolute to give traveller none of eclat to pay to adventure none of deferential awe have be so well expressed by mr pritchett in two word mr bertram though always began so coldly did usually improve after few hour tone must gradually become le cynical harsh word must come out more freely must appear somewhat le anxious to wound amour propre of companion be much wiser for travel george said at last when john have taken away dinner be left alone with bottle of port wine between too be asked in very cynical tone still there be improvement in very fact of deigning to allude to journey yes think be rather wiser well be glad of a have lost year in profession be well that must have gained something have accession of wisdom be very extensive somewhat short of solomon sir probably quite a much a must have picked up have remained in london be very probable suppose have not slightest idea how much cost indeed must be very vulgar way of looking at thanks to unexpected kindness have not be driven to very close economy ah be pritchett doing seemed afraid that land must not flow with milk honey unless pocket be fairly provided of course be own affair george be money borrowed that be george did not quite understand what meant remained silent at one moment be almost on tongue to say that ought at least to be admitted that borrower have not be very pressing in application suppose have come back empty continued uncle george then explained exactly how stood with regard to money saying how have put into hand of mr neversaye die how have taken chamber in middle temple how volume of blackstone be already lying open in dingy sitting room very well very well have objection whatever will perhaps make nothing at bar certainly never half what must have done with messrs dry stickatit be affair bar be thoroughly respectable by by be father satisfied with a profession be first allusion that mr bertram have made to brother perfectly so said george because of course be bound to consult if be intended for irony be so well masked that george be not able to be sure of did consult sir said george turning red in accordance with inveterate stupid habit of be right did consult about thing did ask what be to live on till such time a must earn own bread in answer to george be obliged to own that did not there be necessity said for know have fellowship oh ah yes of course relief of further cause for anxiety in matter forgot that uncle george be always very hard on father much too hard be think be a regard duty to if complain need not oh be be did think that up to remissness in doing duty a father have fallen rather on shoulder than on yours suppose have be mistaken eh at rate if have to complain complaint must be made to not to see have not time to run across world to jerusalem be to do so chance be ten to one must not catch if will ask pritchett too will find that father be not best correspondent in world perhaps have sent back by answer to pritchett half yearly letter have sent nothing by will warrant have not come george own truth did borrow money from when saw if did not showed very low opinion of finance liberality george might have declared without absolute falseness that father have borrowed money of have not patience at present moment to distinguish between must be false what not false in defending father character must not feel that father have behaved very shabbily to that sir lionel conduct must not be defended in detail also felt that uncle be quite unjustifiable in wounding by such attack be not to that mr bertram must have complained of sir lionel remissness in money matter resolved that must not sit by hear father so spoken of therefore utterly disregardful of what might be terribly ill effect of uncle anger thus spoke out in tone not of meekest will neither defend father mr bertram will sit still hear so spoken of how far may have just ground of complaint against know will inquire be father must protect name in presence hoity toity will ask to hear if please sir have received very many good office from for heartily thank be aware that owe to education support up to time debt fear can never pay therefore like other people be inclined to resent by heaven must resent nothing said by to myself will not sit by hear father ill spoken of will not not for money must give leave seems to that what spend of money be added up a debt against father pray imagine boy that be burden to be burden to will endure no longer while at school knew nothing of thing not much while be at college now do know something feel something if please sir will renounce further assistance from beg in return that will say nothing further to a to quarrel there may be between sir lionel quarrel said uncle getting up standing with back to fire have not spirit enough to quarrel with well have said george who be now walking about room from fire in eye certainly appeared that spoke truth in respect know bitterness of spirit against brother continued george feeling must teach not to show before son mr bertram be still standing with hand in pocket leaning against mantel piece with coat tail over arm said nothing further at once continued to fix eye on nephew who be now walking backwards forward from one end of room to other with great vehemence think at last said george that will be better must go back to town good night sir be as said uncle very likely said george ass will kick sometimes bray too said uncle there be certain spirit about made difficult for altogether to get better of other may bray more in hearing will wish good night again held out hand to old man uncle took hold of hand did not go through process of shaking did at once let go again held there for time looking stedfastly into nephew face then dropped have better sit down drink wine said at last have rather return to town said george stoutly have rather stayed here said uncle in tone of voice that for be good humoured come need not be in pet like child stay where be now if like to come again why can stay away a be said in manner of request george did again sit down will be foolish to make fuss about said to what say be true need not come again will not so sat down again sipped wine so saw caroline at jerusalem said old man after pause of about twenty minute yes met with miss baker who told who told why miss baker of course be here for week after return here in house why must be here in house miss baker be usually here three four time year be said george quite startled by information why on earth have miss baker not told of what did think of caroline asked mr bertram think of said george perhaps did not think anything about at if so will be delighted to punish vanity by telling so have thought great deal about at rate talked a though have surprised george great deal almost made forgive uncle inquiry have received oh yes did think of said thought of little at least oh little well mean a much a one doe generally think of people one meet perhaps rather more than of others be very handsome clever what saw of liked be favourite of mine very much so only that be too young have not a yet shilling to depend on might have done for wife for so saying drew candle to took up newspaper be very soon fast asleep george said nothing further night to uncle about caroline sat longing that old man might again broach subject be almost angry with for not having told uncle whole truth then reflected that caroline have not yet acknowledged that felt anything like affection for said to over over again that be sure must not marry without loving for rich uncle in christendom yet be singular coincidence that uncle must have thought of same marriage next morning be again more surprised on coming down to breakfast parlour found uncle there before walking up down room with hand behind back a soon a george have entered uncle stopped walk bade shut door george said perhaps be not very often right either in what do what say last night be right sir yes last night be right whatever may have be father conduct be right to defend bad a have be be wrong to speak of a deserved before will not do so again thank sir said george eye almost full of tear be what suppose people in army call ample apology perhaps however may be made little more ample sir sir said george not quite understanding pray say anything more wo for have got nothing more to say only pritchett want to see be with at three o'clock to day at three o'clock bertram be with pritchett learned from gentleman in most frozen tone of be capable with sundry little good humoured asthmatic chuckle that have be desired to make arrangement for paying to mr george regularly income of two hundred year to be paid in way of annuity till mr bertram death to be represented by adequate sum in fund whenever that much to be lamented event must take place to be sure sir said pritchett two hundred year be nothing for mr george two hundred year be great deal to george that morning have be very much puzzled to think how be to keep going till might be able to open small end of law golden egg chapter xiii littlebath abhor mystery must fain be possible have tale run through from little prologue to customary marriage in last chapter with smoothness incidental to ordinary life have ambition to surprise reader castle with unknown passage be not compatible with homely muse must a lief have to do with giant in book real giant such a goliath a with murdering monk with scowling eye age for such delight be think gone may say historically of mr radcliffe time that there be mysterious sorrow in day be now a much out of date a be giant must wish that serene gratification might flow from page unsullied by single start now be aware that there be that in last chapter appears to offend against spirit of calm recital profess people will begin to think that be to be kept in dark a to who be who that be intended that interest in novel will depend partly on guess must wish to have guessing therefore at once proceed to tell about miss caroline waddington be granddaughter of old mr george bertram be therefore speaking with absolute technical propriety first cousin once removed of lover young mr george bertram degree of relationship happily admits of love matrimony old mr bertram have once twice be alluded to a bachelor most of who be best acquainted with have doubt of being so to reader be permitted great privilege of knowing that be married very early in life doubtless have reason for keeping matter secret at time very early death of wife saved from necessity of much talking about afterwards wife have died in giving birth to daughter child have survived there be then living sister of mr bertram who have be married few year to mr baker infant be received into family of friend miss baker be child miss baker be therefore niece by marriage of mr bertram in family caroline bertram be educated mary baker be brought up together a sister during time mr bertram did duty by daughter a regard money a far a mean then went be known in family to be father elsewhere be not so known baker lived in france fact of having such domestic tie be not suspected among acquaintance in england in course of time daughter married one mr waddington hardly with full consent of baker for mr waddington mean be small not decidedly in opposition to have marriage be opposed by mr bertram of course be asked to assist in supplying money for young couple refused to give offered to mr waddington occupation by income must be earned mr waddington wisely acceded to view have lived must doubtless have lived to become rich man died however within four year of marriage so fell out that wife did not survive above year two of marriage caroline waddington heroine be sole offspring mr waddington commercial enterprise have not caused to live in london though have be required to be there frequently mr bertram have therefore seen more of than of own daughter infant have be born in house of baker there be brought up a orphan of four year old have come under care of mary baker under care remained miss baker be therefore not in truth aunt what be exact relationship leave a calculation to conversant with mystery of genealogy believe that be almost a nearly connected with lover when mr waddington daughter be dead mr bertram felt to be altogether relieved from family tie be not yet old man being then about fifty five be very rich man be of course considered that must provide liberally for grandchild when asked to do so by miss baker have replied that be provided for that have enabled child father to leave behind four thousand pound for girl be provision sufficiently liberal that must not give rise to false hope that must be heiress that if niece mary baker must take charge of must allow income for purpose have done with sufficient liberality be mysterious have now believe be unravelled may go back to story of mr pritchett must perhaps say word have be habituated in sundry money dealing to look on miss baker a patron niece have always called a such indeed connection have be so far back that usually styled miss mary did not know though be very suspicious on matter did quite suspect be truth a to miss waddington be niece to patron niece knew more than excepting of course that be daughter of mr waddington that be mistress in own right of four thousand pound mr pritchett be very anxious about patron wealth here be mr bertram turned seventy year of age mr pritchett be sixty six one knew who be to be heir a far a mr pritchett be aware have heir mr george must naturally be so so thought mr pritchett old man apparent anxiety respecting nephew habit have now given for year of paying cost of nephew education income now allowed led to conclusion then uncle liked so well to lead mr george be so unwilling to be led have waddington lived must have be heir doubtless miss waddington might still be so even miss baker mr bertram in way be certainly very fond of miss baker be thus that mr pritchett speculated from day to day george however be always regarded by a favourite in race now at last may return to story having seen uncle george next business be to see lady love be disposition must not allow to remain quiet while hope be so doubtful heart so racked have be travelling with miss baker ever since living in daily intercourse with caroline be probable enough that might by time have be half tired of love have have such safety valve be now therefore bubbling boiling within heart in manner very subversive of legal accuracy injurious to legal study be absolutely necessary said to that must know on what ground stood absolutely necessary also that must be able to talk to one on subject so wrote to miss baker saying that intended to do pleasure of renewing acquaintance with at littlebath determined to see arthur wilkinson on way be day in wilkinson be taking pupil at oxford day in used to think so much of adela gauntlet meeting of two friend be sufficiently joyous for such love sorrow a oppressed bertram when sitting in chamber of mr neversaye die rarely oppress young man in moment must otherwise be jovial arthur have at time gotten over one misery not yet fallen into have obtained fellowship have hardly expected be commencing life of don with don comfort around well upon word envy arthur do indeed said bertram looking round cousin room at balliol a sat down to pas evening quietly together be what always looked forward to a did also have obtained have forsworn envy can not be very envious said wilkinson laughing a bliss be still within own reach have still room at oriel if choose to go into for bertram have be elected to fellowship at college be easily said somehow must be know why be arthur have panted to have privilege of ordained priest yet be not to be so have looked forward to ordination a highest ambition of man yet will never be ordained why not george be not destiny on subject talk such nonsense well at rate will not be lot mind telling arthur there be one else to whom must own how weak be there have be moment since have be away in have sworn to devote to work so sworn when object around be gifted with solemn tie must have made oath sacred yet well yet a yet everything be in own power arthur be not so be now one of myrmidon of most special of special pleader mr neversaye die have given over to glory of horse hair wig ' must now be gospel be doom to propagate falsehood instead of truth struggle be severe at first there be little revulsion of feeling will do very well after time a easily have doubt a harcourt doe be harcourt who have led to perhaps so partly wrong in have not be harcourt have be talked over have weakly allowed to be talked out of own resolve have not be done by harcourt must tell be for came here then told history of love history to men of twenty four girl of twenty be of such vital importance young man when first love first know that love be frequent in thought of woman have chosen feel to be separated from humanity by amber tinted cloud to be enveloped in mystery of common mortal know nothing shake mane a walk on with rapid step regard almost a god did object to taking order asked wilkinson object be nothing to nothing on earth must not have objected to being shoemaker said that must advise to think of one trade a soon a other can not say that think showed either good feeling good taste said wilkinson stiffly ah dear fellow know there be bad taste in a said must defy to say anything in bad taste arthur doe not matter have told must go to bar a man of honour must keep word to cousin have not much inclination to lecture wilkinson be now clergyman have become so mainly because have failed in obtaining power of following other profession must have gone to bar have be able felt by mean called to rebuke bertram for doing what must fain have done have not accepted say why must be so unwilling that must take order anxiety on behalf tell strong tale in own favour ah say that because understand be able to give advice without giving least shadow of encouragement indeed when did advise have not even told that loved fact be can not bear state longer will know worst at rate wish must see arthur must not wonder must be uneasy so went on with lover customary eloquence till late hour in night wilkinson be patience about one o'clock began to yawn then went to bed early on following morning bertram started for littlebath littlebath world life mostly in lodging miss baker caroline lived there a world mostly doe there be three set of person who resort to littlebath there be heavy fast lighter fast set there be also pious set of two fast set be scandalously fast pace be never very awful of heavy may be said that gentleman generally wear coat padded be frequently seen standing idle about parade terrace that always keep horse trot about road good deal when hound go out lady be addicted to whist false hair pursue pleasure with discreet economy of lighter fast set assembly ball be ruling passion even in there be wild extravagance gentleman of division keep usually two horse on sale of one of mind be much bent drink plentifully of cherry brandy on hunting day a rule often misbehave be very careful not to be caught in marriage talk about woman much a crafty knowing salmon might be presumed to talk about angler lady be given to dancing of course be none of nearly so old a might perhaps be led to imagine greatly eschew card playing nevertheless now again one of may be seen to lapse from sphere fall into below if may justly say that votary of whist be below worshipper of terpsichore of pious set much need not be said a light have never be hid under bushel in spite of hunt club assembly room be predominant power live on fat of land be strong unctuous moral uncharitable people men never cease making money for woman making slipper for clergyman though resident at littlebath be thus separated a rule into three class class always keep accurately to division there will be who own double allegiance one set will tread upon there will be who can hardly be placed in miss baker be among latter number on principle be admirer of great divine on domestic comfort of whose toe so many fair finger have employed nevertheless be not averse to rubber in mildest form caroline did not play whist occasionally gave way to allurement prevalent among younger female world of littlebath miss baker lived in lodging bertram therefore went to hotel have be mistress of largest house in littlebath must hardly have ventured to propose a guest plough however be good inn deposited there hunting season at littlebath have commenced bertram soon found that have so wished must with little trouble have provided with stud in coffee room of hotel have intended to call on miss baker on evening of arrival have not actually told that must do so though walked down to terrace in lived courage failed when got there must not go in may be that evening call be not thing at littlebath said to so walked back to hotel on following day did not go before two o'clock consequence be that poor miss baker niece be kept at home in state of miserable suspense to visit be quite a important a to by one of elder namely be regarded with anxiety quite a nervous when did call be received with hospitality due to old friend why have not come to tea night before tea have be kept for till eleven o'clock why at rate have not come to breakfast have be much nicer in jerusalem miss baker said bertram answered hardly with spirit have marked that have said in far away land have be afraid to disturb so late have be unwilling to intrude so early miss waddington looked up at from collar be working began to ask whether really did like so much of course will dine with said miss baker george said must assured that have not intended to give so much trouble must be same man thought caroline who have snubbed mr m'gabbery have stood by laughing when slipped into water manner of question be then asked answered respecting different journey constantinople be described on one side tyrol on other peril of ride to jaffa discomfort of austrian boat to alexandria manner of lady from india with whom miss baker niece have travelled in passage from egypt to marseille then said something about uncle george not that miss baker so called bertram said that have that miss baker have be staying at hadley yes said when be in town have always money matter to arrange with mr bertram rather to have arranged by mr pritchett usually stay day two at hadley on occasion be there week george must not think that up to period of meeting at jerusalem miss baker have be instructed to be silent about hadley that be now permitted to speak out openly so sat talked for hour caroline have given aunt strict injunction not to go out of room so a to leave together during bertram first visit of course must be palpable that did so for purpose said caroline why not said miss baker innocently never mind aunt pray wish miss baker of course obeyed a always did so george sat there talking about anything nothing rather lack daisically till got up to take leave have not horse here suppose said miss baker why do ask can get one in ten minute doubt because caroline will be so glad to have one to ride with nothing will induce aunt mary to mount steed since day be lifted out of saddle at jaffa said caroline oh that journey mr bertram be stronger woman than ever thought be to have lived through be soon arranged that george must go back to inn hire horse that caroline must then ride together in hour so be cantering up face of ridgebury hill ride produced very little caroline here required attention george did not find practicable to remain close enough to love long enough close to to say what have to say with emphasis felt that subject demanded there be little tender allusion to feat of horsemanship done in syria mention of mount of olive of miss todd picnic pool of siloam might if properly handled have led to much did lead to nothing when george helped miss waddington to dismount at miss baker door that young lady have almost come to conclusion that have thought better of love that must be well that must think better of hers in accordance with professed attempt at plain speaking may be a well explained here that miss baker with view of sounding uncle view wish have observed to that george have appeared to to admire caroline very much have old man remarked a might so probably have done that be two fool must probably become two beggar miss baker must have known that match must be displeasing to have not done so ah said did be singular must have met now miss baker in wisdom have taken a strong hint that match must not be displeasing to miss baker have clearly be on george side from beginning perhaps have shown little opposition caroline ardour might have be heightened a be have professed to doubt have nothing to say against george much might doubtless be said in favour in fact miss waddington must have be glad to know what be intention of mr george bertram senior really wish have stayed away said to aunt a be getting ready for dinner nonsense caroline why must have stayed away why must expect to stay away have stayed away must have be first to grumble be missish dear missish upon word aunt mary be becoming severe what mean be that think care so very much for on whole be not not quite sure whether well wo say anything more only doe seem to that be much more in love with than be bertram came to dinner so also did one of littlebath curate very energetic young man who have not yet achieved above one two pair of worked slipper kettle holder greater thing however be doubt in store for if must remain true to mission aunt mary have intended to ask one caroline have declared that be out of question to expect mr bertram must drink wine by whole evening be dull enough work of disenchantment on caroline part be nearly accomplished bertram few minute before went away a curate be expatiating to miss baker on excellence of rector last sermon found occasion to say one word miss waddington if call to morrow early after breakfast will see miss waddington looked a though there be nothing in proposition to ruffle serenity said that must george word have be tame enough there have be something in fire of eye that at last reminded of jerusalem on next morning punctually at ten knock be heard at door caroline have at first persisted that aunt must not absent even miss baker must not obey such injunction a how do expect that poor young man be to behave have said much care how behaves caroline have replied nevertheless did care be therefore sitting alone when bertram entered room walked up to took hand a did so seemed to be altogether different man from of yesterday there be purpose enough in countenance now purpose apparently have intention of pursuing with energy miss waddington said still holding hand caroline be to apologize for calling so be privilege to be own then still holding hand stood a though expectant of answer must settle affair at once connection through uncle entitles to privilege said caroline smiling using woman wile to get out of difficulty will take privilege from on basis have to ask of must be given on own account on own refused caroline since parted in room in jerusalem have thought seriously of little else than of must not answer then gave answer did not know own heart said must know now absence have taught much must have taught something have taught said with eye fixed on ground that world have one thing desirable for must not take man part unless endeavoured to obtain be here to ask for now what have absence taught oh so many thing can not repeat lesson in one word a do come caroline look at least for sincerity from be too good too gracious to indulge girlish vanity at cost of man suspense missish girlish miss waddington felt that behoved to look to character be word have not usually be applied to indeed mr bertram must think unpardonable to keep in suspense then answer said have by time let go hand be standing at little distance from on hearth rug never have lady be wooed in sterner manner caroline almost felt that liked better for have simpered said little nothing so like ordinary gentleman during ride that present brusqueness be quite relief to still did not answer at once essayed to stick needle into work pricked finger in lieu of come caroline be wrong in supposing now at least must know own feeling will tell again how dearly how truly love answer then in honest plain christian sincerity answer a true woman must answer true man do love for moment there be answer well will not ask again will not torment oh mr bertram what be to say what must have say be so stern with stern well be not stern coming up close to looked into face caroline said will be wife will be motion of lip rather than spoken word nevertheless heard fool that be not to have heard before in beating of heart not to have seen in tear in eye not to have felt in warmth of hand on afternoon miss waddington ride be much more energetic on evening miss baker did not think necessary to catch curate to drink wine with george bertram be made quite at home given to understand that have better leave dining room when lady did so there be much talked over evening next day upshot of be that marriage must take place till next summer that perhaps might be expedient to postpone till summer twelvemonth to george put must have put absolute veto miss baker only shook head smilingly said that thought must be so nothing be to be done before christmas a miss baker be to be at hadley very early in january undertook to inform mr bertram gave strong hope that must be prevailed on to favour marriage can make difference to purpose whether doe said george very independently chapter xiv way mean on following day bertram returned to town now that be successful lover about to take upon at future time responsible duty of married man became very energetic in chamber of mr die must hardly spare day during winter for running down to littlebath whenever did do so took coke upon lyttleton down with did work in vain never have worked in vain facility of acquiring special knowledge sought have ever be one of gift mr die be already beginning to prophesy great thing friend harcourt who occasionally wanted society declared that overdid labour down at littlebath did not quite approve of industry caroline naturally thought that more of lover hour must be devoted to miss baker who looked on mr bertram money a certainly destined for caroline george considered that be wasting time with fusty book have not dared to say much to george on subject have not taken very well little that did say must not tell caroline be mr bertram granddaughter did remind that be mr bertram nephew hinted that though profession might be very eligible for young man of such brilliant prospect must hardly be necessary for absolutely to make slave of to george have answered somewhat curtly that have reason to expect anything further from uncle that a looked forward to maintain wife by successful exertion a barrister be absolutely necessary that must at present work very hard have lost whole year said to miss baker nothing very sharp work can atone for never once saw uncle after first visit to littlebath till next year be far advanced felt desire to see certainly wish to be bearer of tidings a to own engagement miss baker have undertaken to do might do so if so pleased a far a be concerned have idea of asking permission to marry from one why must ask have once said to miss baker will marry just same whether permit whether doe not be grievous to lady at littlebath very little have be said about money between george miss baker up to time nothing have be said between george caroline two lady knew that there must be marriage till there be adequate income income of gentleman when stripped of fellowship must be two hundred pound year that of lady be about same now caroline waddington have intention whatever of marrying on four hundred pound year must be more than three year at very least before profound study must result in golden fee now that matter be so far settled settled a bertram considered did tell harcourt of love harcourt said one day have piece of news perhaps ought to tell be engaged to be married be said harcourt rather too coolly to satisfy friend expectation be not joking who ever accused of joking since took to law mr die did not give credit for joke not even for so bad one a must be will congratulate condole with either perhaps have better wait till see lady when be to be well in coming summer suppose be wish at least wish of course will be law presume then may be justified in surmising that lady have considerable fortune indeed have not something have got about a much perhaps a will have bread to eat occasionally cheese said harcourt who must not understand that rising man must marry early unless in doing so acquired money occasionally cheese repeated bertram be state of thing must not suit book know not exactly said harcourt men have very different idea about woman must do have done be doing with small income wife be in respect like horse if gentleman doe keep horse must be well groomed must not endure woman who be not always got up in satin velvet not satin velvet exactly require curiously mounted saddle for horse think must have much enjoyment with cheap wife like cold mutton candle end very well love feminine economy family washing bill kept at lowest maid of work with allowance in lieu of beer dark morning gown for household work must not if know add fuel to ardour of conjugal affection love woman dearly like to be near then like to be nice when woman be nasty be very nasty bertram said in heart that harcourt be beast animal without soul creature capable of other joy than of material nature kept opinion at present moment to not however that be averse to express openly before friend often gave harcourt to understand that suspected of being deficient in article of soul harcourt must take reproach with perfect good humour remarking perhaps that might probably find possible to get on decently without one be lady name secret asked not to at least believe be generally considered advisable that sort of thing must not be talked about quite openly till consummation of be nigh at hand have wish for mystery in matter name be caroline waddington what daughter of sir augustus nothing to sir augustus have heard must then be one of general family not that only relative that know be miss baker miss baker said harcourt tone of voice be not encouraging yes miss baker said bertram tone of voice be hardly conciliatory oh ah yes exactly think know miss baker must be odd if did for life at littlebath hardly ever come to town when doe stay down at hadley with uncle oh h be horse of colour beg pardon entirely dear fellow why did not tell at first that be match of uncle making uncle making be not match of uncle making well well one that approves hardly gave credit for so much prudence will be a good a having everything settled exactly a must wish be giving great deal too much credit said bertram laughing uncle know nothing about marriage have not slightest idea of consulting must think mean to do so considering everything mean to consult only relative have who can do anything for yes have told over over again that have claim on therefore will make none bertram have said to frequently that cared nothing for man judgment in such matter nevertheless after what have passed did desire that harcourt must see caroline be aware judging rather from harcourt tone than from word that keen sighted friend of have low opinion of miss waddington that thought that be ordinary intriguing girl who have be baiting hook for husband after manner scandal state to be so common among littlebathians bertram longed therefore to surprise eye astound intellect with view of charm near knowledge of attribute nothing must be said of beauty blaze of must fall upon altogether unprepared george be right in feeling in respect harcourt have formed very false idea of miss waddington have led to imagine that be second rate unattractive in first place have own idea about littlebath conceived that be not place in highest beauty of england must be looked for in next place knew george bertram regarded a man peculiarly liable to such danger a must come down with to littlebath when will give day harcourt demurred a did not wish to be called on imperiously to praise woman of whom knew must disapprove endeavoured to excuse from journey bertram persisted at last be settled that must go down did not happen till towards end of winter miss baker have a promised seen mr bertram in meantime answer returned from hadley oracle have like most oracle answer be neither favourable unfavourable mr bertram have expressed no great anger at tale of love be told have expressed gratification well have said be odd that must have come together very odd be clever young man dare say may do well miss baker have then ventured in very modest way to ask opinion a to sufficiency of young people income must judge of have said rather sharply suppose have idea of marrying a yet mean to wait till begin profession to miss baker have made answer nothing further have be said at meeting early in march miss baker have again seen great man have then ventured to explain to that george be working very hard ah have word for suppose said uncle if so believe will get on at such work a quicker without wife than will with one at interview miss baker did ask plainly a have be agreed beforehand between niece that must do whether must on marriage make increase to granddaughter fortune have liberal ladylike provision said will not have enough to live on said miss baker will have third more mary than have when married aunt yet saved money on income remember how have be brought up sir if will be fine lady gentleman must take penalty of being so fine lady gentleman can not marry at moment notice a do ploughboy milkmaid if can not live on limited income must wait did however on occasion go so far a to say that if must wait for twelvemonth that if be then living must add two thousand pound to caroline fortune a to george have done a much a intended to do certainly for present george like own way said old man a far a be concerned will have will be well for to make own career in world will be happier so than in spending money on occasion miss baker be permitted to tell caroline circumstance of parentage grandparentage same story might now be told to george be to be cautioned that relative displeasure must be incurred by useless repetition of mary said let mislead let marry with idea by so doing will inherit between money wish to understand that view be altogether different miss baker when returned to littlebath must not think that have be successful in mission caroline immediately declared that idea of marriage for year even for next must now be altogether out of question be very much startled at hearing that mr bertram be mother father did not pretend to suddenly intense affection for if be so said coldly if george be only near connection if doe not disapprove of marriage ought to give income on can live be astonishing how different be view of grandfather grandchild on such matter unfortunately there be unanimity of opinion on matter between lover between aunt george be of opinion that must marry immediately on present income trust to providence exertion for future increase for one year must have income of fellowship in two year half must be called in meantime must make something by magazine if caroline be not afraid be not caroline be very much afraid have by mean formed part of project of life to live in london a married woman on four hundred pound year knew said to miss baker effect must have on husband affection seemed indeed to share of harcourt opinion on subject to have dislike to feminine economy at least to use of under surveillance of man eye a far a must see marriage must be postponed indefinitely at rate till after george must have be called to bar miss baker voice be for middle course suggested that must wait for mr bertram two thousand pound then marry must then have income increased to extent must also show deference to old man view must undoubtedly so miss baker thought have ultimate result of most beneficial nature after a remarked more than once to niece who else be there young people be quite a obstinate a old man george must make concession to uncle be ready to marry on love small income expected caroline to show equal warmth caroline must by mean alter view risk misery of ill provided nursery have be one great resolve of life that must not be poor man wife be ready to wait said if must trust wait surely george might do so man with world around encountered misery risk in waiting fell to girl lot dispute incidental to different opinion did not ever take place between george caroline from feeling of chivalry abstained from discussing money matter with from feeling of prudence be equally silent with poor miss baker be medium for george of course must press with lover ardour for early day caroline must of course say that immediate marriage be found impracticable then must refer other to miss baker thing went on in way till middle of may sometimes george be almost angry wrote letter be somewhat savage sometimes caroline must be haughty then too must write letter must tell mind in good plain set term be not near enough sufficiently often with other to quarrel so matter went on till may then on one fine may day harcourt george together took place in train for littlebath wonder what will think of said george of course will tell truth oh of course said harcourt with mind duly made up to praise have pluck to find fault with said george must be afraid not to call handsome even if thought a ugly a hecate exactly said harcourt therefore little experimentary trip be never of use chapter xv mr harcourt

in seeing that sherry bottle be duly decantered standard of value did not at rise in estimation candle end cold mutton must doubtless be forte economical washing bill strong point so be thinking much distressed in mind for to do justice be a anxious on behalf of bertram a be in nature to be anxious for one when juno entered room did not swim in fly in glide in walked in a woman must walk if

of cause a be love be doing exactly that wished to do be vindicating choice to man whose judgment on matter be most vitally essential to when lady left dining room bertram harcourt heartily wished that miss baker have not be so scrupulously hospitable hardly knew what to do with mr meek mr meek remarked that miss baker be very nice person miss waddington be charming person miss penelope gauntlet be very nice person indeed that miss adela be very sweet person then seemed that conversation be at end eh what none especially be to say middle temple such have be harcourt reply to mr meek

talked over on occasion bertram failed altogether in moving even though at one moment aunt mary have almost yielded to caroline remained steady a rock none of eloquence be very eloquent on occasion changed at became soft in tone affectionate almost caressing in manner nothing must induce to go from point bertram got on very high horse spoke of engagement a being thus practically broken off did not become angry declare that took at word with low voice said that be aware that determination gave option in matter must certainly be justified in so resolving nay might do so without slightest stain upon faith must not violate truth by saying that decision must give pleasure that must must here for first time became rather agitated before must finish george be at foot swearing that must not must not live without that knew that must not must not do so so little conference ended george have certainly gained nothing caroline have gained that have made known resolution have nevertheless not

intimate lady at littlebath have many trouble during trouble famous young barrister be very civil to in latter of two year be now gone circumstance have brought up to london for couple of month in spring then saw much of mr harcourt nothing of george bertram though george be still affianced husband of miss waddington chapter ii retrospective first year george bertram have returned to town sunday after conference in miss baker little room not in very best of mood have talked glibly enough on way back because have be necessary for to hide chagrin have done so in cynical tone have given harcourt to understand that something be wrong for ten day after there have be no intercourse between littlebath then have written letter to caroline full of argument full also of tenderness in essayed to move from high resolve have certainly written strongly if not well be working said nearly a hard a man must work in order to insure success for nothing be aware idea that be already justified in looking on a wife must have induced to labour so strictly for be grateful to have given great necessary incitement therefore thanked god that have on shoulder burden a well a in heart blessing of such engagement strain must be too great for if burden be to remain present to daily while blessing be to be postponed for so long time have already felt spirit numbed energy weakened seemed to in daily work that great hope have be robbed from dream told that be to be happy waking moment brought back to disappointment knew that must not endure that must not remain there at post diligent a fain must be if reward be to be postponed for so long a being under holy engagement to wrote perhaps almost too solemnly have given up sort of life to natural disposition might have led suppose say with regret rejoice to have done so rejoice to be so doing be for do must not look to for reward granting that there may be risk will not share supposing that there may be suffering will not endure if man with best effort may protect woman from suffering will protect so have written have ended by imploring to let be married that autumn by return of post got three line from calling dearest dearest george requesting that must allow week to answer letter at length must not be answered without deep thought gratified much wrote note to begging on account to hurry that must wait for reply with utmost patience again imploring to be merciful be however apparent in tone of note apparent at least to caroline that judged eloquence of letter to be unanswerable that be already counting on surrender lessened effect of on caroline heart for when first received have have strong effect on first morning when read in bedroom before went down to breakfast certainly have strong effect on made up mind that must say nothing about to aunt at rate on day aunt must have advised to yield at once must have preferred counsellor of sterner sort so put letter in pocket went down tranquilly to breakfast after breakfast wrote note have mentioned day thought about to herself next day on evening of second day have brought to give in then came george note fancied tone of triumph hardened heart once more on evening of day be firm to principle have acted hitherto must continue to act according to course have laid down for herself on fourth day be sitting in drawing room alone for aunt have gone out of littlebath for day when adela gauntlet came to call on adela knew must counsel to yield therefore must certainly not have gone to adela for advice be sad at heart sitting there with letter among thread needle before gradually found impossible not to talk of to talk of at last to hand over to be read there must be doubt at a to nature of adela advice caroline have have conception of impetuosity of matured conviction on subject of impassioned eloquence with advice must be given have be far from thinking that adela have such power of passion well said a adela slowly folded sheet put back into envelope well what answer will make to can doubt caroline said adela miss gauntlet eye shone a caroline have never before seen shine indeed do doubt doubt very much not that ought to doubt what knew to be wise week ago know also to be wise now one be so weak be so hard to refuse whom love hard indeed said adela to thinking woman must have stone instead of heart who must refuse request a from man to whom have confessed love because love man must wish to make beggar of be too much afraid of what call beggary said adela beggary caroline with four hundred pound year have right to accept man if intended to decline to live with on income a that must make request must come from a demand demand time for demand have not yet come have come if be true to word must have thought of doubt did think of before accepted have right now to make wretched therefore will not make poor poor poor how fearfully afraid be of poverty be there nothing worse than poverty what call poverty poverty can not have gown starched above once week caroline stared at adela went on broken heart be not half so bad a daily tear disappointed hope dry dull dead listless despondency without one drop of water to refresh be a nothing to well grounded apprehension a to one larder never marry till be sure will be full let heart be ever so empty adela for others there may be excuse continued thinking then a always of scene at west putford defending to herself whom to herself so often accused for there can be none if drive from now whatever evil may befall will lie like weight of lead upon heart if refuse now be not man to take quietly wait can live without yes be pride to say so believe must live without think too well of to believe that must live happily without will be happy without will be proud stony hearted wretched stony hearted at least in appearance not fortunate enough to become so in reality why adela one must think that be victim of passion nipped in bud by cruel prudence so be a said rose from seat a though intended standing there before companion to go on with impassioned warning effect be too much for falling down on knee with face buried in hand rested on sofa gave way to sob tear caroline be of course much shocked did what must to relieve adela merely begged that might be left to herself one minute one minute said plaintively in voice so different from that have used just now one minute will be well again have be very foolish never say anything about never never not to one promise promise caroline dear caroline do promise one know one must know caroline did promise with natural curiosity wanted to know whole story adela however must tell nothing must say no more about in agony of strong feeling have once pointed to a beacon even must not endure to do again must say nothing further about in more plaintive softer tone did not cease to implore friend not to throw away from rich heart be still within grasp scene such a must not have effect on caroline did not ultimately have adela have wished be miss waddington doctrine that must not under circumstance of life permit to be carried away by passion why then must allow adela passion to convince be fact of adela own case knew nothing might be that have be cruelly treated friend lover even might have be in fault must surely be extreme of folly for caroline waddington to allow to be actuated by example of one who have not even shown her of what that example consisted upshot of be that at end of week wrote to george declaring grieved a be to grieve felt obliged to adhere to former resolution also wrote strongly perhaps with more force of logic than lover have done trust time will come said when will acknowledge have be right of be quite sure that be now to yield to time must come very quickly when must acknowledge to have be wrong that must then think to have be wrong must kill be not know fitted either by disposition education to be poor man wife say with pride though if choose to take for pride can not help be fitted to be husband of poor wife love enthusiasm now make look on want a slight evil have ever tried want since left school have not have everything that money must buy have ever be called on to deny reasonable wish never believe have what right have then to suppose that can do for other have never yet done for talk of misery of waiting be not because have a yet known misery have not men to wait who look for success in life to work wait bide time present work be know too hard in do have too much enthusiasm kill by work for sake if may still plead own sake do so say have given up sort of life to disposition must have led believe disposition to be bad must be grieved to think that debar from pleasure be not bad because be engaged to there be that in eagerness of bertram protestation on point must not be flattering to girl caroline when thought of did not wish to be so flattered required le passion in lover more judgment wanted to be more awake to fact that true meaning of engagement be that two must join together in world battle in order that together might fight battle more successfully than of must do apart write with great grief continued a know that what write will grieve write under conviction be doing duty by be ready however to acknowledge delay may not be in consonance with intention when proposed to that of have deceived other wilfully be quite sure may be that have misunderstood other if so dear george let be a though have never be say on own behalf if so wish be ready to hold a yours to wait ready have said be cold word may supply other that heart wish if waiting be contrary to wish be what be not willing to endure then consider matter a altogether in own hand certainly have right to bind to will all ask in such case be that decision will not be delayed such be miss waddington letter portion of at least for not above half have be given here effect upon bertram have not be exhilarating in heart called cold heartless at first resolved to take at word break off from must willingly have done so a far a be concerned must not bring to do on own part must not endure to part with though must willingly have punished by telling that have forfeited claim to a be did nothing for three week neither answered letter went near gave token that be thinking about then came note from miss baker asking to come to littlebath be good humoured playful almost witty too much so for miss baker unassisted epistle craft at once saw that caroline have dictated heart at rate be light answered by one equally good humoured playful perhaps more witty addressed of course to miss baker in excused at present in consequence of multiplicity of town engagement be june must not get away without making guilty of manner of perjury in august must certainly take littlebath on way to scotland have intended that light word must be dagger in caroline bosom there be not pin prick in whole of sullen grief on part must have hurt must have hurt have taken at word annulled engagement for have begun to find that loved more than have thought possible have talked in prudence written in prudence of giving up when time came in might expect letter from saying that so must be heart did tremble at postman knock did feel that have something to fear joyous clever laughing answer to aunt be that must wish though loved must wait though loved did not wish to be sad when be away from have reason measure in love be love a began to find almost to own astonishment george have alluded not untruly to own engagement on day after received caroline letter shut up coke upon lyttleton for term shook dust off foot on threshold of mr die chamber why must work why sit there filling brain with cobweb pouring over old fusty rule couched in obscure language useful only for assisting mankind to cheat other have have object be gone have wished to prove to one heart to one soul young a be poor a be need not fear to trust to guardianship despite musty toil did fear therefore must have more of more of at rate then while sun be shining so brightly so went down to richmond with twisleton madden hopgood fortescue heaven know what did when got back to town night rather perhaps heaven enemy why not caroline did not care whether amused a other men do for sake have kept from thing a be indifferent why need care cared no longer there be more law term more eulogy from gratified mr die of jovial day at richmond elsewhere there be plenty plenty also of jovial bacchanalian night in london miss waddington have be very prudent there might perhaps have be prudence yet more desirable did go down to littlebath on way to scotland remained there three day made up mind a journeyed down to say nothing about late correspondence to caroline till must first speak of a have come to exactly similar resolution on part a adhered to intention so fell out that nothing in matter be said by of caroline be quite satisfied not so bertram again said to that be cold passionless a cold a be beautiful declared a walked home to plough how very many young gentleman have made same soliloquy when mistress have not be so liberal a must have have lover passed three day together at littlebath with apparent satisfaction rode together walked together on one evening danced together nay talked together miss baker thought that everything be smooth bertram a went off to scotland said to that be very very cold began to question with whether did really love do write to tell what sport have caroline have said when went away what subject for woman to choose for lover letter never said write write often always when write swear that love oh yes will write said bertram laughing will give succinct account of brace send of too said miss baker certainly said george so did be joined with harcourt one two others in trip to scotland be then that told friend how much be disturbed by miss waddington obstinacy how doubted not a to heart being a to having heart to belong to one in answer to harcourt gave pretty nearly same counsel a have done wait dear fellow with little patience will have lot of time before for married trouble what be use of man having score of child round just when be beginning to enjoy life be that miss waddington think about though of course ca tell so then also be to say on occasion little subsequent to conversation above alluded to bertram also told friend what knew of miss waddington birth whew w w whistled harcourt be that case well now be surprised be indeed have agreed to marriage know of have not disagreed indeed made peddling little offer about money what have said to about nothing not word have only seen once since christmas then did not speak of did harcourt asked fifty other question on matter eagerly a though considered newly learned fact to be of greatest importance of bertram answered till at last be tired of talking of uncle can not see that make difference said whose granddaughter be doe make greatest difference own be surprised now that miss waddington must wish to delay marriage thought understood feeling conduct on matter must say that regarded a admirable can not quite understand now certainly seems to that with guarantee a need be afraid of nothing whichever of selected must come to same thing harcourt if must marry to morrow because by doing so must make sure of uncle money by heaven must not take if will not take for what can do for may let alone thus majestically spoke bertram sitting with friend on side of scottish mountain with flask of brandy case of sandwich between then said harcourt be as a spoke finished flask bertram kept word told lady love particular a to game killed particular also gave a to scenery a to friend a to scotch people wrote nice chatty amusing letter such a most people love to get from friend said little nothing about love once twice ventured to tell of pretty girl that met of adventure with laird daughter nay insinuated laughingly that have not escaped from quite heart whole caroline answered letter in same tone told with excellent comedy of leading fact of life in littlebath recommended by mean to go back after laird daughter described joy of heart at unexpectedly meeting mr m'gabbery in pump room subsequent disappointment at hearing that there be now mr m'gabbery have married that miss jones of whom parental potts have so strongly disapproved be very nice very amusing very friendly bertram a lover knew that be not satisfied when have done with grouse laird daughter went to oxford did not then go again to littlebath went to oxford from thence to arthur wilkinson parsonage here saw much of adela consoled by talking with about caroline to did not conceal great anger while be still writing good humoured witty letter to betrothed be saying of to adela gauntlet thing harsh perhaps in be true have devoted to said be working for a galley slave work be contented to do must have borne anything risked anything endured anything if must have borne with have must have gone to shield from discomfort love still miss gauntlet be perhaps misery that love can never love now a must have done have come to then how can work now said again will be called to bar of course there be difficulty in may perhaps earn what will make decently respectable spirit high spirit be gone be better pleased that must be so be intolerant of enthusiasm be not pity miss gauntlet that must be so different what must adela say to word that uttered be to truth weary melancholy truth repetition of truth be devouring own heart sympathized with fully cordially ardently said word absolutely in dispraise of caroline admitted at last admitted so often that according to thinking caroline be wrong wrong bertram must shout can there be doubt can one with heart doubt adela said one with heart must doubt have heart said bertram be lovely clever fascinating elegant have everything woman must have except heart except heart then a turned away face adela must see that brushed hand across eye what must do weep too be not known to men certainly be to woman how dangerous be such tear thus during stay at hurst staple bertram be frequently at west putford observed that adela be not often at cousin vicarage that arthur be very seldom at west putford family be clear be on a good term a ever adela mary sophia must be together old mr gauntlet must dine at hurst staple arthur must talk about old rector freely enough bertram rarely saw adela unless went to rectory though dined there with wilkinson girl three four time arthur only dined there once have arthur quarrelled said to adela one day laughing a spoke oh said must not keep down rebellious colour a answered bertram at once took hint to said nothing further on matter why marry arthur asked next morning arthur also blushed not thinking then of adela gauntlet of pledge have given to lord stapledean pledge of have repented day since have given here may be explained that a arthur wilkinson have repented of pledge have felt more strongly from day to day that have put in false unworthy position so did mother from day to day feel with le force compunction have at first expressed a to receiving son income have become le le now perhaps must no longer boast of existence arrangement seemed to to be so essentially good one child be provided for in convenient so comfortable manner be so natural that must regard a mistress of house that perhaps blame be due to in compunction ceased blame be now heaped upon fact be merely stated have already learned to regard a legal owner of ecclesiastical income seeing that son deducted stipend of one hundred fifty pound for merely doing duty curate must have only have half of sum a sometimes said to herself seeing also that have fellowship have scruple in making pay fairly for extra accommodation received at home exactly a must have done have poor dear old mr wilkinson not be out of way considering comfortable circumstance poor dear old mr wilkinson be perhaps not regretted quite so much a might otherwise have be case mr wilkinson be in habit of saying many thing from day to day in praise of good lord stapledean who have so generously thought of widowhood when did so arthur must look grim say nothing mother must know that be displeased surely can not begrudge income have once said to eldest daughter oh be sure doe not said mary somehow be not so happy about thing a used to be then must be very ungrateful boy said mother indeed what more must young full fledged vicar want than to have comfortable house under mother apron string why marry bertram have asked cousin be odd that arthur must not marry seeing that adela gauntlet lived so near that adela be so very very beautiful up to day bertram have heard nothing of circumstance under living have be given then did wilkinson tell story ended by saying now see that marriage be quite out of question then bertram began to think that understood why adela also remained unmarried began to ask whether world be a cold hearted a caroline must be that adela also have refused to venture till future husband must have good comfortable disposable income of own if so must not have sympathized so warmly with if so what reason must there be why arthur must not meet other must then be that arthur wilkinson be such coward said nothing on matter to of for of have confided to sorrow if have sorrow have wish to penetrate secret what have said what have have said learnt by accident have not gift of reticence so talked of love occasionally to arthur talked of very often to adela upshot of talking to adela be always why oh why be not caroline more like to caroline be doubtless more beautiful doubtless more clever doubtless more fascinating what be beauty talent fascination without heart be quite sure that adela heart be warm went to littlebath more that year be well perhaps that did not well ill a case may be have done so must in then state of mind most assuredly have broken with miss waddington in lieu however of accepting miss baker invitation for christmas went to hadley spent two three day there

chamber when day came round in october made annual payment to mr die on occasion mr die have spoken rather seriously to up to time period of idleness have mainly be period of long vacation mr die be willing to suppose that continued payment be sign that intended to settle again to work will be impertinent to ask uncle at hadley have said to will be impertinent to ask what caroline intend to do at time mr bertram be aware that nephew knew in what relationship stood to other impertinence at sir unfortunately have intention in common be engaged to be married want to keep engagement want to break hers well can not say that be wiser of two know that wisdom go quite so far a be content to abide evil day only must postpone be to say have prudence be aware have proposed to make considerable addition to fortune to hers mind on condition that must postpone marriage till next summer did hear something about sum of money that have spoken to miss baker about believe quite forget particular be very indifferent a to money matter mr barrister be indifferent a to money matter of other people sir have intention of marrying miss waddington for money before knew that be granddaughter have now that do know for money if marry for more money than own fortune perhaps couple of thousand added to be likely to be mistaken will never make mistake of kind a far a be concerned be quite welcome for to keep two thousand pound be kind of must marry to morrow without be not at sure will marry next year with if exercise authority over a grandfather wish must tell so a coming from upon word carry high a lover not too high hope a man well george remember once for now old man spoke in much more serious voice will not interfere at a grandfather will have known that be such do understand understand sir that be not wish that must be generally talked of trust wish have be will be complied with by last speech be not put in form of question george understood that be intended to elicit from promise for future assurance a to past have mentioned circumstance to one intimate friend with whom be obliged to discus matter obliged to discus private concern sir with one friend sir with two

mentioned matter to one have be afterwards discovered that such denial be false mr bertram must not have be by much so angry offence lie together joined with fear deference to lie must have testified must be nothing so black a offence without lie without fear without deference uncle be very angry on day said nothing further on matter on next day did on third day just a george be about to leave hadley said in usual bantering tone have more intimate friend george a far a private matter be concerned sir will not said george be in consequence of what mr bertram have then learnt that became acquainted with mr harcourt a mr harcourt have heard about grandchild thought better to see learned gentleman did see a have be before stated became intimate with other so ended first of two year chapter iii retrospective second year next year passed almost more uncomfortably for george bertram for lady at littlebath than have latter month of last year occurrence can hope be stated le in detail so that may get on without too great delay to incident of period be to be awhile for present existing time year be harcourt great year in january february march did great thing in chancery in april came into parliament in may june july sat on committee in august stuck to work till london be no longer endurable in latter part of autumn there be extraordinary session during worked like horse studied corn law question a well a sundry legal reform christmas week in following spring came out with great speech on behalf of sir robert peel nevertheless found time to devote to care trouble of miss baker miss waddington in spring bertram paid one two visit to littlebath may be doubted whether made altogether agreeable there stated broadly that be doing little nothing at profession be said engaged on other matter great excitement to work under have commenced have be withdrawn from under circumstance be not inclined to devote exclusively to study certainly be not to taste did not condescend again to ask caroline to revoke sentence pressed now for marriage made quite apparent that change in for worse there have be change for worse be owing to obstinacy be now living life of dissipation intend that must be understood that utterly gave up to pleasure disgraceful in that altogether abandoned rein allowed to live life a be passed by young men in london taste appetite be too high for did not sink into slough of despond did not become filthy vicious callous bestial departed very widely astray from rule governed during first six month in london be well known at littlebath did bertram at endeavour to conceal truth indeed may be said of that never concealed anything in especial case took pride in letting caroline know full extent of evil have done be question with whether have not now given up bar a profession altogether did not say that have done so be certainly intention to keep term to be called have now no longer legal gamaliel time in april of year mr die have written to very kind little note begging to call one special morning at chamber in stone building if not very inconvenient to bertram did call mr die with many profession of regard regret honestly returned to money paid for year tutelage have be said pleasure pride to to have mr bertram in chamber must still be so to have there again must not take gentleman money under false pretence a seemed to be no longer mr bertram intention to attend there must beg to refund did refund accordingly also be made known to lady at littlebath be engaged have said on other matter also be true during first six month of anger have be content to be idle idleness did not suit so sat down wrote book published book without name told at littlebath of authorship one also told of at oxford book bookling for consisted of one small demy octavo volume be not such a delighted friend at littlebath at oxford even at two hampshire parsonage at littlebath made miss baker hair stand on end at oxford gave rise to suggestion in orthodox quarter mr bertram must be requested to resign fellowship have be told how sitting on mount of olive have be ready to devote to service of church to belonged must mind have be known at time how proud might one have be of mind be not then known now after lapse of two year made a be public oriel be by mean proud of name of little book be very awful name be called romance of scripture began in first chapter with earnest remonstrance against condemnation knew injustice of world must pronounce against there be nothing in book said to warrant man in accusing of unbelief let who be so inclined to accuse read judge have called thing by true name that doubtless by must be imputed to a sin must be found that have gone no further in impugning truth of scripture than many other writer before of whom have since be rewarded for writing by high promotion in church bishop bench be reward for orthodoxy there have be taste for liberal dean have gone no further said than many dean be acknowledged went on to say that scripture statement must not now be taken a true to letter particularly not a true to letter a now adopted by englishman seemed to that generality of countryman be of opinion that inspired writer have written in english be forgotten that be oriental who wrote in language natural to with customary grandiloquence of orientalism with poetic exaggeration in east be breath of life be forgotten also that wrote in ignorance of natural truth men have now acquired by experience induction not by revelation truth be truth of heaven not truth of earth man thought that sun in day did rise set moving round earth because prolongation of day have be described by sun standing still upon gibeon then took book of job measured that by light of own candle so on book be undoubtedly clever men read woman also read began to talk of at least of blindness of mother who have not have wit to see that old chronicle be very much a other old chronicle romance of scripture be to be seen frequently in bookseller advertisement mr mudie told how always have two thousand copy of on shelf so friend did something in world what did do be unfortunately not applauded by friend harcourt very plainly told that man who scribbled never did good at bar two trade said be not compatible said george believe not author must be nothing if love truth barrister must be nothing if do harcourt be whit annoyed by repartee having given warning went way to work be very well known that romance of scripture be bertram work there be comfortable row about at oxford row be private of course a be necessary book having be published without author name much be said many letter be written bertram in writing to friend at oriel who took up cudgel in defence made three statement first that one at oxford have right to suppose that be author second that be author that one at oxford have right to find fault with what have written thirdly that be quite matter of indifference to who did find fault to however added that be ready to resign fellowship to morrow if common room at oriel wished to get rid of so matter rested for awhile who at time knew bertram best be confident enough that belief be shaken in spite of remonstrance so loudly put forth in first page have intended to be honest in remonstrance be not man who exactly know what doe believe man be there one may almost ask man who have such knowledge believe in resurrection of body say so at least what do believe by men may be firm believer yet doubt bible statement doubt letter of such statement men who be firm believer will not be to put forth doubt with eloquence such men if devote time to scripture history will not be arrested by sun standing on gibeon if speak out at will speak out rather a to do believe than a to little that doubt be soon known to bertram world that who regarded a freethinker did great injustice other thing made very unhappy at littlebath very fact of george having written book nearly scared miss baker out of wit according to own light must have placed freethinker in same category with murderer regicide horrid mysterious sinner who commit crime too dreadful for woman to think of must not believe that bertram be one of be fearful to think that one must so call caroline perhaps must not so much have minded flaw in future husband faith if have not be proof of unsteadiness of unfitness for world battle remembered what have said to two year since on mount of olive then thought of what be saying now everything with be impulse enthusiasm judgment be wanting how must such a get on in world have indissolubly linked lot to of one who be so incapable of success indissolubly have not so linked not a yet one night opened mind to aunt spoke very seriously of position hardly know what ought to do said know how much owe know how much have right to expect from must pay owe must do duty by even at sacrifice of if must plainly see what duty be caroline do wish to give up not if must keep keep a be high hope be done with ambition be over longer look for much must fain know that still love before marry must wish to be sure that mean to live with in present mood how can know aught of how be sure of anything aunt after remaining for half hour in consideration at last with reluctance gave advice break heart to say so caroline think must abandon think must ask to release from promise may well be imagined that miss waddington be not when declared that high hope be done with ambition be over be not anxiety sorrow doubt doubt a to man whom have pledged to love whom did love have made ill be not have become thin pale be looking old wan sat silent for awhile leaning with head on hand made answer to aunt suggestion really must caroline indeed must know be not happy a be happy be looking wretchedly ill too know be wearing take advice caroline write to there be two reason against aunt two strong reason what reason love in first place love aunt mary sighed have other answer sigh to give to in next place have right to ask anything of why not caroline made request to refused have consented to marry last year must have be different intended to do right even now think be wrong can not impute fault to doe in order may impute that then may have revenge nothing more be said on matter at time thing went on for awhile again in same unsatisfactory state early in summer miss waddington aunt went up for few week to london have be miss baker habit to spend day at hadley about time of year suggested to caroline instead of doing so must go for week so to london thought that change must be good for niece thought also though of said nothing that caroline must see something of lover if be not to be given up must be well so miss baker thought that marriage must be delayed longer bertram be determined to prove marriage be necessary to tame have proved at rate to miss baker satisfaction there must now be money enough to live on a uncle bertram two thousand pound have be promised for summer on little scheme miss baker went to work caroline made opposition to london plan said nothing about george in connection with heart be somewhat softened wished to see miss baker therefore wrote up for room must naturally one must say have written to george there be now little jealousy commencement of hot blood even between george though still caroline engaged lover be known to have bitter feeling be believed perhaps by miss baker to be more bitter than really be so lodging be taken without reference to when reached town found that be abroad then miss waddington be really angry have right be true to be annoyed in be not there to meet have not given opportunity did appear to that circumstanced a be considering acknowledged engagement between be wrong to leave country without letting have word to say whither be going for how long be nearly fortnight since have written to caroline for anything knew might be month before again heard from be then that sent for harcourt at period that became so intimate with bertram have told of foreign trip only day two before have taken departure be just at time that there have be noise about romance of scripture bertram have defended in one two newspaper have written defiant letter to friend at oxford then started to meet father at paris be going further might be back in week however must be uncertain a return must depend on of sir lionel sir lionel intended to come to london with mr harcourt be very attentive to in spite of being at time so useful public man be very attentive to being almost a civil to elder lady a be to younger for englishman showed very good breeding by degree began to regard with confidence with sufficient confidence to talk to of bertram with sufficient confidence even to tell of fear by degree caroline must talk to alone when once permitted to do so concealed nothing harcourt said not word against friend that friend might perhaps have thought that friend speaking of behind back might have spoken more warmly in praise be hard at present to say much must be true in bertram praise be not living in wise prudent manner not preparing in way to live a man must live by sweat of brow harcourt must not say much in favour that bertram be clever honest true high spirited that miss waddington knew that miss baker knew what wanted to learn be that be making prudent use of high quality harcourt must not say that be doing so that will fall on leg at last said harcourt once when be alone with caroline doubt with talent high honest love of virtue be impossible that must throw away present moment be of such vital importance be so hard to make up for loss even of twelve month be sure be said caroline must not care for so much if thought thought what miss waddington that disposition be not altered be so frank so candid so so so affectionate be manner of men to change in respect become perhaps not le affectionate le demonstrative to miss waddington answered nothing might probably be so be singular enough that with idea must be complaining to perfect stranger of uncaressing unloving manner in lover who have professed to herself that lived so little for love have george be even kneeling at knee heart must have be stern enough be only by feeling woman wrong that found endowed with woman privilege think that bertram heart be changed continued harcourt be doubtless very angry that request to last summer be not complied with how must have married then mr harcourt think what income must have be a yet without profession be not blaming be not taking part against only say that be very angry doe bear malice mr harcourt no doe not bear malice men may be angry without bearing malice think that have shown want of confidence in be still showing have not justified that want of confidence to harcourt answered nothing smiled slightly well have not what must have done ought to have done tell mr harcourt distress beyond measure that must think have be to blame think so far from miss waddington bertram be dear friend know fine quality can not own that justified in temporary want of confidence

seemly if feminine be at rate not ladylike be driven to defend what be of complain have right to complain became engaged more than twelve month since certainly with understanding that matter be to stand over for three year understanding be that be to be married a soon a might reasonably be arranged then took on to order delay kindly offered to give up a alternative must not force to marry loved too well trusted too much in love to be able to think that giving up be necessary perhaps be wrong period of wretched interval be at own disposal have married time must have be yours must have be just that must know how be spent must then have known so much of other have chosen that must not be therefore deny right now to make inquiry if have departed from hope have formed have one to blame have said that neglect be ready to marry to morrow have be ready to do so day since engagement know how much more than ready have be profess to be very painstaking lover nay if will life must bore even if in case mawkishness of delay did not do more than bore at rate will not go through loved do love truly told of truly when first knew urged suit till have definite answer accepted now there need be nothing further till be married insist on will not have affair discussed by with person to whom be stranger will see letter to aunt have told will visit at littlebath a soon a have returned to england yours ever affectionately g b letter be terrible blow to caroline seemed to to be almost incredible that caroline waddington must be forced to receive letter a under circumstance from gentleman unseemly unfeminine unladylike be epithet lover used in addressing be told that bored to play lover that misconduct be fault then be accused of mawkishness be imperative too in laying order to insist on be incumbent on to comply with insisting of course showed letter to aunt whose advice resulted in that must be better that must pocket affront silently if be not prepared to give up engagement altogether if be so prepared letter doubtless must give opportunity then mr harcourt came to while anger be yet at hottest manner be so kind temper so sweet attention so obliging that must not be glad to see if george loved if wished to guide wished to persuade why be not at right hand mr harcourt be there instead did not bore multifold a duty be to be near then committed first great fault of in history will be shown a being guilty showed lover letter to mr harcourt of course be not done without previous converse till have found out that be wretched inquired a to wretchedness till have owned that be ill with sorrow beside perplexed in extreme then at last saying to herself that cared not now to obey mr bertram showed letter to mr harcourt be ungenerous said harcourt be ungentlemanlike said caroline be written in passion will not notice so miss baker went back again to littlebath be september before bertram returned then sir lionel came with have not space to tell much of what have passed between father son reached apparently on good term with other sir lionel settled in bedroom near to son chamber near also to own club there be however great ground of disagreement between sir lionel be very anxious that son must borrow money from mr bertram george very resolutely declined to do so be now clear enough to sir lionel that son must not show filial disposition by advancing on own behalf much money to father a be by mean in affluent circumstance went down to littlebath took father with meeting between lover be again unloverlike nothing must be more affectionate than sir lionel took caroline in arm kissed called dear daughter praised beauty believe kissed miss baker indeed know that made attempt to do so think not at improbable that in overflowing of affectionate heart made overture of same kind to exceedingly pretty parlour maid who waited upon might be thought of george sir lionel soon became popular there popularity be not decreased when declared that must spend remainder of autumn perhaps winter at littlebath did stay there for winter have year furlough during be to remain in england with full pay made known to lady at littlebath that chief object of getting leave be to be present at nuptials of dear caroline son on one occasion borrowed thirty pound from miss baker circumstance intimacy perhaps made excusable happened however to mention little occurrence casually to son george at once repaid that debt poor a be at time must have more chose merely for asking said sir lionel on occasion in tone almost of reproach so winter passed away george however be not idle fully intended to be called to bar in following autumn did to certain extent renew legal study did not return to mr die prevented possibly by difficulty must have in preparing necessary fund great work through winter in early spring be small volume published in march called fallacy of early history need not give minute criticism on work will suffice to say that orthodox world declared to be much more heterodox than last work heterodox indeed be so bad said that there be not least glimmer of doxy left about early history of spoke be altogether bible history fallacy to alluded be plainest statement of book of genesis nay have called whole story of creation myth whole story a there given so at least said rabbi of oxford among outspoke more loudly than others outraged very learned rabbi of oriel bertram however denied have said not called anything myth there be printed book one might have supposed that must be easy enough to settle question be far from being so word myth mythical be used dozen time rabbi declared that be applied to statement of scripture bertram declared that be applied to appearance statement must have a at present put before english world then said something not complimentary to translator something also very uncivil a to want of intelligence on part of oxford rabbi war raged warmly be taken up by metropolitan press till bertram became lion lion however without hide for in middle of dispute felt called on to resign fellowship lost that hide got in lieu friend assured be of much warmer texture uncle have taken considerable interest in dispute alleging through that oxford men be long eared ass bigoted monk may be presumed that own orthodoxy be not of high class have never liked george fellowship have always ridiculed income received from directly heard that have be resigned gave nephew thousand pound said nothing about merely told mr pritchett to arrange matter sir lionel be delighted a to question of orthodoxy be perfectly indifferent be nothing to whether son called book of genesis myth gospel have said much very much a to folly of risking fellowship more great deal more a to madness of throwing away now be quite ready to own wrong did do so in most straightforward manner after what be fellowship to man just about to be married in position bertram have of course be free to speak out if indeed there have be object in holding to college then expression of such opinion let alone publication must not have be judicious a be however nothing must have be more lucky son have shown independence rich uncle have shown warm interest still took in nephew sir lionel be able to borrow two hundred fifty pound sum of money at present moment be very grateful to bertram triumph be gilded on side for bookseller have paid handsomely for infidel manuscript infidelity can make successful will at rate bring income brings to period at may resume story one word must say a to caroline during winter have seen lover repeatedly have written to repeatedly engagement therefore have by mean be broken meeting be cold letter equally so must have married at once now if must ask must not ask be quite willing to marry if must herself say that be willing so far to recede from former resolution must not bring to do be too proud to make first concession to other therefore concession be made by sir lionel once attempted to interfere failed george gave to understand that must manage own affair when son be frequently called on to lend money to father that father be never called on to repay parental authority be apt to grow dull have become very dull in case chapter iv richmond be in midst of noise about bertram new book that scene be presumed to be re opened have resigned fellowship pocketed thousand pound of event have much depressed spirit appeared now to friend to be happy man in spite of love trouble at same time harcourt also be sufficiently elate have made great speech with considerable eclat sail be full of wind of wind of more substantial character than by bertram vessel be wafted just now harcourt bertram be again much together few month since have appeared to harcourt bertram intended to hing in world to make figure even now there be little hope of doing much a barrister seemed probable that might at rate make known a author such triumph a harcourt well knew be very barren still be well to know men who be in way triumphant therefore barrister so triumphant considered judicious not to drop friend may be said that bertram have given up idea of practising a barrister still intended to go through form of being called profession be to be that of author have manner of work in hand poem play political pamphlet infidel essay history narrative of travel in east have made up mind fully that there be in england only two occupation worthy of englishman man must be known either a politician a author behoved man to speak out what be in with audible voice so that world might hear might do so either by word of mouth by pen paper by former in parliament by latter at desk form of speech have own advantage fate have made harcourt member of parliament seemed to intend bertram to be author harcourt though overwhelmed by business at period took frequent occasion to be with bertram when be with alone always made effort to talk about miss waddington bertram be rather shy of subject have never blamed harcourt for what have taken place while be absent in paris since time have never volunteered to speak of own engagement be together one fine may evening on bank of river at richmond george be fond of place whenever harcourt proposed to spend evening alone with must go up river dine there on occasion harcourt seemed determined to talk about miss waddington bertram who be not in best possible humour have shown one might say plainly enough that be subject on did not wish to speak one might also say that be subject a to talking on choice certainly ought to have be left to man who be engaged may often choose to talk to friend about engaged bride friend doe not usually select lady a topic of conversation except in conformity with benedict wish on occasion however harcourt must talk about miss waddington bertram who have already given one two short answer began to feel that friend be almost impertinent be cracking decayed walnut sipping not very best of wine bertram be expatiating on sir robert peel enormity in having taken wind out of sail of whig rehearsing perhaps few paragraph of new pamphlet be about to come out when harcourt again suddenly turned conversation by by said believe there be day absolutely fixed for marriage said bertram sharply enough day have be fixed must anything on earth have be more base than manner in have endeavoured to leave cobden a necessary legacy to new government must have put cobden into place in government of own oh d cobden one have enough of in house quite have not that advantage will have of day will make over battersea hamlet to a soon a can get judge wig on head be thinking of other thing now wonder whether caroline waddington ever will be man wife probably about time that be made judge have have well hope if do do will come off before doubt be coming off at of be too proud for other neither of can forgive what other have done what do mean to tell truth harcourt have great inclination to discus matter just at present if please will leave miss waddington alone what mean be said embryo judge perseveringly that be too angry with on account of enforced delay be too angry with because have dared to be angry with think will ever come together bertram looked full at harcourt a be said observed that there be not usual easy gentlemanlike smile on barrister face yet barrister be doing best to look a usual fact be that harcourt be playing game playing with considerable skill performance be not altogether that of garrick something might have be read in face have bertram be cunning enough to read bertram be not cunning man bertram looked full in other face have be content to do so to say nothing must have gained point subject must have be at once dropped harcourt then must have gone further bertram be now angry being angry must not speak harcourt have interfered once before between miss waddington interfered yes interfered in what then thought still think to have be very unwarrantable manner be pity did not tell of at time be pity rather that must drive to tell of now do so when be in paris said to miss waddington what have right to say what did say rather said to ah be fault of mine be fault of yours do think that can not understand that can not see must have be silent enough to for encouragement know be ever so vexed a when received that letter from took upon know be angry very angry be not fault said nothing what friend under such circumstance be bound to say well let matter drop now let miss waddington settle own affair can not let matter drop have driven to defend must do a best may know that be angry exceedingly angry exceedingly angry repeated be fault of mine when miss baker sent for must not go to when be there must not listen to when caroline told that be wretched miss waddington shouted bertram in voice caused glass to shake made waiter turn round then suddenly recollecting scowled round room a observed that be noticed hush dear fellow will be miss waddington not quite so loud beg pardon hearing lady called by christian name so often by miss baker forgot when spoke to of wretched state what be to do be to say fie fie take hat go away be very wretched continued for bertram merely scowled said nothing must not sympathize with thought that have neglected be clear that have gone abroad without telling be to be wondered at must be unhappy telling that be so be unexcusable at rate be blameless think that be also be question in what wrote to did duty a friend to party after do confess that thought anger too great to allow ever to stand at altar with mean to say that showed letter said bertram almost leaping at letter what letter know what letter letter from paris letter wrote to in reference to one received from desire at once to have answer from did caroline show that letter harcourt looked very guilty extremely guilty did not immediately make reply harcourt answer said bertram much more coolly have feeling of anger now with did caroline show that letter miss waddington did show to thus successful mr harcourt have be successful also in now having narrated interview in manner doe not make redound very much to gentleman credit must add to narrative apology if even handed justice be done throughout world apology must be found for most offence not that offence must thus be wiped away black become white much be now very black must be reduced to sombre uninviting shade of ordinary brown be so customary to humanity apology for mr harcourt will by mean make conduct white will leave perhaps of deeper dingier brown than be quite ordinary among men nay will leave still black many will say mr harcourt have seen that in opinion proved that bertram miss waddington must never be happy with other have seen that in opinion led to conclusion that of really wished that marriage must take place have seen that also made believe that be too proud to ask for release under such circumstance must be doing ill if be to release caroline have so spoken spoken even to that seemed impossible to that must wish for marriage bertram have so written that seemed equally impossible that must wish for must not therefore be madness to allow to marry have said a much to miss baker miss baker have agreed with can not love miss baker have said must not neglect so shamefully be sure doe not love there be man who did love her who have felt that must love from first moment that have seen a affianced bride have not then courted for for then be manifest that loved be loved now now that be altered be there good cause why must not covet now mr harcourt thought that there be sufficient cause then man who be not by nature vain man who have not made apt at believing that young beauty fell readily in love with who have not spent year in basking in lady smile imagined that have ground to think that miss waddington be not averse to oh how have looked when part of bertram letter have be read in professed that must not be bored by love duty for lady then man have be kind to have shown that such service must be no bore to have be gentle mannered to also have be gentle to woman can not be of nature making whom being kind misery make not kinder caroline be kind at least so thought heaven know be miserable also thus hope rose must never have risen scheme be made if not absolutely black be a near a shade of brown may be then there be fact that caroline be granddaughter might probably be heiress of one of wealthiest men in city of london consideration of fact have weight also lady must at least have six thousand pound might have sixty might have three time sixty harcourt must probably have found inexpedient to give way to love have there be money to gild passion be notoriously man of world pretended to be nothing else must have thought that have made ludicrous if have married for love only with be source of comfort that lady pecuniary advantage allowed hope that might indulge love so did indulge have trusted for awhile circumstance must break off ill assorted match that then must step in without previous interference in matter time be running too close unless something be done two poor young creature must marry make wretched for life benevolence required that must take matter in hand so did take in hand commenced operation not unskilfully a have seen such be apology for mr harcourt very poor one reader will say turning from gentleman with disgust be poor one be turned inside out a be done with lady gentleman in novel of might find little difficulty in giving good apology for shade of brown must often be very dark bertram sat for awhile silent motionless at table harcourt seeing look of grief almost repented what have done after have only told truth letter have be shown to be incredible said bertram incredible incredible nevertheless voice showed plainly enough that statement to be not incredible let be so said harcourt who purposely misunderstood wish to believe let leave so come be time for to go back to town bertram still sat silent saying nothing harcourt called waiter paid bill then told bertram what share be commenced smoothing silk of preparatory to moving bertram took out purse gave necessary amount of shilling then again sat silent motionless come bertram there will be only one train after know what crowd there be always for let go bertram did not move harcourt if must not mind said very gently must rather go back by to day what have said have put out will probably walk walk to town oh walk will be nothing will like wait for there be good fellow will see to morrow next day before long so harcourt shrugging shoulder expressing surprise at singular resolve put hat on head walked off by what inward reflection be on journey back to london will not inquire will accompany other friend in walk hurriedly a have be written remembered almost word of letter from paris knew that have be severe have sometimes perhaps regretted severity knew also that offence have be great what right have affianced bride to speak of to man be not fit that must tell how great be sin idea on matter be perhaps too strong certainly be not peculiar speaking for educated male sex in england like to think that one must tamper with lady whom love what be to have since done to talk of have be bad to show letter to show such letter a to show such letter to person to make such confidence with such confidant must not be that loved must not be that must prefer that other man to a thought of walking on hurriedly towards london on soft may night bosom swelled with anger rather than with sorrow must be over then between must not go on after what have now be told be willing presumed to marry having pledged word that must do so be clear that did not care for must not hold to pledge must take to bosom one who must have secret understanding with man miss baker said to have treated badly must have known why have not told if be so that miss waddington liked better than must not have be miss baker duty to tell so did not signify however have learnt in time luckily luckily luckily must quarrel with harcourt what mattered whether did what mattered what part harcourt took in concern if harcourt have said be true if caroline have shown letter bertram must never forgive that if so must part then if did not posse what mattered who did nay if loved why must prevent coming together of must make fully satisfied must know whether letter have truly be shown harcourt be barrister in bertram estimation barrister word be not always to be taken implicitly so still walked on what must first do how must act at once then occurred to that according to idea generally prevalent in world on such matter must not be held to be justified in repudiating betrothed merely because have shown letter of to gentleman felt in own mind that cause be quite sufficient that state of mind act disclosed be clearly not that of loving trusting wife others might think differently perhaps miss baker might do so perhaps miss waddington then be not possible that must ever wish to marry after having taken course a have not indeed ample cause to think that did not wish to marry have put off to last possible moment have yielded nothing to urgent request in intercourse with have be cold unbending have have moment of confidence be not with be with one whom perhaps liked better there be jealousy in not jealousy of usual kind self respect have be injured must not endure that hardly now wished that must love must go to littlebath at once ask question must ask question be now burning inside heart did not like severe letter must write no more such to what further communication might of necessity take place between must be by word of mouth so resolved to go down to littlebath on morrow then reached chamber weary sad at heart be no longer angry endeavoured to persuade that be absolutely reverse of angry knelt down prayed that might be happy swore that must do anything to make so that anything be not to include chance of marriage with chapter v juno in spite of philosophy prayer bertram went to bed not in very happy state of mind be man essentially of warm loving heart be exigeant perhaps even selfish in love most men be so did love have loved having made up mind to part from have loved must not be happy have often lain awake thinking of fault to now lay thinking of fault to be pity said to that marriage must have be so delayed have acted foolishly in certainly have not known have not understood character appreciated affection nevertheless might have borne better felt that have be stern almost savage to that have resented refusal to marry at once too violently threw heavy blame on through still felt that must not now marry be not clear to that caroline must be delighted to escape from engagement if way to do so be opened to lost time in carrying out plan by early train on following day went down to littlebath at once went to father lodging for sir lionel in order that might be near dear daughter be still living in littlebath have entered second lighter fast set played good deal at card might constantly be seen walking up down assembly room did something in horse flesh george first went to father lodging found still in bed lighter fast set at littlebath generally get up early sir lionel professed that have not lately be altogether well littlebath be fearfully fearfully cold be now may be still obliged to keep fire be in very good humour however with son for period of two hundred fifty pound loan be not long passed by gratitude for have not yet given way to desire for more oh george be that be delighted to see going up to terrace suppose be with caroline for few minute last night never saw looking better never george answered by asking father where meant to dine sir lionel be going to dine out usually did dine out be one of men who have knack of getting succession of gratis dinner must be confessed in favour admission be generally made in dining out world sir lionel be worth dinner then will probably return evening will see before go sir lionel asked why must not dine a usual in montpellier terrace on subject george at present gave answer merely said that thought very improbable that must do so then went away to work be hard work that have to do thoroughly wished that be over did not however allow moment to pause on contrary walked so quick that when found in miss baker drawing room be almost out of breath partly from cause partly from agitation be unable to speak to lady in usual unruffled manner ah how do do miss baker be very glad to see have run down to day in great hurry be very anxious to see caroline be out miss baker explained that be not out must be down very shortly be glad be not away for be very anxious to see very miss baker with voice also in tremble asked if anything be matter nothing matter truth be be tired of miss baker want to settle know how may bear have half killed miss baker looked at almost aghast for manner be energetic almost wild only that so frequently be wild must have feared that something dreadful be about to happen have not however time to say anything further for caroline step be heard on stair must let be alone for ten minute said george feel shame of turning out of own drawing room perhaps caroline will not mind coming down with into parlour miss baker of course waived objection a retreated two lady met just at drawing room door caroline be about to speak be stopped by expression on aunt face lady have little way of talking to other with nod beck wreathed smile be quite beyond reach of men in language aunt mary did say something a passed gave niece to understand that coming interview must not consist merely of delight be common among lover caroline therefore a entered room composed face for solemn thing walked slowly not without dignity in mien into presence of who be to be lord master hardly expected george said father have be right be looking well very well figure be perhaps not quite so full colour in cheek quite so high a when have first seen in jerusalem otherwise have never seemed to more lovely little effort have made to collect to assume certain majesty in gait be becoming to so also be plain morning dress simple braid in hair be collected might certainly be boasted of miss waddington that be beauty of morning rather than of night that complexion be fitted for sun rather than for gaslight be going to give up why saw before have so often brought to believe that at moment actually did believe to be a perfect form of feminine beauty a might be found by search in england be a yet own might keep a own knew thought knew enough of to be sure that let feeling be what might must not condescend to break word to doubtless must marry that in few month hence if only must marry beautiful a be much a be own much a still loved have come there to reject flashed through mind in moment lost time in idle thought caroline said stretching out hand to usually when met after absence have used hand to draw nearer to with more warmth than present ordinary greeting showed caroline have come down to have talk with there be that between must be settled well what be said with slightest possible smile will not if can help say word to show that be angry be angry george if so have not better show concealment will never sit well on hope not will conceal anything willingly be because so greatly dislike concealment be here must not conceal anything if tried george be useless for to say that will not show that be angry be angry do show be hope present sin be not very grievous one by banishing poor aunt out of drawing room fear must be rather bad be dining with mr harcourt last night escaped in conversation that have shown to letter wrote to from paris be so caroline did show very letter certainly indifferent listener must have said that there be tone of anger in bertram voice yet there be that in made miss waddington feel that room be swimming round round turned ruby red up to hair bertram have never before seen blush like for have never before seen covered by shame oh how have repented showing that letter how soul have grieved over from very moment that have passed out of hand have done so in hotness of passion have written to sharp stinging word have maddened up to moment have never known how sharp how stinging how bitter word might be world have hitherto be so soft to be there told that be unfeminine unladylike then be sitting by be so smooth so sympathizing so anxious to please in anger sympathy have shown from day to have repented in roughness of sackcloth bitterness of ash be possible that caroline waddington must so sin against woman sense of propriety that ala have be proved be impossible that must so sin not know that have sinned not feel shame of did stand before red with shame at first moment made answer be in heart to kneel at foot to kneel in spirit if not in body ask pardon hitherto have asked pardon of human being there be effort in doing of must not at once get over have eye looked tenderly on for moment have one soft tone fallen from lip must have done down must have gone implored pardon who that have once loved have ever asked aught in vain from george bertram ah that have done so how well might have loved other what joy there might have be there be nothing tender in eye tender tone softened word fell from mouth what said in spite of promise voice have never before sounded so stern what show letter to man show letter to mr harcourt be that true caroline child asks pardon from mother because be scolded wish to avert wrath in order that may escape punishment so also may servant of master inferior of superior when one equal asks pardon of be because acknowledges regret injury have done such acknowledgment such regret will seldom be produced by stern face harsh voice caroline a looked at listened to did not go down on knee not even mentally instead of doing so remembered dignity wretched a be at heart continued to seat without betraying misery be that true caroline will believe charge against from other lip than own yes george be true did show letter to mr harcourt so stern have be in bearing that must not condescend even to word of apology have hitherto remained standing on hearing flung into chair buried face in hand even then might have be softened might have relented might have be well be very unhappy george said that letter have made very unhappy hardly knew where to turn for relief what said jumping up flashing before in storm of passion to former sternness have be a nothing what letter made so unhappy that be obliged to go to mr harcourt for relief appealed for sympathy from to from who be who be affianced husband have idea of sort of bond existed between did not know that there be matter in must not look for sympathy to such a without being false nay almost worse than false have ever thought what be to be one loved object of man heart to have accepted that love have be on point of interrupting softness of last word interrupted for moment letter a do remember that letter caroline yes remember remember too well must not keep must not feel that such word from be ever by mean that be harsh be cruel harsh cruel what will will not now stop to defend be one from very nature of must have be sacred between be written to a to one to whom have right to write a future wife one must have right to write letter a in particularly begged that mr harcourt might not be made arbiter between made special request that to at least must not talk of what cause of trouble there might be between yet selected a confidant read with poured over with word have come hot from heart discussed with love bah can not endure have not told so must not have believed george good god that must take letter read over with why caroline admits of one solution there be one reading to riddle ask world sent for a friend yes seem to have

felt that ought to give release for have known that have not thoroughly loved miss waddington be too proud too conscious of necessity to maintain pride at present moment to contradict nevertheless in heart felt that did love that must fain not give up that in spite of anger bitter railing anger must keep close to if only must do so now that spoke of giving up must not speak passionately of love

so long have so much trouble in matter trouble trouble will not make fool of believe at rate that understand oh perfectly mr bertram did not understand perhaps be very likely that must understand what have meant to understand be that in giving up be sacrificing only not that did so in conviction that did not care for that did so on account strong a own love still be in spite of offence be what

passed have manner be a ordinarily be must of course have be asked to join a have seen have be moment for such customary civility now however went to dinner while seated there miss waddington told aunt that did not feel equal to going out that evening miss baker of course said something in opposition to that something be not much might easily be understood that young lady who have just lost lover be not in fit state to go to littlebath card party thus early in evening caroline contrived to be alone then for first time attempted to realize have come upon hitherto have have to support goddess ship first before george bertram then with lighter effort before aunt now that be alone must descend to humanity now that be alone have so to descend yes have lost three year to mortal goddess

most courteous manner to do justice be not grief burnt most hotly into heart said to herself that be so that be worst grief must fain have felt that be so there be more of humanity in her of sweetness of womanly humanity than be aware have left knew not how to live without be thorn stuck fast in woman bosom must never again look into deep thoughtful eye never again feel pressure of strong manly arm never hear poetry of rich voice a have heard when poured word of love truth into ear bertram have many fault while belonged to have thought of often enough have many virtue also now must think of have said that be gone gone for ever be easy enough to say that with composed voice to miss baker there be nothing so easy a bravado wretch who be to be hung can step lightly while multitude be looking at woman who be about to give up that heart most value can declare out loud that matter be very indifferent to when victim of law be lying in solitary cell thinking on doom morning before executioner come to when poor girl be sitting alone on bedside with heart empty rather not empty only hopeless be very difficult then to maintain spirit of bravado caroline waddington did try have often said to herself in month now time past repented of engagement if so now be time to congratulate that be free from must not congratulate while have entirely belonged to have not known how thoroughly have loved when have only thought of parting with have believed that must be easy now found that be not so easy be about a easy for to pluck image from heart a to draw one of limb from socket limb have to be drawn from socket there be longer hope that must be saved nay have be already given up a far a expression of will be concerned there be nothing left to bear pain so sat down began to draw out limb oh sensitive reader have ever performed process be by mean to be done with rose water appliance gentle motherly pressure whole force of hospital have to be brought out to perform operation now discovered perhaps for first time that have strong beating heart that loved violent capricious man with strong pulse of there be more about now be lovable by woman a caroline waddington than when have first spoken of love on side of mount olivet then have be little more than boy boy indeed with high feeling with poetic nature much humour gift have hardly sufficed to win heart now have added to strong will power of command capability of speaking out to world with sort of voice after power will be gift woman most love in man now that caroline have lost lover confessed to herself that did love love yes how must recover be first thought must not recover in way be second thought a to asking to come back to wrenching of limb from socket must be better than at least knew must not do be possible that of own accord must come back to be not possible man be tender hearted must have be whistled back with slightest lure while yet two be standing in room together be a proud a be tender though there might also be wrenching to be done within heart must never come back again uninvited thus while miss baker be at old friend card party miss waddington sat in own bedroom striving with bitter tear violent struggle to reconcile to loss chapter vi sir lionel in trouble have be said that miss baker be going to spend evening with old friend trust miss todd umquhile of valley of jehoshaphat now of paragon littlebath have not be forgotten miss todd of free heart rosy face yes miss todd have come to littlebath be intent rather on forming party of toddites than of joining to of regular set be perhaps not much given to be pious certainly be ill inclined to be slow if fast however chose to be fast in own line before have pleasure of attending at soiree must say word two of one of most distinguished of expected guest sir lionel be to be there now sir lionel have be leading pleasant life at littlebath with one single exception that be rather in want of fund have capital apartment four room ensuite man servant groom three horse phaeton one be more looked up to at littlebath lady smiled young men listened old gentleman brought out best wine be delightful that re angusta did occasionally remind that be mortal oh sordid brother of who must have given thousand on thousand without feeling loss of have be unable to see much of old mr bertram in recapitulating story of young mr bertram latter doings must have be said that early in present year have not be quite a well a friend must wish george have gone to see once twice so also have niece miss baker granddaughter have said very little to on miss baker mind impression have be left that must please to see marriage completed at time likewise brother sir lionel have thought expedient to see there have hitherto be interview between since sir lionel return colonel have found out have be duly astonished at finding out history of miss baker niece that george caroline must be heir to great portion of brother money must not doubt that miss baker must have something thought probable then reflected that in spite of be come gone brother heart might relent on death bed might be that must talk sick man round if be impracticable might at least learn how others stood in brother favour sir lionel be not now young man ease settled life must be good for what if married miss baker first called on pritchett mr pritchett told that brother be better considerably better sir lionel be in rapture have hurried up from littlebath in agony have heard most distressing account must however go down to hadley see brother be afraid mr bertram be not very much up to company just at present wheezed out mr pritchett brother know suggested sir lionel pritchett knew exactly how brother stood with other though be very partial to mr george have not warm love for sir lionel oh yes brother be brother surely mr bertram know sir mean said sir lionel that be little vexed about account oh account there be account sir lionel if be to settle that perhaps can manage without troubling to go to hadley not what settling account will make matter smoother sir lionel must get nothing more from mr pritchett must not be put off from intention did go to hadley found brother sitting up in dining room must not have known indeed many who have seen lately might have have difficulty in recognizing be not only lean lank worn wan spoke with difficulty on close examination might be seen that mouth be twisted a be from centre of face since relative have seen have suffered what be genteelly called slight threatening of paralysis mind if touched at have recovered spirit be in nowise paralyzed when sir lionel be shown into room have first of taken precaution of sending down card from hotel saying that must call in hour old man put out hand to did not attempt to rise from chair must be remembered that brother have not seen other for more than fifteen year sir lionel have tutored carefully a to what must say what do george said old man shrank a heard unaccustomed name when heard that be ill must not come see very good of sir lionel very good of growled old man be fifteen year since met be old men now be old man now nearly worn out too old far gone to have many want be not in condition suppose there be amount of sarcasm in voice a spoke in eye also a looked at brother made sir lionel perfectly understand that rich relative be not specially anxious to be kind to well be of quite so far gone a hope not quite so far gone a sir lionel looked very pleasant speaking for myself have not many want now have pleasant old man that be only three four comfortable room for servant phaeton pair of horse smaller establishment in secluded quiet street nothing more than including of course be excellent in eating drinking line speaking for myself have not many want now did look very good humoured pleasant a spoke mr bertram senior did not look good humoured pleasant there be that in old eye be very opposite to good humour pleasantness ah said well be glad of for will be able to do more for poor george will have want be going to take care trouble on sweetheart have take be accustomed to do without want income will be tight enough forby what can do for colonel sat still looked pleasant began to think that might be a well for that be back at littlebath poor george hope will be happy think will greatest anxiety now be of course for happiness yours be same doubtless be odd that child child child must thus come together be not so spoke colonel mr bertram looked at looked through almost said nothing be odd continued sir lionel very happy circumstance be certainly sweetest girl ever saw george be lucky fellow yes be lucky fellow will get more than have right to expect first last will have six thousand pound have not heard say what mean to settle on perhaps be waiting till have come home sir lionel forte during whole official career have be making pleasant by pleasantness be innate in thing appeared to be going in very unpleasant manner how be to make thing pleasant now well see george have be so much knocked about there be fellowship think behaved shabbily enough to fellowship one hundred seventy pound year run of teeth at feast time such thing a man ca marry on fellowship very well have have have no ca exactly do on whole think be quite a well that threw up so told did tell at same time what future income be to be upon soul did not if hear be true believe did have be exceedingly generous to george to also then sir lionel allow to tell that hear be not true anything at that may have heard of kind if have heard anything be perfectly false have said nothing to george about income have nothing to say to well may have expressed wrongly perhaps did say nothing be alluding especially to what have done will tell exactly what have done thought showed high spirit when threw up fellowship a have always great contempt for oxford fellow sent thousand pound be present hope will make good use of be sure will said sir lionel who certainly have just cause for such confidence seeing how large slice out of sum have be placed at own disposal be sure will said sir lionel indeed know that have ah be glad to hear of of course know more about than do of course be arranging matter be have have from that be likely to have if such be to be treatment of george of george who be certainly in respect favourite what hope must sir lionel have for be not so much brother word led to fear that brother money bag be impregnable to a brother voice brother eye that eye be never off sir lionel did begin to wish that be at littlebath know whether george may have formed hope continued old man here sir lionel interrupted not imprudently if anything be to be said must be said now well if have formed hope george can not own that be natural have looked on a man without child of own have be taught so to look by treating almost a though be son mean that paid school debt oxford debt when forgot to do so growled out elder brother yes that afterwards gave income when came up to live in london hope think that be ungrateful george sir lionel used softest at same time most expressive tone grateful seldom look for much gratitude will be glad to know when may suit to settle with account have be running on now for great many year probably pritchett may have sent a spoke mr bertram rose from chair took ominous looking piece of paper from off mantelpiece yes mr pritchett be punctuality in matter said sir lionel with gentle laugh have not about usual pleasantness have probably checked can say whether be correct said mr bertram senior looking at paper in hand well ca say have exactly in least doubt figure not in least mr pritchett be always correct know yes mr pritchett be generally correct may ask sir lionel what intend to do in matter be necessary now that sir lionel must summon up best courage reminded that after brother be feeble old man impotent in money a seemed now clear that further pecuniary aid be to be expected why need fear on account have be possible for to get away without further talk must have done so be not possible so determined to put good face on suppose be joking now george said wish must describe tone of voice in word joking be repeated by elder mr bertram made military knight jump in chair confess to that word impotent must not be safely applied to ancient relative well dare say be joke old man went on to say if expect to be paid what have expended in saving george from being turned loose upon world without education suppose be joke have have have never thought of laughing at before now will always heard that be joker sir lionel have have have dare say have laughed at often enough eh what mean be when took upon george education maintenance must hardly have intended to have paid back again by poor devil a be oh must must at rate suppose did count on having money back well must admit did not feel very sure of did think there might be doubt what must do must not let poor wilkinson ruin because must not pay debt be sorry that take up in such manner said colonel assuming tone of injured innocence came here because heard that be ill thought be dying eh did not exactly think that be dying george knew that be very ill old feeling came back on feeling of early youth george must not be happy without seeing very kind of be sure altogether decline then to settle account eh if desire will will make arrangement certainly want at once suppose oh half in three month other half in six will do for must take great deal more than income to do fear professional income yes suppose must fear give five six thousand year for staying at home at littlebath surely must have saved money must have intended to do something for son have looked upon a provided for by uncle oh have therefore be satisfied that must do well now sir lionel will tell how matter be know will never repay shilling of money therefore will tell pritchett not to bother with sending more account be worthy man be sorry must have have so much trouble so be very be done have have trouble have paid money a far a george be concerned begrudge must not if knew what sentiment be care fig for sentiment feeling of gratitude to be very strong be not be not in least grateful to do wish to be so be honest lad with high spirit good heart bad head sometimes have thought of making heir ah sighed sir lionel have now firmly made up mind to do such thing have knowledge of worth of money doe not value money oh there mistake indeed do must do good with a regard mine wo have sir lionel face again became very doleful who will have george whom else have got to leave to when want to consult on subject will send for just at present have wish to do so now if please will say no more about money nothing more be said about money very little on other subject on what other subject must pleasant votary of pleasure such a sir lionel wish to hold conversation with worn out old miser from city have regarded brother a very full sponge from living water might probably be squeezed sponge seemed be no longer squeezable by in way so left hadley a quickly a must betook to littlebath with somewhat saddened heart consoled however by reflecting that old man whim be seldom very enduring george might yet become participator in huge prize if not on own account at least on of wife sir lionel returned to littlebath resolving come what might must not again have personal recourse to brother have tried diplomatic power have failed failed in line on being successful in so pre eminently piqued in ireland be said of man who be more than ordinarily persuasive that can talk devil out of liver wing of turkey sir lionel have always supposed to be gifted with eloquence in discourse at devil have be too stout for have gone away without wing at liver other on one point on have be very anxious to say word two have be unable to introduce slightest hint have not dreamt that must be possible to ask brother in so many word whether miss baker must be made participator in great prize have imagined that might have led way to conversation must have shown be old man feeling with reference to lady a reader will have perceived have not be able to lead conversation in way have left hadley without further light for guidance of step in matrimonial path in have contemplated expediency of taking leisurely evening stroll wicked old miser have declared that george must not be heir have also said that be tantamount to similar declaration regarding caroline must have six thousand pound first last nothing more than beggarly six thousand pound of two third be already own without thanks to one what wretched old miser who then must have money must hardly be possible that must leave to miss baker yet might be just possible anything be possible with capricious miserly old fool like what catch must be if sir lionel must become heir in so deliciously easy manner in probability anything old man might say be exactly opposite of intended to do probably must leave money to george very probably to caroline most probably must do something for miss baker something handsome for soft obedient handmaid who have never disobeyed of command better still have never drawn upon for more than regular allowance such be sir lionel thought a made way back to littlebath yes must make acceptable to miss baker george old george be not long for world be very evident to colonel troublesome old cross grained churl that be must soon be out of way such being certain certain must not sir lionel manage matter in way must not engage to lady while brother be yet alive then marry afterwards marry perhaps not marry a might then become expedient be well sure of if promised to marry before acquisition of fortune such acquisition must not induce to break off from match be too true too honourable for said sir lionel to feeling warm admiration for truth of character a resolved how might best back out of such engagement in event of being expedient for so to do so passed thought a made way back to littlebath when there did not allow idleness to mar scheme immediately began to make pleasant more than ordinarily pleasant to miss baker did not make love to after manner of youth have done so must only have frightened gentle lady be assiduous in attention soft sweetly flattering in speech friendly oh so friendly in manner called almost day at montpellier crescent to be sure there be nothing unnatural in for be not about to become father of dear caroline dear to a dear caroline might be softest whisper most sugared word be always for aunt have ever little proposition to make kind family suggestion to put forward be man of world be lady delicate unfit for coping with world necessarily ignorant of naughtier darker way must do everything for by degree did almost everything for miss baker so that lady be charmed without knowing let do full justice have not remotest idea of opening flirtation with sir lionel bertram have looked on a future father in law of own dear child never a anything more idea of becoming lady bertram have ever for instant flashed upon imagination nevertheless by degree warrior attention became pleasant to have have youthful adorer poor good miss baker never at least since have be merry a other child be when little lover came have advanced to present nearly mature age without perhaps feeling want of nevertheless even in bosom be living usual feminine passion for admiration be lusus naturae woman with heart blood in vein not a yet very old woman therefore though have idea that sir lionel be lover have learned to be fond of little conversation with caroline on subject be delightful younger lady be certainly sharper of two though have own concern to occupy be able to see that something might perhaps be intended liking for sir lionel be by mean strong passion something probably have passed between george for george must keep secret from at rate suspected knight must not say anything to put aunt on guard beyond using cold expression in speaking of future father miss baker who suspected nothing who expected nothing must not be too lavish in praise caroline must say do think be so happy in having father in law oh certainly caroline have answered for think more of father in law son oh of course do know sir lionel be such perfect gentleman did ever know gentleman of age so attentive to lady a be well perhaps not except one two old men whom have seen making love be very different sort of thing know be absurd must say think sir lionel behaviour be perfect what must have said of sir lionel behaviour have known secret of establishment thus partly on sir lionel account miss baker began in day to have perhaps hottest fit strongest wish with reference to niece marriage then just at hottest moment came blow have be told of in last chapter miss baker a prepared for miss todd party must not believe that matter be hopeless quarrel of lover have ever be renewal of love since day when verb between two nominative case first became possessed of power of agreeing with of there be something in sweet easiness of agreement seems to tend to such reconciliation miss baker be too good grammarian to doubt fact must probably under existing circumstance have stayed at home with niece that knew must meet sir lionel at miss todd party be very anxious to learn whether sir lionel have heard of sad interruption to harmony anxious to hear what sir lionel must say about anxious to concert measure with sir lionel for repairing breach be if sir lionel must appear to be cognizant that breach existed if must find that be not cognizant must not tell at least thought must not circumstance must of course govern conduct to certain degree when moment of meeting must arrive so miss baker went to party certainly with saddened heart comforted in degree by assurance that must meet sir lionel dear sir lionel what thing be to have friend said to herself a stepped into fly yes indeed best thing in world very best dear miss baker be of thing most difficult to acquire especially difficult for lady gentleman after forty year of age in meantime sir lionel have be calling on miss todd have heard good deal about miss todd be strong at heart a man be strong who have two

walked on alone perhaps little piqued at being thus slighted be strange sight to see rev mr o'callaghan among worldly crowd of pleasure seeking sinner there be a have said three set of people at littlebath that miss todd with commanding genius great power of will must have got together portion of two of be hardly to be considered wonderful fast heavy set liked good supper did appear singular

since how then did come to pas that be seen at miss todd party secret lay in miss todd unbounded power be not a other littlebathians when unintentionally squeezed hand squeezed in return with somewhat of firmer grasp when gently whispering trusted that be a well in spirit a in body answered aloud larger paragon heard that be very well in thank god then a guest pressed in passed on rapidly to tea cake to such generous supply of cream a mr flounce in piety might be pleased to vouchsafe to what mr o'callaghan said sir lionel into miss todd ear in tone of well bred wonder triumphant admiration mr

away martial bosom mr o'callaghan be left alone in converse with mr flounce turned to miss todd who be now seated near enough to door to do honour to late arriving guest near enough also to table to help easily to cake soul burned within to utter one anathema against thing that saw miss todd be still not playing might opine that objected to practice sir lionel be still at back also might be brand have be rescued from burning at little distance sat miss baker knew that at rate be not violently attached to card must not say something must not lift up voice if only for moment speak forth a so

pulpit preach at however consoled by improving occasion on following sunday for next fifteen minute sir lionel stood ground saying soft nothing to miss todd then also became absorbed among rubber found that miss todd be not good at having love made to in public be very willing to be confidential very willing to receive flattery attention hand pressing like must make confidence in usual joyous loud voice when told that be looking remarkably well must reply that always did look well at littlebath in tone must not fail to attract attention of whole room now sir lionel must fain have be little more quiet in proceeding be forced to put off of what have to say till must find miss todd alone on top of mountain 't be thus at least that expressed thought to in chagrin a took place opposite to mr shortpointz at seventh last establishment now formed in room only idler present be miss baker miss todd miss baker be not quite happy in mind be not only that be depressed about caroline firm belief in grammatical axiom before alluded to lessened grief on score conduct of sir lionel made uncomfortable began to find without at understanding why that did not like miss todd a well a used to do at

work while be still painfully toiling through second game first having be scored against by partner fatuity in having trumped long heart be to be borne with patience lady ruth said emitting fire out of one eye do ever mean to have done dealing card lady ruth did not condescend to make answer recommenced leisurely counting then miss ruff uttered that terrific screech have peculiarly excited miss todd attention declare like at said tender hearted miss baker think mr o'callaghan be quite right dear be quite wrong for blamed use of card not abuse after what harm come of suppose miss ruff will actually kill dare say if be playing must notice do play cribbage will have little cribbage miss baker did not play cribbage at rate said that did not do tell something about dear caroline continued miss todd be so anxious to see have be very long engagement have there ought to be lot of money ought there suppose be all right know be very much in love with young bertram made manner of overture to quite in vain have have have always thought very fine fellow think very lucky girl when be to be do tell be over head ear in love with be miss baker to say to have not slightest intention of making miss todd confidante in matter certainly not now a lady be inclined to behave so very improperly with sir lionel yet did not know how to answer hope wo be put off much longer continued miss todd be day fixed yet day be fixed yet replied miss baker blushing miss todd ear be very quick there be nothing matter trust well wo ask question say word to anybody come there be table vacant will cut in then determined that must get out from sir lionel party at of table be now changed miss baker miss todd found playing together miss baker too loved gentle little rubber if must enjoy quietly without fear of being gobbled up by ruff longspade with miss todd be in matter quite safe might behave a badly a have lady ruth miss todd must do worse than laugh at miss todd did not care about point at own house must a soon lose a win so miss baker must have be happy have not still continued to sigh over friend very improper flirtation with sir lionel thus thing went on for hour so now again savage yell be heard from ill used angry lady low growl prolonged sometimes through whole game came from different part of room nobody took notice of be manner at littlebath though stranger to place might have thought on looking at perturbed face hearing uncourteous sound that there must be flow of blood such flow a angry nail may produce denizen of place knew better so rubber went on with amount of harmony customary to place scene must have be odd one for non playing stranger have non playing stranger be there to watch person in room be engaged at whist except mr flounce who still remained quiescent behind tea cake did not happen that party be made up of number of exact four there be two over two middle aged lady maiden widow perhaps more happy than of others certainly more silent for of have partner to scold be hard at work at double dummy in corner be sight for stranger be generally thought that sad ennui pervades life of most of old lady in england to whom fate have denied usual care burden of world whose care burden be done gone there be ennui here stockjobber on 'change must go about exciting work with more animating eagerness there be who scolded who be scolded who sat silent being great of mind who being weak must not restrain note of triumph note of woe be of a animated intense a tiger springing at prey watch gleam of joy light up half dead sallow countenance of old mr

three winning little club see king queen fall impotent at call triumphant successful lady longspade be napoleon more triumphant did brighter glow of self satisfied inward power cross feature when at ulm succeeded in separating poor mack from friend play on lady let not begrudge amusement hold with pious mr o'callaghan that interchange of few sixpence be grievous sin at other hour ye be still soft charitable tender hearted tender hearted a english old lady be must be dear lady must not be well to remember amenity of life even at whist table so thing went on for hour so then miss baker sir lionel again found separated from card table lonely pair have be sir lionel cue evening to select miss todd for special attention have found miss todd at present moment to be too much public character for purpose have sort of way of speaking to guest at once have doubtless on whole extremely hilarious effect be not flattering to amour propre of special admirer so faute de mieux sir lionel be content to sit down in corner with miss baker miss baker be also content be rather uneasy a to how must treat subject of caroline quarrel with lover of course saw george to day began yes did see be seemed to be in tremendous hurry said must be back in town to night be not staying be no be not staying did know when saw that dear caroline be not with thought might perhaps have better company at home be not very well george went back to london before dinner nothing wrong hope well hope not be have heard anything about have sir lionel heard anything have heard nothing what be may be presumed that conversation a have not be carried on in very loud tone nevertheless low a miss baker have spoken low a sir lionel have spoken have be too loud have chosen place badly table at lady ruth party be sitting ought rather to say miss ruff party be in one corner of room friend have placed on cushioned seat fixed against wall in very corner thing be still going badly with miss ruff a sindbad carried old man must not shake off so did miss ruff still carry lady ruth revoke weight be too much for manfully struggled on however womanfully must perhaps be stronger more appropriate word have to calculate not only how to play own hand correctly have also to calculate on partner probable error be hard work required that around must be undisturbed silent in midst of maze of uncontrollable difficulty buzz buzz of miss baker voice fell upon ear up rose from chair miss todd said miss todd looking round from neighbouring table shone upon with rosy face shining be of avail miss todd if be to be conversazione have better make so at once if be whist then must say never heard so much talking in life be little of said miss todd not sotto voce oh very well now understand said miss ruff then resumed work went on with calculation miss baker sir lionel got up of course going over to further part of room continued conversation soon told knew have hardly seen george said caroline have have long interview with on leaving have said that now be over know what to make of said miss baker with handkerchief to eye what do think sir lionel know say that lover always do quarrel always do make up again george be very headstrong fellow said sir lionel yes be have always felt always there be being sure with be so wild have such start have be doing oh yes think so not that caroline be very spirited too suppose somehow came about between be tired of waiting might have be reason twelve month ago there be to be no more delay now be a understood have not be that sir lionel make very unhappy know miss baker again used handkerchief must distress dearest friend said lionel for sake oh if knew how pain to see suffering in way think more of in matter than even of george do indeed sir lionel contrived to give little pinch to top of one of miss baker finger not however without being observed by sharp eye of hostess caroline sobbed miss baker behind handkerchief be nicely ensconced in depth of lounging chair so that must turn face from card table be so sweet to be consoled in one misery especially when one really belief that misery be not incurable so that on whole miss baker be not unhappy yes dear caroline said sir lionel of course can say nothing till have heard more of matter do think caroline really love sometimes have thought so have sometimes be used doe love sir lionel be if know anything about ah dearest friend do know anything about be very question want to ask do know anything about sometimes have thought knew nothing then sometimes have thought be bold enough to think sir lionel looked intently at handkerchief covered face miss todd looked furtively ever anon at sir lionel declare think must do very well said miss todd to herself good naturedly miss baker did not quite understand felt much consoled sir lionel be remarkably handsome man a to that have made up mind long since then be peculiarly gentlemanlike man very friendly man man who exactly suited taste have for week past begun to think day tedious in did not see now be driven in upon mind that conversation be much pleasanter occupation than whist be conversation with so highly polished man a sir lionel bertram nevertheless did not quite understand what meant did know how ought to answer why need answer at must not sit there wiping eye softly comfortably listen to what might come next sometimes think that woman never love said sir lionel perhaps said miss baker yet in depth of many heart there may be fund of passion oh there may certainly said miss baker in own friend be there such fund there be there hidden depth there unexplored still fresh still perhaps still to be reached again miss baker found easiest to lie well back into chair wipe eye comfortably be not prepared to say much about depth of own heart at so very short notice sir lionel be again about to speak who can say what might have come next how far hidden depth might have be tried when be arrested in midst of pathos by seeing mr garded mr fuzzybell rush to shoulder of lady ruth revoke colonel quitted love for moment hurried to distant table while miss baker removing handkerchief sat up gazed at scene of action quarrelling have be going on unabated have caused little surprise be astonishing how soon ear becomes used to incivility be now accustomed to miss ruff voice thought nothing of exclamation well declare what ten of spade have have have well be excellent joke if must have obliged lady ruth by returning lead of trump must have be out c c c more attracted attention general pity for lady ruth have become dead passive at last miss ruff tongue went faster faster word became sharper sharper lady ruth countenance became very strange to look at bobbed head about slowly in manner frightened mr fuzzybell ceased to make remark to partner then mr garded made two direct appeal to miss ruff for mercy miss ruff must not be merciful perhaps on occasion refrained for moment be only for moment mr garded mr fuzzybell ceased to think of card looked only at lady ruth then of sudden rose from seat colonel a have said rushed across room player at table put down card stood up in alarm lady ruth be sitting perfectly still except that still bobbed old head up down in strange unearthly manner have about ten card in hand held motionless eye seemed to be fixed in one continued stare directly on face

passed by heavily enough then arthur wilkinson returned returned on saturday evening a clergyman always do so a to be ready for great day of work there be sabbath breaker to be compared in vehemence of sabbath breaking to hard worked parochial clergyman unless indeed be sunday school child who be forced on day to learn long dark collect stand in dread catechismal row before spiritual pastor master in first evening there be that flow of friendship always exists for few first hour of meeting between men who be really fond of other men be fond of other fonder perhaps because of have now cause for sorrow very little be said between arthur adela there be not apparently much to alarm widow in mutual manner to make think that miss gauntlet be to be put in place adela sat among other girl taking even le share in conversation than did arthur though talked a became master of house talked little to on following morning went to church of course who have courage to remain away from church when staying at clergyman house one ever unless be clergyman wife perhaps independent self willed daughter at hurst staple however on sunday attended adela be in deepest mourning thick black veil be down so a to hide tear last sunday have be at church father have preached last sermon bertram a entered door must not remember how long be since have joined in public worship month month have passed over since have allowed to be told that scripture moved in sundry place to acknowledge confess sin yet there have be time when have earnestly poured forth frequent prayer to heaven time not long removed be a yet hardly more than three year since have sworn within on brow of olivet to devote to service of saviour why have that oath be broken girl have ridiculed young girl have dissipated that by sheen of beauty by sparkle of eye by laughter of ruddy lip have promised to god rustling of silk have betrayed heart at instance at first word that promise have be whistled down wind to what have brought now a for bright eye flashing beauty ruddy lip be made over in fee simple to who be ready to go further than have gone in seeking world vanity even price of apostasy have vanished from be be nearly be a anything to further misery have come upon where be faith now true youthful ardent faith belief of inner heart conviction of god saviour have once be to source of joy have all vanished when under wall of jerusalem over against very garden of gethsemane have exchanged aspiration of soul for pressure of soft white hand one becomes infidel at once man who have really believed doe not lose by sudden blow firm conviction of soul when work have be once commenced when first step have be taken pace becomes frightfully fast three year since belief have be like ardour of young love now what be feeling men said that be infidel must deny with frigid precision with stiffest accuracy of language then argue that acknowledgment of superhuman creative power be not infidelity have god of own cold passionless prudent god same god said to whom others looked with only difference that when others looked with fanatic enthusiasm looked with well balanced reason be same god said a to saviour have good deal also to say on subject good deal might show that be not so far from others a others thought so must prove that be infidel must thus satisfy now that again heard psalm of youth remembered a listened that have lost for ever beauty have cost so dear did not now begin to think to feel perhaps rather than to think that after sound of church bell be cheering that be sweet to kneel there where others knelt sweet to hear voice of young child a uttered together response of service be so much wiser than others that must venture on own judgment to set apart to throw over a useless be to others so precious such be feeling a sat knelt stood there mechanically a be remembering old habit then tried to pray praying be by mean easiest work to man can set kneeling be easy repetition of well known word be easy putting on of solemnity of mind be perhaps not difficult to remember what be asking why be asking of whom be asking to feel sure that want what do ask that asking be best way to get on whole be not easy on occasion bertram probably found utterly beyond capacity declined to go to afternoon church be not held to be de rigueur even in parson house unless be among certain of strictly low church clergyman very high churchman may ask to attend at four o'clock of winter morning will not be grievously offended if on sunday afternoon prefer arm chair book probably of sermon be between conscience dined early in evening bertram host walked out hitherto have have little opportunity of conversation bertram longed to talk to one of be within breast on occasion however failed conversation will not always go exactly a one must have be glad to see at church to day said parson to tell truth did not expect hope be not intended a compliment to rather fear be arthur mean that went because did not like to displease by staying away something like said bertram affecting to laugh want mother sister either to regard a ogre in england at rate in country in england one be ogre if one doe go to church doe not much matter believe what one doe when one be there so long a one be quiet let parson have say there be nothing so easy a ridicule especially in matter of religion quite true then be again true that be very hard to laugh at anything be not in point ridiculous god worship be ridiculous pretence of worshipping god be so a be step from ridiculous to sublime a true worship of god be probably highest sublimity to man can reach so perhaps be never so absolutely absurd in such bathos of ridiculous a when pretend to do so effort must sometimes fall short of success will explain what mean said bertram attending more to than companion what idea of man can be so magnificent a represents with hand closed eye turned to heaven with hold communion imagine man so placed holding such communion will at once have run down whole gamut of humanity from st paul to pecksniff have nothing to do with belief be for man to take care that be if possible nearer to st paul than to pecksniff have nothing to do with belief be gauge only gauge have of what belief man have how many of who be sitting by silently while preached really believed hope trust firmly trust that be believer including wonder whether there be one one believer in called on to say that believed one for instance who belief in communion of saint one who belief in resurrection of body why must not believe in communion of saint what be difficulty very little certainly a belief go what call belief rumtunshid gara shushabad gerostophat be shibboleth of of caucasian tribe do believe in rumtunshid if will talk gibberish when talking on matter have rather change subject now be unreasonable want to have gibberish to yourself that must have to yourself in own pulpit accede to out here on heath surely may have turn believe in rumtunshid then why must farmer buttercup be called on to believe in communion of saint what doe believe about why must make little flora buttercup tell huge fib a to say that belief in resurrection of body be taught a necessary lesson will be explained to at proper age there be proper age for will never be explained to neither flora father will ever understand anything about will always believe be old enough to understand explain to one yet have ever attempted to do so yet education be not neglected wilkinson have too great fear of friend power of ridicule to venture on explanation so again suggested that must change subject be always way said bertram never knew clergyman who did not want to change subject when subject be one on must be ever willing to speak if there be anything that deem holy must not be willing to hear ridiculed there be much that deem holy for fear laughter be ready to defy ridicule if talk to of asceticism of stylite tell that admire will imitate will not then laugh at of course ridicule what think be false ridicule will run off truth like water from duck back come explain to about resurrection of body yet in flesh will see god said arthur in solemn tone say be impossible nothing be impossible with god yes be impossible that own great law must change be impossible that must remain yet not remain body that call body that flora buttercup belief to be body for in matter doe believe will turn through prolific chemistry of nature into various productive gas by other body will be formed with body will see christ with now carry that will carry when die for of course atom of body change little matter be sufficient for to believe a scripture teach yes if one must believe jew when drag dying limb to valley of jehoshaphat can believe in darkness know nothing of law of nature will go to people who be not in darkness if ask mother what mean when say 'not by confusion of substance by unity of person ' what will answer be subject will take time to explain yes think so time longer to understand wilkinson be determined not to be led into argument so remained silent bertram be also silent for awhile walked on content with own thought yet not content wilkinson must have be contented to be let alone to have mind faith hope left in repose nature education have prepared for be not so with bertram be angry with for not believing angry with others that did believe went on in way for ten minute then bertram began again ah must believe if be thing to come at a man wish who must doubt priest teacher of people who must make so easy will make so difficult so impossible belief at rate must be easy though practice may be hard must look to bible not to yes be there be stumbling block book be given to not over well translated from various language part of be history hyperbolically told for eastern language be hyperbolical part of be prophecy very meaning of be lost to by loss of thing be intended to be imaged out part of be thanksgiving uttered in language of men who knew nothing must understand nothing of rule by be to be governed be talking of old testament be given to a one whole then have story of mystery be above at least beyond utmost stretch of man comprehension very purport of be opposed to idea of justice in jurisprudence of heaven can that be just here on earth be manifestly unjust be faith in god so weak then reliance on so firm that can believe nothing beyond own comprehension believe much that understand believe distance of earth from sun believe that seed of man be carried in woman then brought forth to light living being understand principle of wondrous growth yet believe know that be from god can not believe that evil be good can not believe that man placed here by god will receive not receive future happiness a may chance to agree not to agree with certain doctor who somewhere about fourth century perhaps later have so much difficulty in coming to agreement on disputed subject think bertram that be going into matter know be not vital to faith in christian religion what be vital what be not if must only learn that always argue in circle be to have faith because of bible be to take bible through faith whence be first spring of faith to come where will find fountain head in prayer to god can pray without faith did man ever kneel before log ask log that might believe in log have no faith in log must be possible that must be seen there kneeling before have bible then for intrinsic evidence of truth yes most irrefragable evidence evidence that thinking man can possibly reject christ teaching word have there a coming from mouth be irresistible evidence of fitness to teach will permit to use such evidence must take from beginning of career before can look into intrinsic truth must be true to sun standing still upon gibeon le than divine wisdom showed that caesar tribute must be paid to caesar if man child be to select how will ever have creed if creed how will have church if church how then parson follow on come to in truth require too much so get nothing flock believe pray listen to be not in earnest in earnest heaven if

gone to room be again together bertram thought that must speak of caroline be again foiled there have be little bickering on part of mr wilkinson have be querulous have not cared to hide though george adela be sitting there a guest have made son unhappy now spoke of be sorry must hear mother speak in way george hope be not harsh to try to refrain from answering unless go back to round jacket take food from hand like child can not please perhaps be too careful to please think must let know to certain extent must be master in own house ah have given that up long since have idea that house be

did be certainly kind do blame never must have accepted living on term never never knew when did have never since ceased to repent so saying got up walked quickly about room must believe now mother take upon to tell in what way must read absolution feel injured because comply can tell of one remedy arthur can tell of one remedy take wife to yourself one who will not mind in what way read absolution to wife said wilkinson uttered long sigh a continued walk yes wife why not people say that country clergyman must never be without wife a for firmly think that be right curate be to marry

imputes blame to tried to love must not ah did love never almost shouted a said a did so stood across companion path never never loved know now what poor vile wretch be be think that most torment then walked on adela have come there expressly to speak to now be almost afraid to speak heart have be full of what must utter now utterance seemed to have left have intended to console did not dare to attempt there be depth almost sublimity about grief kept silent oh adela said if knew what be to have empty heart rather heart not empty must fain be empty that might again refill dear adela put out hand to take own hardly knew why let take hand dear adela have never sighed for comfort of empty heart probe wound to bottom may not search own did not answer be possible that must answer question eye became suffused with tear be unable to raise from ground must not recall hand not at moment have come there to lecture to talk to to comfort now be unable to say word did know secret of heart that secret once once have involuntarily broken from out lip have caroline told have be so false to friendship a false to friendship a have be to love adela adela must that have met earlier in life yes last word added after have quickly rescued hand from grasp very quickly withdrew now a quickly lifted up face all covered a be with tear endured full weight of gaze what be possible that knew how have

must have be impossible impossible way impossible be on side then have not that empty heart adela what else must make impossible mr bertram when came here have wish intention to talk about why not of a well a of say again must have met earlier might have be must have be saved from shipwreck will speak openly to adela why not added seeing that shrunk from seemed a though must move on quickly away from word mr bertram say that will be useless for to have said will not be useless be friend friend must understand other know how have loved caroline believe have loved do not oh yes do believe well

dissolved when have made most of world trading if love mr bertram be so bitter in speaking of bitter tell that think quite right in what doe if woman can not love what better can do than trade upon beauty there let go did not wish to speak of be very wrong in asking to walk with morning adela not wrong very very right there well will not ask for hand again though be in friendship in friendship will give stretched out hand to be ungloved very white fair prettier hand than even caroline must boast must not take must not lie to adela be broken hearted have loved have loved that woman with heart with very soul with utmost strength of whole being now have come to if know what broken heart mean have here yet yet yet oh adela must fain try yet once again can hing for nothing if world be there at foot wealth power glory to be have for stooping must not stoop to pick if must not share with friend adela be so sad to be alone yes be sad be not sadness lot of many of yes nature bid seek cure when cure be possible know what wish to understand mr bertram yes adela do think do think be honest open at rate strive to be so think do understand if do then cure seek be impossible ah be impossible be not angry with angry not angry be angry now if speak openly again thought thought fear that will pain care for pain if good can come of thought that also have be wounded in wood stricken hart lie down together lick other wound while herd roams far away from be so why do hear then 'of poor sequestered stag left abandoned of velvet friend ' mr bertram grief fear must still be solitary so unendurable god still temper wind to shorn lamb now a have ever done there be sudden cure for evil time will come when will be remembered not without sorrow with calm quiet mourning will be endurable when heart now not broken a say tortured will be able to receive other image that time can not come at once think be well that must wish who have courage to love must have courage to suffer yes yes yes if courage be wanting if one have not one can not have such courage for asking first weight of blow will stun sufferer know that mr bertram that dull dead deathly feeling will wear off at last have to work to read to write to study in respect men be more fortunate than be have must occupy thought adela speak of if be generous will not do so if have in way seemed to speak of be because have made unavoidable what god have given to bear be bearable though must that must have spared poor father so saying adela at last gave way to tear on subject might be allowed to weep bertram said nothing to disturb till be near house then again held out hand to a true friend hope a dear friend be not so said yes answered in lowest voice a dear friend remember that expect friend generosity friend forbearance so made way back to own room appeared at breakfast in usual sober guise with eye told tale on next morning took departure nearest station on railway by be to go to littlebath be distant about twelve mile be proposed that must be sent thither in mr wilkinson phaeton indeed except farm yard cart be only vehicle belonged to parsonage be low four wheeled carriage not very well contrived for accommodation of two moderate sized people in front of two immoderately small people on hind seat mr wilkinson habitually drove with one of daughter beside with two others two whose leg have be found by measurement to be shortest in durance vile behind when so packed be clear to men that capacity of phaeton be exhausted now first arrangement proposed be that arthur must drive phaeton that sophy must accompany adela to station sophy in so arranging have forgotten that friend have bag trunk bonnet box presence of at littlebath must be indispensable therefore at last moment when phaeton came to door with luggage fastened on hinder seat be discovered for first time sophy must be left behind arthur wilkinson must willingly have given up position george bertram must willingly have taken adela also must have be well pleased at such change though must have be pleased must not be effected vicar must not very well proclaim that a sister be not to accompany shield must not act a charioteer to miss gauntlet must lady object to be driven by host so at last started from vicarage door with many farewell kiss large paper of sandwich who be that consumes large packet of sandwich with parting guest be always laden imagine that station master dog be mainly fed upon first half mile be occupied on wilkinson part in little must be effort to make companion more comfortable shifted about into furthest corner so a to give more room pulled cloak out from under put over knee to guard from dust recommended three time to put up parasol then have word two to say to neighbour that only lasted a long a be in own parish then came to hill gave opportunity of walking on getting in again occupied minute in taking out watch assuring adela that must not be too late for train when be done necessity for conversation still remained have hardly be together thrown for conversation on other a now be since day when arthur have walked over for last time to west putford reader do remember hardly for have not fortune misfortune of more prominent hero intervened since chapter be before hope will find comfortable at littlebath said at last oh yes be will be when aunt come home will be at home then know will be time fear so dread greatly going to miss todd whom have never seen see dear miss baker must go back to hadley soon miss todd have certainly be very good natured in offering to take then there be silence lasted for about mile mother must have be very glad if must have stayed at parsonage till aunt return so must sister so must be very kind too kind said adela then came pause perhaps for quarter of mile be up hill work quarter of mile passed by very slowly seems so odd that must go away from whom have known so long to stay with miss todd whom never have even seen think change of scene will be good for mr wilkinson well perhaps so then other quarter of mile made away with come get along dumpling be said to fat steed for have now risen to level ground house know must be very stupid for be much changed from what be be not oh know yes be there be same spirit same good will miss father greatly ah yes can feel for there be loss great loss sometimes think unfortunate that mother must have remained at vicarage after father death have be very good to know have done best adela be first time have distinctly heard call by christian name since have come to stay with have failed be not happy there indeed for matter be man must be happy when doe duty none of do so thoroughly a to require other source of happiness go on dumpling do duty see that be very careful in doing yours perhaps will hardly believe wish lord stapledean have never given living well be difficult to believe that think what have be for sister know must have be very poor must not have starved have fellowship must have taken pupil be sure must have be happier then then well said adela a spoke heart be not quite at rest within breast then must have be free since took that living have be slave again paused moment whipped horse be only now for moment that be silent yes slave do not see what life live must be content to sacrifice to mother if sacrifice be understood see how be with nothing can do will satisfy yet for have sacrificed everything everything sacrifice be sacrifice if be agreeable sacrifice consists in being painful well suppose so say that to myself so often be only consolation have not that think home must be made uncomfortable to there be reason why must be at least must think not spoke with little spasmodic effort however did not betray to companion who seemed to to be almost more engaged with dumpling than with conversation certainly have be through wish of hers that be thus talking of household concern a be speaking of be forced into certain amount of hypocrisy be subject on must not speak openly there be then hill to be walked up adela thought there must be more of matter have come up by accident must now probably drop away whether by design from chance because other topic presented arthur went back to subject did so now in manner be peculiarly startling to miss gauntlet do remember calling once at west putford soon after got living be long time ago now suppose do remember yes do very well do remember what told then what be said adela clearly be duty of young lady on very many occasion to be somewhat hypocritical if there be man to whose happiness marriage be more necessary than to of be country clergyman yes can believe that be if there be not lady of own family living with know that make difference oh yes must make difference think that man must be very wretched who have one to look after house be that idea of excellence of wife must have expected something higher from adela suppose think then that if man have linen looked after dinner cooked be sufficient poor adela must be acknowledged that be hard on think that sufficient must seem so from what say then what said belied thought seems to mr wilkinson since drive to speak out that matter be very much in own hand be certainly free agent know better than can tell what duty to mother sister requires circumstance have made dependent on certainly be not man to disacknowledge burden certainly not certainly not having made up mind to must not be allow to be slave what can do mean that must be poor man be be to give up fellowship at same time take upon other care a well do a other poor men do know other man situated a be know men who be much worse situated a regard worldly mean be to give mother half of income must still presume be richer than mr young mr young be curate of neighbouring parish who have lately married on curacy will be said by critic especially by female critic that in saying adela went long way towards teaching mr wilkinson way to woo indeed brought that accusation against not lightly be a have expressed driven in cause of truth to say what have said did in heart of heart believe that mr wilkinson have thought of in saying what did say mind on matter have be long made up knew to be poor sequestered stag left abandoned by velvet friend have feeling in matter amounted to slightest hope have asked for counsel have given only counsel honestly must give therefore bear lightly on oh critic bear lightly on especially critic feminine to worst of wrath scorn willingly subject other lover with whom tale be burthened yes must be better off than young said wilkinson a though be speaking to be not point know have ever looked at exactly in light there be house parsonage mean be full of woman be thus irreverently that spoke of mother sister what other woman must come among oh be treasure for have to search said laughingly bitterness of day be over with at least then seemed so be not even thinking of herself when said must come to house adela mean to ask whether if a regard other circumstance be minded to marry must then be deterred by mother in law sister in law yes just so said wilkinson timidly well that must depend much upon how well might like gentleman something also upon how much might like lady man wife must always be mistress in own house oh yes of course mother be determined to be mistress in house well will not recommend to rebel against mother be that station mr wilkinson yes be station dear have forty minute to wait yet mind mr wilkinson will not in least dislike waiting by myself of course will see off dumpling wo run away may be sure of there be very little of runaway class to be found at hurst staple parsonage except adela call runaway hope run away from just when be beginning to feel comfort of being with there wo catch cold now so having thrown rug over dumpling back followed adela into station know anything so tedious a waiting at second class station for train there be lady waiting room into gentleman may not go gentleman waiting room in porter generally smoke refreshment room with dirty counter covered with dirtier cake there be platform walk up down till be tired go to ticket window dozen time for ticket having be warned by company bill that must be prepared to start at least ten minute before train be due man inside know better doe not open little hole to have to stoop head till two minute before time named for departure then there be five fat farmer three old woman butcher at aperture not finding equal to struggling among for place make up mind to be left behind at last however do get ticket just a train come up hearing that exciting sound nervously cram change into pocket without counting afterwards feel quite convinced that have lost shilling in transaction be somewhat in way that forty minute be passed by wilkinson adela nothing of moment be spoken between till took hand for last time adela then whispered to will think much of what have said to very much do so wish be not leaving wonder whether must be surprised if be to write to train be gone before have time to answer two day afterwards bertram also left arthur said a took leave of vicar if who have made mess of may give advice on subject must not leave adela gauntlet long at littlebath if be chapter xiii solicitor general in love caroline waddington be at hadley when received accepted proposal made to by sir henry harcourt may be conceived that affair be arranged without very great amount of romance sir henry indeed be willing in hurried manner to throw at lady foot to swear by fair hand that loved a man never yet have loved to go to work in fashion usually most approved by young lady in hurried manner say for just at moment be being made solicitor general have

alluded only to own virtue on fourth asked to be lady harcourt told that must be lady harcourt a far a be concerned there be end of for present then sir henry proposed that day must be named on subject also found ready to accommodate have coy scruple a to time suggested that must be before christmas very well let be before christmas christmas be cold time for marrying be to be cold marriage

be violating secrecy too much if suggested that george bertram have have slight partial success even when have such positive claim success have of course be in direct opposition to lady will miss baker have now gone back to littlebath to receive adela gauntlet because knew that must be more comfortable in own room than in uncle dismal house perhaps because sir lionel be there have however gone back caroline remained mistress for time of grandfather household old man now seemed to have dropped mystery in matter generally indeed spoke of caroline a miss waddington heard talked of a granddaughter without expressing anger with sir henry so spoke of appeared to be quite reconciled to marriage in spite of entreaty to george attempted bribery broken hearted sorrow when failed seemed to be now content indeed have made opposition to match when caroline have freely spoken to about made little snappish remark a to fickleness of woman at same time signified that must not object why must sir henry harcourt be in respect good match for granddaughter have often be angry with george bertram because george have not prospered in world sir henry have prospered signally must probably prosper much more signally might not be safely predicated of man who be solicitor general before be thirty that must be lord chancellor lord chief justice at rate very bigwig indeed before be fifty so of course mr bertram did not object have not signified acquiescence in very cordial way rich old men when wish to be cordial on such occasion have one way of evincing cordiality be not by pressure of hand by kind word by approving glance embrace conveys satisfaction warmest word if unsupported be very cold old man if intends to be cordial on occasion must speak of thousand of pound dear young fellow approve altogether will have twenty thousand pound day becomes yours then be hand shaken with true fervour then be real cordiality expressed felt what dear old man grandpapa be be there one like dear old duck be going to be so generous to harry mr bertram said nothing about twenty thousand pound nothing about ten nothing about money at till be spoken to on subject be sir henry special object not to be pressing on point to show that be marrying caroline without sordid view that admiration for mr bertram have bearing at on gentleman cash box did certainly make little feint at mr pritchett mr pritchett merely wheezed said nothing mr pritchett be not fond of harcourt interest seemed to care little for miss caroline now that have transferred affection be essentially necessary that sir henry harcourt must know what be to be done if be to have nothing be necessary that must know that have certainly counted on having something on having something immediately be thoroughly hard working man of business yet be not economical man man who life before world in london life chiefly among men of fortune can hardly be economical have not therefore large sum of money in hand be

of house be fashion know hope will excuse sir henry for not liking sir henry of course did excuse there be nothing liked so much a sitting cosy over dining room fire in about hour caroline did come

henry may have done before in line history say not man who be solicitor general at eight twenty can hardly have have time for much practice perhaps wanted caroline have have there have be walk a well a ride at littlebath walk also though perhaps of doubtful joy amidst graf below wall of jerusalem so started there be perhaps must say be for time railway straggling new suburban villa may now have destroyed there be be pretty woodland lane running from back of hadley church through last remnant of what once be enfield chase how many lover foot have crushed leaf used to lie in autumn along pretty lane well well there will not be word in strain speak solely now of time here present to sir henry former day former roamings there will be clean forgotten solicitor general now thither wends way love beauty attend upon foot see how open gate stand by churchyard paling doe stand there yet wonder well well will say doe be beautiful day for walk said sir henry yes very beautiful said caroline there be nothing be so fond of a long walk said gentleman be very nice said lady know care for going very far to day be not quite strong at present not strong solicitor general put on look of deep alarm oh there be nothing matter with be not quite strong for walking be out of practice boot be not quite of right sort hurt hope oh actually hurt will do very well for to day then there be short pause got on green grass run away into chase in front of parsonage window wonder whether wicket be ever standing there now on summer afternoon be soon a much alone nearly so a lover might wish to be quite enough so for caroline curious eye be still peeping doubt to see how great lawyer looked when be walking with girl of heart to see how rich miser granddaughter looked when be walking with man of heart perhaps voice be whispering that have changed lover for in rural seclusion everything be known by everybody peeper whisperer interfered with contentment of fortunate pair hope be happy caroline said sir henry a gently squeezed hand be so gently laid upon arm happy oh yes be happy believe know in great deal of very ecstatic happiness never did hope be rationally happy not discontented at rate not regretful hope believe that will do best very best to make happy oh yes quite believe that must think of other comfort after take be great thing in married life expect to be passionately in love with not a yet caroline let of expect that sir henry passionate love take rarely last long be very troublesome while doe last mutual esteem be very much more valuable caroline must have believe in love oh yes do believe in why else must wish to marry think too well of to feel strange that must love love with with also for future will be subordinate to other passion sir henry did not altogether like reference to past be conveyed in word future however bore without wincing know so thoroughly history of last three year continued that must be impossible for to deceive if must if know under circumstance must have done so have loved once good have come of be contrary to nature to do so to love in mad passionate self sacrificing manner yet did think may say with certainty never will be so foolish again have suffered lately caroline a sore still smart hardly yet know what happiness may be in store for yes have suffered felt from touch on arm that whole body shuddered walked on in silence for awhile considering within why must marry girl rejected of former lover who now hung upon arm be now at very fullest tide of prosperity have everything to offer mother wish for daughter daughter wish for have income rank name youth talent why must fling rich treasure at foot of proud minx who in taking swore that must not love must not be better for to recede word well knew must do for pride be true pride felt in heart that be not assumed have only to say that be not contented with cold lack of love must simply desire to lead back to home leave there must be easy enough for to get head from out noose be very easiness perhaps made hesitate knew own price be not at anxious to dispose of cheap bargain if sir have horse to sell never appear anxious for sale that rule be well understood among who deal in horse if madam have daughter to sell will be well for also to remember young friend if have to sell same rule hold good be hard to put old head on young shoulder hard a task be however must seem to have be effected a regard caroline waddington then sir henry looked at not exactly with present eyesight a then at moment existing for seeing that be walking by side must not take comprehensive view taste mind required looked at searchingly with eyesight of memory found that exactly tallied with what judgment demanded that be very beautiful man have ever doubted that be now in full pride of beauty be to certain then beauty be of goddess class seems for so long period to set year at defiance be produced by girlish softness by perishable mixture of white red be not born of sparkling eye ripe lip cherry cheek to face belonged line of contour severe lovely of ineradicable grace be not when smiled laughed that most pleased did not charm only when spoke though indeed expression of speaking face be perfect have beauty of marble bust must not be easy even for sir henry harcourt even for young solicitor general to find face more beautiful with to adorn drawing room then have that air of fashion that look of being able to look down unfashionable be so much in eye of sir henry though in of george bertram have be almost demerit with caroline a with many woman be appearance rather than reality have not moved much among high people have not taught to despise of own class woman of littlebath todd adela gauntlet looked a though must be able to do so be fitting must have look if ever be to be wife of solicitor general then sir henry thought of mr bertram coffer ah if must only be let into secret might be easy to come to decision that old man have quarrelled with nephew be well aware that george in pig headed folly must make overture towards reconciliation of also be sure be not probable that at rate great portion of almost fabulous wealth must go to man granddaughter there be doubtless risk then one must run risk in everything might be if must play card wisely that must get that must be placed in position to make even solicitor generalship beneath notice so in spite of caroline coldness resolved to persevere having thus made up mind turned conversation to subject liked house on whole did caroline during past week have be up to see new house in eaton square oh yes very much nothing must be nicer only be afraid be expensive be subject on caroline must talk to not particularly said sir henry of course one ca get house in london for nothing will have rather bargain of if can pay money down great thing be whether like be charmed with never saw prettier drawing room never bedroom for london house be so large airy did go into dining room oh yes went in there room for four twenty be there not well know ca give opinion about must have three time that number at supper be not thinking of supper be sure must kitchen convenient eh very so at least aunt mary said now about furniture can give two three day in town ca oh yes if require must trust taste in matter taste have taste time if wo mind going to so conversation went on for fifteen minute then be at home caroline boot have begun to tease walk therefore have not be prolonged to great distance ah again say how pleasant how delightful be lover walk then caroline went up to bedroom sir henry sat down near mr bertram chair in dining room wanted to speak to sir said rushing at once into midst of subject about caroline settlement be time that must be arranged must have made lawyer see pritchett know pritchett have authority to act for in such matter act for pritchett have authority to act have little renunciation of granddaughter affair be more than sir henry expected be therefore surprised disgusted well only want to know who have authority anticipate great difficulty caroline fortune be not very large of course must be settled six thousand pound believe four sir henry be if be rightly informed four be be told six think by george bertram in former day must of course prefer six if be only four why must make best of have only four of own said old man somewhat mollified have objection to telling must propose to do objection in life sir henry income be large want little ready money at present to conclude purchase of house to furnish must object to four thousand pound being paid into hand if insure life for six for benefit be fortune larger must of course propose that insurance must be heavier sir henry be so very reasonable that mr bertram by degree thawed must make granddaughter fortune six thousand a have always intended must be settled on income of course going to husband must insure life for four thousand more on behalf mr bertram must lend sir henry three thousand for furniture sir henry agreed to saying to that loan from mr bertram be equal to gift mr bertram seemed to look at in different light mind sir henry will expect interest to day will only charge four per cent must be made bond debt oh certainly said sir henry so affair of settlement be arranged chapter xiv mr leake of rissbury adela gauntlet reached littlebath without adventure at station met miss baker ready to take box in charge soon learned what be to be fate for autumn be imperatively necessary that miss baker must go up to town in week two there be such hundred of thing to be done about furniture that know said miss baker looking rather grand a spoke of niece great match yet doing so with least possible amount of intentional pride vanity adela of course acknowledged that there must be hundred of thing expressed deepest regret that must be so much in way perhaps almost wished that have remained at hurst staple not at in way dear said miss baker will be back again in week at furthest miss todd will be delighted to have for time indeed must be very much disappointed now offended too if did not go same must not leave only that sir henry insists that caroline must choose thing of course have not time to go with then responsibility be so great why suppose will have to lay out about two thousand pound what sort of person be miss todd asked adela oh extremely nice person will like amazingly so lively so good natured so generous very clever too perhaps for age be little too fond too fond of what be going to say dress suppose indeed ca say that there be anything to blame for in dress very handsomely always plain what be going to say be that perhaps for woman of age be little too fond of gentleman attention caroline told that be most confirmed old maid knew old maid who gloried in being old maid know about dear if certain gentleman be to ask think 'd glory in much longer be very nice person will like very much miss baker did go up to town leaving adela to miss todd hospitality did go up in doing so resolved to return a soon a possible sir lionel be now in paragon nearly other day to be sure did generally call in montpellier terrace on alternate day then there be reason for have to talk about george caroline what possible reason must there be for going to paragon adela be rather frightened when found left at miss todd lodging though lady manner to be not such a need have inspired much awe now dear said mind in least do just whatever like if only knew what did like must have if must get be fond of now will ask young people here to night oh miss todd not for have never be much in society certainly wish for at present well society be not bad thing play card suppose know one card from 'd just suit mr o'callaghan then be fond of young clergyman there be one here might just suit young lady be dying for then pray let interfere with miss todd perhaps like officer better there be heap of here know where come from never seem to have anything to do young lady however who run after mr o'callaghan seem to think very nice oh miss todd want clergyman officer well then will get novel from circulating library at three o'clock always drive out will go to pastrycook oh declare here be sir lionel bertram a usual know sir lionel adela said that have met sir lionel at miss baker what pity match must

going out will tell what will take care of be beautiful day if miss gauntlet like will walk instead of having fly miss todd never aped grandeur always called private carriage fly because have only one horse sir lionel having made salutation to miss gauntlet declared that must be most happy to be trusted with custody through street of littlebath ca walk either miss gauntlet to day because must call on old mr leake at rissbury quite forgot mr leake so see sir lionel sha want after sir lionel declared that last decision made quite miserable will be recovered by dinner time doubt said miss todd now will go upstairs put bonnet on a miss gauntlet have got hers can stay talk to charming creature miss todd be said sir lionel before door be well closed such freshness of character so much bonhommie little odd sometimes last word be not added till miss todd footstep heavier than camilla be heard well up stair seems to be very good natured person never saw before to day did not knew very intimately in holy land a if land ever be must be holy to sir lionel such a be george caroline of course know about miss waddington adela signified to that did know circumstance to alluded be very sad be not then connection between being so near being joint heir to enormous property know people here take caroline part say that have be hardly used can not say that blame george can not indeed be one of case in one must be blamed exactly be just what say advice to george be let money influence conduct in way thank god there be enough of for of have to think of be happiness own be what said do believe took advice think have sordid view with reference to caroline fortune be sure have not oh never what sir henry view may be pretend to know people here do say that have be ingratiating with brother for time past have leave miss gauntlet be old man old enough to be father well preserved old beau might have said grandfather experience of life be that money be never worth trouble that men take to get say brother be fond of if so think have made mistake in life great mistake sounded very nice even to adela inexperienced ear be not like ring of genuine silver after mock virtue imposes on few people man of world be personally known for such a also be known cruel griping avaricious unjust enables avaricious unjust to pas scatheless through world be not ignorance of world a to sin indifference of world whether be sinful now sir lionel may just put into fly then wo keep longer said miss todd a re entered room with bonnet shawl mr leake who lived at rissbury be deaf old lady not very popular among other old lady at littlebath world of course know that village of rissbury be hardly more than suburb of littlebath being distant from high street not above mile half will be remembered that second milestone on hinchcombe road be altogether beyond village just a begin to ascend hill near turnpike mr leake be not very popular seeing that though ear be excessively dull tongue be peculiarly acute have repute of saying most biting thing of lady in littlebath many of lady of littlebath be apt to say biting thing then mr leake did not play card did give supper add much in way to happiness of other lady compatriot lived in rather grand house of own whereas others lived in lodging kept carriage with pair of horse whereas others kept fly have mysterious acquaintance with countyocracy went long way with lady of littlebath though what good even did to mr leake be never very apparent be terrible bore to have to talk to people who use speaking trumpet who be so fidgety that wo use speaking trumpet properly miss todd greatly dreaded speaking trumpet did not usually care one straw for mr leake tongue much for carriage horse county standing littlebath world called on mr leake miss todd being at rome did a roman do will take for five minute said miss todd a driving through village of rissbury finished description of lady then do take up for five more then will go on again then will go away adela agreed though with heavy heart for what subject of conversation must find on to dilate to mr leake through speaking trumpet for five minute miss who said mr leake putting trumpet down from ear that might stare better at adela oh miss gaunt very well hope will like littlebath miss gaunt miss gaunt let shouted miss todd with voice must have broken trumpet into shiver have not be made of very best metal never hollo dear when do ca hear at only make noise like dog barking will find young men about littlebath very good natured miss gaunt be rather empty headed think young lady generally like better for adela felt called on to make answer to a be not turn at trumpet what news have heard lately mr leake asked miss todd great thing be to make mr leake talk instead of having to talk to amuse think do amuse one very much then be not line suppose can dance most of who have got money may do for husband a world go mu be too particular must miss gaunt miss gaunt let whispered miss todd into trumpet separating sound well so that must not clash on unsusceptible tympanum of friend ear let let let think can hear anybody almost better than can miss todd know how be never can hear people out of town a well a can own set be habit take be used to deaf people in country suppose said miss todd who with good nature did choose to be over much put upon ah ca hear said mr leake have however heard want to tell something about caroline waddington be true be got lover already oh quite true be going to be married want to be married yes doubt want to be married be what want only be not able to manage have have have beg pardon miss gaunt old woman must have joke about young one must miss todd mr leake be be past seventy whereas dear miss todd be only just forty four miss gauntlet can tell about miss waddington said miss todd in very plainest voice be very great friend correspond with other so miss todd handed over spout of trumpet be corresponding with dare say be with dozen at once do know anything about miss gaunt poor adela what be to say do hand absolutely trembled a put lightly to instrument thrice bent head down before be able to say anything thrice lifted up in despair be lady gentleman be friend of yours dear of gentleman hope have not robbed of beau miss waddington be very dear friend of mine ma'be oh be be know mr bertram also be dear friend too well suppose be disengaged now tell be got nothing eh really know be very hard to know very much admire such jilt miss waddington did not jilt madam then jilted be just what want to come at be very much obliged to dear see can tell about be about money be no shouted adela with energy that quite surprised money have nothing to do with did not say have anything to do with take up habit of holloing from miss todd suppose truth be that found out what be meant to find out men must be too inquisitive must miss todd be quite right miss gaunt have anything to do with be bad affair think be very much mistaken madam said adela again shouting be thrown away ca hear word when hollo in way not word said mr leake then adela with imploring look at miss todd relinquished seat miss todd rose with usual little speech about leave taking have a have seen intended to have gone in for second inning hope of winning game against mr leake be over even courage be nearly upset so making little whisper to adela held out hand to old lady prepared to depart dear be in great hurry to go said mr leake yes be rather in hurry morning said miss todd neglectful of trumpet have so many people to see well good bye be very much obliged to for coming miss todd here mr leake affected to whisper whisper must have be audible to dozen have dozen be there must forget to wish joy about sir lionel good morning to miss gaunt then mr leake dropt old fashioned gracious curtsy to say that miss todd blushed must be to belie general rosiness of lady complexion be blush always over face colour of highest be always flying be not only that cheek carried settled brilliant tint at smile miss todd be ever smiling tint must suffuse forehead neck at peal of laughter peal of laughter be innumerable must become brighter brighter coming going rather ever coming fresh never going till reflection from countenance must illumine whole room light up face of around now almost blushed black have delighted hitherto in little bit of libellous tittle tattle to position a young old maid have given rise have affected always to assist propagation there be poison about old female snake sting in tongue of old adder reached even old fool said miss todd by mean sotto voce mr leake heard though speaking trumpet be not in action said in most good natured voice think be such fool at of course be old in want of income doubt then be knight know dear colonel then two lady waiting for further courtesy went back to fly miss todd have quite regained good humour by time be seated well said what do think of friend mr leake what make so very spiteful asked adela why see dear 'd be nothing if be spiteful be fate be very old life there by herself doe go out much have nothing to amuse if did do must do anything rather like well ca say like said adela then sat silent for time miss todd while reflecting whether must in way defend from imputation about sir lionel see what sort of woman be miss gauntlet of course must not believe word that say how very dreadful oh doe not mean anything call white lie nobody notice what said about sir lionel know really will not think of anything said must explain to said miss todd in whose mind in spite of blushing certain amount of pleasure be mixed with displeasure mr leake scandal have caused for at moment sir lionel be not little thought of at littlebath among lucretias there assembled there be many one who must have felt small regret in abandoning maiden meditation at instance of sir lionel bertram must explain to sir lionel doe come to see very often must think there be something in rather must be surprised at others thinking so only that be quite sure that be thinking of somebody else be asked adela perhaps not with great deal of animation yes will tell who that somebody else be mind must say anything about if be sure be almost sure for one never can be quite sure about anything then think one ought to talk about people oh be very well then at place a littlebath one must have to hold one tongue altogether let people talk of so talk about ca live without dear say thing like mr leake be sure now about sir lionel ca guess who be how must miss todd know person in littlebath except miss baker there now have guessed knew must say told miss baker marry sir lionel yes miss baker marry sir lionel why not why must why must think must be very wise think sort of marriage often make people very happy do think love said adela whose idea of marriage be of very primitive description well see why must that be in sort of way wo write poetry about eyebrow if mean that think 'd like to keep house for now caroline be going away think 'd like to have one to live with be not born to be solitary wild beast a be adela be surprised have nothing to say be aware of reason suited to allege why miss baker must not marry sir lionel bertram have be asked before must have said that miss baker seemed settled in maiden life that be little likely to be moved by civil speech of old military beau silence be perhaps more prudent therefore said nothing fortnight with miss todd passed without much inconvenience to have to sit out one two card party to resist at last with peremptory decision host attempt to take elsewhere miss todd be so truly kind so generous so fond of making others happy that won upon adela at last parted excellent friend be so fond of miss baker miss todd said on last morning do so truly hope will be happy say word about what be saying only watch if be true will see quite a much of sir lionel there a have here so parted adela be transferred over to montpellier terrace there have be probability that caroline must return to littlebath with aunt such be not case autumn be advancing to close be now november hardly month remained before may say happy day on miss waddington be to become lady harcourt there be a miss baker said so much to do so little time to do have therefore be decided that caroline must not return to littlebath have come back only on account said adela not at must have come back way for many reason like to see mr bertram from time to time especially now that have acknowledged caroline must kill to stay long at house did see much of sir lionel while be at miss todd good deal said adela who must hardly keep from smiling a answered question be always there believe idea be that mean to make match of be indeed oh think that now well have be in house must have seen great deal what else can bring there so much miss todd say be always talking about about what nonsense miss baker went up to room rather better pleased than have be caroline a will be remembered have written to adela with tidings of new engagement adela have answered that letter affectionately shortly wishing friend happiness saying what little in cheerful vein must allow to say on such occasion very shortness of letter have conveyed condemnation that adela must not help caroline have expected condemnation knew that must be condemned either by word by lack of be nearly equal to by mind be in state that having half condemned must have given anything for cordial acquittal from one loved valued did not expect from adela did not receive carried with brave face however to grandfather to miss baker to betrothed showed sign of sorrow sign of repentance though there be perhaps repentance in heart there be much sorrow much remorse must not keep wholly silent wrote again to adela almost imploring for pity need not give whole letter portion of will show how poor girl mind be at work know have judged found guilty said can tell that from tone of letter though be generous enough to endeavour to deceive have condemned because know feel sure that what be doing be prudent think may say right have refused sir henry offer other such offer offer to must have be must have be open to same objection what must have done what must have be career be not now speaking of happiness of what use must have be to one will say that love sir henry have told that in usual acceptation of word love esteem high quality will marry with full intention of doing duty of sacrificing to if need be of being useful in position in will place what better can do than can do better adela know will do better to have loved married for love poorest gentleman on god earth must be to have done better can not do now power of doing have be taken from question with be whether must be useful a wife useless a unmarried woman for useless must have be petulant wretched employment work duty will now save from dear adela try to look at in way if be possible throw over without attempt be unmerciful at rate ended letter by saying at rate will come to in london in early early spring say that will do so will think that mean to abandon altogether adela answered a sweetly a delicately a must nature said be different must be presumptuous in to set up a judge on friend conduct must abstain from doing so must pray to god caroline sir henry might be happy together a to going to london in spring must do so if aunt penelope plan must allow of must of course be governed by aunt penelope who be now hurrying home from italy on purpose to give home nothing further occurred year at littlebath sufficiently memorable to need relation unless be necessary further to relate miss baker nervous apprehension respecting sir lionel be in truth so innocent that must have revealed day to young friend inmost secret of heart if have have secret in truth have none be desperately jealous of miss todd knew not why asked manner of question a to going coming never asked why be so anxious about be in twitter of sentimental restlessness did not understand cause of own uneasiness on day sir lionel came to be happy in good spirit when however went to miss todd be fretful sometimes must rally on admiration for rival did with bad grace wit repartee sarcasm be by mean forte must not have stood up for five minute against deaf old mr leake when tried hand on sir lionel failure be piteous merely amounted to gentle rebuke to for going to paragon instead of coming to montpellier terrace adela saw saw also that sir lionel be in way sincere what must do what must say hope miss todd be quite well yesterday sir lionel miss baker must say think there be much matter with sir lionel must answer be talking great deal about while be with about be sure have something better than to talk of there must be nothing better gallant colonel must say oh must there when be to be adela here be most anxious to know how can say so miss baker know be not anxious at well if be not be hope will be asked have have have why did not sir lionel make up mind put end in one way other to torment of poor lady many reason guided in high policy in first place must not make

will return to again in meantime must go back to hadley two old bertrams dear miss baker marriage feast prepared by miss baker for wedding guest did not occupy very long be there great inducement for assembled to remain with mr bertram miss baker soon found again alone be sooner alone than business of life recommenced be very splendid match for said mr bertram yes suppose be said miss baker miss baker in heart of heart have never quite approved of marriage now mary what do mean to do oh will see get thing taken away said yes yes stop minute be of course what mean be what do mean to do with ca go back live at littlebath alone if be to use word flabbergasted a expressing miss baker immediate state of mind must draw down on just anger of critic in have condescended to use of slang what other word will so well express what be meant have fully intended to go back to littlebath have intended to do so at earliest moment must be possible be not sir lionel still at littlebath moreover fully intended to live there that must have little difficulty in matter have anticipated own income that be indefeasibly own be very small by far too small to admit of permanently keeping on room in montpellier terrace hitherto income own caroline put together have be very comfortable for mr bertram have annually paid to sum of must have be sufficient for own living have not known what difference caroline marriage might make in allowance have be given to herself without specification that have be so given for purpose yet have be understood thing that caroline be to live with be supported though caroline income have also be used have gone rather in luxurious enjoyment than in necessary expense in keep of horse for instance in journey to jerusalem in new grand piano such like now there might naturally be doubt whether under altered circumstance allowance from mr bertram must remain unaltered have never occurred to that must be asked to live at hadley that idea did now occur to therefore stood before uncle hesitating in answer may inability to select better word be taken in excuse flabbergasted in mind feeling doom followed quickly on hesitation because said mr bertram there be plenty of room here there can be need of two house two establishment now have better send for thing fix here at once must leave room at littlebath without quarter notice coward plea long day lord long day be particularly understood when got so cheap there will be difficulty in reletting at time of year growled mr bertram oh suppose not one must have to pay something of course dear one can hardly leave place where one have lived so long of moment why not demanded tyrant well know can hardly say why not one have so many people to see so many thing to do so much to pack up may be easily conceived that in such encounter miss baker must not achieve victory have spirit for fight power to use even have spirit be there effected compromise by very dint of own weakness yes certainly said a mr bertram thought best must be very happy to live with at hadley most happy of course might go down pack up thing settle with everybody say good bye to friend oh friend horrible miss todd thus got month of grace be to go down immediately after christmas day be up again at hadley fixed there permanently before end of january wrote to caroline on subject rather plaintively owning that be of course duty to stay by uncle now that be so infirm must be very dull of course said place must be dull now that caroline be gone must be sad giving up old friend named one two among sir lionel must be great pleasure to went on to say if must be mean of reconciling two brother not what sir henry harcourt will always be mr bertram favourite be sure of think will mind leaving miss todd though doe pretend to be so friendly be never quite sure be sincere then doe talk so very loud in spite of say be not sure be not looking out for husband then went back to littlebath intent on enjoying short reprieve something might happen did not ask what old gentleman might not last long certainly did not speculate on death have sort of idea that there might be though never allowed to dwell on a reality on one point did make up mind that if must be destiny to keep house for of two gentleman must much rather keep house for sir lionel than for brother absolute money dealing have always be with mr pritchett a passed through town mr pritchett came to made usual quarterly payment mr pritchett said be going to live with mr bertram after month so oh ma'be yes ma'be will be very proper ma'be always supposed must be so when miss caroline be gone said pritchett in melancholy tone will be proper for to have money now oh yes ma'be must be duty to stop payment till get order mr bertram never forgets anything ma'be if 'd meant to stop must have forgot to say so oh very well mr pritchett miss baker be going away one word if please ma'be detain ma'be do might have guessed by pritchett voice that be quite willing to let go if wished even though own death on spot might be instant result oh dear mr pritchett said miss baker see how thing have gone ma'be now about miss caroline mean yes be lady harcourt now oh yes know that ma'be mr pritchett here sank to lowest bathos of misery know be lady harcourt very well did mean ladyship disrespect oh dear of course not mr pritchett who must think thing of who be known from baby yes have know 'd from babby ma'be be just have know 'd from amost babby too ma'be be very long time ago mr pritchett yes be year now certainly miss baker be not so young a be know that mr pritchett voice at juncture must have softened heart of stone have one be what be ma'be be going to live with old gentleman now yes believe be well now about mr george ma'be mr george yes mr george miss baker ai of course for to say anything of what go on between young lady young gentleman know anything about never did suppose never will now two be to have be one now be two mr pritchett must not get on further without pausing for breath match be broken off know be broke off say nothing about about who did know nothing therefore say nothing do say that will be very hard very hard very cruel if so that old gentleman be set against mr george because sir henry harcourt have got handle to name for conference ended in promise on miss baker part that at least must say nothing against mr george with assurance also that be impossible for to say anything in favour may be sure of mr pritchett that uncle will never consult about money will never consult human being ma'be must consult solomon if solomon be to go to hadley o ' purpose might slip in word that mr george be not in fault might ma'be miss baker reiterated promise that must not at rate say anything evil of george bertram be such foolish young man ma'be so like baby about money be be why feel for because be so foolish then miss baker prosecuted journey reached littlebath in safety have not be long there before sir lionel have heard news miss baker without knowing that process of pumping have be applied to soon made understand that for present sir harcourt have certainly not be received into place of heir be clear that very moderate amount of old gentleman wealth be usually now called old gentleman by sir lionel miss baker mr pritchett others have be bestowed on rising lawyer that a far a point be concerned game be still open then if be open to sir lionel through miss baker be also open to son george appeared from miss baker testimony that during whole period of wedding doings word have escaped mouth of old gentleman in vituperation anger against george perhaps george after might be best card oh what excellent card might be if must only consent to guide by commonest rule of decent prudence then a mr pritchett have truly observed mr george be so foolish moreover sir lionel be not blind to reflection that old gentleman must never countenance marriage with miss baker mr bertram good intention miss baker ward might be must undoubtedly be frustrated by such marriage if sir lionel decided on miss baker thing must be so arranged that marriage must be postponed till tedious old gentleman must move off scene tedious old gentleman moreover must not be allowed to know anything about with miss todd there need be secrecy drawback delay drawback that of doubtful reception after reception of doubtful masterdom on thorough review of circumstance much balancing in high mind sir lionel at last thus resolved must throw heart fortune at foot of miss todd if there accepted must struggle with muscle of manhood be yet within for supremacy in purse power of law of right belongs to man thought knew that must not be easy for woman to get better of if there rejected must not confess what there be doubt must immediately fall back upon miss baker did must be done immediately for in le than month time miss baker must be out of reach altogether a to seeking miss baker at hadley must be above even courage must be done within next month if on miss baker be to fall honour of being lady bertram must not only receive within month having done so must also agree to

day victory must make even mr shortpointz serviceable when gentleman past sixty make love to lady past forty may be supposed that be not so dilatory in proceeding a younger swain younger maiden time be then behind not before urge on to quick decision may be presumed moreover that pair knew own mind how cruel be to yesterday said sir lionel seating not very close to yet very far from what about poor mr shortpointz have have have poor old lady did think so be sure one ought to be of use sometimes know sir lionel true true miss todd quite true be particularly unfortunate yesterday wished that

conscious probably that ardent young evangelical clergyman be generally in want of income mr o'callaghan shouted miss todd throwing up head with scorn pho gentleman speak of must have made lady lady now who do think be miss baker oh must guess at said poor miss baker now knew that be sir lionel might have be worse however that felt much worse be sir lionel bertram asked other ah miss gauntlet know about gentleman of littlebath can see that be sir lionel be that triumph refused asked miss penelope of course did mean to say that think must have accepted to miss penelope made answer opinion be of mixed sort partly misbelieved miss todd partly wondered at unmarried lady of certain age may be own feeling in regard to matrimony on own behalf seem always impressed with conviction that other lady in same condition must certainly marry if got opportunity miss penelope must not believe that miss todd have rejected sir lionel at same time must not be startled also by great fact of such rejection at rate course of duty be open littlebath must be enlightened on subject before drawing room candle be lit that evening at rate set in littlebath to belonged so rose from chair declaring that have sat unconscionable time with miss baker departed diligent about work well what do think of dear said miss todd a soon a two of be left alone be strange that miss todd who be ordinarily so good natured who be so especially intent on being good natured to miss baker must have thus roughly communicated to friend tidings be sure to wound have omitted to look at in light intention have be to punish sir lionel for having be so grossly false grossly foolish have seen through at least hardly through have seen at least that must have be doubting between two lady that have given up one whom believed to be poorer did not imagine possible that after having offered to must then go with similar offer to miss baker have idea arisen in mind must certainly have allowed miss baker to take chance of promotion unmolested miss baker gave long sigh now that miss gauntlet be gone felt better able to speak nevertheless speech on subject be difficult to kind heart at once forgave miss todd there must now be marriage between false one friend therefore if ice must only get broken must not be unwilling to converse upon subject how to break ice always thought must at last said did said miss todd well certainly used to come there never knew why sometimes thought be to talk about oh said miss baker plaintively gave encouragement none used to send here there anything to get rid of sometimes thought then miss todd hesitated thought what asked miss baker well want to be ill natured sometimes thought that wanted to borrow money did exactly know how to begin to borrow money have once borrowed money from miss baker well know only say thought so never did miss baker sighed again then there be slight pause in conversation miss todd well dear do think that think what speak out dear may before if have got secret will keep oh have got secret only do think that sir lionel be be poor that must want to borrow money well poor hardly know what call poor know that be distressed man suppose have good income little ready money must perhaps set up there be doubt about being over head ear in debt suppose seemed to throw new unexpected light on miss baker mind thought be always so very respectable said hum m m said miss todd who knew world eh said miss baker who did not depends on what one mean by respectable said miss todd really thought be so very hum m m m repeated miss todd shaking head then there be little conversation carried on between lady so entirely sotto voce that reporter of scene be unable to hear word of must see that miss todd bore by far greater part in at end of miss baker gave longer deeper sigh know dear said miss todd in most consolatory voice word be distinctly audible nothing doe man of sort so much good a marrying doe asked miss baker certainly if wife know how to manage then miss todd departed leaving miss baker with much work for thought female friend miss baker have quite forgiven felt that must never quite forgive to have deceived so said to herself recurring to old idea of great respectability nevertheless be probably other sin rankled deepest in mind of miss baker may be said that have hardly touched pitch at rate that have not defiled sir lionel be somewhat ill at ease a walked from paragon to livery stable have certainly looked upon success with miss todd a by mean sure nevertheless be disappointed let of in attempt that may make convince with ever so much firmness that will fail yet be hardly le down hearted when failure come assure that be not sanguine assure falsely be man nature to be sanguine nature perhaps greatest privilege sir lionel a walked along began to fear that own scruple must now stand in way of other marriage of second string to bow when in making little private arrangement within own mind have decided that if miss todd rejected must forthwith walk off to miss baker never occurred to that own feeling must militate against proceeding such be now absolutely fact having talked about dear sarah found that even must have difficulty in bringing to utterance of dear mary went to bed however night with comfortable reflection that such nonsense must be dissipated by morning when morning came morning one pm feeling found be same must not see miss baker day be disgusted disappointed with have flattered that be gifted with greater firmness now that found so wanting in strength of character fretted fumed a men will do even at own fault swore to that must go to morrow that evening went to bed early trying to persuade that indigestion have weakened did great injustice however to a fine set of internal organ a ever blessed man of sixty at two o'clock next day dressed for campaign in montpellier terrace when dressed be again disorganised found that must not do told over over again that with miss baker there need be doubt at least must accept have only to smile there must smile again have only to say dear mary soft eye must be turned to ground battle must be won still must not do be sick be ill must not eat breakfast looked in glass found to be yellow wrinkled wizened be not half there be yet three week before miss baker must leave littlebath be on whole better that little arrangement must be made immediately previous to departure must leave littlebath for ten day return new man so went up to london bestowed time upon son at end of ten day much of repugnance have worn off still sound of word sarah peal of laughter followed rang in ear that utterance of verbiage of love be disagreeable task for gentleman of year have tried found very disagreeable must save repetition of nuisance write to did so letter be not very long said nothing about mary in contented with calling dearest friend few word be sufficient to make understand what meant few word be there merely added caution that for sake matter have better not at present be mentioned to anybody miss baker when received letter have almost recovered equanimity hers have be soft gentle sorrow have have fit of bursting grief wailing have be neither loud hysterical gentle soft faint tinge of melancholy have come upon so that have sighed much a sat at solitary tea have allowed novel to fall uncared for to ground must not be well for said to herself more than once to go to hadley must not change be well for felt now that caroline absence be heavy blow to that must be well that must leave littlebath be astonishing how affair of miss todd reconciled to future home then when be thus tranquil thus resigned thus happy came tremendous letter upsetting peace of mind throwing into new maze of difficulty have never said to herself at time that if sir lionel did propose must accept have never questioned a to probability of such event that must have accepted fortnight ago there can be doubt what be to do now be not only that sir lionel have made tender of hand to lady ten twelve day since to must be added fact that littlebath knew that have done so miss todd after first ebullition of comic spleen have not said much about miss p gauntlet tongue have not be idle perhaps have told only to godly godly let be ever so exclusive must have intercourse with wicked world thus lady in littlebath now knew about then there be other difficulty whispered conversation still rang in ear be not quite sure how far might be mission to reclaim man a sir lionel new sir lionel whom miss todd have described then too be in want of money why be in want of money be there not something also to be said on other side be reported that unmarried lady such a miss baker generally regret forlornness of own condition if

littlebath did influence dear lady must prefer name of lady bertram to of miss baker for remainder of term of year allotted to must please to walk into room a married woman to quit herself of disgrace injustice prejudice folly of own sex rather than of other have so cruelly attached to present position then to be lady bertram there be few angel at time in littlebath miss baker be not one of have taint of vanity in composition doubt if such female vanity must exist in human breast in more pardonable form than did in hers then perhaps plan of marrying might have wished for effect on sir lionel way of living how desirable be must not be splendid work for to reclaim lost colonel might not be duty to marry with special object there certainly did appear to be difficulty a to money if a miss todd assured sir lionel be really in difficulty own present annuity that must absolutely call own one hundred eighty nine pound seventeen shilling threepence per annum must not help much sir lionel be

sin did condemn found that uncle have be right that sir lionel be man whom must in wise respect must hardly love money perceived be father desire must therefore give what money must spare must not

have left to brilliant joy be not explained long even before christianity be in vogue quos deus vult perdere prius dementat whom god will confound first maddens nothing must exceed bland friendship winning manner frank courtesy of sir henry said little about what be past little went to show that have be blessed with hand of caroline waddington only because bertram have rejected that blessing a not worthy acceptance great man a be almost humbled before bertram talent spoke of mutual connection at hadley a though two be heir of right a though right be equal then ended by begging that might still be friend career must be widely different said bertram somewhat touched by tone yours will be in light mine must be in dark most men who do good live in dark for period of life said harcourt too have have dark day doubtless will have again neither with with will endure long bertram thought that harcourt knew nothing about sneered when successful man talked of dark day what darkness have

pleased also that must wish to do so have thought no most distant thought that must ever now be more to than wife of acquaintance whom did not love too well yet there be in heart fragment of half satisfied vanity at hearing that did look forward to see once again how will speak of such wish on part caroline husband have said to at breakfast will be nonsense for george bertram to keep up kind of quarrel hate nonsense of sort there be quarrel between replied there ought to be none will get to come here colour of face became slightly heightened a answered if wish sir henry wish also will not

from hadley be frequently with wondered to find so little altered rather in respect so much altered for be more considerate in manner more sparing of speech much le inclined to domineer now a lady harcourt than in former day have ever be a caroline waddington went constantly into society be always much considered triumph be mainly of quiet nature one sometimes see to be achieved with so little effort by beautiful woman seemed necessary that must sit still sometimes smile world be ready to throw at foot nay smile be too often omitted yet world be there at home though more employed be hardly more energetic husband told that wished house to be noted for pleasantness of dinner party therefore studied subject a good child must study lesson taught what material of dinner must be satisfied that cook be good looked to brilliancy of appointment did best to make house shine brightly house did shine on whole sir henry be contented be true that wife did not talk much what little did say be said with sweet manner with perfect grace be always dressed with care be always beautiful be always ladylike have not sir henry reason to be contented a for talking must do now that be told that george bertram be to come to house did not show much more excitement at tidings than at promised advent of mr baron brawl took matter with such indifference that sir henry at least have cause for jealousy then be indifferent about everything nothing seemed to wake to joy sorrow sir henry perhaps be contented lovely ladylike attractive a be sometimes did feel almost curious to know whether be possible to rouse doll of to sense of life animation have thought nay almost wished that name of old lover must have moved that idea of seeing must have disturbed one name be same to a have be told to go call on mr stistick have gone be told to receive mr bertram be quite ready to do so angel from heaven spirit from below must sir henry have summoned such to table must have be received by with equal equanimity be dutiful on part naturally satisfactory to husband inclined to be somewhat exigeant even duty may pall on exigeant husband man may be brought to wish that wife must cross on occasion sir henry have such pleasure saw bertram morning said when went home for five minute before taking seat in house for night be to be here on wednesday oh very well there will be six then said more be clear that dinner that only be on mind have told to be careful about dinner therefore must not complain nevertheless be almost vexed let wife think that will satisfy husband by perfect

have be comfort to lady harcourt if sir henry must have have dinner party day how must bear must say how must look when george bertram came there a guest to house how must be so cruel so heartless so inhuman a to come there path be difficult enough for poor weary foot must know must at rate have known how must be so cruel a to add great stumbling block to other peril wednesday came at half past

that fame of charm have reached ear that be delighted to have opportunity of making acquaintance mr mr stistick be next comer mr stistick sat down on opposite sofa seemed to think that did duty to society by sitting there so did only permit so to sit there be further labour in entertaining mr stistick be large heavy woman with square forehead square chin have brought up seven child most successfully now in day of husband parliamentary prosperity be carried about to dinner in way enjoyed be not too shy to eat have wish to be talked to to talk to sit easily on sofa listen to buzz of voice be life society to perhaps in long hour be meditating on child frock husband linen never seemed to be long to mr stistick be standing on rug before fire preparing for first onslaught on baron brawl when servant announced mr bertram ah bertram be delighted to see said sir henry doubly so a dinner be ready judge know friend bertram by name at rate sort of half introduction be performed who moved oxford from propriety said baron bertram saw heard eye ear be at command a took host proffered hand glanced eye for moment round room there sat have to speak to a best might at last interview

red manner felt be awkward be not master of when such be case with man fact always betrays did speak to how do do lady harcourt said put hand out felt end of finger once more within own spoke too probably pretty woman can say almost a much a be necessary on such occasion a without opening lip whether spoke whether did not be same to certainly did not hear finger did touch hand eye did rest upon face then in moment of time thought of jerusalem of mount of olive of ride at littlebath of last meeting when have be shattered to piece there be five hundred fifty five thousand male child between age of nine twelve said mr stistick pursuing wondrous line of argument a bertram turned towards fire what fine national family said baron how ashamed feel when bethink that only one of be mine dinner be served said butler mr stistick will allow said sir henry then in minute bertram found walking down to dinner with member of parliament have school accommodation for just one hundred fourteen continued that gentleman on stair now will tell what becomes of other four hundred forty one bertram be not at moment in condition to give information on subject can tell about one said baron a sir henry began grace odd thousand be nothing said mr stistick pausing for second till grace be over judge mr stistick sat at lady harcourt right left so that bertram be not called upon to say much to during dinner judge talked incessantly so did member of parliament so also did solicitor general party of six be always talking party men woman be not formed into pair therefore become dumb person voice make person emulous difficulty felt be not a to what one will say how one will get in ten twelve fourteen be silent number now again harcourt endeavoured to make bertram join in conversation bertram did make faint attempt essayed to answer of mr stistick very difficult inquiry be even roused to parry raillery from judge be not caroline who must not watch narrowly a sat there in silent beauty saw that be not so arraigned in mind for want of courage have be happy noisy light of heart must probably have arraigned for deeper sin a long a matter be left in hand of parent nothing on earth will be done said mr stistick be what have always said to lady brawl said judge be what have said to lord john what intend to say to again lord john be very well thank stistick be glad at rate to get a much a that from said solicitor lord john be very well continued member not altogether liking interruption there be only one man in country who thoroughly understands subject who be able see slightest probability of finding second said judge who be able to make heard what do say lady harcourt asked baron a to management of school with how many million of mr stistick five hundred fifty five thousand male child suppose say boy said judge boy asked mr stistick not quite understanding rather disconcerted by familiarity of word well suppose must be boy at least most of be from nine to twelve say continued mr stistick completely bewildered oh that alters question said judge not at said mr stistick there be accommodation for only well will ask lady harcourt what do say lady harcourt lady harcourt felt by mean inclined to enter into joke on side so said with gravest smile be sure mr stistick understands very well what be talking about what do say ma'be said judge turning round to lady on left mr stistick be always right on such matter said lady see what be to have character absolutely enables one to upset law of human nature still do say mr solicitor that majority of be probably boy boy exclaimed member of parliament boy think can have understood word that have be saying think have said baron there be five hundred fifty five thousand male child between oh h h male child ah h h now see difference beg pardon mr stistick really be very stupid mean to explain to lord john in present session stistick who be one man said sir henry one man be lord boanerges believe be only man living who really understands social want of kingdom everything else also sneered baron baron always sneered at cleverness be external to own profession especially when exhibited by one who like noble lord named must have confined effort to profession so boanerges be to take in hand male child very fitting too be made to be schoolmaster be first man of age think so sir henry be certainly when be on woolsack said sir henry be normal position always assumed by first man of age in country though of when there do hide light under bushel said judge be first law reformer that perhaps ever lived said mr stistick enthusiastically hope will be last in time said enemy hope will live to complete work said politician then methuselah will be child to jared lamech little baby said judge in such case have got work before certainly said mr solicitor so battle be kept up between george bertram lady harcourt sat by listened more probably perhaps sat by did not listen when ladyship mr stistick have retreated oh reader fancy what that next hour must have be to caroline harcourt how gothic how barbarous be still in habit in devote wife to such wretchedness a o lady have ever be lot to sit out such hour a with mr stistick who must talk read sleep in whose company must neither talk read yet sleep if such have be lot have not asked why in civilized country in civilized century must be doomed to senseless sleepless purgatory when be gone when judge radiant with fun happiness hastened to fill claret beaker then bertram by degree thawed began to feel that after world be perhaps not yet dead around well mr stistick said baron if sir henry will allow will drink lord boanerges with heart said mr stistick be man of whom may be said that man knew better on side bread be buttered be buttering bread of million upon million said mr stistick doing better still said bertram enabling to butter own lord boanerges be probably only public man of day who will be greater in hundred year than be now let at rate hope said baron that will at time be le truculent ca agree with bertram said sir henry consider be fertile in statesman do think that peel will be forgotten in hundred year be said with usual candour of modern turncoat for sir henry have now deserted peel almost must hope by time said bertram will have sort of niche in history no doubt a have mr perceval who did so much to assist in war lord castlereagh who carried union also be heaven sent minister whom acheron have not a yet altogether swallowed up boanerges think will escape libitina if spirit of age will allow immortality to man of day think will doubt whether public opinion a now existing will admit of hero worship public opinion be best safeguard for great man great name said mr stistick with intense reliance on civilization of own era quite true sir quite true said baron for space of twenty four hour then followed calm then coffee after that solicitor general looking at watch marched off impetuous to house judge said know will excuse for too have be slave in time will go up to lady harcourt bertram will not be forgiven if go upstairs bertram did go upstairs that might not appear to be

in eaton square never saw caroline alone became used to seeing being with strangeness of meeting wore away must speak to without reserve on common matter of life found that have intense delight in

long promise yes very long for visit when first promised be to have be made to mr bertram one know how promise still live on caroline have pressed even when felt that adela presence must no longer be

amuse guest be one who did not require much amusing have there be friendship between friend month must have run by too quickly a be before be over wished again even at littlebath bertram dined there twice once went with to concert met in park called then there be great evening gathering in eaton square be there caroline be careful on occasion to let husband know when met bertram a often in shape expressed satisfaction will marry adela gauntlet will see if doe not said to after one of dinner in eaton square be very pretty very will be very nice only wish that one of have little money to go on with caroline answered nothing to never did make answer felt quite sure in own heart that must not marry adela gauntlet have confessed truth to herself must have wished to do so adela saw disapproved saw much must not disapprove of saw that there be very little sympathy between husband wife that little be not on increase very little nay be there caroline did not say much of lot in life few word did fall from seemed to be full of scorn for have around for who have given seemed to say there be that for have striven ash on now step sleep feed be gritty between teeth foul to touch see here be reward do not honour for having won then appeared that sir henry harcourt have already learned how to assume cross brow of captious husband that sharp word be already spoken on light occasion spoken without cause listened to with apparent indifference even before adela such word be spoken then caroline must smile bitterly turn face towards friend a though must say see see what be to be wife of so fine man so great man what grand match have not made for though look spoke thus word of complaint fell from lip word of confidence have said that sir henry seemed to encourage visit bertram made to eaton square for time did so up to time of large evening party be given just before adela return to littlebath on evening adela thought saw deeper frown than usual on brow of solicitor general a turned eye to couch on lovely wife be sitting behind george bertram be standing so standing that must speak must hear then adela bethought that though must say nothing to caroline might not be equally impossible to say something to bertram there have be between sort of confidence if there be one to whom adela must now speak freely be to knew something of other secret of at least trusted other if be done at must be done on evening there be probability that must meet again before departure be only house in did meet here adela have wish to see more be come to say good bye to said first moment be able to speak to alone to say good bye be visit over so soon go on thursday well will see again for will come on purpose to make adieu mr bertram do certainly will put out little hand gently oh so gently touched arm why not why must not come to see have not so many friend can afford to lose will not lose must willingly lose mr bertram well miss gauntlet be right to be here at whole tone temper character of face altered a answered quickly sharply if not fault lie with sir henry harcourt who with pertinacity induced to come here why be wrong must be here foolish may be be what mean did not say wrong did think that imagine evil may be foolish continued bertram a though have not heard last word if so folly have be if be foolish be that reason why must not be wise what be fear adela what be injury will come will be to to to harcourt injury real injury be sure of may not unhappiness come of doe seem to that be happy happy of be happy of be not utterly wretched be a happy a be sir henry have doubt be a happy a be in what say mr bertram do injustice be not unhappy be not then congratulate on getting over trouble consequent on true heart did not mean in way to speak of have care regret sorrow a have most of have cause of misery can not assuage well be fortunate that be can say caroline can see be not happy mr bertram fear that coming here will not make more so have said little word meaning so well perhaps have done more harm than good did not come again to eaton square till after be gone very shortly after that did so adela have seen that short whispered conversation between lady harcourt bertram moment a be of confidence so also have sir henry yet have be for moment lady harcourt bertram have said how well do sort of thing do answered well one ought to do something well do mean to say that excellence be restricted to pretty nearly such excellence a there be must have thought then paused be not coming to reproach hope said reproach lady harcourt reproach silent expressed never fall on head then must be much altered a said last word in what be hardly more than whisper saw lady in distant part of room to whom attention might be considered to be due rising from seat walked away across room be very shortly after adela have spoken to for many long bitter day bertram have persuaded that have not really loved have doubted when have first told so calmly that be necessary that marriage must be postponed for year have doubted much when found if not happy at least contented under postponement doubt have become almost certainty when learnt that discussed merit with one a henry harcourt on day at richmond when discovered that very secret of heart be made subject of confidential conversation with man have doubted no longer then have gone to reception proved to that doubt have be too well founded certainty only too sure so have parted with a know now began to doubt doubt to be le certain of certainty that did not much love sir henry be very apparent that must not listen to slightest word without emotion that too must perceive that adela conceived that still loved that presence there be therefore dangerous that also have be told to be then possible that loving woman a did having never ceased in love for one moment having still loved with whole heart whole strength that have flung from while heart be still own must be that during courtship must have seemed so cold yet have loved thousand time have reproached in heart for being worldly now world seemed to have charm for thousand time have declared that cared only for outward show of thing outward show be now wholly indifferent to that in degree contributed to happiness even to contentment be made manifest enough to then thought drove wild began to ask whether there must be yet comfort in fact that have loved perhaps loved still motif by men be actuated in conduct be not only various mixed a bertram thought in way concerning lady caroline waddington have once belonged to proposed to scheme of infamy indulgence of disastrous love ruin for whom world now called so fortunate did think that if still loved must be pleasant to sit talk with pleasant to feel warmth in hand pleasant that there must be confidence in voice so resolved there be resolve allowed to come to pas that intimacy in eaton square must not be dropped then bethought of part friend harcourt have played in matter speculated a to how pleasant fellow have cheated out of wife what adela have said might be very true why must regard sir henry happiness why regard man happiness woman who have regarded so hired horse rode in park when knew lady harcourt must be there dined with baron brawl because lady harcourt be to dine there went to ball at mr madden for same reason solicitor general now saw did not press friend to take part at more of little dinner what may have passed on subject between sir henry wife can not be said man doe not willingly accuse wife of even first germ of infidelity doe not willingly suggest to that one be of more moment to than be probable that brow became blacker than have be that word be le courteous manner le kind of bertram may be presumed that said nothing might however have be easy for caroline to perceive that no longer wished to have old friend at house at mr madden ball bertram asked to dance with did stand up for quadrille mr madden be rich young man in parliament intimate friend of sir henry of bertram caroline have danced with being first performance of nature since marriage having done so must not a said to herself refuse mr bertram so stood up busy solicitor general who showed for five minute in room saw moving hand in hand together in figure of dance a so moved bertram must hardly believe in reality of position what if one have prophesied to three month since that must be dancing with caroline harcourt adela did not stay with long said a be standing still not very long think be fond of london then be again silent till turn for dancing be over think be said bertram be must not care if be to leave for ever do like london lady harcourt oh yes a well a other place think much signifies london littlebath new zealand be then silent for moment till bertram again spoke with effort be evident in voice used not to be so indifferent in such matter used have world so changed that nothing be longer of interest world have changed certainly with with also lady world have changed with of fortune while have be crushing have be very kind to have well perhaps have a kind at rate a deserve may be sure of complain of then be again silent wonder whether ever think of old day said after pause at rate never talk of mr bertram suppose not one must not talk of out of full heart mouth will speak constant thought will break forth in word there be nothing else left to of can think one looking at face a answered must have little dreamed how much be passing through mind how much be weighing on heart commanded not only feature even colour motion of eye anger flashed from there be blush of indignation a answered in crowded room yet word be indignant enough there be anger too in low tone reached ear so plainly reached further whose doing have be why be may not think of past time why be that thought memory be denied to who be that broke cup at very fountain be did ever think of prayer 'forgive trespass in pride must forgive nothing now dare to twit with fortune lady harcourt will sit down if please now know why speak thus then without further word caused to be led away sitting down between two old dowager debarred absolutely from power of word immediately after left house remained for hour remained danced with young lord echo who be whig lordling with mr twisleton whose father be treasury secretary talked to about harcourt

treasure have be cruel have be unforgiving have denied to that pardon behoved so often to ask for be question bertram be now forced to put to that other question must now answer in one way have then be cause of own shipwreck have driven own bark on rock while open channel be there clear before have not now assured of love though word of tenderness have passed lip whose doing have be yes certainly have be own doing conviction thus came upon did not add much to comfort there be little consolation to now in assurance that have loved did love have hitherto felt to be injured man now have to feel that have committed injury whose doing have be in pride must forgive nothing word rang in ear memory repeated to hourly tone in have be spoken have accused of destroying hope for world have answered not word to accusation on morning after ball at mr madden sir henry came into wife room while be still dressing by by said saw at mr madden last night yes perceived that be there for moment caroline answered be dancing know that ever saw dancing before have not done so since be married in former day used to be fond of ah yes when be at littlebath did not much matter then what did in way doe

will direct direct only request be same thing exactly will not dance again must have felt prohibition have be aware of wish before have offended well if choose to take in light can not help good morning will not dine at home to day so solicitor general went way wife remained sitting motionless at dressing table have of already become aware that bargain have made be not wise one chapter v can escape have not george bertram be of men most infirm of purpose must have quitted london immediately after ball at rate for many month be lamentably infirm of purpose said to over over again that

at rate to spare now yet remained must ask pardon before went must do then must go object be to see without going to eaton square instinct told that sir henry no longer wished to see there be unwilling to enter house of one who did not wish presence for two week failed in object certainly did see lady harcourt not in such way a to allow of conversation at last fortune be propitious reverse found alone with be seated quite alone turning over engraving lay in portfolio before when came up to be angry said if ask to listen to for few moment still continued to move engraving before with slower motion than before though eye still rested on plate might have seen have dared to look at that mind be far away from might have seen also that there be flash of anger now in countenance spirit be softer than on evening when have reproached for have remembered that also have be deeply injured answered nothing to request thus made told that be unforgiving continued now come to beg that will not be unforgiving also be if have done anything have caused caused to be le happy than might have be le happy said not with scorn with have before repeated word believe hope must wish to be happy must do anything in power to make so there can be nothing now in power mr bertram a spoke involuntarily put emphasis on now made word convey much more than have intended no said what can such one a do what must ever have done say that forgive lady harcourt let forgive whispered a did so put out hand to let forgive be that can do for other oh caroline caroline said speaking hardly above breath with eye averted still holding hand attempting to hold for a spoke withdrew be unjust to other night be so hard to be just when one be so wretched have be like two child who have quarrelled over plaything

nothing to forgive ala yes mine be first fault knew that really loved loved oh caroline hush mr bertram not so speak so know that must not wrong know must not lead into trouble not into further trouble into worse misery that might have led might have be led to such happiness lady harcourt when think of what have thrown away think of not at mr bertram can command thought sometimes by practice

heart with heart now god bless mr bertram thing must most tend to make contented must be to see married to one must love weight must then be off soul now weighs on very heavily so saying rose from seat left standing over engraving have thrown pearl away pearl richer than tribe there be nothing for now to bear loss there be other source of unpleasantness between sir henry wife besides inclination for dancing sir henry have now paid one half year interest on sum of money have be lent to by old gentleman at hadley have be rather disgusted at finding that be taken a matter of course be not at present moment by mean over burdened with money constant devotion to politics interfered considerably with practice be also perhaps better known a party lawyer than a practical practising one thus though present career be very brilliant be not quite so profitable a have hoped most lawyer when begin to devote to politics have secured if not fortune at least mean of making even at age sir henry might have be said to have done have aspiration be in way moderate be not moderate wished to shine with extreme brilliancy to live up to character for wealth world gave to give out a fact to be understood by men that be to be heir of hadley croesus there be perhaps certain wisdom in wisdom of dashing chancy nature fortune favour brave world certainly give most credit to who be able to give unlimited credit to there be certainly risk in life led giving of elegant little dinner two three time week in london be expensive amusement so began to be very anxious about old gentleman what be to do that might get near money bag there be game what best sportsman dodge might use so a to get into bag perhaps to hing to use sportsman dodge must have be best then be so hard to hing when so much might be gained by doing something very well sir henry duly instructed a to weakness customary to old men thought wife must be best weapon surest dodge if must be got to be attentive affectionate to grandfather to visit flatter hover about much might be done so thought sir henry do what might lady harcourt must not assist be not part of bargain that must toady old man who have never shown special regard for think ought to go down to hadley sir henry said to one morning what to stay there said caroline yes for fortnight so parliament will be up now in three week will go to scotland for few day must not make out with old gentleman till go to grimsdale must much rather remain at home sir henry ah yes be just like must much rather that went if wish to shut house up will not object to go to littlebath very probably not must object to going there exceedingly object to of place be most vulgar most forget have dear friend living there dear friend yes miss todd suppose think may a well leave miss todd alone at present moment be particularly anxious that must be attentive to grandfather have never be in habit of staying at hadley then sooner get into habit better can not think why must wish to trouble old man who must not have slightest pleasure in seeing be nonsense if behaved well to must have pleasure do ever write to never write to to day then ask whether must be glad to have caroline did not answer husband immediately went on buttering toast sipping tea have never yet disobeyed positive order that have given be now thinking whether must obey order if not how must explain to that must not do so well said why do not answer will write to to day have much rather not doe that mean that wo fear sir henry that must mean have not be on term with grandfather must admit of doing so nonsense said lord master be not very civil to morning how can man be civil when hears such trash a that know how be situated how great stake be will hing to help win to made answer of what use must be for to answer also have thrown away pearl taken in exchange piece of brass there be nothing for too to bear misery upon word take very coolly continued seem to think that house furniture carriage horse be to grow up round without effort on own part doe ever strike that thing cost money will give up to morrow if wish that know be nonsense be doing to surround with thing reproach be not just nay be not manly woman idea of manliness be very extended expect to get everything to hing talk of justice do not know that when married looked to uncle fortune certainly not have known must have told how vain believed such hope to be then why on earth refrained from finishing question even must not bring to tell that have married with other view merely slammed door behind a left room yes have certainly thrown pearl away what life be to have doomed what treatment be for caroline waddington who have determined to win world wear have given to brute who have taken only because might perhaps be heiress of rich old man then thought of lost pearl how must do other than think of thought of what life must have be have bravely committed to hand fearing nothing trusting everything remembered energy during happy day in have looked forward to early marriage remembered tenderness of manner natural gallantry of heart loving look of bold eye then thought of husband yes thought of long wildly a did so indifference with have regarded grew into hatred shuddered a imagination made that frightful contrast between picture eye must have so loved to look on if be only lawful that other picture to look on be legal doom brow grew wildly black a thought of caress love be more hateful to even than coarse ill humour thought of a did so asked that question come first to mind of creature when in misery be there mean of release way of escape be bark utterly ruined for ever marriage without love be perilous step for woman who have heart within bosom for who have none only so much a may be necessary for ordinary blood circulating department such arrangement may be convenient enough caroline waddington have once flattered that heart of hers be merely blood circulating instrument have discovered mistake learned truth before be too late have known what be to love yet have married henry harcourt seldom indeed will punishment be so lame of foot a to fail in catching criminal a have be punishment bitter cruel remorseless punishment have caught now held tight within grasp too have said that be wretched what must wretchedness be to hers be not married to creature that hated be not bound in foul mezentian embrace to being against whom human gorge rose in violent disgust oh if must only be alone a be alone if must be granted to to think of love to think of in solitude silence in solitude beast with front of brass foot of clay have right to break by night day ah if wretchedness might only be a wretchedness how blessed must not think then again asked whether there might not be escape that woman have separated from husband well knew that plea of ill usage of neglect of harshness of temper have be put forward accepted by world to partial enfranchisement of unhappy wife have often heard have also heard that in such case cruelty must be proved hasty word cross look black brow must not suffice must plead that hated man that have never loved that have married in wounded pique because lover whom did love have thrown off there be ground none a yet on must claim freedom have sold a slave must abide slavery have given to beast with face of brass foot of clay must endure cold misery of den separation solitude silence that whom heart worshipped might enjoy such thing for there be such relief within reach have gone up into room when sir henry left in order that one might see wretchedness there remained for hour at last said aloud lifting head from pillow on face have be hid standing erect in room will not bear will not endure can not

to new house be built be full of romance of picturesque oriental wonder of strange sight strange noise strange smell when one be well in town little narrow lane turn turn be incessant mosque shop creates fresh surprise can not allow to write description of cairo how dervish there spun shook going through holy exercise with admirable perseverance must tell occurred towards latter end of winter when wilkinson bertram have nearly completed sojourn in cairo not what dervish have roared out monotonous prayer to allah duly friday at pm with a much precision a service in one of own cathedral friend have put thing off a hardly being of much interest at last went there when have only one friday left for performance believe that a rule mahomedan hate christian regarding merely a christian certainly doe so have tidings of confirmed success on part of rebel in india reached furthermost part of turkish empire christian life must have be safe there horrid outrage perpetrated at jaffa massacre at jeddah sufficiently show what might have expected in syria christian be admitted within mosque for foot touch be considered to carry pollution in egypt have caused ourselves to be better respected thrash arab pay therefore be very glad to see anywhere even dervish welcome to most sacred rite with excellent coffee loan of rush bottomed chair now when be remembered that mahomedan never us chair must be confessed that be very civil moreover let be said to immortal praise that dervish of cairo never ask for backsheish be only people in country so bertram wilkinson have coffee with sundry other travelling briton who be there then with chair in hand went into dervish hall be large lofty round room roof of be in shape of cupola on one side pointed towards mecca therefore nearly due east there be empty throne tribune in head of college dean of chapter of dervish located on haunch be handsome powerful man of about forty with fine black beard dressed in flowing gown covered by flat topped black cap by degree slowly in came college of dervish seated a dean be seated sat on floor in circle spread away from tribune getting larger larger in dimension a fresh dervish came in there be not much attention to regularity in arrival for appeared barely in time for closing scene commencement be tame enough still seated shouted out short prayer to allah certain number of time number be said to be ninety nine did not say whole prayer at once though consisted of only three word took first word ninety nine time then second then third only sound to be recognized be that of allah deep guttural tone in be groaned out by voice together made even that anything distinct word so be completed circle getting ever larger larger be remarked that men came in a dervish who belonged to various ordinary pursuit trade there be soldier in circle apparently common labourer indeed one may join though presume must do so with danger be discovered that be not mahomedan who specially belonged to college have peculiar gown cap herded together on one side of circle appeared to friend that throughout entertainment be by far least enthusiastic of performer when round of groaning have be completed occupied probably hour young lad perhaps of seventeen year very handsome handsomely dressed in puce coloured cloak rather petticoat with purple hat on head in shape like inverted flower pot slipped forth from near tribune into middle of circle began to twirl after about five six minute two other younger boy somewhat similarly dressed did same twirled also so that there be three twirling together twirling of elder boy be by far more graceful let young lady put out hand so a to bring one to level of waist other with crown of head then go round round a nearly a possible on same spot let do so raising of foot will ever be visible let continue for fifteen minute without variation in attitude of arm sign of fatigue then may go in for twirling dervish be absurd to suppose that male creature in england must perform feat during twirling little black boy marked time by beating with two stick on rude gong dance be kept up at first for fifteen minute then there be short spell of howling then dance twirl then real game began circle have now become so large a to occupy greater part of hall be especially swelled by sundry new arrival at moment in particular there came one swarthy tall wretched looking creature with wild eye wan face black hair of extraordinary length who took up position standing immediately opposite to tribune other new comer also stood near of whom be remarkable for length of hair of have tied up behind like woman now proceeded to unloose at period considerable toilet preparation be made for coming work in circle who have not come in from college with gown cap one two even of deliberately took off outer clothing tied up in bundle bundle removed to various corner so that might again find own clothes one two put on calico dressing gown appeared to have be placed ready for purpose among be cadaverous man of black hair then stood up dean standing also before tribune deep toned murmur went round circle also be word allah a be duly explained to bertram by dragoman without such explanation must have be impossible to detect that word be pronounced indeed sound be of such nature a to make altogether doubtful from whence came be like human voice amalgamation of voice appeared a though came from very bowel of earth at first be exceedingly low increased gradually till at last one might have fancied that legion of lucifer be groaning within very bowel of pandemonium also by slow degree motion be seen to pervade circle men instead of standing fixedly on leg leaned over first to right then to left swaying backwards forward together in same direction so that sound motion be a though came from one compact body then a groan became louder so did motion become more violent till whole body heaved backwards forward with regularity of pendulum voice of steam engine a excitement became strong head of dervish walked along inner circle exciting to more violence who already seemed most violent did standing for few minute before such man bowing own head rapidly groaning deeply a did so man before whom stood must groan swing with terrible energy men with long hair be especially selected by degree lateral motion be abandoned dervish bowed head forward instead of sideways one who have not seen operation can conceive what men may achieve in way of bowing groaning bowed till swept floor with long hair bending double after motion bringing up again to erect posture dean went backwards forward from one to urging on by time sight be terrible to behold perspiration streamed down sound came forth a though very heart be bursting face be hidden by dishevelled lock clothes wore be reeking wet still flung about motion becoming faster faster still sound came forth a though from very depth of tartarus still venerable dean went backwards forward slowly before urging on still urging on at last nature with greater number of have made last effort dean retired to tribune circle be broken up men with long hair still persevered appeared to bertram wilkinson with effort be now involuntary be carried on by ecstatic frenzy be best of actor circle have broken up dervish be lying listlessly along wall panting with heat nearly lifeless with exertion four remaining with foot fixed in old place still bowed still howled will die said bertram will not be stopped said wilkinson to dragoman five minute five minute said dragoman look at look at with black hair did look three of have now fallen one remained still at task swept ground with hair absolutely striking with head sound came forth from loudly wildly with broken gasp with terrible exertion a though must be last yet did nothing to repress at last seemed a though power of fully raising head have left also that of lowering to ground still made a be quarter circle hand be clutched behind back with singular motion in singular attitude began to move foot still groaning half bowing made shuffling progress across hall dervish appeared to take notice of dean stood tranquil under tribune who have recovered from exertion be dressing others lay about collecting breath eye of stranger be on still moving black haired devotee on went still howling still swinging head right towards wall of temple pace be not fast seemed a though must inevitably knock own brain out by motion of own head yet nobody stopped will kill said wilkinson said dragoman kill head berry hard bertram rushed forward a though to stay infuriate fanatic one two of dervish who stood around gently prevented without speaking word then finale came crack went against wall rebounded off went at again then again be mock blow serious heavy rap a from small battering ram yet bertram wilkinson be able to observe that did not strike wall a must naturally have done have there be precaution have struck with head in motion a be intended to be believed blow must have come upon forehead temple must probably have killed instead of just a approached wall butted at like ram saved forehead at expense of pole may probably be surmised therefore that knew what be about after three rap man stood still doubled up looking a though be staggered then went again with head towards wall dean satisfied with what have be done now interposed best of dervish be gently laid on back upon floor while long matted hair be drawn from off face a so lay sight be not agreeable to christian eye true mahomedan might think of 't be thus dervish practised religious rite at cairo wonder how much that black fellow get paid friday said bertram a mounted donkey ought to be something very

richer must make bill must pay have loved wife once with sort of love day be gone when have be at such pain to express contempt for tenderness have deserted might be wise to make use of not to molest

to show room latter turned round on stair said that must prefer to have one present at interview will only open door for said other did be preparing to return when uncle called go away george said sir henry will want to show down again so stood together at bedside well sir henry be kind of said putting thin bony hand out upon coverlid by way of making attempt at englishman usual greeting sir henry took gently in found cold clammy be nearly over now sir henry said old man hope not said visitor with tone usual on such occasion may rally yet mr bertram rally there be something in old man voice faintly recalled bitter railing sound of other day suppose will ever rally much more well can only hope for best be what do can assure be true do hope for best of can still do that if hing else of course said sir henry then stood still for while meditating how best might make use of present opportunity what must say to secure fraction of hundred of thousand belonged to dying man that have right to at least moiety of inmost bosom told how must now plead right perhaps after must have be a well for to have remained in london mr bertram at last said hope wo think unbecoming in if say one word about business in present state said old man ca do much a see will endeavour to listen ca be surprised must be anxious about wife umph said mr bertram have treated very well seems who say so woman

stuff be very weak sir henry ca say much more to may ask one question sir have provided for granddaughter provided for old man made sadly futile attempt to utter word with ominous shriek few year since must have be sure to frighten man who must have asked question what sort of man can be george to come to now with question so saying pulled clothes over a though resolved to hold further conversation be very weak said george think have better leave hellish expression came across lawyer face said to go away may leave here to reap harvest by go away know to be beggar have married man

husband be protector at present moment sir henry what passed between long since have be now forgotten be still cousin while want protection will give to oh will will certainly look upon a though be sister have other brother be very kind of very complaisant of what if say that choose that must have such brother perhaps think that a be only husband ought not to have voice in matter suppose that

can lose hold caroline have loved other with other love than of brother sister knew that two might not dwell under same roof be necessary to talk over matter in doing so be very hard not to touch on forbidden subject caroline have made up mind to live again with aunt have made up mind to do so providing that husband power be not sufficient to prevent miss baker must often tell that law must compel to return to lord that must be forced to be again mistress of house in square again live a prosperous wife of prosperous politician to caroline have answered little little have be in manner have thoroughly frightened miss baker nothing lady harcourt have said nothing must induce to do so if can not help caroline will help myself will find way to prevent at rate so much have said nothing

none of know anything yet own money income at least coming from be in sir henry hand will never condescend to ask for said then there be pause in conversation george continued after minute two will not let fall into hand must not help remembering that own mad anger have already thrown into hand now dreaded so terribly oh if two last year might pas away a dream leave free to clasp to bosom a own error of past year will not turn to dream there be more solid stuff in material world than be never melt away vanish into thin air not if can be avoided replied ah can be avoided can not say that know can make despair can not be that have right to imprison hardly know what have right to do be stern man will not easily be set aside will not desert will not desert what for sake caroline must regard what people will say name have be mixed together not a cousin know know george suppose intended must live here be not thinking of know that may not be for will keep chamber in london will just be able to starve on there then will make one more attempt at bar know will succeed be made for success at last have always felt that man must live somehow must have pursuit be more within reach than other otherwise be not very anxious for success what be use of of what use will be to now oh george well be not true tell have made shipwreck of fortune say that have done be that drove bark upon rock timber on account be not le shattered must strive to throw off feeling have so much before in world have striven have thought must love other woman have told others that did love word be false knew that be false have endeavoured to think of other thing of money ambition politics can care for none of if ever man cut own throat have done so must not answer at once because be now sobbing tear be streaming from eye what have done said at last if happiness be shattered what must mine be sometimes think that can not live bear with added after pause will not live bear if come to will die george rising from chair walked across room took sharply by arm george said will protect from say that will save from that protect said repeating word hardly daring to look into face how must protect how save from lord have chosen for might be easy enough for to comfort now with promise must not find in heart to hold out promise must not fulfil if after reading of will sir henry harcourt must insist on taking wife back with how must protect of men in world will not give up to said wildly if do blood will lie upon head george george say that will save from to whom can look now to think will force away with if doe will stand by see so used certainly not caroline well will be better must not be driven to interfere world will forget that be cousin will remember be once to have be husband world be past caring for world be nothing to now if london know how be with have loved thrown away love tied to brute have loved do love love can only be sorrow to fear world god conscience do fear once for one moment george thought must fear nothing once for one moment be still willing to be yours remembered what must think of if must so fall repented baseness may god preserve from such sin for world why must fear world be for that fear must grieve to hear men speak lightly of name let say what please wretched be always trodden on let say what please deserved when stood before altar with man when forbade foot to run mouth to speak though knew hated owned to heart what will do george to rid of sin have risen taken hold of arm when first asked to protect be still standing beside chair on sat now rose also said few gentle word such a thought might soothe yes continued a though did not heed said to almost twenty time during last night hated in very soul be bound in honour even yet to leave in honour in truth in justice pride forbade pride anger against be useless to think of now dear ah yes quite useless must have done then then at last moment asked whether must love that man whispered inwardly to myself that loathed tongue said ' out loud can such lie a told in god holy temple sworn before own altar can such perjury a ever be forgiven will sin worse still if go back to continued after while have right george to ask anything from kindness a cousin for love sake old love can not forget do ask to save from be rather that ask that will save from need of saving that evening george sat up late alone preparing for morrow work trying to realize position in found mr pritchett have be there must have whispered into ear again again ominous important word million of money mr george million of money indeed though mr pritchett be not there remembrance of overflowing coffer did force upon mind who can say that if placed a bertram then be must not think of did think of not over deeply with much sadness knew that be not to be whole of part of so much uncle have told with sufficient plainness knew also that might have be then thought of interview in mr bertram have endeavoured to beg from promise to do for own heart so strongly yearned yes might have have bride money too might have be sitting at moment with wife of bosom laying out in gorgeous plan splendour of future life must be vain to say that there be disappointment at heart yet there be within breast feeling of gratified independence sufficed to support at least might boast that have not sold not aloud with inward boasting be so common with most of there be spirit within endowed with greater wealth than mr pritchett might be able to enumerate inward love loss of must hardly have be atoned for even by possession of whom have lost be passion men call love be rather vigorous knowledge of own worth a man strong will taught that price be sufficient to buy assent that black must be reckoned white white be reckoned black uncle knew have misunderstood in rejecting old man offer have expressed contempt for rich for rich be a counterbalance to independence mr bertram have taken what said for more than be worth have supposed that nephew afflicted with singular lunacy disliked money for own sake george have never cared to disabuse uncle mind let act a will have said to be not for to dictate to either on one side other so error have gone on to morrow morning will must be read george must have to listen to reading of knew well enough that world looked on a uncle probable heir that must have to bear mr pritchett hardly expressed pity sir henry malignant pleasure sir lionel loud disgust be nearly a bad to a remembrance of what have lost by degree screwed courage up to necessary point of endurance what be pritchett to with kind burdensome solicitude what sir henry mad anger how can affect soul what even be father let rave care not to have compassion on why must grief assail grief be so vile so base so unworthy of compassion thus schooling for morrow betook to bed chapter xv will only attendant at old mr bertram funeral be nephew mr pritchett hadley doctor other gentleman be to be present only at more interesting ceremony of reading will sir lionel have written to say that be rather unwell that certainly must come up from littlebath so a to be present at latter performance that very precarious state of health very inconvenient hour of train unhappily prevented from paying other last sad duty to brother remains sir henry harcourt have plainly demanded at what hour will must be read mr stickatit junior mr george stickatit of firm of dry stickatit have promised to be at hadley punctually at two pm kept word mr pritchett came down by early train a be fit on occasion be more melancholy than usual be very melancholy very sad for felt that million of money be in great jeopardy perhaps even death of old friend of forty year standing may have have effect on be mingled feeling pervaded oh mr george said just before went to churchyard be grass of field just grass of field here to day gone to morrow flourishing in morning cast into oven before night behoves such frail impotent creature to look close after interest million of money be afraid did think enough about mr george then hadley bell be rung again be not rung loudly seemed to bertram that one noticed that anything more than usually sad be going on must hardly realise to that be going to put under ground almost nearest relative bell rang out dirge did hardly above breath there be three boy gathered at little gate before door to see body of rich man carried to last home george stood with back to empty dining room fireplace on one side stood mr pritchett on other barnet doctor very few word passed between be not in nature peculiarly lugubrious then there be scuffling heard on stair subdued decent undertaker scuffling a hour two before have be heard muffled click of hammer foot scuffled down stair outside dining room door along passage then door be opened in low decent undertaker voice red nosed sombre well fed mr mortmain told that be ready be yours sir handed pair of black glove to george be yours sir gave pair to doctor doctor held instead of putting on otherwise mr mortmain must not be expected to change after ceremony for pair of lighter colour understood other what must country doctor do with twenty thirty pair of black glove year yours mr pritchett oh mr george sighed pritchett to think must come to be good gentleman very successful very successful there be not ten people in church in churchyard during whole time of funeral to think that man with million of money must die be got rid of with so little parade what money must do in moderate way be done coffin be a heavy a lead must make cloth of best plate upon be of silver looked like there be room for equipage of hearse black coach house be so unfortunately near to churchyard be done in decent sombre useful money making way a beseemed remains of such man be on 'change that be truly buried in capel court that funeral sermon be duly preached be soul knew ear to name loomed large have be true honest in dealing there at least have hurt nobody by word deed excepting in way of trade have kept hand from picking stealing from picking be not warranted by city usage from stealing that law regard a such therefore there on 'change preached funeral sermon loudly buried with due honour two have be named for reading of will seeing that train arrived at pm therefore when ceremony be over george mr pritchett have to sit together in dining room till time arrived doctor who did not expect much from will have gone away perhaps to prepare other friend for similar occupation be tedious hour that so passed certainly at last did make away lunch be brought in sherry have be handed round with biscuit before funeral be again put on table mr pritchett liked glass of sherry though never seemed to have other effect on than to make sadness of deeper dye at last between occupation muttering of few scrap of somewhat worldly morality hour did wear away hand of old clock pointed to two three gentleman have come down by same train arrived in fly together mr george stickatit junior paid for accommodation be more than right for must put in bill sir lionel must not mind of sir henry be too much intent on other thing to enable to think about fly well george said sir lionel so be over at last poor brother wish must have be with at funeral be impossible lady be not here added in whisper must not well talk about lady harcourt be not at present moment anxious to see miss baker be not here to day said george a pressed father hand did not think necessary to explain that be staying at good old mr jones on other side of green must have be down for funeral said mr stickatit have be kept going about property ever since death up to moment may say there be document gentleman will be laid on table personalty will be sworn under five real will be about two more well pritchett how be morning sir henry said little to anybody bertram put out hand to a entered just took muttering something then having done so sat down at table face be not pleasant to be seen manner be ungracious nay more than uncourteous almost brutal seemed a though be prepared to declare enemy of who be there assembled to sir lionel be known may be presumed that word have passed between in fly there in room said word to one sat leaning back in arm chair with hand in pocket scowling at table before beautiful day be not mr pritchett said sir lionel essaying to make thing pleasant after fashion beautiful day outwardly sir lionel sighed mr pritchett occasion be not comfortable must die though of mr george will not of leave such will a behind said mr stickatit come gentleman be ready will sit down george got chair for father put down opposite to of sir henry mr pritchett humbly kept in one corner lawyer took head of table broke open envelope contained will with degree of gusto showed that occupation be not disagreeable to mr bertram said will not take chair thank will stand here if please said george so kept position with back to empty fireplace of then be somewhat afraid of having disappointment read in face commented upon by others be of schooling to bear with appearance of indifference tidings dreaded to hear of be except attorney hoped nothing feared nothing mr pritchett nearly closed eye almost opened mouth sat with hand resting on stomach before a though be much too humble to have hope of own sir lionel be smile what did care not if boy of must get anything a affectionate father must of course be glad if not why then dear boy must do without be intended interpretation of look judging of altogether did not do badly only deceived nobody on such occasion one face be made up for deceit never doe deceive one in truth sir lionel still entertained higher hope than other of listener there did not certainly expect legacy did think that george might still be heir a sir henry be not to be whose name be so likely then if son dear son george must be lord of two nay say only one of many hundred thousand pound what might not fond father expect sir henry be frown yet be not quite hopeless granddaughter only lineal descendant of dead man be still wife anything left to must in sort be left to let be tied up with ever so much care might still be probable that might be named heiress perhaps sole heiress might still be probable that old man have made new will since caroline have left home in eaton square at rate there must still be ground on to fight within reach if lady harcourt must be in way enriched under will if so tenderness on part must hinder from fighting out that fight a long a have inch on to stand bertram hoped anything feared anything except that must look at a disappointed man knew that be to have nothing although now that moment have come felt that wealth might possibly have elated still absence of did not make in degree unhappy did make uncomfortable to think that must be commiserated by mr pritchett sneered at by harcourt taunted by father well gentleman be ready said mr stickatit

used to labour such be case with whole mind be out of tune there be nothing now that must do work to must turn sat there gazing at empty fireplace till moment became unendurably long to at last chief suffering arose not from shattered hope lost fortune from leaden weight of existing hour what must do to shake off how must conquer depression be upon reached hand to paper be lying near tried to read mind must not answer to call must not think of right honourable gentleman speech of very able leading article in be discussed though word be before eye still be harping back on injustice of will iniquity of wife on imperturbable serenity of george bertram false fleeting friend who have fawned on in prosperity now threw over a jonah with so little remorse dropped paper on ground then again feeling of solitude of motionless time oppressed with weight a of ton of lead jumped from chair paced up down room room be too confined took hat pressing on brow walked out into open air be beautiful spring evening in may twilight still lingered though hour be late paced three time round square regardless of noise of carriage light flashed forth from revelry of neighbour went on on not thinking how must stem current be running against so strongly hardly trying to think thinking that must be well for if must make endeavour ala must not make then again returned to house once more sat down in

once misfortune have come upon found unendurable yes utterly unendurable grit substance of man within be not sufficient to bear load fate have put upon a doe deal table in similar case be crushed down collapsed fell in stuff there be not good mahogany sufficient hard wood unseasoned soft porous deal board utterly unfit to sustain such pressure unblushing wordy barrister may be very full of brass word yet be no better than unseasoned porous deal board even though have seat in parliament rose from chair again took glass of brandy how impossible be to describe working of mind in such state of misery a that then endured what what be there release for way spite of black fit to sort of rest to composure of most ordinary kind be there nothing that must do must produce for if not gratification then at least quiescence to generality of men of age there be resource in misfortune men go to billiard table to card seek relief in woman society from smile of beauty laughter moving tongue sir henry very early in life have thrown thing from have discarded pleasure wedded to hard work at very early age if at same time have wedded to honesty also have not discarded heart might have be well with

moment of dusk remembered how have inquired of caroline how many festive guest might sit at ease in room eat dainty with liberal hand must put before where be caroline now where be guest what anxiety now have that must have room enough what cared now for dainty be not to be borne clasped hand to brow rising from chair went to dressing room for what purpose have not even asked of bed rest sleep have have no thought when there again sat down mechanically dressed dressed a though be going out to gay evening party be even more than ordinarily particular about toilet one white handkerchief threw aside a spoiled in tying looked specially to boot with scrupulous care brushed speck of dust from sleeve of coat be blessing at rate to have something to do did then when commenced work have perhaps remote intention of going somewhere if so have quickly changed mind for having finished dressing again sat down in arm chair gas in dressing room have be lighted here be able to look around see what
