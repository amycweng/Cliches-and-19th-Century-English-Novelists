from sugar bowl be easy to see that like fly must return at first vacant moment now have reached very foot of pyramid proceeded to dismount from donkey intention be first to ascend to top then to come down to banquet after to penetrate into interior must seem to be easy of performance pyramid be undoubtedly high be so constructed a to admit of climbing without difficulty lady mounting must undoubtedly need assistance man possessed of moderate activity must require aid at friend be at once imbued with tremendous nature of task before sheikh of arab came forth who communicated with through abdallah work must be done doubt said great many men must be wanted to assist lady must have four arab gentleman three then seeing that work must be peculiarly severe on special day of numerous arab must be remunerated by very large number of piastre mr damer who be by mean close man in money dealing opened eye with surprise mildly expostulated m delabordeau who be rather close man in reckoning immediately buttoned up breech pocket declared that must decline to mount pyramid at at price then mr ingram descended to combat protestation of men be fearful declared with loud voice

ignoring guide scrambled up quicker than arab must follow mr damer started off at pace soon brought to end of tether from point be dragged up by sheer strength of assistant thereby accomplishing wish of men who induce victim to start a rapidly a possible in order that may soon find helpless from want of wind mr ingram endeavoured to attach to fanny must have be nothing loth to have at right hand instead of hideous brown shrieking one eyed arab who took hold of be soon found that such arrangement be impossible guide felt that if lost own peculiar hold must lose prey held on therefore with invincible tenacity miss dawkins looked too a though have thought to be attended to by christian cavalier christian cavalier be forthcoming m delabordeau be wisest for took matter quietly did a be bid allowed guide nearly to carry to top of edifice have so be top of pyramid be said mr damer bringing out word one by one being terribly out of breath very wonderful very wonderful indeed be wonderful

diffident of own charm a to think altogether impossible that might succeed in teeth of little chit fanny damer that mr ingram must join party up nile have very little doubt then there must be one place left for must thus at rate become commingled with most respectable family who might be of material service to thus actuated commenced earnest attack upon mr damer stupendous said again for be fond of repeating favourite word what wondrous race must have be egyptian king of old dare say be said mr damer wiping brow a sat upon large loose stone fragment lying on flat top of pyramid one of
