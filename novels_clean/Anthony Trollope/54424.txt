great russell street after cramming ten pound note into hand to send wife child to poor house in misery that idea have never before presented to fred pickering have thought of starvation rather of high toned extremity of destitution might be borne with admirable perhaps sublime magnanimity how be man to bear with magnanimity poor house jacket union mode of hair cutting be not easy for man with wife baby to starve in country unless be one to whom starvation have come very gradually fred saw now police must come to take wife baby away into workhouse must follow might be that be worse than

made with greatest rapidity owing promotion much more frequently to local interest than to military success state sent such such regiment therefore must be rewarded by having such such general

strengthen for affection of girl whom have come to see north south be even more bitterly divided now than have be when former parting have taken place there be fewer hope of reconciliation more positive certainty of war to knife who adhered strongly to side who did not adhere strongly to side be very few held opinion now with more acrimony than have then done peculiar bitterness of civil war add personal hatred to national enmity have come upon mind of people here in kentucky on border of contest member of same household be in many case at war with other ada forster aunt be passionately northern while feeling of old man have gradually turned to division in nation to naturally belonged for month past matter on be thinking subject filled mind morning noon night be banished from lip because must not be discussed without bitterness of hostility nevertheless there be word of bitterness between tom reckenthorpe ada forster while few short day lasted be love where be woman whom one touch of romance will not soften though be ever so impervious to argument tom must sit up stair with mother betrothed tell story of gallantry of south of sacrifice woman be making of deed men be doing must listen smile caress hand for awhile must be pleasant while old major did not dare to speak before of southern hope down in parlour during two three long night general tom passed in frankfort open secession be discussed between two men old man now have given away altogether yankee said be too bitter for wish have died first be said wish have died first life be wretched now to man who can hing son tried to comfort saying that secession must certainly be accomplished in twelve month slave state must certainly be included in southern confederacy major shook head though hated political bitterness of men whom called puritan yankee knew strength acknowledged power nothing good can come in time said not in time not in time in middle of fourth night general tom took departure old slave

during following day on next night again made way through northern line back into virginia even at time there be considerable danger in doing although frontier to be guarded be so extensive arose chiefly from paucity of road impossibility of getting across country where road existed general tom got safely back to richmond doubt found that tedium of military life have be greatly relieved by excursion then after came year of fighting there have since come year of fighting of such fighting that hearing account from day to day have hitherto failed to recognise extent import now then have even spoke of inaction of side of a though drawn battle have lasted for day in men have perished by ten of thousand must be renewed a might old german battle in austrian general must be ever retreating with infinite skill military efficacy for constancy for blood for hard determination to win at cost of life material history have known such battle a that south have fought best a regard skill man can doubt a regard pluck resolution there have not be pin choice between have fought a englishman fight when be equally in earnest a regard result have be almost altogether in favour of north because have so vast superiority in number material general tom reckenthorpe remained during year in virginia be attached to corp of general lee army be commanded by stonewall jackson be not probable therefore that must be left without active employment during whole year be fighting assisting in wonderful raid be made by man whose loss be worse to confederate than loss of vicksburg of new orleans general tom gained for mark name glory be glory of soldier rather than of general one looked upon a future commander of army men said that if there be rapid stroke to be stricken under order from more thoughtful head general tom be hand to strike thus went on making wonderful ride by night appearing like warrior ghost leading warrior ghost in quiet valley of federal seizing supply cutting off cattle till name came to be great in state of kentucky ada forster yankee though be be proud of rebel lover frank reckenthorpe other general made progress also though be progress of different kind men did not talk of so much a did of tom war office at washington knew that be useful used remained for long time attached to western army having be removed from kentucky to st louis in missouri be there when brother last heard of be fighting day night once said to one who be with from own state a far a can learn frank be writing day night upon word think have best of be couple of day after time then being about latter end of september that tom reckenthorpe found on horseback at head of three regiment of cavalry near foot of one of valley lead up into blue mountain ridge of virginia be about six mile in advance of jackson army have pushed forward with view of intercepting certain federal supply others have hoped might be within reach have expected that there must be fighting have hardly expected so much fighting a came that day in way got supply indeed got nothing blow though on day confederate must not admit that have be worsted must claim to have done more than hold own general tom fighting be on day brought to end must be understood that there be great battle fought on occasion general reckenthorpe with about trooper have found suddenly compelled to attack about double that number of federal infantry did so once then second time on occasion without breaking line to be opposed towards close of day found unhorsed still unwounded with weapon in hand pistol immediately surrounded by about dozen of own men so far in advance of body of troop a to make almost impossible that must find way back to a smoke cleared away must look about saw that be close to uneven irregular line of federal soldier there be still chance have turned for rush with pistol ready for use in hand when found confronted by federal officer pistol be already raised finger be on trigger when saw that man before be brother time be come said frank standing ground very calmly be quite unarmed have be separated from men ridden over hitherto have not be hurt frank said tom dropping pistol arm be that be not going to do then said frank do what said tom whose calmness be altogether gone have forgotten that threat a soon a have be uttered did not even know to what brother be alluding tom reckenthorpe in confusion at meeting brother have lost whatever chance there remained to of escaping stood for moment two looking at frank wondering at coincidence have brought together before turned to run then be too late in hurry scurry of affair two of own men have left saw that rush of federal soldier be coming up around nevertheless resolved to start for run give chance frank said prepared to run a went rather before have left ground on be standing before brother shot struck be disabled in minute be a though be stunned then smiled faintly slowly sunk upon ground up frank said be in at death frank reckenthorpe be soon kneeling beside brother amidst crowd of own men spurrell said to young officer who be close to be own brother what general tom said spurrell not dangerously hope by time wounded man have be able a be to feel to ascertain amount of damage done right leg said just on knee if youll believe frank thought be heart at first dont think much of wound suppose wont let go of course wouldnt let go indeed if have be minded so to do must not have gone wound be not fatal a have at first thought be matter of little consequence a afterwards asserted fighting be over unless must fight with leg amputated between knee hip before general tom found in brother quarter prisoner on parole with leg condemned by surgeon third day after saw leg amputated for three week two brother remained together after that elder be taken to washington rather to alexandria on other side of potomac a prisoner there to await chance of exchange at first intercourse between two brother be cold guarded uncomfortable after while became more kindly than have be for many day whether be cold kindly nature may be sure be such a younger brother made tom be ready enough to forget personal animosity a soon a brother must be willing to do so though be willing enough also to quarrel to quarrel bitterly a ever if frank must give occasion a to threat of pistol have passed away from tom reckenthorpe a angry word passed from be clean forgotten be not simply that have not wished to kill brother that deed be impossible to threat have be like curse mean nothing be used by passion a readiest weapon when passion be impotent with frank reckenthorpe word meant what be intended to mean threat have rankled in bosom from time of utterance to moment when strange coincidence have given threatener power of executing remembrance of be then strong upon have expected that brother must have be a bad a word brother have spared now slowly by degree began to remember that also what be plan tom said a sat one day by brother bed before removal of prisoner to alexandria plan said tom how must poor fellow like have plan to eat bread water in prison at alexandria suppose theyll let up to washington on parole must think of course can say word for well then do say id have done a much for though dont like yankee politics never mind politics now tom never did mind at rate see cant run away must have be mentioned little way back in story that poor old major have be gathered to father during past year a have said must be better for that must die have lived to see glory of country have gloried in if further glory even further gain be to come out of terrible war a great gain to men nation do come from contest be very terrible while last at least must not live to see so when be left by son turned face to wall died there have of course be much said on subject between two brother when be together frank have declared how special order have be given to protect house of widow if wave of war in kentucky must surge up around frankfort land very near to frankfort have become debateable between two army question of flying from house have more than once be mooted between aunt niece so far that evil day have be staved off a yet frankfort little capital of state be northern territory suppose will get home said frank after musing awhile look after mother ada if can will of course what else can do with one leg nothing in war tom of course then there be pause between will ada do said frank what will ada do stay at home with mother ay yes will not remain always a ada forster do mean to ask whether will marry because of one leg if will have certainly will will ought to ask if found seamed over with small pox with limb broken blind disfigured by misfortune must have visited must take a wife same if be penniless must make difference will judge for herself will expect to act by a must have acted by then there be pause look here frank continued general tom if mean that be to give up a reward to for being sent home will have nothing to do with bargain have intended no such bargain said frank gloomily very well then can do a please if ada will take will marry a soon a will let if being sent home depends upon will know how to act now nevertheless be sent home there be not word spoken between two brother about ada forster whether frank thought that might still have chance through want of firmness on part of girl whether considered that in keeping brother away from home must at least do good whether again resolved that must act by brother a brother must act without reference to ada forster will not attempt to say for day two after above conversation be somewhat sullen did not talk freely with brother after that brightened up once more before long two parted on friendly term general frank remained with command general tom be sent to hospital at alexandria to such hospitality a might be able to enjoy at washington in mutilated state till that affair of exchange have be arranged in spite of brother influence at head quarter must not be done in day must permission be obtained for to go home to kentucky till such exchange have be effected in way be kept in terrible suspense for something over two month mid winter be upon before joyful news arrived that be free to go where liked official in washington must have sent back to richmond have so pleased seeing that federal general officer supposed to be of equal weight with have be sent back from southern prison in place declined such favour declaring intention of going home to kentucky be simply warned that pas south must after be granted to then went way disturbed a be state of country nevertheless railway ran from washington to baltimore from baltimore to pittsburgh from pittsburgh

tom oh own one there never be word of question between a to whether unseemly crutch still unhealed wound be to make difference between general tom found before three hour be over that lacked courage to suggest that might not be acceptable to a lover with one leg there be time in girl throw off coyness be a bold in love a men time be with ada forster in course of month elder general simply sent

policeman really did come during time be in most wretched frame of mind knew one at ballymoy in neighbourhood from manner in be addressed also threatened by mr kirwan by who came in out of room be aware that must encounter most intense hostility have heard of irish murder heard also of love of people for priest really began to doubt whether life might not be in danger during time while be thus waiting father giles recovered consciousness have be stunned by fall mind came back to though by mean at once while be left in room with hardly seemed to remember event of past hour be able to discover from what be said that have be for day past a afterwards turned out for last month tenant of room that when arrived have be drinking tea with mr kirwan only other public bed room in hotel be occupied have with great kindness given landlady permission to put saxon stranger into chamber came out by degree must see how idea of base cruel ingratitude rankled in heart of mr kirwan be in vain

natured priest for sake of accommodating stranger have consented to give up half of room have be repaid for kindness by being perhaps murdered yet though just then hated cordially must not quite bring to look at matter a looked at there be excuse to be made if only must get anyone to listen to be using brush clothes brush indeed be said not what hed be welcome made think be intruder wasnt too much honour for like of ye said one of woman with infinite scorn in tone of voice did use gentleman clothes brush certainly said priest be first collected word have spoken felt very grateful to for seemed to that man who must condescend to remember that have used clothes brush must not really be hurt to death even though have be pushed down such very steep stair a belonging to pat kirwans hotel im sure be very welcome sir said wasnt that minded clothes brush wasnt indeed only thought indeed did think that there be only one bed have put into room have not said anything about anybody else what be to

constable have be in room for time before sergeant came with sergeant arrived also doctor priest father columb be called who a afterwards learned be curate coadjutor to father giles by time there be quite crowd in house although be past one oclock seemed that ballymoy knew that priest have be foully misused be manifest to that there be something in roman catholic religion made priest very dear to people for doubt whether in village in england have accident happened to rector people must have roused at midnight to wreak vengeance on assailant for vengeance be now beginning to clamour even before sergeant of police have come two sub constable be standing over felt that be protecting from people in order that might give up to gallows did not like ballymoy doctor at then even at later period of visit to town on arrival made way up to priest through crowd must not satisfy affection anxiety by declaring at once that there be danger instead of doing so insisted on terrible nature of outrage brutality shown by assailant at hard word said mr kirwan must urge on thats thrue for doctor deed may say that doctor two a good bed a ever christian stretched in deed be just father giless own room a may say since big storm fetched roof off riverences house below there thus gradually be learning whole history roof have be blown off father giless own house therefore have gone to lodge at inn have be willing to share lodging with stranger have be reward hope doctor that gentleman be not much hurt said very meekly do suppose gentleman like sir can be thrown down long flight of stair without being hurt said doctor in angry voice be thanks to sir that neck have not be sacrificed then there arose hum of indignation two policeman standing over bustled about little coming very close to a though thought must have something to do to protect from being torn to piece bethought that be special duty in such crisis to show spirit if be only for honour of saxon blood among celt so spoke

peculiarity of residence be disposed to quarrel with on subject made difference in dress on occasion took place on low stone seat just inside church door clothed a usual in thick red serge petticoat loose brown serge jacket such being apparel have found to be best adapted for hard perilous work among water have pleaded to clergyman when attacked on subject of church attendance with vigour that have got no church going clothes have explained to that must be received there without distinction to clothing mally have taken at word have gone with courage certainly deserved admiration though doubt whether there be not mingled with obstinacy be le admirable for people said that old glos be rich mally might have proper clothes if chose to buy mr polwarth clergyman who a old man must not come to went down rock to old man did make hint on matter in mallys absence old glos who have be patient with on other matter turned upon so angrily when made allusion to money that mr polwarth found obliged to give matter up mally continued to sit upon stone bench in short serge petticoat with long hair streaming down face did so far sacrifice to decency a on such occasion to tie up back hair with old shoestring so tied must remain through monday tuesday by wednesday afternoon mallys hair have generally managed to escape a to mallys indefatigable industry there must be manner of doubt for quantity of seaweed donkey amassed between be very surprising old glos be declared have never collected half what mally gathered together then article be becoming cheaper be necessary that exertion must be greater so mally donkey toiled toiled seaweed came up in heap surprised who looked at little hand light form be there not one who helped at night fairy demon like mally be so snappish in answer to people that have right to be surprised if ill natured thing be said of one ever heard mally trenglos complain of work about time be heard to make great loud complaint of treatment received from of neighbour be known that went with plaint to mr polwarth when must not help did not give such instant help a needed went ah so foolishly to office of certain attorney at camelford who be not likely to prove better friend than mr polwarth now nature of injury be a follows place in collected seaweed be little cove people have come to call malachi cove from name of old man who lived there be so formed that margin of sea therein must only be reached by passage from top down to trengloss breadth of cove when sea be out might perhaps be two hundred yard on side rock ran out in such way that from north south domain of trenglos be guarded from intruder locality have be well chosen for intended purpose there be rush of sea into cove carried there large drifting mass of seaweed leaving among rock when tide be out during equinoctial wind of spring autumn supply must never fail even when sea be calm long soft salt bedewed trailing mass of weed must be gathered there when must not be found elsewhere for mile along coast task of getting weed from breaker be often difficult dangerous so difficult that much of be left to be carried away by next incoming tide mally doubtless did not gather crop be there at foot what be taken by returning wave did not regret when interloper came upon cove gathered wealth grandfather wealth beneath eye then heart be broken be interloping intrusion drove poor mally to camelford attorney ala though camelford attorney took mallys money must hing for heart be broken have idea in doubt grandfather shared that path to cove be at rate property when be told that cove sea running into cove be not freehold of grandfather understood that statement might be true what then a to use of path who have made path what be have not painfully wearily with exceeding toil carried up bit of rock with own little hand that grandfather donkey might have footing for foot have not scraped together crumb of earth along face of cliff that might make easier to animal track of rugged way now when saw big farmer lad coming down with other donkey indeed there be one who came with pony boy young man old enough to know better than rob poor old man young girl reviled whole human race swore that camelford attorney be fool attempt to explain to that there be still weed enough for be worse than useless be not hers at rate be not sole way to hers be not trade stopped impeded have not be forced to back laden donkey down twenty yard said have in truth be five because farmer gunliffes son have be in way with thieving pony farmer gunliffe have wanted to buy weed at own price because have refused have set on thieving son to destroy in wicked way ill hamstring beast next time a he down here said mally to old glos while angry fire literally streamed from eye farmer gunliffes small homestead held about fifty acre of land be close by village of tintagel not mile from cliff sea wrack a call be pretty well only manure within reach doubt thought hard that must be kept from using by mally trenglos obstinacy there heap of other cove barty said mally to barty gunliffe farmer son none so nigh mally yet none fill emselves a place then explained to that must not

poor girl old man threw upon justice of thing wouldnt do at according to view that single person must take upon to own god almighty sent a common property of must do mally harm so have told mally be vixen wicked little vixen must be taught to have civil tongue in head when once mally must speak civil a went for weed must get father to pay old man sort of toll for use of path speak civil said mally never not while have tongue in mouth fear old glos encouraged rather than otherwise in view of matter grandfather did not encourage to hamstring pony hamstringing pony must be serious thing old glos thought might be very awkward for of if mally be put into prison suggested therefore that manner of impediment must be put in way of pony foot surmising that well trained donkey might be able to work in spite of barty gunliffe on next descent did find passage very awkward when came near to malachi hut made way down poor mally saw lump of rock at have laboured so hard pushed on one side rolled out of way with steady persistency of injury towards that almost drove frantic well barty youre nice boy said old glos sitting in doorway of hut a watched intruder aint doing harm to none a doesnt

breaker be afternoon in april hour be something after four oclock there have be heavy wind from north west morning with gust of rain sea gull have be in out of cove day be sure sign to mally that incoming tide must cover rock with weed quick wave be now returning with wonderful celerity over low reef time have come at treasure must be seized if be to be garnered on day by seven oclock must be growing dark at nine must be high water before daylight crop must be carried out again if not collected mally understood very well of barty be beginning to understand also a mally came down with bare foot bearing long hook in hand saw bartys pony standing patiently on sand in heart longed to attack brute barty at moment with common three pronged fork in hand be standing down on large rock gazing forth towards water have declared that must gather weed only at place be inaccessible to mally be looking out that might settle where must begin let un be let un be shouted old man to mally a saw take step towards beast hated almost a much a hated man hearing grandfather voice through wind desisted from purpose if purpose have have went forth to work a passed down cove scrambled in among rock saw barty still standing on perch out beyond white curling wave be cresting breaking with violence wind be howling among cavern abutment of cliff now then there came squall of rain though there be sufficient light heaven be black with cloud scene more beautiful might hardly be found by who love glory of coast light for such object be perfect nothing must exceed grandeur of colour blue of open sea white of breaking wave yellow sand streak of red brown gave such richness to cliff mally barty be thinking of such thing a indeed be hardly thinking of trade after ordinary form barty be meditating how must best accomplish purpose of working beyond reach of mallys feminine power mally be resolving that wherever barty went must go farther in many respect mally have advantage knew rock in spot be sure of gave good foothold sure also of did not then activity have be made perfect by practice for purpose to be to be devoted barty doubt be stronger than quite a active barty must not jump among wave from one stone to a must do be a yet able to get aid in work from very force of water a must get have be hunting seaweed in cove since have be urchin of six year old knew hole corner spot of vantage wave be friend must use must measure strength knew when where must cease mally be great down in salt pool of own cove great very fearless a watched barty make way forward from rock to rock told gleefully that be going astray curl of wind a blew into cove must not carry weed up to northern buttress of cove then there be great hole just there great hole of have spoken when wished evil now went to work hooking up dishevelled hair of ocean landing many cargo on extreme margin of sand from whence must be able in evening to drag back before invading water must return to reclaim spoil on side also barty made heap up against northern buttress of have spoken bartys heap became big still bigger so that knew let pony work a might must not take up that evening still be not a large a mallys heap mallys hook be better than fork mallys skill be better than strength when failed in haul mally must jeer with wild weird laughter shriek to through wind that be not man at first answered with laughing word before long a boasted of success pointed to failure became angry then answered no more became angry with in that missed so much of plunder before broken sea be full of long straggling growth wave have torn up from bottom of ocean mass be carried past away from nay once twice over then mallys weird voice must sound in ear jeering gloom among rock be now becoming thicker thicker tide be beating in with increased strength gust of wind came with quicker greater violence still worked on while mally worked must work must work for time after be driven in must not be beaten by girl great hole be now full of water of water seemed to be boiling a though in pot pot be full of floating mass large treasure of seaweed be thrown to fro upon surface lying there so thick that one must seem almost able to rest upon without sinking mally knew well how useless be to attempt to rescue aught from fury of boiling caldron hole went in under rock side of towards shore lay high slippery steep hole even at low water be never empty mally believed that there be bottom to fish thrown in there must escape out to ocean mile away so mally in softer mood must tell visitor to cove knew hole well poulnadioul be accustomed to call be supposed when translated to mean that be hole of evil one never did mally attempt to make own of weed have found way into pot barty gunliffe knew better watched a endeavoured to steady on treacherously slippery edge of pool fixed there made haul with small success how managed hardly knew stood still for while watching anxiously then saw slip slipped recovered slipped again again recovered barty fool screamed if get pitched in there youll never come out more whether simply wished to frighten whether heart relented have thought of danger with dismay who will say must not have told hated a much a ever must hardly have wished to see drowned before eye go on dont mind said speaking in hoarse angry tone mind who mind retorted girl then again prepared for work a went down over rock with long hook balanced in hand suddenly heard splash turning quickly round saw body of enemy tumbling amidst eddying wave in pool tide have now come up so far that succeeding wave washed into over from side nearest to sea then ran down again back from rock a rolling wave receded with noise like fall of cataract then when surplus water have retreated for moment surface of pool must be partly calm though fretting bubble must still boil up down there be ever simmer on surface a though in truth caldron be heated time of comparative rest be moment for succeeding breaker must come up almost a soon a foam of preceding one have gone then again water must be dashed upon rock side must echo with roar of angry wave instantly mally hurried across to edge of pool crouching down upon hand knee for security a did so a wave receded bartys head face be carried round near to must see that forehead be covered with blood whether be alive dead did not know have seen nothing blood light coloured hair of head lying amidst foam then body be drawn along by suction of retreating wave mass of water escaped be not on occasion large enough to carry man out with instantly mally be at work with hook getting fixed into coat dragged towards spot on be kneeling during half minute of repose got so close that must touch shoulder straining down laying over long bending handle of hook strove to grasp with right hand must not do must only touch then came next breaker forcing on with roar looking to mally a though must certainly knock from resting place destroy have nothing for to kneel hold by hook what prayer passed through mind at moment for herself for for old man who be sitting unconsciously up at cabin who can say great wave came rushed over a lay almost prostrate when water be gone from eye tumult of foam violence of roaring breaker have passed by found at length upon rock while body have be lifted up free from hook be lying upon slippery ledge half in water half out of a looked at in instant must see that eye be open that be struggling with hand hold by hook barty cried pushing stick of before while seized collar of coat in hand have be brother lover father must not have clung to with more of energy of despair did contrive to hold by stick have given when succeeding wave have passed by be still on ledge in next moment be seated yard two above hole in comparative safety while barty lay upon rock with still bleeding head resting upon lap what must do now must not carry in fifteen minute sea must be up where be sitting be quite insensible very pale blood be coming slowly very slowly from wound on forehead ever so gently put hand upon hair to move back from face then bent over mouth to see if breathed a looked at knew that be beautiful what must not give that might live nothing now be so precious to a life a life have so far rescued from water what must do grandfather must scarcely get down over rock if indeed must succeed in doing so much a must drag wounded man backwards if be only few foot so that might lie above reach of wave till further assistance must be procured set to work moved almost lifting a did so wondered at own strength be very strong at moment slowly tenderly falling on rock so that might fall on got back to margin of sand to spot water must not reach for next two hour here grandfather met having seen at last what have happened from door dada said fell into pool yonder be battered against rock see there at forehead mally im thinking that he dead already said old glos peering down over body

strong against south in return for fervour in matter future husband consented to abstain from present loud abuse of thing english generously allowed to defend own country when be abused be much a coming from american let hope that same privilege may be accorded to in future home in philadelphia in meantime during last week of girlhood cold cruel week of desperate want strove vigorously to do what little might be in power for poor of country be leaving want have be occasioned by wretched rebel of south be theory be right in much of whether american of south be wretched be rebel will not say here of there can be doubt that created misery then endured have way of making widow said again uncle robert must not let give away cloak gave other day must have to give said mr granger exactly

granger mr frew who be living in liverpool always came over to plumstock on friday evening spent saturday sunday with rector family for saturday be happy day for frederick f frew be good lover liked to be with nora to walk with to talk with liked to show that loved to make gracious pleasant be not so sure that coming be equally agreeable to mr granger mr frew must talk about american politics praising feeling spirit of countryman in north whereas mr granger when driven into subject be constrained to make battle for south prejudice what must have called judgment went with south be not ashamed of opinion disliked arguing with frederic f frew fear must be confessed that frederic f frew be too strong for in such argument why must be so can not say american argues more closely on politics than doe englishman conviction be not truer on account very often le true a be conclusion of logician because trust to syllogism be often false instead of to experience of life daily working of mind though not more true in political conviction than englishman be more unanswerable therefore mr granger did not care to discus subject of american war with frederic f frew riles frew said a sat after dinner in plumstock drawing room on friday evening before christmas day to hear folk talking of election think war will come to end rebel of south have own way because democrat have carried ticket will have tendency said parson not inch more than carrying reform bill repealing corn law have tendency to put down throne same sort of argument two party be at dagger drawn about reform bill did not cause to split on other matter throne wasnt in question said parson be war in question not in way most popular democrat in state at moment be mclellan say one be so anxious to see war ended whoever say so slander if dont trust deed look at word believe in said parson then put aside a nobody cant do for be man whom largest party in northern state trust most implicitly fact be sir frederic f frew gave proper twang to last letter of last word none of here understand politics cant realise blessing of molly give tea said rector in loud voice when matter went a far a did not care by what

victory union said frederic f frew exhaustion said charley from oxford compromise said bobby from liverpool lord almighty when will have done work said parson in meantime molly do keep plenty of fire under kitchen boiler be clearly business of present hour for in mr granger part of country may say indeed for on mr granger side of water mattered little then in lancashire whether new york might have democratic republican governor old cotton have be burned present crop must not be garnered future crop crop never must be future must not get sown mr granger might be slow politician be practical man understanding thing immediately around be aware frederic f frew with rest of that be right when bade wife keep fire well hot beneath kitchen boiler isnt almost wicked to be married in such time a be much later in evening when nora still troubled in mind about widow mite whispered word into lover ear if be to give up lover for twelve month must not that be throwing in of something to treasury from off own back out of own mouth then matter of marriage have be so fully settled that feared to think of disturbing must never consent to postponement then offering to be of avail for must be taken from own back not from nora have idea in making of such offering a suggested mr frederic f frew must conceive that have contributed by far greater part uncle called amalekite doubted whether must be just to spoil amalekite after fashion a nevertheless into ear whispered little proposition wicked to get married said frederic not according to idea of christian religion oh know what mean gave arm slight caressing pinch at time uncle have gone to own room cousin have gone to study by believe intended to signify proper smoking of pipe of tobacco in rectory kitchen mr granger seated in easy chair have

aunt im going to bed then returned again across room whispered to lover ill tell what sir ill marry on th of january if youll take just a be now with bonnet on shawl over dress exactly a walked out with before dinner when made promise never said anything about fine clothes may come in old red cloak if like very well now mind ive got consent good night sir after will only be mite have turned towards door have hand upon lock came back into room close up to will not be quarter of mite said how can be anything if get then kissed hurried away out of room before must again speak to what what what said mr granger waking up so nora have gone have gone yes just minute said frew who have turned face to fire so that tear in eye might not be seen a took off to bed swore to that nora field be trump that have done well in securing for wife never occurred to that be in way in earnest about wedding dress be trump because be so expressive in love to because eye shone so brightly when spoke eagerly on matter a to appearing at altar in red cloak a be more probable in own customary thick woollen shawl never thought about of course must be married a other girl be married have nora thought of till that moment in made proposition to lover a have said before veil be ordered so be white silk dress bonnet also have be ordered with bridal wreath other thing assorting therewith vast hole be to be made in grand aunt legacy for payment of finery a mr granger have said to in so spending must best please future husband have enough of own must not care that must provide with article must afterwards give at expense of little smartness at wedding american like at rate a well a englishman nora with honesty lady may not admire have asked lover question in plainest language will have to buy thing so much sooner have said id buy to morrow only youll not let must rather think not master fred then have gone off with aunt ordered wedding clothes now a prepared for bed after conversation have just be recorded began to think in earnest whether must not be well to dispense with white silk orange wreath while so many be dispensing with be forced to dispense with bread fuel must bedizen with finery from liverpool while uncle be a well knew refusing set of new shirt wanted sorely in order that might send to fund at money must cost be throwing in two mite daily a be aunt who toiled unceasingly at woollen shawl woollen stocking so that went on knitting even in sleep nora since earnestness of bad day began have done little nothing needle indeed have be very busy have be busy in preparation for mr frederic f frews nuptials even bob charley worked for relief committee have done nothing nothing given two pound have offered four uncle with self restraint never before afterwards practised by have chucked back two saying that must not be too hard even upon amalekite a thought of word asked whether be not more incumbent on than on one else to do something in way of self sacrifice be now briton must shortly be american must be said of that distress of own countrywoman countrywoman whom be leaving did not wring heart be not without pang that prepared to give up nationality owner rank a first in world most of who own rank if not a first then a second now seemed to a though be deserting own family in distress deserting own ship in time of storm be going over to from whom distress storm have come be not needful that must do something that must satisfy that have be willing to suffer in cause must throw in two mite if did know where to find must only do in truth said to herself a rose from prayer by throwing in have got one very great treasure have not got anything else that care about after isnt so easy to be widow with two mite then sat down thought about a to postponing marriage that knew to be in truth quite out of question even if must bring to do everybody about must say that be mad mr frederic f frew might not impossibly destroy with one of pretty revolver sometimes brought out from liverpool for to play with be not practicable for to give up wedding clothes there must be considerable difficulty even in a to having be ordered that might be overcome by sacrifice of portion of price then aunt even uncle must oppose cousin must cover with ridicule in latter might however achieve something of widowhood after loss must fall more upon f f frew than upon really did not care for in what clothes be married so that be made wife a regarded might not be disagreeable to to stand before altar with dowdy creature in old gown then there be one other consideration must not seem that be throwing in two mite publicly before eye of men a pharisee might do must there not be ostentation in widowhood a continued to reflect cast last thought behind might be so said of if such saying be untrue if offering be made in widow spirit not in spirit of pharisee must not be cowardly to regard what men might say such false accusation must make part of two mite ill go into liverpool about on monday said to herself a finally tucked clothes around early in following morning be up out of room with view of seeing aunt before came down to breakfast first person met be uncle accosted in one of passage what nora be early for be going to have morning lover walk with frederic franklin frederic franklin a choose to call uncle said nora never come out of room much before breakfast time raining hard lover a be ought not to mind rain must mind very much uncle want to speak to very seriously have be making up mind about something there nothing wrong be there dear there nothing very wrong be not exactly about anything being wrong hardly know how to tell what be then paused must see by light of candle in hand that blushed hadnt better speak to aunt said mr granger thats what meant to do when got up said nora a have met if dont mind assured that did not mind putting hand upon shoulder caressingly promised assistance in power im not afraid that will ask anything ought not to do for then revealed to scheme turning face away from a spoke will be so horrid said to have great box of finery coming home when be giving up everything for poor people if dont think must be wrong cant be wrong said uncle may be question whether must be wise mean wrong to if be to be other clergyman must be ashamed of a be to marry dont think need mind about clergyman of course must tell foster girl foster girl yes be to be bridesmaid be nearly sure have not bought anything new yet of course must think very dowdy dont care bit about must just tell that have made up mind that couldnt afford wedding clothes must be true wouldnt question be about wild american isnt wild american well then about tamed american what will say said might come in old cloak have told then be afraid thought be only joking uncle if youll help think can bring round dare say can to anything just at present didnt at mean that indeed im sure couldnt bring round to putting off marriage no not to to anything else know be laughing at dont much mind being laughed at must save very nearly fifteen pound if not quite think of youd give to soup kitchen id give to for distress then uncle spoke to somewhat gravely youre good girl nora dear good girl think understand thought on matter love for doubt whether there be necessity for to make sacrifice marriage must be gala festival according to mean of people married bridegroom have right to expect that bride will come to fairly arrayed bright with wedding trapping think can do pet without robbing of little bravery oh a for of course can do without there be little soreness in tone not because be feeling to be misunderstood because knew that must not explain further must not tell uncle that poor among jew might have be relieved without contribution of two mite that widow must have lost have not so contributed have hardly arranged thought a to double blessing of charity certainly must not express with reference to own case felt need of giving in time of trouble something that valued be right when have said that be hard to be widow how many among when give give from off own back from out of own mouth who can say that have sacrificed want of own that have abandoned comfort that have worn threadbare coat when coat with gloss on have be customary wear that have fared roughly on cold scrap whereas well spread board have be usual daily practice who have done so have thrown in two mite for will charity produce double blessing nora thought that be not well in uncle to tell that must do without wedding clothes of course must do without soon threw word behind went back upon word have preceded bridegroom have right to expect that bride will come to fairly arrayed after must depend upon circumstance suppose bride have mean of arraying fairly without getting into debt must bridegroom expect in case if hell consent will said a prepared to leave uncle youll drive to offer to pay for thing dare say will then hell drive to refuse may be quite sure of uncle that clothes do wear will never see bill of then conference be ended ive made calculation again said bob at breakfast feel convinced that if act of parliament must be passed restricting consumption of food in christmas week entire week mind to of ordinary week must get two million of money that two million must tide over till indian cotton come in of course mean by food butcher meat grocery spirit wine only think that by one measure must not entail real disappointment on one whole thing must be done act of parliament wouldnt give money said father of course dont really mean act of parliament must be absurd people might give up christmas dinner great many will doubt many of most in earnest be pretty nearly giving up daily dinner who be indifferent will go on feasting same a ever cant make sacrifice obligatory must be sacrifice if did said nora still thinking of wedding clothes doubt whether sacrifice ever do real good said frederick f frew oh fred said nora have rather high authority a to benefit of self denial said parson man who cant sacrifice must be selfish said bobby be agreed to hate selfish people what about widow mite said mr granger thats very well may knock down with bible if like a might do also if talked about pre adamite formation believe word of bible believe that understand thoroughly might understand better if studied more said parson very likely wont be so uncourteous a to say same thing of elder now about sacrifice wouldnt wish to keep people in distress that might benefit by releasing people in distress be there said nora oughtnt to be there a self sacrifice after be very insufficient to prevent distress there certainly seems to be question open whether other mode must not be tried give country in humanitarian principle be so exercised that one will be degraded by receipt of charity seems to that like poor people here in england that may gratify yourselves by giving not a much to eat a want just enough to keep skin from falling off bone charity may have double blessing may also have double curse not charity mr frew said mr granger look at lady bountifuls of course depends on heart continued lady charity if be charity ill tell said frederic f frew interrupting in philadelphia in matter be best organised city know im going down to village said parson jumping up who be to come with escaped out of room before frew have have opportunity of saying word further about philadelphia thats way with uncle always said turning to nora almost in anger certainly be most conclusive argument know that of running away mr granger meant to be conclusive said elder lady pity be that never convinces mr granger probably have desire of convincing ah well doe not signify said frew when man have pulpit of own why must trouble to argue in place where counter argument must be met sustained nora be almost angry with lover whom regarded a stronger more clever than of uncle family tyrannical sometimes overbearing in use of strength one by one aunt cousin left room be left alone with have taken up newspaper a refuge in wrath for in truth did not like manner in allusion to own country be generally treated at parsonage there be englishman who think that man differing with be bound to bet with on point in dispute then decline to back opinion such men say when bet be refused feeling of american be same a to who be unwilling to argue with considers that intelligent being be bound to argue whenever matter of argument be offered to can understand that subject may be too sacred for argument frederic f frew on present occasion be a dog from whose very mouth bone have be taken have given one two loud open growl now sat with newspaper showing teeth a far a spirit of thing went be in humour nora found called upon to attack on question of own proposed charity knew well that must bark even at if thing went wrong with then never bite said to herself have told that

austrian who left venice in spring early summer of year last past year hatred felt by venetian towards austrian soldier who held city in thraldom have reached culminating point for year hatred have be very strong how strong can hardly be understood by who never recognise fact that there have be so to say mingling of conquered conqueror process of assimilation between italian vassal german master venice a city be a purely italian a though barrack be filled with hungarian long legged soldier cafs crowded with white coated austrian officer regiment held town lived a completely after own fashion a though be quartered in pesth prague vienna with exception that in venice be enabled indeed from circumstance be compelled to exercise palpable ascendency belonged to nowhere else be master daily visible a such to eye of one who merely walked narrow way of city strolled through open square a master be a separate a gaoler be separate from prisoner austrian officer sat together in chief theatre having best part of to few among spoke italian none of common soldier did so venetian seldom spoke german must hold intercourse with croat hungarian bohemian of whom garrison be chiefly composed must not be otherwise than that there must be intense hatred in city so ruled hatred have be intense for year have reached boiling point in may preceding outbreak of war other nation might desire to do italy at rate be at time resolved to fight be not that king government be so resolved what be purpose just then of power of state if purpose have then be definitely formed by one now know history perhaps may day tell nation be determined to fight hitherto have be done for italian by outside ally now time have come in italian must do something for people hated french aid by have be allowed to live burned with desire to prove that must do something great without aid there be enormous army that army must be utilised for enfranchisement of venetia to great glory of italy king minister appreciated fact that fervour of people be too strong to be repressed be probably guided to such resolution a did make by appreciation feeling be a strong in venice a be in florence in milan in venice only rather in venetia only outward sign of such feeling be repressible be repressed through lombardy tuscany young man who pleased might volunteer with garibaldi to volunteer with garibaldi be not at first so easy for young men in verona in venice more complete be repression greater be difficulty stronger of course arose hatred of venetian for austrian soldiery have never heard that austrian be cruel in what did be determined a long a have intention of holding province be necessary that must be so during past winter there have be living in venice certain captain von vincke hubert von vincke austrian officer of artillery who have spent last four five year among fortification of verona who have come to venice originally on account of ill health military employment have kept in venice remained there till outbreak of war going backwards forward occasionally to verona still having venice a head quarter now captain von vincke have shown so much consideration for country assisted in holding under subjection a to learn language to study manner have by mean found way more le into italian society be thorough soldier good looking perhaps eight twenty thirty year of age well educated ambitious very free from common vice of thinking that class of mankind to belonged be only class in must be worth man while to live nevertheless imbued with strong feeling that austria ought to hold own that austrian army be indomitable that quadrilateral fortress bound together a be now bound by austrian strategy be impregnable so much captain von vincke thought believed on part of country in thinking believing be still desirous that much must be done to relieve austrian italy from grief of foreign rule that italy must think of succeeding in repelling austria from venice be to absurdity have become intimate at house of widow lady who lived in campo san luca one signora pep whose son have first become acquainted with captain von vincke at verona carlo pep be young advocate living earning bread at venice business have taken for time to verona when leaving city have asked austrian friend to come see in mother house madame pep daughter nina carlos only sister have somewhat found fault with young advocate rashness in thus seeking close intimacy of home life with one whom might be own peculiar virtue must not recognise a enemy of country must be very fine if be put into book said signora to son who have be striving to show that austrian if good in might be a worthy friend a italian be always well to live on safe side of wall be not convenient that sheep wolf must drink at same stream said with caution everywhere form so marked trait in italian character who go softly go soundly half of italian nature be told in proverb though be not half be becoming most apparent in doings of nation in day signorina be quite of one mind with mother carlo said how be that one never see one of austrian in house of friend why be have never yet found in room with one of because men woman be generally so pig headed unreasonable carlo have replied how be for instance ever to learn what german be at core frenchman englishman if refuse to speak to one ended by captain von vincke being brought to house in campo san luca there becoming a intimate with signora signorina a be with advocate story must be necessarily too short to permit to see how affair grew in soft delicate growth by beginning of april nina pep have confessed love to hubert von vincke captain nina have have few word with signora on subject of projected marriage carlo will never allow old lady have said trembling a thought of danger be coming upon family must not have brought captain von vincke to house unless be prepared to regard thing a possible said nina proudly think be too good fellow to object to anything that will ask said captain holding by hand lady whom hoped to call mother in law throughout january february captain von vincke have be invalid in march have be hardly more than convalescent have then have time opportunity convalescence give for sweet business of love making during time through march in first week of april carlo pep have be backwards forward to verona have in truth have more business on hand than simply belonged to a lawyer be day in italian be beginning to prepare for great attack be to be made in correspondence be busily carried on between italy venetia a to enrolment of venetian volunteer will be understood that venetian be allowed to go into italy without austrian passport at time austrian be becoming doubly strict in seeing that order be not evaded of course be evaded daily twice in april did young pep travel between verona bologna in spite of austria must say to contrary when at venice von vincke discussed very freely position of country nothing of course being said a to journey to bologna indeed of one in campo san luca knew aught be such journey that man say nothing of to mother sister even to wife unless have a much confidence in courage a have in love of politics must talk freely a must also german though of must speak of cause a though two be simply philosophical looker on be not must not become actor though have in mind settled resolve to bear with political opinion of other came to pas that now again be on verge of quarrelling fault think be wholly with carlo pep whose enthusiasm of course be growing a journey to bologna be made successfully who be beginning to feel assured that italy at last must certainly do something for herself there have not come open quarrel not a yet when nina in lover presence be arguing a to impropriety of bringing captain von vincke to house if captain von vincke be to be regarded a altogether unfit for matrimonial purpose at moment carlo be absent at verona be to return on following morning be decided at conference between two lady lover carlo must be told on return of captain von vinckes intention captain von vincke must tell there be certain hotel coffee house place of general public entertainment in venice kept by german called hotel bauer probably from name of german who keep stand near church of st moses behind grand piazza between great canal in narrow intricate throng of little street be approached by close dark water way robs of attempt at hotel grandeur nevertheless be large commodious house at good dinner may be eaten at price somewhat lower than be compatible with grandeur of grand canal used to be much affected by german have perhaps acquired among venetian character of being attached to austrian interest there be not much in carlo pep must not have frequented house even in company with friend von vincke did so frequent now on occasion of return home von vincke left word for that must breakfast at hotel at eleven oclock pep by time must have gone home after journey must have visited office von vincke also must have done greatest part of day work understood habit of other met at bauers for breakfast be end of april carlo pep have returned to venice full of scheme for revolution now regarded a imminent alliance between italy prussia be already discussed italian who be most eager said that be thing done italian be more eager than carlo pep be believed at time more thoroughly believed in italy than elsewhere that austria prussia must certainly go to war now if ever italy must do something for carlo pep be in mood full of thing when sat down to breakfast at bauers with friend captain von vincke von vincke said in three month time will be out of venice will said other where will be in vienna a hope at berlin if can get there will not be here in quadrilatere unless be left behind a prisoner captain went on for awhile cutting meat drinking wine before made reply to pep said more of same kind expressing strongly opinion that empire of austrian in venice be at end then captain wiped moustache carefully with napkin did speak carlo friend said be rash to say why rash said carlo understand other just so friend know how far that long eared waiter may understand of waiter have heard nothing care if did beyond continued captain make difficulty for what be to say when tell thing that must have one political opinion be natural question between in abstract point of view can discus with willingly possibility of venice contending with austria must discus if such rebellion be imminent when tell that be imminent that be already here can not discus be imminent said carlo so be said von vincke then finished breakfast in silence be very unfortunate for friend captain who have come to bauers with intention of speaking on quite subject friend pep have evidently taken what have said in bad spirit be angry with nevertheless a have told nina mother that must declare purpose to carlo on morning must do be not man to be frightened out of purpose by friend ill will come into piazza smoke cigar said von vincke feeling that must begin upon other subject better a soon a scene must be changed why not let have cigar coffee here said carlo because have something to say can say better walking than sitting come along then paid bill left house walked in silence through narrow way to piazza von vincke said word till found in broad passage leading into great square then put hand through others arm told tale at once carlo said love sister must have for wife will consent by body of bacchus what be say said other drawing arm away looking up into german face simply that have consented mother be willing must be brother be madness said carlo pep on part mean yes on yours be there nothing else to prevent how must there be marriage between when war be coming believe in war be believe in war between italy war can affect here in venice if there be to be war in will be concerned im quite willing to wait till be over understand nothing about said carlo after pause nothing be in dark altogether how must not be so when who be over never tell anything will not consent be thing out of question do think that be personally unfit to be sister husband not personally politically nationally be not one of now at moment attempt at close union between austrian venetian must be ruinous von vincke be heartily sorry for blame woman not then carlo pep went home there be rough scene between mother scene still rougher between sister in interview told something though not whole of truth a to engagement into have entered that be to be officer second in command in regiment of venetian volunteer of volunteer whom be hoped that garibaldi must lead to victory in coming war did not tell did make understand that when struggle came must be away from venice must take part in how be to do said if here be joined hand heart to austrian house divided against must fall let reader understand that nina pep in spite of love of lover be a good italian a brother that mother be equally firm in political desire national antipathy where must have found venetian man woman who did not detest austrian rule look forward to good day coming when venice must be city of italia signora nina have indeed six month before be much stronger in hatred of thing german than have son brother have be liberal feeling declaration that even german might be good have induced to allow austrian to come among then man soldier have be two von vincke have shown tendency so strongly at variance with of comrade that have disarmed fear have read italian condescended to speak knew old history of once great city must listen to when talked of old doge loved church palace picture gradually have come to love nina pep with heart nina loved too with heart when brother spoke to to mother with more than customary vehemence of what be due from to country of debt certainly must be paid by of obligation to from must not free told also that by time six month not austrian must be found in venice trembled believed nina felt that love must not run smooth must be with against said carlo why then did bring here nina replied be

believe in war not only venice italy be in earnest captain von vincke foresaw thought that foresaw that time of wretched misery be coming upon devoted town must never give up nina perhaps might be well that must cease to press suit till might be enabled to do so with something of clat of austrian success now at last became necessary that two woman must be told of carlos plan for carlo be going

doe with english be not allowed to run with so uncontrollable stream young lover especially young woman be more subject to control be le inclined to imagine that thing must go a must have nina when be made to understand that war be come that brother be leaving mother venice that might fight for austrian must for time be regarded a enemy in house resolved with slow melancholy firmness that must accept circumstance of destiny if fall said carlo must then manage for must not wish to bind after death talk like carlo nay child must talk like be at least well that must understand other know that

will be country people people a said gently laid hand upon arm touch of finger thrilled through whole frame put out arm a though to grasp in embrace hubert must not be till venice be own wish be said will never be so may make traitor in heart will not drive out fifty thousand troop from fortress understand thing hubert have felt country power to be so strong that can not now doubt be absurd to doubt yet say that will succeed be impossible even though prussia must be able to stand against must not leave venetia will never leave fortress then love may say farewell for ever will not forget

know a little of a might be possible that carlo pep be coming going in service of cause must not surmise must authenticated information reach a to whither carlo went how came might become duty to put stop to carlos coming carlos going on matter therefore said nothing merely shook head smiled with melancholy smile when spoke of future struggle now hubert must go be determined must see might tell

mother said when found again with signora little dream of life be over have be very short nay child life be long for yet there will be many dream much of reality complain of carlo nina continued be sacrificing much perhaps everything for venice why must sacrifice be greater than mine feel to be severe very severe why did bring here if felt thus june came that month of june be to be so fatal to italian glory so fraught with success for italian cause carlo pep be again away who knew nothing of doings knew only that have gone to verona on matter of law who be really acquainted with circumstance of present life be aware that have made way out of verona that be already with volunteer near lake waiting for garibaldi who be then expected from caprera for week to come for month probably during war perhaps two woman in campo san luca must know nothing of whereabouts of fate of whom loved have gone to risk for cause too must be content to risk in remaining desolate at home without comfort of presence also without sweeter comfort of other presence be thus that woman fight battle in day men by hundred be making way out of venice by thousand out of province of venetia austrian be endeavouring in vain to stop emigration few be caught kept in prison many austrian threat be uttered against who must prove to be insubordinate be difficult for garrison to watch whole people very difficult indeed when there be war on hand at last became fact that man from province must go become volunteer under garibaldi if pleased very many did go history will say that be successful success certainly be not glorious be in month of june that battle of short war be fought nothing will ever be said sung in story to honour of volunteer who served in campaign with garibaldi amidst mountain of southern tyrol nowhere probably during war be there so much continued fighting equal amount endured of hardship of military life task have before of driving austrian from fortress amidst own mountain be impossible one impossible even have garibaldi be supplied with ordinary military equipment ridiculously impossible for in nakedness in be sent nothing be done to enable to succeed that must be successful be neither intended desired be in fact then a have be always since day in gave naples to italy simply stumbling block in way of king of king minister of king general there be that garibaldi again with volunteer flocking to by thousand what will do to rid ourselves of garibaldi volunteer how will dispose of have be feeling of in power in italy not unnaturally feeling with regard to garibaldi man so honest so brave so patriotic so popular so impracticable can not have be trouble to here be with twenty five thousand volunteer armed after fashion supplied at least with red shirt what must be done with garibaldi army so sent away up into mountain where game of play might at rate detain for week in meantime everything might get arranged by benevolent omnipotent interference of emperor thing did get arranged while garibaldi be up among mountain kicking with unarmed toe against austrian prick with sad detriment to foot thing did get arranged very much to advantage of venetia not exactly by interference of emperor fact of war became known more slowly in venice than did in florence in paris in london that battle of custozza have be fought lost by italian troop be known then be known that battle of lissa also have be fought lost by italian ship be not known till autumn be near at hand venetia have in fact be surrendered there be rumour men in venice doubted rumour woman who knew that husband have be beaten must not believe that success be to be result of such calamity there be week in came news from carlo pep to woman in campo san luca then came simply tidings that have be wounded will see son never again said widow in ecstasy of misery nina be able to talk to mother only of carlo of hubert von vincke spoke not then word repeated to herself over over again last promise have given have sent away from now knew nothing of whereabouts that must be fighting presumed have heard that most of soldier from venice have gone to fortress too might be wounded might be dead if alive at end of war must hardly return to after what have passed between if did not come back lover must ever take kiss from lip then there be long truce letter from carlo reached venice wound have be slight have be very hungry wrote in great anger abusing not austrian italian there have be treachery italian general in chief have be head of traitor king be traitor emperor be traitor concerned be traitor yet venetia be to be surrendered to italy think that two lady in campo san luca never really believed that must be so until received that angry letter from carlo when may get home can not tell said hardly care to return will remain with general a long a may wish to have anyone remaining with may be sure that will never go soldiering again venetia may perhaps prosper become part of italy there will be glory for have be allowed to hing for mother sister endeavoured to feel sympathy for young soldier who spoke so sadly of own career must hardly be unhappy because fighting be over cause be won cause be won gradually there came to be doubt about that be now september a yet have not come to pas shop window be filled with wonderful portrait of victor emmanuel garibaldi cheek by jowl being two men who at moment be perhaps in italy most antagonistic to other be there a yet fifty different new journal cried day night under arcade of grand piazza advocating cause of italy one indivisible a there came to be month afterwards still be known that austria be to cede venetia that venice must henceforth be city of italy be known be also known in campo san luca carlo pep though very hungry up among mountain be still safe then nina thought that time have come in must become to speak of lover mother said must know something of hubert how nina how will learn will not wait till carlo come back said can not wait longer have kept promise venice be longer austrian will seek have kept word to carlo now will keep word to hubert how to seek widow

amusement of boston indeed be not bad fun there be fashionable course for sleighing brighton road along drive seated among fur with young lady beside if can get one to trust horse horse carry little bell add to charm motion be rapid pleasant be great thing see be seen by everybody of course be expedient that frost must be sound perfect so that sleigh must run over dry smooth surface a season draw to end when sleighing intimacy have become close warm horse be made to travel through slush wet scene becomes one of peril discomfort though one also of excitement not unfrequently of love sleighing be fairly over at time of now speak so that brighton road be deserted in slush sloppiness nevertheless there be possibility of sleighing a be stranger newly arrived young friend of mine took rather allowed to take out so that glory of charioteer might be mine guess be not alone said after have passed bridge out of town there young hoskins with pheely gledd just ahead of be first have ever heard of ophelia then a pushed along after instigated by foolish briton ambition to pas yankee whip did hear good deal about in addition to what have already be told then heard that mr hannibal hoskins to pas whom on road be now only earthly desire be miss gledds professed admirer in point of fact that be known to boston that have offered hand to more than once already have accepted now at rate said looking at close contiguity on sleigh before friend explained to that such be by mean probable that miss gledd have twenty hanger on of same description with one of whom might be seen sleighing walking dancing that argument a to further purpose on part be to be deduced from such practice girl said friend dont go about tied to mother apron a girl do in old country free institution c c confessed blunder acknowledged that wide perhaps salutary latitude be allowed to feminine creation on side of atlantic do must couldnt pas hannibal hoskins whether guessed that be ambitious englishman whether have general dislike to be passed on road dont know raised whip to horse went away from suddenly very quickly through slush snow be half gone hard ridge of remained across road so that sleigh

for horse said hoskins a wiped perspiration from brow looked down upon fiercest of quadruped sprawling up to withers in snow then turned to miss gledd who be endeavouring to unroll from fur oh miss gledd be so sorry what be to say youd better say that horse ran away think said miss gledd then stepped carefully out on to buffalo robe moved across from quite dry footed on to sleigh a friend hoskins be very intimate must a thought get on very well by with dbris in ditch offered to drive miss gledd back to town looked at with eye gave a thought peculiar thanks then remarked that have come

being short of acquaintance when young yankee dandy with very stiff neck informed that miss gledd wanted to speak to having given intimation took off with air of disgust among long necked bottle mr green said have just be introduced to a be being whisked away by hoskins in sleigh mr green believe owe apology when took sleigh from didnt know be britisher didnt indeed be little nettled endeavoured to explain to that englishman must be just a ready to give up carriage to lady a american oh dear yes of course said didnt mean that now ive put foot into worse than ever thought be at home here knew

be not woman be pert a be one be what mean something like yet love country so dearly must sooner live there than in other land in world if only thought must be accepted english people continued be certainly wanting in intelligence must read in anxiety of say about england how much think of will england say of will england think of will england do in matter a concern be first thought a to matter be of importance to abuse admire abuse despise be difference so wont tell anything about mr pryor well shant ask again never again ask favour have be refused then turned away to old gentleman be talking to mother conversation be at end must confess that a walked away from chesnut street into beacon street across common anxiety be more keen with regard to mr pryor than a concerned miss gledd be englishman old friend being also man not much younger than be one regarding whom might perhaps form correct judgment a to what must what must not suit must do well in taking ophelia gledd home to england with a wife must be accepted there a have phrased accepted in such fashion a to make contented be intelligent so intelligent that few woman whom must meet in proposed new country must beat there be pleasant good humoured true a believed must be accepted in london there be freedom easiness about readiness to say anything came into mind absence of reticence must go very hard with in london never have heard say anything that must not have said perhaps after have got prejudice in england when next met pryor spoke to about miss gledd long short of be said that people say that be going to marry what sort of people be backing against hannibal hoskins other night at club seemed clear that be favourite vulgarity of people surpasses anything that ever dreamed of said pryor be of

pedlington boston assumes to be athens of state will go home by first boat next month have said nothing to about miss gledd be clear that if went home by first boat next month must go home without

fellow citizen have always hated since day on have driven miss gledd home have generally attributed hatred to manner in wore hat on one side confess have often felt amazed that miss gledd must have so far encouraged think may at rate declare that must not have be accepted in london not accepted for much yet hannibal hoskins be not bad fellow true devotion to ophelia gledd proved that miss gledd said speaking to from sleigh do remember calamity there be very ditch not hundred yard ahead of here be very knight that took home in sleigh said laughing hoskins sat bolt upright took off hat why took off hat dont know unless thereby got opportunity of putting on again little more on one side mr hoskins must not have goodness to upset again suppose said sir said hoskins raised rein squared up

nothing on earth over earth under earth must ever move be sufficient yet thought be so fond of england so be too like nay love that ease of manner posse can not reach then there be silence between for perhaps mile yet be driving slow a did not wish to bring journey to end have fully made up mind that must be in way better for friend pryor that must give up thought of western aspasia yet be anxious to talk to about a though such marriage be still on card have seemed that lately have thrown herself much into intimacy with that be anxious to speak openly to if must only allow have already declared on former occasion that must ask further question about mr pryor at last plucked up courage put to direct proposition about future tenor of life after that have said about mr hoskins suppose may expect to hear that have at last accepted must not have asked question of english girl ever knew not even of own sister in plain term yet took not only without anger even without surprise answered a

just so what must baronet wife say to with sharp boston notion cant see looking at over length of drawing room cant fancy how pert must be what snappish word must say to baronet upon whole dont think must do better with mr hoskins again sat silent for time have now asked question to be bound to give true answer answer must be true a to herself without reference to pryor be sitting back in sleigh tamed a be by own thought have looked at a though have really wanted counsel if be to answer in truth said be to answer in truth then said can only bid take of two whom love be if be case that love love said if be case continued that love then leave a be be not then to think of man happiness certainly not by marrying without affection ah may regret with affection for of do feel affection asked a

credit know two men said do ask that when word be spoken jumped from sleigh hurried up step to father door in very truth hat glove of hannibal hoskins have influenced a have influenced have done so although knew how devoted be a son brother for full month after have further conversation with miss gledd with mr pryor on subject at time be living in habit of daily intimacy with pryor a did not speak to about ophelia did not often mention name to be aware that be often with at rate often in company did not believe that have daily habit of going to house a must have done have be accepted suitor indeed believed to be man who must be very persevering in offering love who if persistently refused must not probably tender again still talked of returning to england though have fixed day purposed doing so early in may used such influence a have in endeavouring to keep at boston till time miss gledd also constantly saw indeed one must not live in society of boston without seeing almost daily be aware that mr hoskins be frequently with a regarded betokened nothing a have before endeavoured to explain never deserted friend have idea of being reserved in manner with man because be reported that such man be lover must be very gracious to hannibal in mr pryors presence yet be evident at rate to that in doing so have thought of grieving english admirer be one day seated in room at hotel when servant brought up card misther hoskins he waiting below want to see yer honour very partickler said raw irishman mr hoskins have never done honour of calling on before have ever become intimate with even at club nevertheless a have come to of course be willing to see so be shown up into room when entered hat be suppose in hand looked a though have be on one side of head moment before a though must be on one side again moment left beg pardon mr green said perhaps ought not to intrude upon here intrusion at wont take chair put hat down did take chair wouldnt put hat down confess have be actuated by foolish desire to see placed for few minute in properly perpendicular position ive just come ill tell why ive come there be thing mr green in man doesnt like to be interfered with must not agree with in doing so expressed hope that mr hoskins have not be interfered with to very disagreeable extent well scorn to say that boston dandy said waall if story be written by englishman le conscientious than that latter form of letter be one must adopt in endeavour to convey sound a uttered by mr hoskins well dont quite know about now mr green im not quarrelsome man dont go about with six shooter in pocket dont want to fight nohow if can help in answer to be obliged to tell sincerely hoped that must not have to fight that if fighting became necessary to trusted that fighting propensity must not be directed against friend of mine dont do much in way on side of water said be well aware of said dont want one to teach be usage of genteel life in england be there whole fall two year ago a regard said dont think much good be ever done by duelling that depends sir on how thing eventuate mr green satisfaction of description be not what desiderate on present occasion wish to know whether mr pryor be be not engaged to marry miss ophelia gledd if be mr hoskins dont know sir be friend admitted again assured mr hoskins knew nothing of such engagement pleaded also be friend a well a too admitted again declared that from side have be made aware of fact of such engagement then mr green said may ask for own private opinion upon whole be inclined to think that might not so told in what most courteous word must find for occasion bust at first grew very long stiff hat became more still more sloped a held began to fear that though might not have six shooter in pocket have nevertheless kind of pistol in thought at last started up on foot confronted a thought with look of great anger word when came be no longer angry mr green said if knew ive done to get that girl heart be instantly softened to for aught know said may have moment for asking said no voice be very melancholy a spoke looked into sloping hat ive just come from chesnut street think shes rather more turned against than ever be tall man good looking after fashion dark with thick black shiny hair huge bold moustachio like style of appearance certainly have manly bearing in society of boston generally be regarded a stout fellow well able to hold own a man by mean soft green feminine yet now in presence of stranger to be almost cry about lady love in england man tell that have be rejected then in england so few men tell to others anything of real feeling a ophelia have said to be hard polished nobody know anything about anybodys anything what must say to did say something went so far a to assure have heard miss gledd speak of in highest language at last perhaps hinted though dont think did quite hint that if pryor be out of way hoskins might find lady more kind soon became quite confidential a though be bosom friend perceived think be not anxious that pryor must carry off prize wished to teach pryor that prize be not such prize a must suit shes very girl for boston said in energy put to mr green hasnt gait of going must suit london whether gait of going must must not suit metropolis did not undertake to say in presence of mr hoskins did at last say must speak to pryor so that field might be left open for others if have intention of running for cup must not be taken indeed charmed by honest strength of affection hannibal hoskins felt for object of adoration have come into room determined to display a man of will of courage of fashion have broken down in under extreme desire to obtain assistance in getting one thing wanted when parted with shook hand almost boisterously while offered most exuberant thanks yet have not suggested that must do anything for did think that ophelia gledd must accept offer a soon a pryor be gone have not told that thought so about two day afterwards have very long very serious conversation with pryor at time think that have made up mind a to what intended to do be very opposite to hoskins in way mood there be not only no swagger with propriety quiescence of demeanour very opposite to swagger in conversation most violent opposition be conveyed by smile displayed other energy than what might be shown in slight curl of upper lip if reproved did by silence there must be no greater contrast than between hoskins there must be doubt man must recommend most to english world by gait demeanour think there may be doubt a to be best man doubt also a to must make best husband that friend be not then engaged to miss gledd did learn learned nothing further except that must take departure with first week in may unless anything special occurred to keep in boston be time early in april got note from miss gledd asking to call on come at once said a want advice above thing signed yours in truth o g have have
