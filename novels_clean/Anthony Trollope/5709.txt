success made confident in hour of battle taught by degree to bear undaunted fire of enemy officer of republic be most injudicious in allowing enemy to gather head a did have brought really formidable force of men in one body into province of anjou immediately upon revolt of st florent might doubtless have driven vendeans who be then unarmed undisciplined back to farm affected to despise neglected to take vigorous measure till whole country be in arm then found that available force be enabled to collect be insufficient to quell spirit daunt patriotism of revolted province towards end of april

aid took three four other piece of cannon none prized a did marie jeanne be universally credited among peasantry at cathelineau touch remarkable piece of artillery have positively refused to discharge against vendeans leader certainly be at pain to disabuse of belief contributed so strongly to enthusiasm of more astute among people have certainly thought for while that cannon be humbug that be useless either to royalist to republican in fact that must never go off at sceptic be cured of infidelity at thouars when saw soldier a well a republican of town fall in heap beneath thunder of marie

league from though have be up nearly whole previous night must willingly have returned to attack that evening have be allowed to do so be not considered expedient be resolved that attack on camp must be renewed a early a possible on following morning a be considered that republican must not expect so quick return of army have be completely routed might therefore to certain extent be taken by

be quite right a be will not fight worse for saying prayer a finished speaking men rose again rushed against earth work attempt of preceding evening have have one good effect have taught peasant who hesitated be in five time more imminent danger than who at once got into trench that men climbing up embankment at top of be not nearly so liable to be struck a men at bottom of trench a beyond therefore eagerly stuck hand foot into earth made best of way into encampment have be expected by republican that next attack of royalist must probably be made at bournan have consequently moved most of cuirassier from varin to strengthen important place men left in encampment consisted chiefly of tribe of republican who be enrolled into french army under name of marseillaise men who be a ferocious in hour of victory a be prone to fly at first suspicion of defeat men who delighted in bloodshed who preferred finding victim ready bound for slaughter be abject cowardice of troop gave so wonderful career of success to vendeans be diabolical cruelty have made suffering of royalist more notorious even than bravery de lescure larochejaquelin adolphe denot led men further along road to

mud water conspicuous with red neck red waist at least so thought republican for offered very little opposition to henri have just time to see that friend have entered town by gate on doue road did not wait to speak to republican soldier be escaping from town in opposite direction must not resist temptation of following be at head of men just passing over loire by wooden bridge called bridge of green cross having possessed of sword in passage through town be making good use of when dragoon turned suddenly round fired pistol almost in face near a man be to in hurry missed bullet merely grazed henri cheek without even raising skin ah bungler said henri raising sword be good for king nation struck unfortunate man dead at foot not only soldier inhabitant of town be escaping by hundred over

detachment on other by portion of m d'elbee army men have done execution a covered with cannon portion of road over vendeans have passed have taken no active part in engagement what made more singular be that garrison at bournan be composed of very best soldier of french republican army be under command of general coustard who kept position during whole attack inactive unmolested have attacked m

dispersion of large army have be collected there by republic be enterprise of much greater magnitude than anything have previously be undertaken by vendeans gave great advantage supplied plentifully with arm ammunition clothes for soldier greatly inspirited peasant made convention feel that have contemptible enemy to deal with in la vendee that best soldier of france must be required to crush loyalty inspired peasant of anjou poitou vendean leader felt that responsibility be greatly increased very much depended on decision to might now come a regarded further operation general council of war be accordingly held in saumur at matter be debated among twelve of vendeans be admitted to consultation others be strictly excluded be cathelineau bonchamps who though badly wounded have caused to be brought thither from doue de lescure who have remained in action for eight hour after arm be broken have consequently suffered much from larochejaquein d'elbee stofflet adolphe denot father jerome

during siege have be said selected for special purpose purpose by grace of god be accomplished be now ready to resign commission into hand of who have given to be not so foolish said a to suppose that be qualified to take command in war have now to carry on one privilege beg to exercise on retiring from command will name successor let one who plea name will then put to vote let who have most vote be general so be said henri nothing can be better name m de lescure said cathelineau of be beloved by people be not educated others be highly educated be not yet known to peasant be be sure brave men m de lescure be beloved by knowledge fit for high position cool constant determined courage man who have seen in hour of battle will doubt name m de lescure de lescure be about to rise when henri put hand upon friend arm said let speak charles know that what cathelineau have said of cousin be more than truth be still charles when have spoken can then say what please be sure will agree with nevertheless will not give vote that be chief general cathelineau have desired that one differing from must name that question must then be put to vote differ from therefore name name good cathelineau saint of anjou now let vote said prince de talmont come bonchamps do begin never heard of deposing commander in chief in consequence of complete victory said convention murder general when be defeated even convention reward for victory vote for cathelineau foret said prince say cathelineau said peasant generally must be disappointed to see put above certainly vote for cathelineau said father jerome who came next must be offending creator said m d'elbee be to reject great good commander whom gracious providence have sent vote for cathelineau m denot said prince adolphe denot especially disliked cathelineau be jealous of reputation popularity must not bear to feel in way under control of man so much inferior in rank fancied moreover that cathelineau regarded agatha larochejaquelin have be quick enough to perceive that ineffable grace beauty of mistress have filled heart of poor postillion with admiration feared that own rejection have be caused by mutual feeling in agatha breast future event might warm into love adolphe therefore hated cathelineau must have delighted have dared to do so to express disapprobation of choice after pausing for few moment found that did not dare so merely said oh cathelineau of course when be resolved what be use of voting about to show that be resolved said de lescure to make cathelineau understand that be positively duty to take position wish to fill so one after recorded vote that cathelineau must be commander in chief of vendean army declared that must without reserve obey military order might give well gentleman said again seating at head of table must pay bad compliment to understanding be further to insist on own unworthiness will not at rate be wanting in zeal for good cause will trust to who directs for assistance in difficult duty have imposed on then debated on important question of what must be next movement on subject there be much difference of opinion bonchamps be again asked to speak first advised that must at once proceed to paris can hing said while present convention sits in paris have one head have ten thousand bloody hand there can be peace rest in france while danton robespierre barrere be omnipotent let at once start for paris brittany will join part of normandy southerns will follow men of bordeaux of gironde have not own orator leader of revolution be murdered in seat because be not willing that france must become one golgotha lyon even marseille be now sick of monster who have crawled forth from haunt of jacobin to depopulate country annihilate humanity there be now small faction even in paris to whom restoration of order must not be acceptable intensity of cruelty be only strength of governing faction extent of abomination alone make terrible hundred will fly from one indian snake so potent be venom so sure to inflict death let one brave man set heel upon head noxious animal be destroyed for ever so be with party who now rule convention now that have with powerful prestige of victory let march at once to paris hundred will join on way what force can at moment be collected to stop let proceed at once to paris proclaim at door of convention in garden of tuilleries in place louis quinze where sainted monarch so nobly shed blood france again submits to king must that must said de lescure must that spirit of revolution be yet sufficiently quenched in france to allow to follow advice there be much very much to be done before royalist army can march from la vendee to paris unthought of suffering to be endured blood of thousand to be sacrificed before france will own have be wrong in experiment have made must fight battle by inch be satisfied if when dying can think that have left to child probability of final victory normandy gironde may be unwilling to submit to jacobin leader be a yet a warmly attached to republic a paris bonchamps little know disposition character of men who at bidding have left home come to saumur if think that at bidding will march to paris be even now burning to return home to recount to wife child what have done not number came to saumur must leave town with on road to paris before must reach tour army must have melted away from like snow from mountain top when sun begin to shine be here in own locality that must endeavour to extend influence in southern brittany people believe be with town be full of troop of republic let drive out of anger ancenis nantes a have driven from saumur let force from bank of loire become master of coast of southern brittany then may expect men money from england then may fairly hope for such foreign aid a may enable to face republic at present if march to paris march to certain destruction m de lescure be right said stofflet men must not go far from home must remember that be not paid have mean of paying if have english gold might perhaps make way to paris men be not so mercenary stofflet said bonchamps think have shewn great desire for plunder said stofflet must live if be to have pay plunder how be to get to paris agree with bonchamps said henri come what come may must make dash at paris will be cut to piece here while be waiting for english aid of men must follow most of believe where meet with friend will give provision where find enemy will take pay owner in republican assignats must get other payment in market town be sorry to disagree with charles voice be for paris mine also certainly said adolphe let career be short at rate let be glorious let march to paris strike terror into tyrant of convention be difficult to strike terror into tyrant said de lescure quickly when number of supporter be ten time greater than of opponent well cathelineau said bonchamps what do say be for to settle question between be to go forward to paris march back to nantes must wish to hear what others say for fear that m de lescure be right fear peasant must not follow so far from own home what doe prince de talmont say will have voice in matter said prince have joined lately a yet be only fit to follow where others lead m d'elbee said cathelineau hardly know how to speak said d'elbee where subject be so important m d'elbee be not wont to be so modest said stofflet doe not trust providence will inspire with wisdom when open mouth to give opinion certainly stofflet trust in seeing eye at be so willing to scoff expect be to be allowed to see further into futurity than however if be to express opinion think must endeavour to march on paris if find that men desert that others join standard must return how be to return said de lescure to whom think that can collect army in la vendee when one have deserted on road will peasant again trust in after have once left never if army dissolve in despair will never be able to establish again who talk of despair charles said henri did not despair when be thundering against gate of saumur with four republican to one royalist opposed to why must despair now why must army despair believe must go anywhere at command of priest with hope of restoring king to throne question be then put to vote de lescure four others voted for attacking nantes bonchamps five others declared for proceeding at once to paris with view of arresting present leader of convention cathelineau be then called on to express opinion must of course be decisive think m de lescure be right said think be not in position to advance to paris have not heart to ask men to follow into strange country so far from own home number be now equally divided a cathelineau be commander in chief voice turned scale expedition to paris be postponed so be said bonchamps let prepare then for nantes be not fortified like saumur troop there be very numerous be then decided that cathelineau must name six lieutenant under to take command of different district from army be collected to men must be sure to return also appoint officer in command of artillery in command of cavalry cathelineau must have willingly dispensed with task of selecting officer work in must hardly fail to give offence to in might probably give entire satisfaction to none be to be done felt that be useless for to shrink from m bonchamps said will of course take command of men of anjou m de lescure of from southern part of bocage will assist hope in selecting others be very difficult to select where so many be fit rather say said henri laughing where so many be equally unfit why bonchamps marigny be only soldier by profession have among will all be soldier shortly said jerome be at rate going right way to learn trade marigny of course will take artillery said bonchamps be very lucky in having so good artillery officer among there be one at rate to dispute claim marigny said de lescure so be president over bearie jeanne ' gunpowder said henri be settled be cathelineau unless m marigny refuse said cathelineau be not modest enough for general said marigny do furnish with gun will fight do collect gunpowder will consume prince de talmont will take cavalry said cathelineau indeed said prince will not interfere with henri larochejaquelin henri larochejaquelin be much obliged to prince said henri be not ambitious of making fool of doe wish to be made fool of moreover henri larochejaquelin doe not wish to quarrel with old friend like prince might be tempted to do so if take liberty with name cathelineau said prince henri have be at head of cavalry through set bad example prince said de lescure let man coincide with cathelineau direction without word so will be spared ill effect of over modesty of too much assurance besides said cathelineau m larochejaquelin will be much wanted elsewhere a matter of course will be leader of parish round chatillon doubt if men must follow one else dear cathelineau said henri if will take advice will not make leader of youngster at adolphe will be well contented to be hussar for awhile let grey headed senior be leader pointed to d'elbee whose hair be grizzled henri have seen that spirit of jealousy be already rising in adolphe denot face allusion have be made to service advice have never be asked in council there be probability that must be named a one of leader have hardly spoken word since have assembled in council room henri though own heart be stranger to jealousy dread of neglect tormented adolphe sympathised with felt for friend thought that if be together excluded from command at request blow must be le keenly felt be two youngest in room youth be good reason why must not be named henri be younger of two knew that if be selected a one of chief adolphe must be miserable at finding left out de lescure however must not allow of have promised that must not disgrace denot by telling of cowardice have shewn at bridge of fouchard be determined to keep word must not allow cousin pupil bosom friend man whom loved with affection of brother father to sink to same level a coward how absurd be said angrily wonder henri that must be first to create such foolish difficulty when very existence depends on perfect unanimity in proportion a mean of enforcing obedience be slender must resolution be firm implicitly to obey direction of who be selected a leader have made cathelineau general desired to select officer when selects a one object if object from proper modesty argues that who accept shew improper degree of assurance must think of thing henri resign to dignity be dumb said henri laughing go on cathelineau if men name say one word one syllable against choice will slay cathelineau knew that difficulty still lay before whom have already chosen must a matter of course be among number who be to be other three m donnissan said be in whisper to de lescure who be sitting next to know what wish might be father in law feel too old answered de lescure d'elbee must be much fitter person be thought so much of at beauprieu other two asked cathelineau name one yourself ask bonchamps to name other m d'elbee said cathelineau aloud will not be sure refuse to take portion of labour will find whispered stofflet to neighbour that a providence have called upon will be willing enough will do best said d'elbee a be called upon may lord direct may fight battle so a to do honour to name think will name stofflet said cathelineau consulting with bonchamps de lescure be brave man though rude in manner will make perhaps best soldier among already men obey almost more implicitly than one do do said bonchamps can not do better think will be right to do so said de lescure though like man peasant know be one of yesterday morning have ample proof of courage a say be brave man good soldier stofflet be then informed that have be named though muttered expression a to own want of necessary qualification be evidently well pleased that choice have fallen on now last of lot be to be chosen a two last name have be mentioned denot brow have grown blacker blacker henri larochejaquelin during whole proceeding have be walking about room sitting now in one place now in at present moment be sitting next to adolphe who when stofflet name be mentioned whispered to almost audibly gracious heaven stofflet whole affair be becoming discreditable how can gentleman serve under man a that think too much of rank adolphe said henri must entirely forget distinction of person now unless do so can never succeed do think be more likely to set king upon throne by making such brute a general wonder whom commander in chief will choose next foret suppose after having again consulted for time bonchamps said to cathelineau think can do better than name adolphe denot be said in low voice adolphe ear be not slow to catch own name be once more happy though be named last must be equal with others not so said de lescure who have idea that denot have overheard mention of name adolphe be not yet sufficiently known to people besides have hitherto forgotten one who though absent must not forget one who be first in field against republic who be already at head of army who have on various occasion shown capable to lead army must not forget charette last word be spoken out loud though be eagerly responded to by one else fell with heavy sound on adolphe denot ear to know that be excluded after have be named to feel that have be proposed merely to be rejected be more than must bear a soon a cathelineau have formally announced name of m charette a one of leader started abruptly from chair said oh of course gentleman if prefer charette so be doubtless will be better able to assist endeavour than must might have spared mortification of putting name on list of officer merely to scratch off again what matter adolphe said larochejaquelin blushing for friend will not share command will not word be a influential in parish of chatillon a own sincerely beg pardon m denot said cathelineau if have hurt feeling be a much aware a be that must be very wrong to neglect merit of m charette achievement claim from distinction power influence must probably be lost to la vendee if did not now incorporate army with ours have nothing further to say said denot must own altogether admire selection have be made have nothing further to say on subject be sorry adolphe that have said so much said de lescure must have be apt to say more if have be passed over said adolphe forgetting in passion how have disgraced before de lescure at bridge of fouchard fear misunderstand purpose have collected here in saumur so many men in arm said fear that think peasant of country have turned into soldier that might become general play at being great men indeed such be not case if personal ambition have brought here have better leave have come here to fight very probably to die for king religion being called upon to act a leader must bear heavier share of burden undergo greater peril than others seek especial dignity look for other pre eminence than of suffering more than others fear be not feeling influence feeling sir be a pure a own said denot if so said father jerome have better teach to think so by taking care that conduct be also a pure a m de lescure oh father jerome anger said henri come with adolphe will quietly talk over exactly understand what mean yet will understand what mean said denot whose anger be now beyond control will know will not remain here to be rebuked by priest who have thrust into affair with have concern to make subservient to men who be not fit to be equal will not deign to be common soldier when man a stofflet be made officer got up from chair in have again seated stalked out of room have at rate proved to said bonchamps be wrong to nominate that be right not to accept nomination grieve that must be vexed with said stofflet did not seek to put above time experience will make wise said de lescure let pity folly forgive council be then broken up different officer went to perform own duty when denot left room henri immediately followed adolphe said a overtook in market place adolphe indeed be wrong one meant to show indignity have also followed to tell be wrong of course be wrong be wrong because will not submit a charles do to ignorant boor like stofflet cathelineau because like cathelineau why adolphe be mad said henri why voted that cathelineau must be general voted why henri what child be do call that voting when be arranged beforehand be blind tell will vote next suppose that great general valour will de rewarded with sister hand sister hand what be be speaking of yes agatha hand think that when make general of such a that ambition will rest there if be content to be lieutenant to postillion presume will feel honoured by nearer connexion with denot be raving mad cathelineau looking for sister hand yes agatha hand postillion looking for sister hand sir will find be not mad before long cathelineau will look for agatha hand heart have already without waiting for further answer hurried away must be raving mad said henri unlucky in love thwarted in ambition be unable to bear grief like man what phantasy have jealousy created in brain agatha be right man who must speak of even in madness a have now spoken be not worthy of cathelineau be ten time lower than postillion by birth must still be twenty time made noble by achievement by character yet must not wish nonsense think more of wedding agatha than of diana chapter iii return to durbelliere when adolphe denot left friend henri in street of saumur ran off from henri be so completely astonished by parting word so utterly dumb founded by what said respecting agatha that made attempt to follow returned after awhile to house in charles adolphe be lodging a walked slowly through street continued saying to poor fellow be mad be certainly raving mad from time tidings be heard of denot have never returned to lodging be seen anywhere except in stable in horse have be put to stand have saddled horse taken from stall from moment nothing further must be learnt of in saumur de lescure henri made most minute inquiry in vain have destroyed hid in town horse must certainly have be found be surmised that have started for paris on mad speculation though friend deeply grieved at misconduct absence when have so much to do to think of be in felt a relief after remaining about week in army be disbanded rather disbanded for effort be made to keep together a great body of men a possible attempt be made to garrison town for purpose leader undertook to pay about one thousand men at certain rate per day for service while remained under arm in saumur idea after very short time be abandoned men must not stay away from home in spite of comfort be procured for pay be promised garrison very quickly dissolved cathelineau succeeded in taking back with to st florent nearly men who have accompanied next object be attack of nantes a st florent be between saumur that town men be able to return to home without going much out of direct way marched through town of anger on return took possession of store found there republican garrison having fled a soon a heard of approach many of bonchamps men accompanied of who have come to saumur with de lescure henri larochejaquelin young men who have wife family who literally preferred excitement of campaign to ordinary home employment such men joined cathelineau army by far greater number of peasant of bocage returned with de lescure larochejaquelin charette have be invited to assist cathelineau in attack on nantes have promised to do so de lescure found absolutely necessary to go home on account of wound larochejaquelin went with have already heard that convention have determined to invade la vendee on side with overwhelming force be necessary to protect southern portion of province duty be allotted to two friend therefore returned home from saumur without expecting to enjoy for length of time fruit of recent victory litter be formed for de lescure for at present found impossible to bear motion of riding henri little chevalier father jerome

seizing upon person taking from durbelliere marrying during confusion revolution have caused in country at first have distinct idea of treachery towards royalist with whom have sided though vague thought of bringing soldier of convention to durbelliere in dead of night have at different time entered mind have never reduced such thoughs to palpable plan have ever endeavoured to excuse to iniquity of such scheme a man doe when resolve to sacrifice honour honesty to passion be in council room at saumur that first felt desire to betray friend of life be in moment of hot anger after leaving that determined to put into effect plan have already conceived be then that insane ambition selfish love prompted to forget feeling have hitherto recognized a honourable to commit to deed must make impossible that must ever be reconciled with companion of youth have presentiment that must ever rise to honour distinction in army of republic never even thought of what future life must be revenge be object sweet delight of proving to agatha larochejaquelin that be able to carry out bold threat knew that have scorned derided must be too much to say that adolphe denot be insane for must

suffering of victim whom have caused to ascend scaffold little thought that in few year must be looked upon a sole author of barbarity of now complained be seldom that robespierre have spoken so openly to eleanor duplay of inmost thought be flattered gratified to think have thought worthy of confidence that have chosen to listen to secret of heart felt that if have influence with must become a woman to use on behalf of whom might be in power to save from fearful death be there many more who must die said when hear wheel of horrid cart a carry poor creature who have be condemned on last

convinced if be necessary must be repeated for one will not shrink from duty though must sink beneath horrid task imposes on then sat silent for while though robespierre have ventured to express to girl whom knew to be so entirely devoted to feeling somewhat akin to of pity for victim must not bear that even must appear to throw shadow of imputation on propriety justness of measure although only did so by repeating appealing to kindly expression have fallen from have become so used to unmeasured praise of among whom lived so painfully suspicious of who in remotest degree disapproved of of word deed so confident of so distrustful of others even what have said be painful to though hardly knew why yet felt that be displeased with eleanor however be altogether unconscious of having irritated sore feeling relying on kind tone of what have said confident manner in have spoken to determined to obey dictate of heart intercede for mercy for fellow creature poor girl did not know danger of coming near lion prey have heard much of vendeans though who have spoken in hearing of doings of royalist rebel be not likely to say much to excite sympathy on behalf still have learnt that be true to other faithful to leader generous to enemy brave in battle awful punishment to be inflicted on doomed district have also be partially discussed in hearing though republic have more enthusiastic daughter than woman heart must not endure idea even innocent child of large province must be condemned to slaughter for father want of patriotism what work so fitting for woman whom ruler of people have chosen for wife a to implore stern magistrate to temper justice with mercy in what way must use influence so sweetly a to ask for life of woman child yet felt afraid to make innocent request robespierre have never yet be offended with though have given counsel on almost subject have never yet spoken to one word of disapprobation still knew that have inspired with fear made attempt to begin subject did not notice for be still brooding over unpleasant sensation word have occasioned at last gathered courage said soldier of republic have at last overcome rebel of la vendee have not m robespierre be not enough to conquer traitor answered must be crushed before country can be safe from treachery treason must be crushed know crime between man man can be atoned for by minor punishment crime between citizen country can only be properly avenged by death may teach murderer thief iniquity of fault when have learnt to hate deed have committed may be pardoned be not so with traitor though truest child of france must spend life in attempt must not be able to inspire one aristocrat with spark of patriotism must royalist in la vendee perish then said eleanor robespierre did not answer immediately leaning elbow on table rested forehead on hand so a nearly to conceal face eleanor thought that be meditating on question remembering that have declared that must be pleased if now then victim might be spared again commenced difficult task of urging to mercy talk of shedding blood of innocent child of destroying peasant woman who can only think feel a husband bid will not allow that must be done will be life of woman more precious to than of man be false sentiment teach to spare iniquity of woman because of sex weakness entitles to protection beauty begets love weakness beauty must be accepted a excuse for crime poor innocent babe be not possible that must have committed crime in religion of christ be declared that sin of father will be visited on child to third fourth generation priest who made law handed down to flock a very word of god have closely studied human nature believe that almighty creator condescended to engrave on stone with own finger word a must feign that did do law be not le true child must expatiate to third fourth generation sin of father nature be benignant will that must be so if be so will not nature work out own law will not be punishment enough that so many woman must lose husband so many child father know be averse to shedding blood must spare life whenever sense of duty must allow to do so try what clemency will do in la vendee try whether kindness will not put stop to bitterness of enmity do dearest for sake be possible that eleanor have never before spoken to lover in language so tender be also probable that have never before asked of request in ought of political nature be concerned be that a may a soon a have finished speaking face became suffused with scarlet a though have said something of be ashamed one must think that there be nothing in term of endearment have used must have displeased betrothed husband nothing in petition have made must have angered political friend robespierre however soon showed that be displeased angered nay worse still that black unmanly suspicion be aroused to disordered brain seemed that eleanor be practising on woman wile for unworthy purpose that treason lurked in show of humanity affection believed that who have always believed in loved almost worshipped have become in instant false designing looked steadily in face moment two before answered did not bear calmly fierce glance of eye saw at once that have angered in spite of love must not know how dark terrible be anger who have set on to talk to of said slowly still keeping eye fixed on hers set on m

safe with a spoke laid hand upon arm attempted to appeal to affection gently withdrew arm from grasp again concealed face with hand a stand here alive before continued speaking with more assured voice than have hitherto used have not whispered word to man woman upon subject eleanor have risen from chair when companion first expressed suspicion be now standing robespierre remained seated still shading eye with hand a though have nothing further to say to must wish to be alone however felt that must not leave without further explanation on part retraction on knew not how to set about most eloquent men in france have found difficult to explain anything to robespierre satisfaction one have yet be able to make retract word have spoken say that believe m robespierre said for mercy sake say that doubt do not know must always obey that word be always to word of truth have done wrong doubt not in speaking to of public matter beg pardon promise will not so transgress again before leave tell that distrust fidelity must still wish to hope eleanor that be truly anxious for welfare of country safety of friend said still however without looking up indeed be most anxious anxious above thing for welfare safety must think little of life must give to promote one secure other tell then conjure who be who have desired to beg for life of vendean rebel a spoke leapt from chair putting hand upon

niche in wall be now late light even abroad be growing dimmer moment be still le strong within building must not therefore see face of priest a knelt at side of altar voice seemed familiar to of madame de lescure perhaps a much from fatigue a from devotion sank down at once upon knee against little stone seat projected from wall near door marie remained standing straining eye to try to catch feature of cure after moment two also knelt down said in whisper to sister be cure of st laud be own father jerome have hardly be minute two in position near door when service for evening be over priest rising from altar gave blessing to little congregation of rose from knee left chapel portion of still remained kneeling with head in hand trying to make up by length perseverance of devotion for deficiency there might be in fervour two lady also rose though doubted for moment what to do advanced to rude step of little altar at father jerome be again kneeling have not seen a yet have noticed entrance of one ordinary congregation of chapel so absorbed be either in thought devotion that did not even observe till be standing close to elbow father jerome said madame de lescure in low voice laying hand on threadbare sleeve of old grey coat still wore if must guess comfort have in finding here priest sprang from knee at hearing voice gazed at a though have be ghost be possible said madame de lescure mademoiselle here in chapel of genet then turning to gaping peasant said go home child go home have business to speak of to lady oh father jerome said madame de lescure a soon a be alone for heaven sake tell something of m de lescure have heard of what happened at cholet yes madame be there said priest be there then can tell of husband for god sake speak father jerome tell worst

at head with huge crucifix lifted high in air have be close to de lescure when fell have seen in litter after be carried from field of battle must therefore have said at once that have seen alive after battle be over have wish to deceive madame de lescure at moment of be speaking most undoubtedly believed that wound have be fatal that husband be more musket ball have entered just below eye making way downwards have lodged in back of neck surgeon have examined wound before father jerome left army though have not positively said that must prove mortal have spoken so unfavourably of case a to make who heard believe that must be so have jerome expected to see two nearest dearest relation of man whom thought to be now more must have prepared for difficult task must have have to undertake one must have be better able to go through with feeling delicacy firmness such be not case sudden apparition of wife sister of friend seemed to to be supernatural though at once made up mind to give false hope must not so quickly decide in what way must impart sad news have to tell madame de lescure be trembling so violently a asked question on answer to fate depended that priest observed turned to altar at end of chapel to fetch rude chair stood there for use of officiating clergyman be only moveable seat in chapel whilst doing so be enabled to collect thought so a to answer not quite so much at random a otherwise must have done sit down madame de lescure said sit down mademoiselle made latter sit down on altar step be fatigued have agitated too intensely why speak father jerome why tell at once be alive then added almost screaming in agitation for god sake sir keep wretched miserable woman in suspense priest gazed for moment at unfortunate lady have at bidding sunk upon chair must hardly be said to be seated a with knee bent under hand clasped gazed up into face felt that husband be dead still till fatal word be spoken there be hope enough within heart to feed agony of doubt be tormenting marie have hitherto said nothing have made own grief subservient to of brother wife though hardly le anxious be le agitated than other can not tell anything with certainty madame said priest at last can not then know that be dead then there be at rate room for hope said not allowing to finish what be about to say sank back in chair relieved overwrought mind with flood of tear priest be firmly convinced that de lescure be at moment numbered among dead conscience forbad to relieve of dreadful task by allowing to entertain false hope have still therefore to say word found so difficult to utter sat down beside marie on low step of altar immediately opposite to madame de lescure still have on vestment of holy office though be much worn shabby soiled cap formed part of priest dress when officiating be on head shoe be so worn tattered that be nearly falling from foot stocking displayed shape of huge leg be so patched darned with worsted of different colour a to have made more fitting for mountebank than priest at present moment there be one likely to notice costume have there be observer there must have told tale easy to be read of suffering have be endured by brave faithful servant of king when god madame de lescure said speaking in kind peculiarly solemn tone of voice when god called upon to be wife of who have be to so affectionate husband vouchsafed to higher blessing at same time imposed on sterner duty than woman in general be called upon to bear have enjoyed blessing if know character will not shrink from duty will shrink from nothing father jerome said god will be done will endeavour to bear burden providence lay on have woman weakness woman fear who have given strength courage to so many of people in afflicted day will also give to will enable to bear weight of hand in chastising blesses in punishing here will render fit for unutterable joy hereafter paused moment a of woman must now speak through tear went on be close to husband when fell a eye closed on battlefield rested on blessed emblem of redemption be dead then said jumping from chair struggling with sob nearly choked oh sir if have mercy man must feel for wretched woman tell at least truth a spoke threw on knee before father jerome certainly lacked mercy usually speaking lacked firmness now nearly felt overcome must compose before can speak calmly to daughter

up courage child show worthy to have be wife sister of great man whom loved so well be dead said marie speaking for first time almost in whisper know now that be so threw into sister lap embraced knee priest did not contradict commenced narrative intended to convey to listener exactly same impression be on own mind in however failed told that de lescure have be carried senseless from field have be taken by henri in litter on road towards st florent that have be present when surgeon expressed almost fatal opinion respecting wound that wounded man be still alive when last saw that since then have heard certain news respecting even statement priest be unable to make without many interruption acted rather a relief than otherwise to madame de lescure might at rate see husband again be still possible that surgeon father jerome might be wrong a soon a have told tale forgetting fatigue difficulty surrounded wanted immediately to resume journey father jerome be equally anxious to learn how marie have come so far how intended to proceed chapeau have in mean time called on old priest though have found almost impossible to make understand what wanted who lady be of whom spoke have that father jerome be in chapel be a much gratified a be surprised to hear have then hurried back though have not put forward during scene have be just described have heard what have passed now explained to father jerome way in have left chatillon journeyed on horseback from st laurent declared at same time with much truth that be quite impossible for to proceed farther on way that night poor brute be

welcome to will find poor enough father bernard have shared with for last two night poor cure have not many luxury to offer to friend now madame de lescure tried to utter kind of protest that must not turn poor old man out of only bed succeeded badly in attempt for heart be sad within hardly knew what be saying followed father jerome out of chapel of locked door putting key into pocket strode into humble dwelling opposite found father bernard seated over low wood fire in small sitting room in smell arising from burning of damp stick be very prevalent there be one small rickety table in middle of room one other chair besides occupied by host with article alone room be furnished that there be carpet in clergyman house in poitou be not remarkable indeed must have be very remarkable if there

arthur mondyon remained among while to tell how bravely countryman have fought at cholet against number more than double own before must consent to own beaten there be immense deal for henri larochejaquelin to do in first place have to collect together fragment of disbanded army to separate men who be armed from who have lost arm to divide comparatively speaking small number of former into such band regiment a must make serviceable in case of need de lescure be unable to give actual assistance in work thoughtful brain reflecting on difficulty of henri situation conceived how much must be increased by want of absolute title to authority therefore determined ill a be to invest with command in chief of shattered army early on morning after arrival begged that such men a have

between island other shore narrow river run rapidly henri at first contented with sending woman child together with sick aged into island thinking that there must be at rate for time safe from blue that effort might probably be made from other shore to convey across narrow passage gradually however island became full be obliged to send boat round to take people from thence to main land day work continued when dark night came on boat did not for moment cease to ply immediately after sunset rain began to fall in torrent a anxious wretch did not like to leave close vicinity of river have spent

question about husband indeed have not have opportunity to do so for have be hurried through dense throng of people none of whom knew when be lifted from horse by strange hand have idea that window immediately above head looked from room in husband lay chapeau however with considerate tact did not lose moment in finding aubergiste learning from enough to enable to whisper word of comfort to be here madame said standing close behind in room above there be somewhat better than have be a strong in mind a ever have be most anxious for arrival then led way into hotel pushing aside crowd to right to left within five minute from time of entering town two lady found on stair immediately outside chamber in be lying object of present anxiety for last four day four night have be first only desire of madame de lescure to be with husband now that be so near dreaded to open door who be with said speaking in whisper trembling from head to foot so that must hardly stand little chevalier be with always said aubergiste who have followed up stair never leaf now that m henri be obliged to be away have better go in perhaps said chapeau send chevalier out can tell m de lescure madame be here might be too much for monsieur to see at once without waiting for answer chapeau knocked at door went in while two lady sat down on nearest step dreading almost to breathe in intense anxiety in few second arthur mondyon came out taking hand of of two friend pressed to lip know be here said to madame de lescure be to go into alone marie will go down stair until sends for be tranquil a can while be with will find a calm a ever rose entered room on tiptoe a chapeau left face be a pale a marble heart beat so violently that felt that must hardly be able to reach chair at bed side de lescure be lying on decent very humble bed at farthest end of large room in there be three four other bedstead enormous number of common deal chair table piled one top of be propped up in bed on pillow a turned eye towards door full light of sun shone upon face gave especial ghastliness to pallor madame de lescure tried to control in such moment feeling of heart overcome reason motion of body be governed by passion alone in instant face be on bosom arm be locked closely round body victorine own victorine said greatest grief be over now feared that be not to meet again that thought alone be almost too much for courage be for time unable to articulate word felt warm tear a convulsively pressed cheek against breast felt violent throb of loving heart allowed few minute before asked to speak to have thrown off hat have worn before entering room now gently smoothed ruffled hair with hand collected together loose tress have escaped down neck look up love said have seen face yet heard voice come victorine be not used to be so weak must string nerve now dearest must be brave now used to praise for courage now be time for to show oh charles oh poor stricken love then raised face gazed into till tear made eye so dim that must hardly see knew must come at last said knew fearful blow must come at last oh that have gone when others went at rate must not have lived to see thus do say that victorine speak so allow to think so will rob of of dearest comfort love be to do again again must stand by throne again must counsel to do so doubt on point must be calamity indeed thank god there be doubt misery to see thus torn mangled tortured for what what good have done with hot patriotism be king nearer throne be murder of republic frequent fear be selfish now love did not know when first took up arm that many happy wife must be widowed that numberless child must be made fatherless that hundred of mother must have to weep for son must not ourselves complain of fate to have knowingly thoughtfully consigned so many others madame de lescure have answer to make to husband remonstrance sat upon bed so that must support head upon bosom pressing lip to clammy brow said in low voice god will be done charles with heart pity who have suffered a now suffer remained sitting there in silence for considerable time weeping indeed stifling sob that sound of grief might not agitate while enjoyed inexpressible comfort of having close to closed eye a leant against sweet support afforded not in sleep be thinking over might be most necessary for to say to before power of speech have left taking counsel with a to advice must give victorine said then paused moment for reply a did not answer went on victorine want to be now while speak to can listen to calmly love while speak to seriously said that must tone in said hardly gave confirmation to promise hardly know what account have yet heard of unfortunate battle oh have heard that be most unfortunate unfortunate to most unfortunate to be unfortunate hope who spoke to of deceived with false hope for must have be mere cruelty give hand love hope told truth know dearest do not that that wound be mortal strove hard to control feeling bit under lip between teeth pressed foot against bed grasped loose clothes with hand be disengaged virtue on husband most prided be calmness self possession in affliction knew that now expected that virtue from that nothing must so grieve a to see render weakly up to sorrow strove hard to control exertion did not enable to answer seemed almost miraculous to herself that must sit there retain consciousness hear utter such word have attempted to speak effort must have overcome for heaven sake victorine let nothing let nobody deceive know worst look to christ for power to bear will find burden not too heavy to be borne love must part in world have passed life together without one shadow to darken joy of union have be greatly blessed beyond others can complain because happiness on earth be not eternal be not great comfort that can thus speak together before part have be allowed to live to see dear face to feel breath on cheek to hear voice to tell with assurance approach of death give that sorrow be for time that future joy will be everlasting must thank victorine for tender care constant love have made happy here have helped to fit for happiness hereafter be owing to that even hour have little bitterness for be not happy dearest be not happy even now in other love madame de lescure have while husband be speaking sunk upon knee beside bed be now bathing hand with tear can not blame for tear said for human nature must have way victorine will remember that must not give way to sorrow a other woman may do rise dearest let see face feel have strength now to tell have to say may probably never have strength again rose at bidding sat upon bed where must look full upon face then began to pour out to wish of heart thought have run through brain since consciousness returned to after wound after little while conquered emotion listened to answered with attention first spoke of daughter who be now in safety with relative who have fled to england then of herself probable result of vendean war told that must not say word to discourage henri have life be spared must have considered own most paramount sacred duty to further war with energy possessed that did not expect that must ever terminate favourably to hope king will reign again said in france doubt for moment year upon year of bloodshed will have to be borne blood of france will be drained from province aye from parish before guilt have committed can be atoned for before can have expiated murder of king desired to continue with henri till opportunity must occur for to cross over into england to let such opportunity pas said that if henri must maintain ground for while in brittany if people must support if english succour must arrive be still probable that might be able to come to such term with republican a must enable to live after own fashion in own country to keep own priest among to maintain exemption from service in republican army must not be so said must all valour of vendeans not be able to secure even thus much then remember that god will temper wind to shorn lamb with people a with individual will not make burden too heavy for back have to bear spoke also of marie declared wish that must not delay marriage with henri even said must life be so far prolonged a to enable to be carried over into brittany must army there find moment rest must wish to see hand joined together at bed side poor dear marie said madame de lescure almost unconsciously be thinking of sister future fate that also might have soon to bewail husband torn from by savage war de lescure understood what be passing through mind said know love that there be reason why have better remain a now be why must not indissolubly bind to other at time a must choose least of evil will both now be burden will not say burden charge upon henri have right to expect that girl who will depend for everything on will not shrink from danger of marrying have be happy to accept love when may be comfort to must not hesitate to give hand besides dearest think what comfort will be to to know that be married before die there be one other subject on have made up mind to speak on even calm collected a be found difficult to express have however determined that be duty to do so though word almost refused to come at bidding still went through task will be desolate for time victorine when will have left said answered only by look that look be so full of misery of misery blended with inexpressible love one seeing must have doubted that must indeed be desolate when be gone have loved other too well to part easily continued for time world will be weary blank to may god who know how to pour balm into wound in mercy inflicts grant that time may not be long listen to patiently love be strong sense of duty make pain memory will always be dear to let vain foolish wicked regret counteract purpose for god have placed here be very young dearest have probably yet many year to live must multiply grief at leaving tenfold if thought that hope of happiness in world be to be buried in grave with love bear with said for tried to stop pain give now may prevent much grief to hereafter remember victorine must evil day pas by must ever again be restored to peace tranquil life earnest last solemn prayer to be that memory may not prevent future marriage be still kneeling by side with face upturned hand clasped together now implored to stop uttered dissent made protestation beseeched by long tender love by common tie bound together to cease to speak on subject be so agonising have done love said know that will not think lightly of prayer have made to in so serious manner de lescure have expressed same wish to wife on former occasion however have of course be le solemn then wife have answered with full not grieving heart have lot once said be cast in indian village prejudice of country must have required to submit to horrid torturing death upon tomb prejudice of christian land attribute blame to wife who doe not yield living sacrifice to life of desolation from false regard to husband memory be if not so horrid whit a unreasonable such sentiment be attempt to counteract god beneficence who cure wound inflicts henri first care after having seen marie madame de lescure be to provide for transit that of wounded friend to other side of water for felt that if blue came upon st florent before be done nothing must prevent three from being made prisoner tidings have yet be received of advance of republican from cholet towards st florent precaution henri have taken be such a to ensure few hour notice of approach knew however that hour must be hour of boundless confusion that whole crowd of unfortunate wretch who might then still be on southern side of river must crowd into small boat hurrying other to destruction discipline must be at end that authority must probably be insufficient to secure passage for party about three o'clock sent word to arthur to have strongest of boat kept in readiness little lower down river than usual point of embarkation so that might if possible escape being carried through throng then procured waggon into de lescure be lifted on bed wife sat behind supporting head on lap henri sister walked beside vehicle down to water edge little chevalier be there with boat have with two men of whom be young who have be at work whole day ferrying over vendeans to island arthur figure be hardly that of aide de camp head be bare face begrimed with mud be stripped to shirt sleeve be tucked up nearly to shoulder still have round waist red scarf of be so proud be so soiled dragged a hardly to be recognized a badge of honourable corp to belonged for have constantly since morning be up to breast in water dragging woman child out of river heaving boat ashore helping to push off through mud rush be settled on bank that arthur must go over with into brittany a henri felt that must not conscientiously leave st florent side of river while so many thousand be looking to for direction consequently a soon a de lescure two lady have with much labour delay be placed in boat swung out of water into bow frail bark with precious load be pushed off into stream point from started be somewhat lower down stream than from boat have be hitherto put off consequently a got into middle of river found carried down towards lower part of island on have intended to land have men who be rowing worked vigorously must not have occurred to great extent pulled slowly feebly foot boat made across descended a much down river arthur have be desired to land de lescure on island boat have be sent round to be ready to take at once from thence to other shore when found that be unintentionally so near lower end of island occurred to that must save much pain trouble if be to run round land at once on opposite shore must in way have to make considerably longer journey then de lescure must be spared pain of so many different movement madame de lescure immediately jumped at proposal for heaven sake arthur do so if be possible said will be greatest relief think must ever get across to other boat if once leave arthur be behind two men at oar who have listened to what have be said without making observation attempting to alter destination of boat rudder there be none steering therefore depended entirely on rower do hear said arthur stretching forward laying hand on shoulder of man who be in front never mind island at go little more down stream then can cross over at once without landing at do hear friend added speaking rather hastily for boatman took apparent notice of instruction hear monsieur said man be impossible must not do ah nonsense answered chevalier not do say must do wonder must hesitate for moment when know how m de lescure be suffering how much lady have to go through turn boat down stream at once tell be quite impossible said old man doggedly still holding on to course must only upset boat drown must never push through current on other side must jean quite impossible said other must only be carried down into rush else be upset in stream nonsense said arthur what be to upset at rate will try laid hand on oar of man who be nearest to instead of having effect desired turned nose of boat other way for god sake dear friend do favour for if can said madame de lescure may save life of husband indeed will reward richly for labour stop arthur use violence be sure will do kindness for if be able if wo do for kindness will do because can not help said arthur when saw that men still showed disposition to go down stream a spoke pulled pistol out of belt prepared to cock pistol in truth be perfectly harmless for have be over over again immersed in water powder be saturated with wet did not occur to boatman very possibly to arthur when stepping across thwart on hinder man be sitting held pistol close to ear of other threatening that if did not at once do a be bid must blow out brain take place on seat poor old man dropped oar from hand into water falling on knee on bottom of boat implored for mercy spare monsieur oh spare said lady pray speak for be not used to work indeed be not comrade be nearly dead with fatigue arthur put pistol back into belt when poor man begged for mercy pulling fallen oar out of water declared that must row round island that two old men might take other oar in turn agreed to then who have be so frightened who be plainly master of two told tale to a filled arthur place in bow of boat when have heard said what former occupation have be must not wonder that hard work at found be almost too much for be said priest have be employed above twenty year a cure in small parish on river side between st florent chaudron other man who be working with have be sexton have like other cure be turned out of little house by republic have returned to parish when heard that success of vendean arm seemed to promise tranquillity to old inhabitant of country have however soon be again disturbed rumour of lechelle army have driven from home have fled with many others to st florent have be advised that who be taken in priest garb must be more subject even than others to wrath of republican have therefore disguised a from having lived so long near river have become somewhat used to management of boat have for charity sake leant hand to poor vendeans willing a said to use what little skill strength have for who lost in fighting for country religion now added found almost knocked up although when have be chosen to take over monsieur two lady have not have heart to decline still have found that strength must fail knew that companion must not unaided reach opposite shore if young gentleman must assist must still do best perhaps might cross over in safety piteous tale soon turned anger into admiration friendship thanked kind old man for that have done for arthur once over again turned round to beg pardon for violence have offered indeed then picked out for job said because always worked so hard seemed so skilful anxious because observed that boat always made passage quicker than others must not be angry when tell thought have be boatman life said be not angry at flattered indeed have spent much of leisure time in rowing be heartily glad that little skill be now useful to friend soon offered to take place again at oar when old servant arthur must allow to do so declared that be quite again that few minute rest have wonderfully recruited lady thanked kindly begged to remain while where be from time to time asked question about past tried to hold out hope to for future tear came into eye rolled down cheek after while took sexton oar literally to relieve from having to speak be not work alone have upset said after while poor people seem so callous have worked hard two day a young gentleman know for charity yet till moment have not have kind word urge on to work when land at shore even thank a go away then turn back with heavy heart for load reached shore of brittany in safety when de lescure be placed in carriage have be provided for desired that poor priest might be begged to accompany on journey declined however saying that have found sphere in must be useful that must stick to work till be done till strength failed de lescure pressed hand begged blessing told that if there be many such a in country la vendee might still carry head high in spite of that republic must do against praise made old man heart light once again returned to boat passed back to st florent with comrade arthur ready to recommence labour in meantime de lescure wife sister be warmly welcomed on breton side of river before night for first time since battle of cholet found in comparative security peace when arthur got back found that plan have be started for carrying over vendeans if did not drown altogether must be certainly much more expeditious than of boat have originated with chapeau under whose guidance operation be about to commence have come down to water side with master on seeing way in men be working have calculated that must yet take above week to carry over who remained a be probable that must be attacked before twenty four hour be over have observed that might a well give up for lost if must devise other scheme of passing over will do best can said henri if can get over woman child wounded rest of can fight way to bridge of ancenis why not make raft said chapeau make one if can said henri will only go down stream besides have timber iron ready to do chapeau however determined to try employed men from durbelliere who knew must work for to get together piece of timber must collect brought down to bank of river green trunk of small tree body of old waggon small beam be able to pull down out of deserted cottage near river side piece of bedstead broken fragment of barn door chapeau with endless care joined together by numberless bit of rope at last succeeded in getting raft on forty fifty men might stand seemed to be

be interrupted by loud rumour that there be vast fire close down on opposite side of river jumped up went out saw that whole heaven be alight with conflagration of st florent blue have burnt town northern bank of river be covered with crowd of men woman gazing at flame be consuming own house yet so rejoiced be to have escaped from destruction that hardly remembered to bewail loss of property town of st florent be between three four mile from place where be congregated yet must plainly see huge spark a flew upwards fancied felt heat of flame on upturned face early on following morning whole army be on march towards laval vendean leader be well aware that republican be now on track be truly thankful that unaccountable delay in movement of enemy have enabled to put great river between pursuer garrison convention have thrown into town of brittany be very insufficient in number spirit blue abandoned one place after a vendeans approached passed through cande segre chateau gonthier without having to fire shot though gate of town of laval be closed against be only done to allow republican soldier time to escape from other side of town inhabitant of laval flocked out in number to meet poor vendeans to offer hospitality such comfort a small town must afford to so huge crowd begrudged nothing that possessed spared provision house seemed that chapeau promise be time true at rate for time found plenty in laval henri established head quarter in stone house in centre of town here also got accommodation for three lady m de lescure did chapeau forget to include annot stein in same comfortable establishment under pretext that service must be indispensable m de lescure have suffered grievously through whole journey seemed to rally when reached laval comparative comfort of quiet chamber gave ease lessened despondency whole party recovered something of usual buoyancy when henri brought in word in evening that if worst came to worst must certainly hold out town against republican army until assistance reached from england be willing to hope that cause in be engaged might still prosper chapter ix la petite vendee for four five day remained quiet in laval with nothing to disturb tranquillity rumour of what be going on on side of river men with exception of old marquis de lescure be hard at work from morning until night have hardly time patience to describe accurately what be going on to who be left within time passed very heavily with two sofa have be carried to window of sitting room occupied window looked out into main thoroughfare of town here marquis wounded man be placed so that might see be passing in street various report reached from time to time few of be confirmed many proved to be false still remained doubtful two fact be positively ascertained firstly that main army of republican have passed river at anger be advancing towards laval secondly that there be considerable number of breton peasant already under arm in country who be harassing blue whenever must meet in small party very frequently menacing garrison found in small town last circumstance created great deal of surprise not so much from fact of breton having taken up arm against convention a from certain degree of mystery be attached to men who be roving about country appeared that be under control of one leader whose name be not known in laval who be supposed to have taken active part in many of battle fought on other side of river tactic however be very different from have be practised in la vendee never took prisoner showed quarter slaughtered indiscriminately republican soldier fell into hand encouraged men to pillage town where inhabitant be presumed to be favourable to convention licence allowed be mean of drawing many after who might not have be very willing to fight merely for honour of defending throne after custom of country be different from prevailed in poitou anjou peasant soldier wore long flaxen hair hanging down over shoulder be clothed in rough dress made of untanned skin of goat sheep with hair on outside singularity of appearance at first added terror to arm be enhanced by want of experience cowardice of republican troop through country wild roving band of lawless men have assumed to name of la petite vendee certainly did much towards assisting vendeans for not only cleared way for in many of town of brittany prepared people to expect created very general opinion that there must be more danger in siding with blue than with royal party if men of la petite vendee have rendered terrible captain have made not name for be unknown character much more so be represented to be young man of fierce hideous aspect under part of face be covered with black beard always wore on head huge heavy cap covered brow shaded eye from sight concealed face nearly a effectually a vizor be always on horseback alone for have confidant friend peasant soldier believed to be invulnerable for represented to be utterly careless a to where went what danger encountered only name knew by be that of mad captain probably have be le ugly le mysterious le mad people must not have obeyed so implicitly followed so faithfully such be tale be repeated from time to time to madame de lescure party by little chevalier chapeau according to account mad captain be ally who must give most valuable help in difficulty whole story angered de lescure whose temper be acerbated by own inactivity suffering whose common sense must not endure seeming folly of putting confidence in so mysterious warrior really believe story hear of man hope said to wife sister one morning be inhuman ruffian who be disgracing by cruelty cause have joined for sake of plunder rapine at rate said marie seems to have scared blue in country if so must be good friend to if can not do well without such friend will never do well with believe whoever may be man be soldier de lescure be perhaps right in character attributed to captain of la petite vendee band of men mysterious leader now commanded held ground in brittany long after vendean army be put down in poitou anjou then became known by name chouan band for year carried on fearful war against government in part of province be called morbihan about eight o'clock in evening henri arthur mondyon returned to house after long day work be first to bring new tidings of blue new ally mad captain portion of republican army have advanced a far a antrames within league two of laval have hardly taken up quarter in town before be attacked routed driven out of by men of la petite vendee many hundred of republican have be slaughtered who have escaped carried to main army exaggerated account of number daring cruelty of breton rebel whoever be said henri in answer to question from sister be gallant fellow will be glad to give hand there can be doubt of now charles for blue at antrames certainly numbered more than double men have with be told drove helter skelter out of town like flock of sheep do mean to let have rest of war to said de lescure who be rather annoyed than otherwise at success of man whom have stigmatized a ruffian be afraid sha find quite so easy to get war taken off hand said henri laughing believe be part of good general to make most of unexpected assistance may come in way henri said marie must have idea who wonderful wild man be say be one of vendean chief say so said arthur told of people here that be at fontenay saumur talked of knowing cathelineau bonchamps be speaking to man who heard say so did man say what be like said marie think saw at answered arthur seems that wo let one see face if can help say be quite young man chapeau now knocked at door brought farther tidings mad captain troop have returned from antrames to laval have just now entered town men be shaking breton by hand said chapeau wondering at long hair rough skin three four day ago feared vendeans must never have faced blue again now be a ready to meet a ever be captain be actually in laval at present chapeau indeed be m henri saw riding down street by hotel de ville not ten minute since did see face chapeau asked marie did look like one knew asked madame de lescure did ride well asked little chevalier did look like soldier asked m de lescure who do think be chapeau asked henri larochejaquelin chapeau looked from one to a question be asked then selecting of m de lescure sister a two easiest to answer said did not see face mademoiselle say that certainly be good soldier m charles certainly doe not look like one of vendean officer who can be said henri can be marigny charles impossible said de lescure marigny be fine robust fellow with handsome open face say man be just reverse be d'elbee come to life again be said arthur mondyon be ugly enough not very big nonsense arthur be old man of men most unlikely to countenance such doings a of la petite vendee think however know man must be charette be courageous yet cruel have exactly that dash of mad romance in seems to belong to new hero charette be in island of noirmoutier said de lescure by account mean to stay there have be really willing to give assistance never need have crossed loire oh certainly be not charette said chapeau saw m charette on horseback once carry a though have swallowed poker gentleman twist about like like like mountebank suppose said de lescure ride well same m charles rejoined chapeau who do think be chapeau said henri chapeau shrugged shoulder a one frenchman can shrug intending to signify impossibility of giving opinion immediately afterwards walked close up to master whispered something in ear henri looked astonished almost confounded by what servant said to then replied almost in whisper impossible chapeau quite impossible immediately afterwards chapeau left room henri followed calling into chamber in lower part of house began to interrogate a to what have whispered upstairs did not like to speak out before m henri said jacques for did not know how lady might take a sure a be standing here man saw on horseback just now be m adolphe denot impossible chapeau quite impossible how on earth must have got mean to raise troop of men in brittany besides never must have returned to side deserted doe not signify m henri whether be likely unlikely that man be adolphe denot 'd wager life on without least hesitation why m henri know a well a know did see face saw rise in saddle throw arm up a did so be quite enough for mad captain of la petite vendee be other than m adolphe denot henri larochejaquelin be hardly convinced yet knew that chapeau must not express so confidently unless have good ground for doing so be aware also that be almost impossible for one who have intimately known denot to mistake seat on horseback therefore though not quite convinced be much inclined to suspect that in spite of improbability unfortunate friend be mysterious leader of breton army determined that must at rate seek out man whoever might be that if found that adolphe denot be really in laval must welcome back with brother love to cause from for so henri have always protested nothing insanity have separated at rate chapeau must go find

halloo out 'now for saumur here be for saumur now for bridge of saumur ' to be sure talk deal about saumur think must have be wounded there badly somewhere near brain though henri did not quite understand why denot must especially allude to saumur in mad moment yet understood enough of what men told about captain to be sure that adolphe be man though must not be shocked to hear spoken of a madman yet rejoiced in heart to find that have done something to redeem character a loyal soldier learnt that denot have be above two month in brittany that have first appeared in neighbourhood of laval with about two hundred men who have followed thither out of province that have there be joined by a many more belonging to maine since time have be backwards forward from one town to chiefly in

at end denot came to door undid wooden bolt within to admit a thought poor zealous creature who have attached to in new career when door opened friend of youth man whom have so deeply injured stood before henri in anxiety to find out truth of chapeau surmise have energetically a turned out successfully pursued object of search have not for moment turned over in mind what must say to denot if found how must contrive to tell that forgave fault how must explain to that be willing again to receive into arm a friend brother moment be now come when must find word to say a awkward bolt be being drawn henri felt that be hardly equal to difficulty of position if henri found difficult to speak with difficulty be much greater injury have inflicted on friend insult have heaped on sister rushed to mind thought of own deep treachery black ingratitude disordered imagination must only conceive that henri have chosen present moment to secure bloody vengeance forgot that have already be forgiven for what have done that life have be in hand of have injured have then be spared by when resentment be fresh hot when have done nothing to redeem treason have thought reconciled to cause of la vendee still felt that must not dare to look on larochejaquelin a other than enemy denot started back a recognized visitor henri first object be to close re bolt door so interview might not be interrupted adolphe said in voice intended to express tenderness felt be delighted to have found denot have rushed to miserable deal table stood near bed seized sword stood upon now stood armed ready for assault

behind sword besides how be to defend if be attacked adolphe said why do raise sword against friend see have come a friend see have sword other hesitated for moment with weapon still raised a though for defence then flinging behind on floor exclaimed there there may kill if will having said so threw on bed sobbed aloud wailed like infant henri knelt down on floor by side of low wooden stretcher putting arm over adolphe shoulder thought for while what must say to comfort crushed spirit of poor wretch whose insanity have not usual effect of protecting from misery occurred to that late achievement a leader of breton peasant in at rate have be successful must be subject at present most agreeable to determined therefore to question a to what have done come adolphe said get up have much to say to other friend have heard much of what have done here in laval in brittany have be of great service to must act together for future of course know that there be vendeans on side of river men woman child together for minute denot still lay with face buried in bed without answering henri knelt beside in silence trying to comfort rather by pressure of hand than by sound of voice then raised up sitting erect with face turned away from friend said be use for to try to speak of have done in brittany when know that heart be full of what did in poitou by god of heaven from whom hope for mercy said henri solemnly have freely entirely forgiven cause of anger ever have against denot still sat with face averted withdrew hand from henri grasp a muttered between teeth have not asked

henri moving close to denot side putting arm round neck embracing know how have suffered know always knew be proper self turned against cause loved so well adolphe wo talk of thing now just now said must talk of be quite right after what have passed can not meet without having much to say again madman jumped to foot a paced up down room fiercer humour again came upon henri exclaimed a spoke stood still close to other henri why avenge sister honour why punish dishonour brought on father hoary head henri say why seize by throat wretched traitor who brought desolation destruction into family stretched out long gaunt neck a though expected that larochejaquelin must rise from bed take at word henri felt that be useless to endeavour to reason with to answer raving of madness still hoped that by mixture of firmness gentleness might yet take away from present miserable dwelling by degree bring back to happier state of mind difficulty in way however be very great for knew how serious must be danger folly of leading again into agatha presence nonsense adolphe said why do talk to friend of vengeance come take up sword come away be cold damp place besides want refreshment before next day work before six hour be gone republican army will be near laval must be prepared to meet picked up denot sword handed cap took arm within own a though to lead at once out of room where be going to

ever talk about bridge of saumur now henri to day have never heard word of want of courage denot have shown in passage of bridge of saumur one de lescure have noticed though certainly have never forgotten have be too generous to speak of to one henri merely knew that two friend charles adolphe have be together at bridge have heard from others of de lescure gallant conduct have oftentimes be spoken of in army henri have never remarked that equal tribute of praise be not given to two for deed on occasion now answered quite at cross purpose merely with object of flattering vanity of friend will never forget adolphe vendean will ever forget bridge of saumur will remember that glorious day when have forgotten many thing have happened since poor denot winced dreadfully under blow henri so innocently inflicted merely said will not go with need ask for mind be made up do know henri de lescure never loved other never never never even when be seemingly such good friend never loved other loved so well that for sake bore with man despised yes always despised since time came home from school together blame for tried hard to conceal what felt thought that did not know from first day that passed together found out be never happy in company be perfectly unintelligible to henri be attributed by to frenzy of madness in fact there be truth in denot irregular spirit have be cowed by de lescure cold reasoning propriety now felt impossible to submit to pardon of man who thought must forgive abhor be to purpose henri threatened implored almost strove to drag from room denot be obstinate in resolve henri be at last obliged to leave with agreement that must meet on horseback hour before daybreak at gate of town led towards anger when henri returned downstairs found chapeau

be most glorious omen said henri jumping up look on success a certain when predicted by charles for be least sanguine among henri said take advice attack till be close to town may be sure will be ready enough to give opportunity after having driven across loire like wild goose lechelle will not doubt power to drive also from street of laval be agreed among de lescure advice must be taken that none of vendeans must advance above league on road towards antrames be already known that general lechelle whole army be in neighbourhood of town be not likely that a have pursued vendeans so far must remain there long without giving opportunity now desired of again trying strength with a henri prepared to leave room little chevalier rose to accompany said henri stopping do remain with chapeau

wild gaunt look about have so startled friend when first saw there be more of hope spirit in countenance spoke if did not look like soldier will now leave warrior of la vendee to obtain what success can against experienced troop of republican army men so well known in many bloody battle a soldier of mayence will return stay while with woman wounded man who be left to horror of long day suspense for considerable time said nothing to other a to probable event of day for knew well that must hear news for few hour to come by degree cold grey dawn of october morning broke into room candle be put out ordinary employment at time be utterly out of question so clustered together at window waited for such news a chance might bring from time to time annot stein who be now living with in house came in joined after while old marquis be brought into room took station at opposite window to occupied by de lescure noise in street be incessant soldier on horseback on foot cannon waggon passed on without moment pause men shouted a went by eager for revenge against enemy who have driven from home woman mixed in crowd shrieking screaming a parted from husband lover morning air be cold chill still de lescure insisted on having window open that might cheer with voice men a passed below that might call to by name whom might chance to know wife be astonished to find how many remembered to perceive soldier a passed recognized wan face of general expressed sincere delight at again seeing feature well done forestier well done gallant friend exclaimed a tall handsome man rode by who from garb arm be evidently officer have however like many of officer belonged to lowly rank still looked up with reverence to of fellow soldier whose blood be more noble than own be never missing when strong arm be wanted man took off cap bowed low to saddle bow have be born to manner must not have done with more grace god bless general said god grant that may soon see here among again thousand loud clamorous voice echoed wish tear rose to de lescure eye none wife must mark knew that friend kind wish be vain that have now personally hope except in death must not entirely repress vain regret that might live to witness success of party of since sojourn in laval have taught to be sanguine be moment before tear be gone eye be again on fire with enthusiasm ah de bauge good de bauge exclaimed a friend of early youth passed by using at moment effort to repress wild clamouring hurry of follower god prosper thee dear friend oh that now have score two such soldier a thou art have many hundred here a good said de bauge pausing moment from work to salute friend whom recognized at window thousand perhaps a brave thousand a eager if did know how to use courage answered de lescure after there be lull for few moment then troop of cuirassier trotted down street jingling bridle sword spur a moved small body of cavalry have be for time pride strongest hope of vendeans have be gradually armed horsed trained during war by greatest exertion of wealthiest among officer have certainly proved to be worth trouble have cost be now ala reduced to number have ridden out of chatillon before battle of cholet remnant be still full of spirit anxious to avenge fallen brother bright trapping complete accoutrement afforded strange contrast to medley appearance of footman who retreated back to house to make way for horse told more plainly than word must do difference between army of trained soldier band of brave tumultuous peasant be now nine o'clock shortly after horseman have passed through street little chevalier came in with news that be immediately about to attack blue republican army being already within mile of town that henri be at moment leaving guard house preparing to lead attack when have told so much aloud to stooped down to whisper to de lescure adolphe denot be riding everywhere through town at henri right hand that be redoubtable mad captain leader of la petite vendee de lescure have not time to question chevalier to express surprise before henri be seen coming down street on horseback almost at full gallop at right hand rode man whom did not immediately recognize agatha however knew at first glance who stranger be with instinctive feeling that sight of must be painful to retreated behind father couch so that must not well see from street when chapeau have first whispered into master ear name of adolphe denot a leader of breton agatha have truly guessed purport of whisper can not therefore be said that be startled to see adolphe once more by brother side still must not shudder a remembered circumstance under have last seen inhuman crime of have be guilty henri rode little in advance a passed merely turned laughing face towards friend kissed hand to window denot till be nearly close to house have not thought of neighbourhood be in have least idea that usual inhabitant of town be looking down on till wandering eye fell full upon face of marie madame de lescure who be standing close to open window immediately blood rushed to face suffused almost with purple red checked horse suddenly for moment looked full up at window where met cold gaze of de lescure fixed full upon pause be for moment must not bear ordeal of look fixing eye to ground struck spur into horse hurried out of sight of on whom did not dare to turn face agatha love in name of blessed virgin who be said marquis rubbing eye before unearthly apparition seemed to have appeared who be that rode by with henri only that know be impossible must have said that be adolphe denot be adolphe sir said arthur mondyon be be mad captain who have be knocking blue about in such wonderful manner suppose got tired of santerre santerre of thought must agree long together arthur said agatha must speak kindly of now see that henri have forgiven if can forgive surely ought to do so be really true that henri adolphe denot be again friend said marquis speaking rather to than to one else well must have thought must have be impossible if henri can forgive ought to do so too think must feel at ease if be in room with think will come to father said agatha did not observe face a passed very sight of seemed to cut to heart adolphe have be quite right when said that be not at like henri there be not one of whole party who did not strive heartily truly to forgive treason iniquity of have be guilty there be not one there who did not at same time feel secret wish that might never again be under same roof with man who have be traitor to friend to king arthur mondyon soon left hurried out to bear part in contest be just commencing be little jealous to think that accustomed place near henri must have be taken from by one who have proved so faithless a denot still be not inclined to pas such day a in door with sick men trembling woman promised however to come to from time to time if be impossible to send news of what be going on a be probable that thickest of fight must be either in town immediately on skirt of there be reason why must not keep promise for couple of hour remained in dreadful suspense hearing nothing fearing everything seemed to a though whole day must have passed in two hour de lescure became dreadfully impatient even irritable declaring at one moment that be quite equal to mount horse that must go out see what be about then again almost fainting with exhaustion occasioned by intense excitement then must lament inexperience of henri expressing dread that indiscretion day must ruin hope again when saw how painful surmise be to agatha marie must begin to praise courage indomitable good spirit declare strongest safeguard lay in affection to person be shared by peasant of la vendee suspense be at length broken not by visit message from own party by most unexpected unwelcome sight on sudden again heard tumultuous noise of troop coming down street on occasion be entering instead of leaving town a rushing body of men turned corner in street be seen that wore well known blue uniform of republican regiment yes there in truth be blue now immediately under house be occupying file after file of sturdy grizzled veteran soldier hurried through street in quick regular time men quite unlike own dear peasant soldier men with musket in hand shako on head cartouche box slung behind back three lady before whose sight horrid reality of danger so long apprehended suddenly appeared have never be so near scene of absolute battle agatha be true have have to endure through one long dreadful night presence of santerre men in chateau of durbelliere then have active part to play have only to sit in quiet wait for doom now felt that something must be done mean must be tried to escape from danger be so close to woman immediately withdrew from window wheeled away couch on marquis be lying nothing must induce de lescure to allow to be stirred in fixed silence with head resting low on window sill gazed on crowded soldier a poured thick numerous into town oh where be henri now said madame de lescure what will do where be to go speak charles for heaven sake speak marie have opened door now stood with in hand wishing to run yet not choosing to leave companion in misfortune while agatha vainly endeavoured with unassisted strength to remove father from room henri be just where ought to be said de lescure there there now come now come by heaven there be denot leading see there be de bauge arthur dear boy gallant boy well done henri larochejaquelin have be grey must not have be better done have got blue a be into wine press poor devil not one can escape alive de lescure when first saw republican coming down street have for moment thought that town be in hand minute reflection served to show be such really case must have driven before hundred of retreating vendeans peasant have never yet so utterly forgotten courage a to throw down weapon at first sight of enemy fly without making effort for victory de lescure be sure that such must not now have be case immediately occurred to that passage of gate must have be purposely left free to devoted blue henri men must fail upon in town where discipline superior arm must be of comparatively little use to be right for while woman be yet trembling panic struck at first sight of enemy henri party have entered long street from market place with fierce yell of defiance vendean cavalry rushed upon astonished blue meeting almost beneath very window from de lescure be looking three woman crouched round aged marquis in farthest corner of room comforted to find that whom so trusted still expected victory nearly fainting with fear deafened with sound of conflict to de lescure sight be pleasure a must not be in fight next thing be to see combatant cheer friend foremost of republican soldier soon gave way beneath weight of attack though fought sturdily did best to keep ground must not however retreat far own men still advancing behind blocked up way after while de lescure have predicted took place party of vendeans have attacked in rear occupied only gate through must leave city now slaughter in street be dreadful blue hemmed in on side fought desperately for life like beast at bay now again vendeans retreated step two driven back by fury of foe then again regained ground advancing over body of slain one in strange medley on be looking be more conspicuous to de lescure eye than adolphe denot have lost cap in confusion of fight thin wan face disfigured by wound chevalier have given be plainly to be seen de lescure be shocked by change saw there only weapon bore be huge sabre swung round head with strength must not have be expected from attenuated frame be often most forward always among first of assailant frequently became surrounded by blue who be prevented by closeness of crowd from using arm have caught de lescure eye from time to time turned face up toward window a though anxious to discover whether who have before witnessed cowardice be now looking upon prowess by heaven fight well said de lescure to wife who be gradually creeping somewhat nearer to husband still unable to face horror of open window be greatly changed look look at now well done adolphe well done there there be down poor fellow fear have struck last blow gallant henri brave henri there be up again together denot face be covered with blood still have sword however well done denot bravely done denot man of living dead ever struck better blow than that last word be distinctly heard by to whom be addressed a again turned up face ray of triumph illumined sunken eye did not however must not speak for heat of battle be carried back again towards gate tumultuous sea of fighting men be hurried away from spot where have be contending while scene be going on in street set of combatant be engaged near gate here two men of very different nature of similar station in life found together during temporary pause after protracted struggle be michael stein auguste emile septimus plume in spite of that have said against trade michael have in old age turned soldier have be fighting sturdily with huge woodman axe weapon have chanced to meet with use of came readily to hand be now sitting on step of gate house wiping with sleeve of coat perspiration unaccustomed work have brought to forehead listening to praise of m plume who be

upon floor dead body of republican general unfortunate man have shot henri turned out of shop without saying word a others prepared to follow one of men knelt down beside body wrenched from hand still

mad captain of la petite vendee have be seen during whole day riding by side of own general denot have not yet be recognized by many of vendeans most of around be indifferent to fate when henri reached room in lay one be with poor baker of laval who have entered town with chapeau having heard that captain be mortally wounded have lost not moment in tendering service poor man be sitting on low stool close by denot head in lap held wooden bowl of water with from time to time moistened mouth of wounded man dipping hand into water letting drop fall from finger on to lip hush hush said a henri entered room for mercy sake shake black blood gush out of mouth with move get two men did not recognize other for have only met for moment that by faint light of rush candle plume therefore have idea of giving up place duty to man whom conceived be stranger henri be at loss to conceive who must be singular looking creature seemed to take so tender interest in friend henri advanced up to bed on tiptoe gazed into denot face have be shocked before now thought that never in life have seen so sad sight colour of skin be no longer pale livid thin dry lip be partially open teeth close set together be distinctly visible eye be at moment closed a though be in stupor long black matted hair hung back over folded cloak on head rested sallow bony hand lay by side firmly clenched a though have be struggling neck breast have be opened for inspection of surgeon be merely covered with ragged bloody towel be asleep asked henri in whisper such a seems to come naturally to one when speaking by bed side of who be in great danger be generally much more painfully audible to sick man than natural voice denot opened eye showed by slight motion of head that have heard friend voice be at moment unable to speak plume made signal to henri to be quiet therefore sat down at other side of bed to watch till adolphe must gain strength to speak to till breath must have passed from body plume in meantime continued occupation causing few drop of water to fall from time to time between thin shrivelled lip in way long half hour passed over at last henri heard name scarcely pronounced by dying man dull eye opened though be evident that film of death have nearly hidden object from view still be evident that knew who be that sat by bed side faintly returned pressure of hand grasped own henri stooped down ear to catch word might fall from lip for while made farther attempt to speak inexpressible look of confused trouble passed across face forehead a attempted to collect disordered thought again closed eye a though struggle be useless at last again muttered something henri caught word lescure ' 'bridge of saumur ' yes yes will said henri trying to comfort still not understanding what be that weighed so heavily on breast felt however that promise of compliance must give comfort will indeed will tell know will again eye be closed struggle to speak be discontinued plume gave over task for be evident that care of must longer be of avail walked away from bed that might not overhear word captain strove to speak to friend henri remained still holding denot hand then thought struck have not earlier occurred to beckoning to plume to come to dismissed in whisper to endeavour to find priest without loss of moment bring to aid of dying man though denot sight speech be almost gone sense of hearing be still left to understood what henri said again moved head in token of dissent again pulled friend towards by hand again muttered out word last that ever attempted to utter that one word henri heard a plainly a though have be spoken with full breath of strong man be sister name adolphe denot survived last effort of troubled spirit few moment sepulchral rattle in throat soon told sad tale of dissolution plume hurrying up to bed head assisted henri in composing limb of dead man for three month denot plume have consorted together have be strange fantastic pair of comrade yet not altogether ill matched nothing must be more dissimilar than have be in age in birth previous habit have met together with same wish same ambition same want of common sense above same overweening vanity have flattered other from moment of first meeting to present day thus two poor zealous maniac for in point of sanity lieutenant be little better than captain have learnt to love other now plume having carefully completed what exigency of moment required gave way to sincere grief bewailed friend with silent sorrow henri who have totally forgotten little that have heard of martial baker be at loss to conceive who must be man stranger to who found cause for so much sorrow in death of adolphe denot a for have tenderly loved denot a brother have truly forgiven gross treachery have determined to watch over if possible protect from farther sorrow after interview have have with must not conceal from that adolphe be still insane felt that death have come to in honourable way atoning for past fault relieving from future suffering must not grieve that friend have fallen in battle bravely doing duty in cause to be bound by so many tie be bravest man best soldier most honourable gentleman in whole army said plume sobbing now there be one left then recovering made to mane of departed warrior loyal promise fully determined to keep thou art gone brave commander gallant commander said standing suddenly upright stretching long arm over corpse thou art gone doubt not will follow thee till moment will come till death a honourable a thine own will release from promise swear will not disgrace high station thy departure obliges to fill be thou who first tutored unaccustomed arm to wield sword be thou who badest hear unmoved thunder of enemy artillery be thou who taughtest know of military tactic art of war rest in peace dear friend dearest of instructor will not disgrace thy precept so finishing stooped down kissed face of dead body apostrophized made cross on bosom muttered fervent prayer for welfare of departed soul if henri be surprised before be now perfectly astounded nothing must be le poetical le imposing have le of military grandeur about than figure of poor auguste plume what must mean by saying that be now called on to fill high station who must be that confessed to owe so deep debt of gratitude to dead man have known m denot long asked henri when conceived that plume be sufficiently composed to hear answer question what be that say name be said plume eagerly pricking up ear beg pardon sir did exactly catch word did know name of friend whom seem to have valued so highly indeed to tell truth sir did not two used to have good deal of talk together for hour hour have sat talked over war have told much of what used to do in poitou when served with vendeans must never get to tell name be question did like to be asked yet be sure never did anything to disgrace name be adolphe denot said henri adolphe denot adolphe denot well be very glad know at last one doe like not to know name of dearest friend one ever have especially after be dead be count denot baron denot something of sort no have title yet be of noble blood suppose then must call general denot simple general sound a well a count marquis in day be general when knew in la vendee have known life replied henri indeed said plume then gazing at companion from head to foot continued gentleman came with chapeau to see last night commander in chief of vendeans henri gave to understand that be then meeting be very lucky said plume most exceedingly fortunate be now commander in chief of la petite vendee must unite force be not ambitious at least not too ambitious will be chief will be next to chapeau be sure will be contented to be third here over body of friend let concert measure for utterly exterminating republican have now be victorious proudly grandly victorious voice will be for march to paris come general give hand hand in hand like true comrade let march to paris thunder at door of convention a spoke auguste emile septimus held out hand to young commander henri must not refuse proffered grasp now remembered chapeau description of martial baker a underwent merciless squeeze plume inflicted on young marquis meditated with something like vexation on ridiculous figure language of who now claimed friendship confidence have before be on term of perfect equality with men equally low in station with poor plume cathelineau have be postillion stofflet game keeper have admired enthusiastic genius of cathelineau have respected practical iron energy of stofflet must neither admire respect auguste plume yet must not reject endeavoured in a few word a must to make companion understand highly a appreciated disinterested offer must not at present moment accede to that many officer high in confidence of whole army must be consulted before important step be taken that a for duty required to hurry back to laval a quick a must that a regarded plume advised to return to own men endeavour to organize into regular corp in doing promised that practical assistance must not be wanting that a regarded body of mutual friend henri must give order for immediate burial having said so much a quickly a must speak henri larochejaquelin hurried from room leaving unfortunate plume to renew lamentation over friend have cause to lament only man likely to flatter vanity be gone must never again be told that be born for great achievement never again promised that bravery fidelity to commander gallant demeanour among comrade must surely lead to exalted duty such be precept with insanity of denot have inflamed mad ambition of poor follower now felt not own unfitness for must not suspect difficulty impossibility to get talent service

now returning from pursuit in have nearly exterminated unfortunate army have followed across loire have crossed that river panic stricken hopeless now be shouting with triumph exulting with joy confident of success none of who returned be without token of success carried back with musket of republican infantry others sabre of cavalry others more joyful in success than be mounted on horse

of follower have certainly be pre eminently successful in first attempt have be made under own sole command be not surprising that joined to confidence of youth must have made feel equal almost to enterprise then subject of joy filled heart marie have promised that if vendeans be now successful if must look forward to spending one quiet week in laval must no longer refuse to join hand to become bone of bone flesh of flesh that promise must now realize therefore a rode back through gate of laval henri felt happier than have done for many long weary tedious day chapter xii vendean marriage young general good news have preceded when entered room where friend be assembled be one ready to embrace congratulate successful soldier received blessing of father praise of de lescure thanks admiration of madame de lescure what valued more than marie acknowledgment of promise gave when last left side during absence three unexpected visitor have reached laval first be father jerome who

saumur from time when found in wretched chamber to moment of death be talking of connecting name charles with everything said at know what be in thought something connected with bridge of saumur be great trouble to great triumph then de lescure told what have happened how poor fellow heart have failed at moment when courage be so necessary how have feared to advance at decisive moment have shrunk back appalled conquered disgraced henri now understood why de lescure have not allowed denot to be chosen at saumur a one of twelve leader of army why have subsequently so generally distrusted expressed so little surprise of conduct of have be guilty at durbelliere history said de lescure give singular insight into intricacy of man character adolphe be not naturally coward for madness aggravates foible of nature one can have shown more capable of gallantry than did yesterday wanted that sustained courage be only given by principle trust in god may forgive sin mercifully remembering infirmity time after preparation be made for marriage of henri marie such preparation a time place allowed there be now inclination opportunity for fete such a must have graced nuptials of marie de

fiction have be blended with history still outline of historical fact have be too closely followed to allow now to indulge humanity of reader by ascribing to friend be quitting success did not achieve state of happiness never be allowed to enjoy must be easy to speak of curly haired darling two of course who blessed union of henri larochejaquelin marie de lescure joy with restored aged father to rural delight of chateau at durbelliere might tell of recovery of modern paladine charles de lescure of glorious rebuilding of house of clisson of ecclesiastical honour of father jerome of happy marriage with more probability happier celibacy of divine agatha can not do so with propriety fact stern untoward cruel fact stare in face must make even novelist blush be in total disregard of well
