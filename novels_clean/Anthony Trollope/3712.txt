stuff into head doe mamma said mimmy who rarely allowed mother to put down mr thompson made further answer again sat with head resting on hand also if truth must be told be thinking of m lacordaire fondness for herself have squeezed hand have looked into face however much may have be nonsense on mimmys part to talk of such thing have not le absolutely occurred be really fact that m lacordaire be in love with if so what return must must make to passion have looked at yesterday squeezed hand to day might not be probable that must advance step further to morrow if so what answer must be prepared to make to did not thinkso said to herselfthat have particular objection to marrying again thompson have be dead now for four year friend friend world must say be wrong on score a to marrying frenchman must not say felt within absolute repugnance to doing that of own country speaking of england a such in truth knew littleand perhaps cared le have gone to india almost a child england have not be specially kind to on return have found dull cold stiff almost ill natured people there have not smiled on be civil a m lacordaire have done a far a england englishman be considered saw reason why must not marry m lacordaire then a regarded man must in heart say that be prepared to love honour obey m lacordaire certainly knew reason why must not do so did not know much of said to herself at first knew a much said afterwards a have known personally of mr thompson before marriage have known to be sure what be mr thompson profession what income if not one else have known for a to point be quite in dark a regarded m lacordaire personally certainly did like a said to herself more than once there be courtesy softness about be very gratifying to then appearance be so much in favour be not very young acknowledged be young be quite evident that be fond of child that must be kind affectionate father to indeed there be kindness in that did must marry againand put to herself quite hypotheticallyshe must look for romance in such second marriage must be content to sit down in quiet home to tame dull reality of life satisfied with companionship of man who must be kind gentle to whom must respect esteem where must find companion with whom must be more safely anticipated than with m lacordaire so argued question within own breast in manner not unfriendly to gentleman that there be a yet one great hindrance at once saw then might be remedied by word did not know what be income profession chambermaid whom have interrogated have told that be marchand to merchant generally felt that have objection baring rothschild be merchant a be also that wonderful man at bombay sir hommajee bommajee who be worth did know how many thousand lac of rupee that must behove on own account that of daughter to take care of own little fortune in contracting such connection that felt strongly must never so commit a to put security in respect out of power then did not think that m lacordaire must ever ask to do so at rate be determined on that there must never be doubt on matter a firmly resolved on again took up book for minute two made attempt to read mamma said mummy will m lacordaire go up to school to see lilian when go away from indeed can not say dear if lilian be good girl perhaps may do so now then will write to tell how be lilian can write for herself can not oh yes suppose can hope m lacordaire will write too will come back here day shant mamma can not say dear do so hope will see m lacordaire again do know what be thinking mamma little girl like ought not to think said mr thompson walking slowly out of room to top of stair back again for have felt necessity of preventing mimmy from disclosing more of thought now dear get ready will go up to school mr thompson always dressed with care though not in especially fine clothes before went down to dinner at table dhte on occasion be more than usually particular hardly explained to herself why did nevertheless a stood before glass did in certain manner feel that circumstance of future life might perhaps depend on might be said done that evening have not absolutely decided whether must go to prince chteau if did go well if did what then have sense enough a assured more than once to regulate own conduct with propriety in such emergency during dinner m lacordaire conversed in usual manner said nothing whatever about visit to polignac be very kind to mimmy very courteous to mother did not appear to be at more particular than usual indeed might be question whether be not le so a have entered room mr thompson have said to herself that perhaps after must be better that there must be nothing more thought about before four of five course be over be beginning to feel little disappointed now fruit be on table after consumption of be practice to retire be certainly open to to ask m lacordaire to take tea with evening a have done on former occasion felt that must not do now considering immediate circumstance of case if further step be to be taken must be taken by not by heror else by mimmy who just a mother be slowly consuming last grape ran round to back of m lacordaires chair whispered something into ear may be presumed that mr thompson did not see intention of movement in time to arrest for did nothing till whispering have be whispered then rebuked child bade not to be troublesome with more than usual austerity in voice desired to get ready to go up stair to chamber a spoke rose from chair made final little bow to table other final little bow smile to m lacordaire be certain to who saw that smile be not a gracious a usual a walked forth m lacordaire rose from chairsuch being constant practice when left table on occasion accompanied to door have madame decided asked whether will permit to accompany to chteau well really dont know said mr thompson mees meemy continued m lacordaire be very anxious to see rock may perhaps hope that mees lilian must be pleased with little excursion a for myself then m lacordaire put hand upon heart in manner seemed to speak more plainly than have ever spoken well if child must really like andas be so very kind said mr thompson so matter be conceded to morrow afternoon suggested m lacordaire mr thompson fixed on saturday thereby showing that be in hurry for expedition oh be so glad said mimmy when have re entered own room mamma do let tell lilian when go up to school to morrow mamma be in humour to say much to child on subject at present moment threw back on sofa in perfect silence began to reflect whether must like to sign name in future a fanny lacordaire instead of fanny thompson certainly seemed a though thing be verging towards such necessity marchand marchand of what have instinctive feeling that people in hotel be talking about m lacordaire be therefore more than ever averse to asking one question a went up to school next afternoon walked through more of street of le puy than be necessary in street looked at name saw over door of more respectable house of business looked in vain might be that m lacordaire be marchand of so specially high quality a to be under necessity to put up name at sir hommajee bommajees name did not appear over door in bombayat least thought not then came saturday morning will be ready at two said a left breakfast table perhaps must not mind calling for lilian on way m lacordaire must be delighted to call anywhere for anybody on behalf of mr thompson then a got to door of salon offered hand did so with so much french courtesy that must not refuse then felt that purpose be more tender than ever have be why not if be destiny fate have prepared for mr thompson must rather have got into carriage at other spot in le puy than at at be forced to do sothe chief entrance namely of htel de ambassadeurs what made worse be that appearance of special fate be given to occasion m lacordaire be dressed in more than sunday best have on new yellow kid glove coat if not new be newer than mr thompson have yet observed be lined with silk up to very collar have on patent leather boot glittered a mr thompson thought much too conspicuously a for hat be quite evident that be fresh that morning from maker block in costume with hat in hand stood under great gateway of hotel ready to hand mr thompson into carriage must have be nothing if landlord landlady have not be there also a well a man cook four waiter fille de chambre two three other pair of eye mr thompson also saw a glanced round then mimmy walked across yard in best clothes with fte day air about for mother must have liked to have whipped what did matter if be written in book that must become madame lacordaire of course world must know that there must have be preparatory love making let have laugh good husband must not be dearly purchased at so trifling expense so sallied forth with already ceremony of wedding mimmy seated opposite to mother m lacordaire also sat with back to horse leaving second place of honour for lilian pray make comfortable m lacordaire dont mind said mr thompson be firm in purpose of civility perhaps making up mind that when must in truth stand in place of papa to young lady then must be time for having back seat in carnage lilian also in best frock came down school step three of school teacher came with must have added to mr thompson happiness at moment if m lacordaire must have kept polished boot out of sight put yellow glove into pocket then started road from le puy to polignac be nearly up hill very steep hill be so that there be plenty of time for conversation girl have nearly to mimmy thought that have never found m lacordaire so stupid lilian told sister on first safe opportunity occurred that seemed very much a though be going to church do of polignac people ever live at place asked mr thompson by way of making conversation in answer to m lacordaire informed madame that place be at present only ruin then there be again silence till found under rock be informed by driver that rest of ascent must be made on foot rock now stood abrupt precipitous above head be larger in circumference with much larger space on summit than other volcanic rock in close to town then at same time be higher from ground quite a inaccessible except by single path led up to chteau m lacordaire with conspicuous gallantry first assisted mr thompson from carriage then handed down two young lady lady must have be so difficult to please a to complain of yet mr thompson thought that be not a agreeable a usual horrid boot horrid glove gave air of holiday finery that must be at ease wearing must in seeing worn be soon taken in hand by poor woman whose privilege be to show ruin for little distance walked up path in single file not that be too narrow to accommodate two m lacordaires courage have not yet be screwed to point admitted of offering arm to widow for in france must be remembered that mean more than doe in other country mr thompson felt that be silly useless if be not to be dear friend coming out fting together boot glove new hat be very foolish if be sooner understood other better so mr thompson finding that path be steep weather warm stood still for while leaning against wall with look of considerable fatigue in face will madame permit honour of offering arm said m lacordaire road be so extraordinarily steep for madame to climb mr thompson did permit honour so went on till reached top view from summit be extensive grand lilian mimmy be much pleased with place elder sister who have talked over matter with school companion expected fine castle with turret battlement romance other expected pretty smiling house such a prince in mind ought to inhabit instead of found old turret with step so broken that m lacordaire did not care to ascend ruined wall of mansion in nothing be to be seen remains of enormous kitchen chimney be kitchen of family said guide oh said mr thompson said woman taking into next ruined compartment be kitchen of monsieur et madame what two kitchen exclaimed lilian upon m lacordaire explained that ancestor of prince de polignac have be very great people have therefore required culinary performance on great scale then woman began to chatter something about oracle of apollo there be said hole in rock from in past time perhaps more than hundred year ago oracle used to speak forth mysterious word there said pointing to part of rock at distance be hole if lady must follow to little outhouse be just beyond must show huge stone mouth out of oracle used to speak lilian mimmy declared at once for seeing oracle mr thompson expressed determination to remain sitting where be upon turf so guide started off with young lady will be thought surprising that m lacordaire must have remained alone by side of mr thompson must be now never mr thompson felt a regarded m lacordaire probably entertained idea of same kind mr thompson inclination though have never be very strong in matter be certainly in favour of now m lacordaires inclination be stronger have fully firmly made up mind in favour of matrimony then be not so absolutely in favour of now mr thompson mind if one must have read must have shown great objection to shilly willying a be accustomed to call m lacordaire be not for danger might thence arise must have seen objection to slight further procrastination courage be beginning perhaps to ooze out from finger end declare that girl have scampered away ever so far said mr thompson must madame wish must call back said m lacordaire innocently oh dear child let enjoy will be pleasure to to run about rock suppose will be safe with woman oh yes quite safe said m lacordaire then there be little pause mr thompson be sitting on broken fragment of stone just outside entrance to old family kitchen m lacordaire be standing immediately before have in hand little cane with sometimes slapped boot sometimes poked about among rubbish hat be not quite straight on head having little jaunty twist to one side with reference to by bye mr thompson then resolved that must make change must ever gentleman become own property still wore glove be very smart be clear to see that be not at ease hope heat doe not incommode said after few moment silence mr thompson declared that did not that liked good deal of heat that on whole be very well where be be afraid however that be detaining m lacordaire who might probably wish to be moving about upon rock in answer to m lacordaire declared that never must be so happy anywhere a in close vicinity be too good to said mr thompson almost sighing dont know what stay here must have be without great kindness be madame have be kind to said m lacordaire pressing handle of cane against heart there be then pause after mr thompson said that be french politeness that knew that have be very troublesome to that must now soon be gone then in own country must never forget great goodness ah madame said m lacordaire a said much more be expressed in face than in word then can neither accept reject gentleman by what say in face blushed too up to grizzled hair turning round walked step two away from widow seat back again mr thompson while sat quite still displaced fragment lying a did near corner of building made not uncomfortable chair have only to be careful that did not injure hat crush clothes throw in word here there to assist gentleman must occasion permit madame said m lacordaire on return from second little walk monsieur replied mr thompson perceiving that m lacordaire paused in speech madame began again then a again paused mr thompson looked up to very sweetly madame what be going to say will be afraid seem to evince by far too great audacity on part mr thompson may perhaps have thought that at present moment audacity be not fault replied however that be quite sure that monsieur must say nothing be in way unbecoming for to speak for to hear madame may have ground to hope that such may be sentiment after have spoken madameand now went down absolutely on knee on hard stone mr thompson looking about into distance almost thought that saw top of guide capmadame have looked forward to opportunity a one in may declare for greatest passion have ever yet felt madame with heart soul love madame offer to homage of heart hand happiness of life posse in world then taking hand gracefully between glove pressed lip against tip of finger if thing be to be done way of doing be perhaps a good a other be one at rate left doubt whatever a to gentleman intention mr thompson must have have own way must not have allowed lover of fifty to go down upon knee must have spared much of romance of declaration so also must have spared yellow glove polished boot be part of necessity of situation therefore wisely took a matter to be passed over with indifference seeing however that m lacordaire still remained on knee be necessary that must take step toward raising especially a two child guide must infallibly be upon before long m lacordaire said surprise greatly pray get up will madame vouchsafe to give small ground for hope girl will be here directly m lacordaire pray get up can talk to much better if will stand up sit down on one of stone m lacordaire did a be bid got up wiped knee of pantaloon with handkerchief sat down beside then pressed handle of cane to heart really have so surprised that hardly know how to answer said thompson indeed can not bring to imagine that be in earnest ah madame be so cruel how can have lived with so long sat beside for so many day without having received image into heart be in earnest ala fear too much in earnest then looked at with eye sighed with strength mr thompson prudence told that must be well to settle matter in one way other a soon a possible long period of love making be fit for younger people than future possible husband object must be to make comfortable if must that must do same for if also be possible a for looking sighings pressing of hand have gone through that twenty year since in india when thompson have be young be still in teen m lacordaire there be so many thing to be considered there hear child coming let walk way for minute turned behind wall placed out of sight walked on few pace till reached parapet stood on uttermost edge of high rock leaning upon continued conversation there be so many thing to be considered said mr thompson again yes of course said m lacordaire one great consideration be thisthat love madame to distraction be very much flattered of course lady must so feel m lacordaire madame be attention if must deign to make happy say that one word love m lacordaire a uttered word did not look a saying be at best mr thompson forgave knew that elderly gentleman under such circumstance look at best if consented tototo such arrangement must only do so on seeing that must be beneficialor at rate not injuriousto child that must offer to ourselves fair promise of future happiness ah madame must be dearest wish of heart to be second father to two young lady except indeed then m lacordaire stopped flow of speech in such matter be so much best to be explicit at once said mr thompson oh yes certainly nothing can be more wise than madame happiness of household depends so much on money madame let say word two monsieur lacordaire have enough for child must marry again must not hope be felt a burden by husband must of course be duty to know what be circumstance before accepted of personally have seen nothing that like oh madame a yet know nothing of circumstance m lacordaire perhaps did feel that mr thompson prudence be of strong masculine description hardly liked le on account to give due be not desirous of marrying solely for money sake also wished for comfortable home proposed to give a much a got only have be anxious to wrap up solid cake of business in casing of sugar of romance mr thompson must not have sugar cake might not be worse on account madame not a yet will be made open at disposal said m lacordaire mr thompson bowed approvingly be in business continued m lacordaire business give eight thousand franc year four time eight be thirty two said mr thompson to herself putting franc into pound sterling in manner that have always found to be readiest well so far statement be satisfactory income of three hundred twenty pound year from business joined to own might do very well did not in least suspect m lacordaire of being false so far matter sounded well what be business asked in tone of voice intended to be indifferent nevertheless showed that listened anxiously for answer to question be standing with arm upon wall looking down upon town of le puy have so stood that must see others countenance a talked mr thompson must now perceive that m lacordaire became red in face a paused before answering be near to seeing emotion gently touched arm with hand did to reassure for saw that be ashamed of having to declare that be tradesman a for herself have made up mind to bear with if found a felt sure must find that trade be one must not degrade hitherto indeedin early daysshe have looked down on trade of what benefit have grand idea be to when have returned to england have tried hand at english genteel society one have seemed to care for therefore touched arm lightly with finger that might encourage paused for moment a have said became red then feeling that have shown symptom of shameand feeling also probably that be unmanly in to do so shook slightly raised head up somewhat more proudly than be wont looked full in face with more strength of character than have yet seen assume then declared business madame said in very audible not in loud voice madameje suis tailleur having so spoken turned slightly from looked down over valley towards le puy there be nothing more said upon subject a drove down from rock of polignac back to town immediately on receiving announcement mr thompson found that have answer to make withdrew handand felt at once that have received blow be not that be angry with m lacordaire for being tailor be angry with in being tailor have so addressed be surprised disappointed altogether put beyond ease have at rate not expected have dreamed of being banker thought that perhaps might have be wine merchant idea have never gone below jeweller watchmaker when word broke upon ear madame je suis tailleur have felt to be speechless word have not be minute spoken when lilian mimmy ran up to mother oh mamma said lilian thought be lost have searched for over chteau have be sitting very quietly here dear looking at view said mr thompson mamma do wish youd see mouth of oracle be so large so round so ugly put arm into way said mimmy at present moment mamma felt interest in mouth of oracle so walked down together to carriage though way be steep mr thompson managed to pick step without assistance of arm did m lacordaire presume to offer drive back to town be very silent mr thompson did make one two attempt at conversation be not effectual m lacordaire must not speak at ease till matter be settled already have begun to perceive that business be against why be that trade of tailor must be le honourable than of haberdasher even grocer sat next other at dinner a usual here a eye be upon made great struggle to behave in accustomed way even in failed world of htel de ambassadeurs knew that m lacordaire have gone forth to make offer to mr thompson world therefore be full of speculation world must make nothing of m lacordaire did look like rejected man mr thompson did not look like woman who have rejected that offer have be madein that everybody agreed from senior habitu of house who always sat at head of table down to junior assistant garon a to reading riddle there be accord among when dessert be done mr thompson a usual withdrew m lacordaire a usual bowed a stood behind own chair did not however attempt to follow when reached door called be
