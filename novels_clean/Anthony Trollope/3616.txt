ballyglass while be so sorely needed at castle conor one must wear before lady without shameand in present frame of mind with infinite contentment let look at one of own said to man a though be merely subject for experimental inquiry larry accustomed to obedience took off shoe handed to own foot be immediately in found that fitted like glove now other said inot smiling for smile must have put on guard somewhat sternly so that habit of obedience must not desert at perilous moment then stretched out hand yer honer cant keep em know said havent ghost of shoe to foot only looked more sternly than

be evidently work of master hand confess be not quite comfortable a walked down stair in first place be nearly hour late knew from vigour of peal have sounded that slowness have already be made subject of strong remark then left shoe went flop flop on alternate step of stair by exertion of foot in drawing up of toe must induce to remain permanently fixed upon foot over above worse than be conviction strong upon mind must become subject of merriment to girl a soon a entered room must understand cause of distress probably at moment be expecting to hear clatter through stone hall with odious metal boot however hurried down entered drawing room determined to keep position near door so might have a little a possible to do on entering a little a possible in going out have other

to very straight backed grim looking lady who occupied corner of sofa on opposite side of hearth knew that politeness required must walk across room make acquaintance with under existing circumstance how be to obey dictate of politeness be determined therefore to stand ground merely bowed across room at miss oconor in so doing made enemy who never deserted during whole of intercourse with family for who know who might have be sitting opposite to a now write upon word mr green lady will expect much from adonis who take so long over toilet said tom oconor in cruel tone of banter knew so well

stranger must have given arm to mr oconor a be took eldest daughter instead contrived to shuffle along into dining room without exciting much attention when there found happily placed between kate
