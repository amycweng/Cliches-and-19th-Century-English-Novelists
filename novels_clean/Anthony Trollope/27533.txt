profitable above others one law thy votary must never transgress buy in cheapest market sell in dearest may divine word be ever found engraved on heart of brown jones robinson of mr brown senior member of firm be expedient that short memoir must be given at time at signed article in mr brown have just retired from butter business doe not appear that in early youth ever have advantage of apprenticeship seems to have be employed in various branch of trade in position if one may say so of out door messenger in capacity entered service of mr mccockerell retail butter dealer in smithfield when mr mccockerell died mr brown married widow thus found elevated at once to full blown dignity of tradesman wife lived together for thirty year be believed that in temper of lady found alloy to prosperity have achieved widow mccockerell in bestowing person upon mr brown have not intended to endow also with entire dominion over shop chattel loved to be supreme over butter tub loved also to be supreme over till brown view on right of woman be more in accordance with law of land a laid down in statute opined that femme couverte must own property not even butter tub hence quarrel arose after thirty year of contest such a mr brown found victorious made so not by power of argument by of own right arm by demise of mr brown amiable lady died leaving two daughter to lament loss series of family quarrel by did lay in power to embarrass husband by must not prevent from becoming absolute owner of butter business of stock in trade two young lady have not be brought up to way of counter a mr brown be not especially expert at particular business in money be embarked prudently thought expedient to dispose of shop goodwill did to advantage thus at age of fifty five found again on world with l in pocket at period one of daughter be no longer under own charge sarah jane eldest of two be already mr jones have be captivated by black hair silk waistcoat of mr jones have gone off with in opposition to wish of parent be aware be not matter of much moment for opposition of one be sure to bring about reconciliation with other such be soon case mr brown must not see daughter allow jones to put foot inside butter shop mr brown consequently took lodging for in neighbourhood hence close alliance sprung up between future partner at crisis maryanne devoted to mother be admitted by who knew that maryanne brown have charm at time be about twenty four year of age be certainly fine young woman be like mother little too much inclined to corpulence there may be who must not allow that hair be auburn mr robinson however who be then devotedly attached to be of opinion be ready to maintain view against man who must dare to say that be red there be dash about maryanne brown at period endeared greatly to mr robinson be quite above anything mean when papa be left widower in possession of four thousand pound be one of who be most anxious to induce to go to work with spirit in new business be for advertising must be confessed of though subsequent conduct be not that must have be maryanne brown when tried in furnace did not come out pure gold at rate will be confessed in behalf that have dash about understood more of trick of trade than other of family mr mccockerell died about six month after eldest daughter marriage be generally called mr mccockerell in neighbourhood of smithfield though so many year have passed since have lost right to name indeed generally preferred being so styled a mr brown be peculiarly averse to name be wormwood to be quite sufficient to give melody in ear good lady died about six month after daughter marriage be struck with apoplexy at time have not be reconciled to married daughter sarah jane nevertheless when heard what have occurred came over to smithfield husband be then in employment a shopman at large haberdashery house on snow hill lived with wife in lodging in cowcross street be supported nearly entirely by mr brown therefore owed to at crisis not only obedience dutiful affection when however sarah jane first heard of mother illness seemed to think that must quarrel with father fast enough jones have idea that old lady money must go to daughter that have power of putting altogether out of hand of husband that having power must certainly exercise on speculation have married a wife fully concurred in financial view be considered expedient by to lose time in asserting right did a soon a breath be out of old lady body jones have married sarah jane solely with view indeed be highly improbable that must have done so on other consideration sarah jane be certainly not handsome girl neck be scraggy arm lean lip thin resembled father mother light brown sandy hair always looked a though be too thin too short to adapt to feminine usage be also not of family disposition be compound of paternal maternal quality have father painful hesitating timidity with mother grasping spirit if there ever be eye looked sharp after penny must weigh ounce of servant meal at glance foresee prevent expenditure of farthing be eye of sarah jane brown say that be a easy to save fortune a to make one in way if in other jones may be said to have got fortune with wife a soon a breath be out of mr mccockerell body sarah jane be there taking inventory of stock at moment poor mr brown be very much to be pitied be man of feeling even if heart be not touched by late loss knew what be due to decency behoved now a widower to forget deceased lady fault to put under ground with solemnity be done with strictest propriety although must of course have be thinking good deal at time a to whether be to be beggar rich man nevertheless conducted till after funeral a though have care on mind except loss of mr b maryanne be a much on alert a sister have be for last six month mother pet a sarah jane have be father darling there be excuse therefore for maryanne when endeavoured to get what must in scramble sarah jane played part of goneril to life must have denied father barest necessary of existence have not ultimately turned out that property be own maryanne be not well pleased to see sister returning to house at moment at least have be dutiful to mother if undutiful not openly so if mr mccockerell have power of leaving property to whom pleased must be only natural that must leave to daughter who have obeyed not to daughter who have added to personal disobedience worse fault of having be on friendly term with father one must have thought must have be clear at rate to jones if not to sarah jane seemed at time to have imagined that eldest child have right to inheritance a being eldest will be observed by by many other trait in character that mr jones have never enjoyed advantage of education mr mccockerell never spoke after fit first struck never moved eye stirred limb uttered word be wretched household at time good lady died on wednesday be gathered to father at kensal green cemetery on tuesday following during intervening day mr jones sarah jane took on a though be owner of everything maryanne did try to prevent inventory not wishing to appear that mr jones have right to meddle task be too congenial to sarah jane spirit to allow of giving over revelled in work be delight to to search out hidden store of useless wealth to bring forth to light forgotten hoard of cup saucer to catalogue rag on premise house at time be not pleasant one mr brown finding jones in whom have trusted have turned against put very much into hand of young friend of named george robinson who what george robinson be will be told in next chapter there be three question said robinson to be asked answered have mr b power to make will if so did make will if so what be will made mr brown must remember whether there have be signing of paper at marriage good deal of rum water said have be drunk there might have be signing too did remember then there be search for will be supposed to be in hand of one brisket butcher for whom be known mr mccockerell have destined hand of younger daughter mr brisket have be great favourite with old lady have often be heard to declare that must have wife money money without wife said to coerce maryanne into match brisket when questioned declared that have will in possession at time kept aloof from house showed disposition to meddle with affair of family indeed through trying day behaved honestly if not with high feeling in recounting doings of brown jones robinson will sometimes be necessary to refer to mr brisket will always be spoken of a honest man did that in lay to mar bright hope of one who be perhaps not most insignificant of firm destroyed matrimonial hope of mr robinson left to wither like blighted trunk on lone waste be nevertheless honest man so much will be said of let never forget that honest man be noblest work of god brisket when asked said that have will that knew of none in fact there be will forthcoming there be doubt that old woman be cut off before have made one may also be premised that have made one must have be invalid seeing that mr brown a husband be in fact owner of whole affair sarah jane maryanne when found that document be forthcoming immediately gave out that intended to take on duty of joint heiress alliance offensive defensive be sworn between at time mr brown employed lawyer heiress together with jones employed there must be possible doubt a to mr brown being owner of property however infatuated on subject jones wife may have be lawyer in london must have thought that young woman have leg to stand upon nevertheless case be undertaken brown found in middle of lawsuit sarah jane maryanne remained in house in smithfield to guard property on own behalf mr brown also remained to guard on behalf business for time be closed be done in opposition to mr brown maryanne mr jones must not bring to permit purchase of firkin of butter unless transaction must be made absolutely under own eye even then must insist on superintending retail herself selling pound short weight be custom of trade said to depart from must ruin thing be in condition going from bad to worse when jones came over one evening begged interview with mr brown that interview be commencement of partnership from such small matter do great event arise at interview mr robinson be present mr brown indeed declared that must have conversation with jones on business affair unless in presence of third party jones represented that if went on a be now doing property must soon be swallowed up by lawyer to mr brown whose forte be not eloquence tacitly assented with deep groan then said jones let divide into three portion will have one sarah jane second will manage third on behalf of sister in law maryanne if arrange well lawyer will never get shilling idea of compromise appeared to mr brown to be not uncommendable compromise on such term a must not of course be listened to robinson strongly counselled to nail colour to mast kick mr jones downstairs mr brown have not spirit for one child be one child said to robinson when went apart into shop to talk matter over fruit of one loin prop of one age robinson must not help thinking that sarah jane be about a bad prop a ever man leant on be too generous to say so matter be ended at last by compromise go on with business together said robinson mr brown keeping of course preponderating share in own hand like butter said jones nothing great can be done in butter be very safe line said mr brown if connection be good connection must have be good deal damaged said robinson seeing that shop have be closed for fortnight besides be woman business have woman to manage added fearing that mr jones might be brought in to detriment of concerned jones suggested haberdashery robinson guided by strong idea that there be more absolute opening for advertising line in haberdashery than in other business assented then let be haberdashery said mr brown with sigh so that be settled chapter iii early history of mr robinson haberdashery be here may be a well to say few word a to mr robinson to explain how became member of firm have be in boyhood bill

genteel young man though can not be said of that possessed manly beauty be slight active intelligent in physiognomy polite in demeanour perhaps may be unnecessary to say anything further on head mr robinson have already established a author in own line be supporting decently by own unaided ability when first met maryanne brown in regent park be then walking with sister resolutely persisted in disregarding token of admiration found unable to restrain there certainly be dash about maryanne brown at certain moment be invincible hooped petticoat on back of sister looked like hoop awkward hoop

then explained in very concise language term on be proposed that partnership must be opened mr brown must put capital into business be entitled to half profit mr jones mr robinson must give firm advantage of youth energy genius must be held a possessor of quarter mr jones made long fierce objection to need hardly be stated be believed that did more than once go back to lawyer mr brown who for time put into hand of youngest partner remained firm at last preliminary be settled name of house nature of business share of partner be now settled site of future labour of firm became next question mr brown be in favour of small tenement in little britain near to entrance into smithfield there must not be scope there said robinson fashion said jones be safe respectable pleaded mr brown there have be shop in little britain sixty year in same family robinson be of opinion that fortune of firm might not improbably be made in six if only must commence with sufficient distinction have ascertained that large commanding premise might be have in st paul churchyard in frontage of square foot of plate glass must be counted by hundred be true that shop be nearly window then a mr robinson said extended front of glass be one thing necessary be true also that future tenant must pay down thousand pound before entered then a explained how must better expend trifle of money possessed trifle of money said mr brown thinking of mountain of butter year of economy have be required to put together four thousand pound thinking also perhaps of absolute impecuniosity of young partner who thus spoke jones be for west end regent street there be shop only two door off regent street must be made to look a if be almost in regent street extension of side piece of plate glass must show quite into regent street even prepared card describing house a door from regent street printing figure word regent street very large intermediate description very small be ever by such stale inefficient artifice

said robinson there be nothing like colour will call magenta house will paint from roof to window top beautiful tint have only then be invented be necessary to explain word to mr brown merely remarked that oil paint must come to deal of money then gave way jones be struck dumb by brilliancy of idea for once forgot to object will tell said robinson nine time nine be eighty one certainly certainly

fifteen minute with back to curbstone forage however of horse became so terribly large item of expenditure mr brown heart failed heart failed went off late one evening to livery stable keeper who supplied horse in mr robinson absence armour be sent back to poland street must have have police down upon george said mr brown deprecating anger of younger partner what better advertisement must have wished said robinson must have be in paper have cost nothing know george what beastesses be eating be frightful to hear of four twenty pound of corn day of 'em because armour be so uncommon heavy men in armour be then given up certainly be beginning to be effective at pm when men be there have become impossible to pas shop without going into middle of street on one two occasion policeman have spoken to mr brown then there be slight accident with child newspaper have interfered be anticipating story for men in armour did not begin operation till shop have be opened now about glass said robinson a soon a three partner have retired from outside flag into interior of house must be plate of course said jones plate might a well have said when wanting house that must have wall rather think so said robinson good deal of mind good sized common window said brown deal better have uncommon said robinson interrupting remember sir there be nothing like glass in day have superseded leather altogether in respect leather said mr brown who be hardly quick enough for junior partner of material now in general use said robinson glass be most brilliant yet cheapest most graceful yet strongest though transparent be impervious to wet eye travel through not hailstorm to power of gas affords obstacle be a efficient barrier against casualty of street a iron shutter to be ordinary lends grace to be graceful give double lustre like good advertisement multiplies stock tenfold like good servant be always eloquent in praise of owner look upon plate glass sir a most glorious product of age regard tradesman who can surround with greatest quantity of a most in advance of tradesman of day oh sir do let have glass be beautiful to hear talk said mr brown be bill be thinking of if will only go enough ahead mr brown will find that nobody will trouble with such bill must be paid day george of course must will never do to think of now in twelve month so when have set house well going payment of such bill a will be mere nothing thing will be passed a item not worth notice faint heart never won fair lady know mr brown then cloud came across george robinson brow a thought of word have spoken for heart have once be faint fair lady be by mean won be quite true said jones never doe have have have then cloud went away from george robinson brow stern frown of settled resolution took place at moment made up mind that when might again meet that giant butcher must forget difference in size accost a though two be equal what though fell blow levelled a at ox must lay low for ever better that than endure from day to day unanswered taunt of one a jones mr brown though be not quick witted be not deficient when feeling of man man be concerned understood taking advantage of moment when jones have stepped up shop pressed robinson hand said will have george if father word be worth anything will have in case a in so many others father word be not worth anything to business said robinson shaking off from thought of love after mr brown have not heart to oppose respecting glass in matter have everything nearly own way premise stood advantageously at comer of little alley so that window be made to jut out sideways in direction full foot half be gained on other side house did not stand flush with neighbour a be not unfrequently case in bishopsgate street here also few inch be made available next neighbour quiet old man who sold stick threatened lawsuit have be instituted must have got into newspaper be advertisement there be considerable trouble about entrance wide commanding centre doorway be essential if made in desirable proportion must have terribly crippled side window to obviate difficulty exterior space allotted for entrance between frontage of two window be broad noble glass splayed inwards towards shop so that absolute door be decidedly narrow when come to have crowd wo get in out said jones if must only crush few to death in doorway fortune must be made said robinson god forbid said mr brown god forbid let have bloodshed whatever do in about month house be completed much to regret of junior partner considerable sum of ready money be paid to tradesman who performed work mr jones be of opinion that by sufficient cunning such payment might be altogether evaded such thought rested for moment in bosom of mr robinson tradesman must be paid paid well great firm of brown jones robinson must be much le likely to scrutinize price at plate glass be charged to per square foot when be taking hundred day over counter than must be now when shilling be of importance to for own sake must do said to mr brown may be quite sure like always liked said mr brown thus must make little dribbling payment by unfortunate idea be generated in neighbourhood that money be not plentiful with firm chapter v division of labour there be two other chief matter to be now necessary that firm must attend first primary being stock of advertisement must be issued other secondary being stock of good must be obtained to answer expectation raised by advertisement george must have something to sell said mr brown almost in despair did not then understand never since have learned secret of commercial science younger partner be at so much pain to teach there be thing elderly man can learn there be lesson be full of light for new recruit dark a death to old veteran will be so doubtless with also said robinson soliloquizing on subject in melancholy mood day will come when too must be pushed from stool by working of younger genius will sink a poor mr brown be now sinking into foggy depth of fogeydom man who be man then that melancholy mood left can surely make fortune before day come when merchant be known to be worth million fogeydom be respected that necessity of having something to sell almost overcame mr brown in day what be good of putting down kolinski minx boa in bill if posse one in shop asked must have if be asked for must not understand that for first start effect be everything if customer must want kolinski boa kolinski boa must of course be forthcoming to number required kolinski boa quasi kolinski in trade be admitted to be same thing when man advertises that have new paletots doe not mean that have got that number packed up in box if required to do so will supply to extent to further extent long row of

osnabruck cashmere what harm be done a long a lady get value for money if get value for money whose fault be be fair stand up fight when try to buy for l shawl think be worth about l be dealing on same principle if be lucky enough to posse credit shawl be sent home without payment three year afterwards fifty per cent be perhaps offered for settlement of bill be fair fight lady be very well able to take care of jones also thought must have something to sell money be money said good be good what be use of window if have anything to dress what be use of capital unless buy stock with mr jones george robinson never cared to argue absolute impossibility of pouring slightest ray of commercial light into dim chaos of murky mind have long since come home to merely shook head went on with composition on be engaged need hardly be explained here that have idea of encountering public throng on opening day without adequate assortment of good of course there must be shawl cloak of course there must be muff boa of course there must be hose handkerchief that dressing of window be to be special care of mr jones robinson must take care that there must be wherewithal dressing of window parading of shop be to be work of jones ambition have never soared above while serving in house on snow hill utmost envy have be excited by youthful aspirant who there walked board with oily courtesy handed chair to lady for one short week have be allowed to enter paradise though looked so sweet on said always have eye on be grand thing to be down on well dressed woman a be hiding roll of ribbon under cloak be idea of grandeur stock of good be of course necessary if firm must only get name sufficiently established that matter must be arranged simply by written order to two three wholesale house competition that beautiful science of present day by plodding cart horse be converted into racer make easy enough when must once become known that firm be opening on great scale in good thoroughfare advertising on real intelligible principle there must be lack of good can have amount of hose want out of cannon street said mr robinson in forty five minute can be brought in at back while be selling over counter can said mr brown perhaps can nevertheless george think will buy few will be ease to mind did so be suicidal act on part one thing be quite clear even to mr jones if firm commenced business to extent contemplated be out of question that must do everything on ready money principle that principle be antiquated absurd uncommercial that be opposed to whole system of trade a now adopted in metropolis have be clearly shown in preface to memoir in instance in case of brown jones robinson doing so be a impracticable a must have be foolish if practicable credit credit only be required of mode of extinguishing credit of crushing a be young baby in cradle there be none equal to of spending little ready money then halting in trade a in love to doubt rather to seem to doubt be to be lost when order good do so a though bank be at back look victim full in face write down long number without falter in pen must there seem hesitation on part affect to understand when article be secured give bill at six month date then credit at banker discount system commences be affair when once bank begin that with bank must do so may put up shutter when once bank have commenced must carry on game be floated then placed well in centre of full stream of commerce must be own fault if either retire with million become bankrupt with eclat be worth more than capital in refitting for further attempt in meantime need hardly be said that be living on very fat of land bird of feather must flock together mr brown mr robinson be not exactly of same plumage be finally arranged that mr robinson must have carte blanche at own particular line of business to extent of fifteen hundred pound mr brown must go into warehouse lay out similar sum in good jones mr jones accompanied old man sore time have of may here be remarked that mr jones struggled very hard to get footing in shop on point must be acknowledged that husband did duty for while must be sarah jane said not have objection in life said can stay at home if please by mean replied if come here father permit will go to america of course firm will allow for share tried on very often after gave firm much trouble think got hand into cash drawer above once twice during first twelve month division of labour be finally arranged a follows mr brown be to order good to hire young men woman look after morality pay wage to

of shaking head at young people who misbehaved be not ineffective there be always danger when young men woman be employed together in same shop if possible must be avoided be not in human nature that must not fall in love at rate amuse with ordinary flirtation now rule be that not word will be spoken doe not refer to business miss o'brien where be salmon coloured sarsenet mr green will trouble for

excellent opportunity for because there be so many decent young men about turned on a though have calumniated establishment with libel of vilest description if whisper of such thing ever reach sir said quite alive with virtuous indignation if such suspicion be ever engendered send packing at once moral of young woman sir then finished sentence simply by shake of head tried to bring into argument endeavoured to make understand that young woman can become happy wife unless first be allowed to have lover merely shook head at last stamped foot moral sir repeated moral above everything in such establishment a if be not moral be nothing supposed be right seemed to to be very hard on young men woman must only hope that walked home together in evening in new firm in bishopsgate street mr brown of course took upon that branch of business little trouble have because own son in law partner must make eye to customer mr jones once said before will bring down gray hair with sorrow to grave

be doing large business did not doubt visited place often usually found shop crowded did doubt whether business be very lucrative might be that whole thing be bubble that must be burst before bill must have be honoured in such case must have saddled with empty handed wife must decidedly not have seen way in emergency went to jones asked advice jones told confidentially that though bill of firm for five thousand pound must be a good a paper from bank of england bill of mr brown a individual must be worth nothing although mr brisket have gone to jones a friend there have be very sharp word between before separated brisket knew well enough that ready money at command of firm have belonged to mr brown now took upon to say that maryanne have right to share jones replied that there be longer anything to share that maryanne future husband must wait for fortune till father must pay out of income must see way like not at said brisket then there have be high word between be at time that first act of johnson of manchester little comedy be being played people in mr brisket world be beginning to talk about matter must be doing deal of trade said one believe be flash sham said happen to know old brown did go down to manchester see johnson there said first there be such person at said second so went on till mr brisket resolved that immediate matrimony must depend on reality of johnson existence if must appear that johnson with paper be false meteor that one have deceived metropolitan public one have be taken have then escaped must tell miss brown that did not see way light of intelligence told that promissory note from source even though signed by firm must be illusory if on other hand johnson of manchester have be taken then thought might accept bill wife maryanne said to young lady early on day on have afterwards have interview with robinson what be about johnson of manchester know nothing about johnson yet about manchester said miss brown standing with back to lover at time be waxing wroth with have learned to hate voice when must tell that have not yet seen way be very well maryanne must know something before go on who want to go on not be sure anybody belonging to if do hate anything be mercenary way there be one who really love who 'd be above asking for shilling if 'd only put out hand to if say that again maryanne will punch head be always talking of punching people head see do so much must wonder if want to punch head of day maryanne never riz hand to woman yet 'd better not a far a be concerned not a long a poker tongs be about

care about way that be very fine maryanne care be man a be a good a word always be defy brown jones robinson to say that be off carrying anybody paper a for paper be thing a know nothing about never wish when man come to paper seems to there be very thin wall betwixt gutter when buy score of sheep so pay for down when sell leg of mutton expects le owe shilling to one mean le that one owes better like maryanne when man trade in way man must see way if go about in dark with eye shut be safe to get fall now about five hundred pound if must only see way a to good sense of mr brisket remark there be difference of opinion between intended wife miss brown must at time have be quite contented to enter into partnership for life on term though memoir be written with express view of advocating theory of trade founded on quite different basis nevertheless may be admitted that mr brisket view of commerce have charm presuming that man have wherewithal view be apt to lose charm in female eye if be insisted on too often too violently maryanne have long since given in adhesion to mr brisket theory now weary with repetition of lesson be disposed to rebel now william brisket said just listen to if talk to again about seeing way may go see by be not so badly off be going to have twitted at in way if like can do other thing will say when gentleman have spoken mind free to lady lady have given answer free back to be very mean thing for gentleman to be saying so much about money after of course girl have got to look to if take up with why of course have to say betand off ' to other young man a may wish to keep company now there be one a will be nameless must demean to say word about money because ai got none a take be partner in first rate commercial firm will tell what william brisket will not hear word said against will not be put upon so now wish good morning so left brisket when be alone scratched head thought wistfully of love must like to see way said always did like to see way a for old man bit of paper then relapsed once again into silence be within hour of maryanne have followed father to george robinson room have declared utter indifference a to johnson of manchester yet might perhaps be a well that must learn truth from father have tried to get have succeeded in keeping in dark to jones must be impossible that must apply from robinson might succeed in obtaining secret have heard doubt of samson delilah thought knew way to strong man lock might not be well for to forget that other samson once more to trust to father partner when weighed two young tradesman one against other balancing claim with such judgment a possessed doubted much a to choice thought that might be happy with then be necessary that other dear charmer must be away a to robinson must marry knew at once without stipulation a to brisket if brisket must be ultimate choice must be necessary that must either worry father out of money else cheat lover into belief that money must be forthcoming having taken circumstance into consideration invited mr robinson to tea mr brown be there of course so also be mr mr poppins when robinson entered be already at tea table great demerit of johnson of manchester be under discussion now mr robinson will tell everything said mr poppins be about johnson know where have gone to mr robinson robinson professed that did not know know well enough said maryanne only be so close now do tell will tell anything choose to ask said mr poppins tell anything not indeed what doe care for be sure must if only knew what be saying before came into room now polly oh will because be better must know now polly if hold tongue will be angry mr robinson be nothing to never will be be sure only if 'd do favour a friend to tell about mr johnson 'd take kind of in meantime mr brown young married guest be discussing thing commercial on own side of room poppins also be not without hope that might learn secret poppins have rather despised firm at first a not few others have done distrusting earlier assurance a to trade bargain having be even unmoved by men in armour great affair of johnson of manchester have overcome even doubt began to feel that be privilege to be noticed by senior partner in house must play game a that be not that poppins believed in johnson that thought that l of paper have at time be missing nevertheless proceeding have affected mind favourably with reference to brown jones robinson brought about that now respected perhaps feared little though have not respected feared heretofore have be possessor of wholesale house of business must not now have dared to refuse good on credit though must have done so before johnson of manchester have become known to world may therefore be surmised that george robinson have be right that have understood way of british trade when composed johnsonian drama indeed 'd rather not mr poppins said mr brown secret in trade must be secret though mr johnson have done deal of mischief want to expose have be exposing ever so long pleaded poppins now poppins said that gentleman wife be troubling mr brown be got other thing to think of than answering question must like to know own because town talking about doe seem odd to that maryanne must know then said maryanne do think when lady asks gentleman least thing gentleman can do be to tell sha ask more not of mr robinson be thinking never mind polly perhaps be best a be must have betray trust said robinson must esteem more because have deceived partner if think that be to earn love in way know little of george robinson then got up preparing to leave room for feeling be too many for stop george stop said mr brown let go said maryanne if go away now will think a hard a adam said mr poppins there be three to one again said mr poppins to what chance can have mr poppins may probably have gone through such phase of life let go said maryanne again wish must then let never show here again george robinson son son exclaimed old man must be understood that robinson have heard though have left room indeed may be surmised have be out of hearing word must not have be spoken heard for be still standing immediately beyond door be irresolute whether must depart whether must return george robinson son son exclaimed old man again will come back said mr poppins following out of door will come back though have to carry polly said maryanne if so much a whisper word to ask will never speak to longest day have to live threat be thrown away upon mr poppins under auspex robinson be brought back into room maryanne said will renounce william brisket law george said of course will said mr poppins pomp vanity besides son son said old brown lifting up hand daughter daughter child child then joined hand together

said george robinson oh bother said maryanne that sort of thing be very good in play business must be business must always be acknowledged in favour of mr brown youngest daughter that view be practical not over strained by romance during two three month considerable intimacy sprang up between mr poppins george robinson be not that there be similarity in character for in most respect be essentially unlike other perhaps very difference led to friendship how often may be observed in field that high bred quick paced horse will choose lowly donkey for close companionship although other horse of equal birth speed be in same pasture poppins be young man of easy nature soft temper who be content to let thing pas by unquestioned so long a passed quietly live let live be word be often on lip by intended to signify that must overlook peccadillo of other people a long a other people overlooked own when lady who became afterwards mr poppins have once called rascal have not with loud voice asserted injustice of appellation have satisfied with explaining to that even be so be still fit for society possessed practical philosophy of own by be able to steer course in life be not perhaps prepared to give much to others did expect that much must be given to there be ardent generosity in temperament then also there be malice grasping avarice if in one respect differed much from mr robinson so also in respect did differ equally from mr jones be at time counting house clerk in large wharfinger establishment have married on salary of eighty pound year tell what be robinson said about time understand business of yours said robinson perhaps not business like ours be not easily understood seem to to divide profit in affair of such magnitude profit can not be adjusted day yet month man want bread cheese day now there be old brown be deal sharper than took for mr brown for commercial man of old school posse considerable intelligence said robinson throughout memoir may be observed that mr robinson always speaks with respect of mr brown very considerable indeed said poppins seems to to nobble everything perhaps be old school young school ai so very different in respect only perhaps there be so much for to nobble regular division of profit have be arranged for in deed of partnership said robinson be uncommon nice very judicious said poppins be thought to be so by law adviser said robinson yet see old brown nobbles money now if ever go into partnership will bargain to have till for share never get near till do attend to quite branch of business said robinson then

from drawer deposited by in safe payment into bank be made three time week check be drawn by mr brown none of have ever be drawn except on behalf of business then payment into bank have by mean tallied with cash taken latterly for last month so statement of daily cash taken have be very promiscuous payment have of course be made to jones robinson for own expense payment made by mr brown to have probably greatly exceeded have vague idea that be supreme in money matter because have introduced capital into firm george robinson have found absolutely impossible to join in league with jones so that hitherto mr brown have be able to carry out own theory motto divide et impera be probably unknown to mr brown in word have undoubtedly be acting on wisdom be conveyed in doctrine jones wife be preparing for war be plain to see that storm of battle must soon be raging robinson also be fully alive to peril of position anxious a be to remain on good term with mr brown be aware that must be necessary for to come to understanding in difficulty have dropped hint to friend poppins not exactly explaining source of embarrassment saying enough to make gentleman understand way in firm be going on suppose be in earnest about girl said poppins poppins have offhand irreverent way of speaking especially on subject from nature demanded delicacy be frequently shocking to robinson if mean miss brown said robinson in tone of voice be intended to convey rebuke certainly be in earnest intention be that will become mr robinson when a soon a prudence will permit lady will consent miss brown have never be used to hardship for must little care what privation might be called on to bear must hardly endure to see in want advice to be if mean to marry do at once if together ca manage old man ca be

poppins took leave have anybody suggested to george robinson that must go to poppins for advice a to course of life george robinson must have scorned suggestion knew very well great difference between humble friend a regarded worldly position intellectual attainment nevertheless there be strain of wisdom in poppins remark though appertained wholly to matter of low import did not disdain to use be true that maryanne brown still frequented hall of harmony went there quite a often without betrothed a with be true that mr brown have adopted habit of using money of firm without rendering fair account of purpose to applied hall of harmony might not be best preparation for domestic duty mr brown method of applying fund best specific for commercial success must look to thing see reform be made indeed must reform entirely by insisting on division of profit by taking maryanne to own bosom great idea filled mind if undue opposition be made to wish when expressed must leave firm break up business carry now well known genius for commercial enterprise to other concern in might be treated with juster appreciation of merit not that will ever leave thee maryanne said to a resolved thing in mind chapter xiv mistress morony be about ten day after conversation recorded in last chapter between mr robinson mr poppins that affair be brought about through imprudence dishonesty of mr jones for time prevented that settlement of matter on mr robinson have resolved during ten day have be occupied in bringing resolution to fixed point then when day hour have come in intended to act event occurred disgraceful a be to annals of firm must now be told there be certain small trick of trade well known to lower class of house in business to brown jones robinson have devoted for time may doubt be profitable be very apt to bring disgrace ruin upon who practise to such trick a mr jones be wedded by none of argument used in favour of high moral tone of commerce must robinson prevail upon partner to abandon nothing must exceed obstinacy blindness of mr jones during discussion when be explained to that conduct be pursuing be hardly removed nay be not removed from common swindling must reply that be quite a honest a mr robinson advertisement must quote especially katakairion shirt be obtained from hodges of sale at s d half dozen have by dint of wide circulation of notice become considerable if be swindling know what be said jones do know what katakairion mean said robinson said jones want to know katakairion mean 'fitting ' said robinson purchaser have only to take care that shirt buy doe fit then be katakairion did invent invented price name be a much a anybody doe be not be well understood maxim in trade that man may advertise chooses advertise to attract notice not to state fact be mean thing to pas off false article over counter if will ticket good must sell according to ticket at first other partner have not objected to ticketing a practice be now common there be at first sight apparent honesty about have seduction lady seeing s d marked on mantle in window be able to contemplate desired piece of good to compare in silent leisure with finance can use power of eye a compensation to shopkeeper be debarred from power of touch then having satisfied a to value of thing inspected can go in buy without delay trouble to vendor have be found by practice so true be eye of lady that be useless to expose in shop window article be not good of kind cheap at price named to attract customer in way real bargain must be exhibited when be done lady take advantage of unwary tradesman unintended sacrifice be made george robinson soon perceived suggested that ticketing must be abandoned jones however persevered observing that knew how to remedy evil inherent in system hence difficulty arose ultimately disgrace be very injurious to firm went near to break heart of mr brown according to jones plan article ticketed in window be not under circumstance to be sold shopmen indeed be forbidden to remove from position under entreaty threat from customer customer be to be at first informed with blandishment at shopman command that good furnished within shop be exact counterpart of exposed then shopman be to argue that arrangement of window must not be disturbed must persistent purchaser after insist on supposed legal right to buy very thing ticketed mr jones be to be called in case mr jones must inform persistent purchaser that be regarded a unreasonable violent disagreeable under such circumstance custom be not wanted by brown jones robinson disappointed female must generally leave shop with loud remark a to swindling dishonesty pettifogging to mr jones must turn deaf ear sometimes worse than must ensue lady must insist on right scramble must occur in order that possession of article might be obtained assistant in shop must not always take part with mr jones a have be before said serious difficulty must arise there can be doubt that jones be very wrong usually be wrong idea of trade be mean limited altogether inappropriate to business on large scale nevertheless can not pas on to narration of circumstance a did occur without expressing strong abhorrence of lady who be desirous of purchasing cheap good to manifest injury of tradesman from whom buy ticketing of good at price below value be not to taste purchasing of such good be le so lady who will take advantage of tradesman that may fill house with linen cover back with finery at cost in manner own mean must not fairly permit be in estimation robber be often necessary that tradesman must advertise tremendous sacrifice be sometimes necessary that must actually make such sacrifice brown jones robinson have during career be driven to such necessity have smiled upon female customer using sweetest blandishment while female customer have abstracted good at price almost nominal brown jones robinson in forcing such sale have be coerced by necessary law of trade while smiling with blandishment have known that lady on whom have smiled have be robber why be that commercial honesty have so seldom charm for woman woman who must give away last shawl from back will insist on smuggling glove through custom house who can make widow understand that must not communicate with boy in colony under dishonest cover of newspaper be not passion for cheap purchase altogether female mania yet cheap purchase purchase made at rate so cheap a to deny vendor fair profit be in truth dishonesty dishonesty to purchaser be indirectly party must that woman must be taught to hate bargain how much le useless trash must there be in house how much fewer tremendous sacrifice in shop brown jones robinson when have be established six eight month have managed to procure from house in silk trade few black silk mantle of very superior description lot have be remnant have be obtained with sundry other good at low figure nevertheless proper price at house must afford to sell must exceed mark of general purchaser in bishopsgate street came into mr jones hand immediately resolved to use for purpose of window half dozen of be very tastefully arranged upon rack be marked at

into party of have ostensible leader then there be always ambitious hardly trustworthy member who endeavoured to gather round third party might become dominant by trimming between other two again must find ground cut from beneath foot by new aspirant member never called other by own name addressed always a worthy goose speaking at such moment with utmost courtesy must still be done though speaker be using energy to show that other goose be in sense unworthy have perpetual chairman for whom affected most unbounded respect be generally called grand full title being most worthy grand goose member on leg when wished to address meeting with special eloquence be about to speak word thought peculiarly fit for public attention must generally begin by thus invoking most worthy grand must say when done by others than well accustomed speaker be considered a work either of arrogance of ignorance great officer be much loved among familiarly be called grand though there be immensity of talk at meeting men speaking sometimes by half hour whose silence club must have be willing to purchase almost at price there be not above four established orator there be four orator of of whom be said that copied manner tone of great speaker in other society there be friend robinson who in elegance of word brilliancy of idea far surpassed other goose word be irresistible power in assembly unequalled yet a many said be power working only for evil liberal party to have joined did not dare to stand without yet if whisper got abroad be true must only too gladly have dispensed with be terrible a friend then must be more terrible a foe then there be crowdy crowdy whose high flown idea hardly tallied with stern reality of life crowdy be leader of who have once held firmly by protection crowdy have be staunchly true to party since have party though have be said of that adventure of crowdy in search of party have be very long very various there have be no goose with bitterer tongue than crowdy now in day spirit of quiescence have fallen on though spoke a often a ever did not wield so deadly tomahawk then there be burly buggins than whom goose have more fluent use of vernacular be not polished a robinson have ever possessed exquisite keenness of crowdy in speaking always hit nail on head carried hearer with by energy perspicuity of argument by degree world of goose gridiron have learned that buggins talked of thing did not understand have not studied fact must not bear light word fell from mouth sweeter than honey sweet a be be of avail be pleasant to hear buggins talk men knew that be useless perhaps most remarkable goose in assembly a decidedly be most popular be old pan traced birth to mighty blood of great pancabinets whose noble name still proudly bore one liked old pancabinet

before long pipe in mouth benign smile be ever on face yet showed plainly conscious that authority lived in slightest word that have to nod to be obeyed that pipe be constant in hand be weapon with signified approbation of speaker when great orator must arise address a most worthy grand must lay pipe for instant on table crossing hand on ample waistcoat must bow serenely to goose on leg then not allowing spark to be extinguished on tobacco must resume clay spread out over head shoulder long soft cloud of odorous smoke when upstart so addressed goose not entitled by character to use sonorous phrase must still retain pipe simply wink eye be said that distinction quite equalled difference between big type little perhaps qualification be most valued among goose most specially valued by worthy grand be knowledge of form of room a be called rule formula have probably be gradually invented for complication of thing have once be too simple be so numerous that goose must remember who be not very constant in attention endowed with accurate memory in respect be doubt useful that when young unskilled goose tried to monopolize attention of room must be constantly checked snubbed at last subdued silenced by reference to forgotten form goose must hope to get through lengthy speech without such interruption till have made form of room long painful study on evening in question that same evening on robinson have endeavoured to tear out tongue of brisket goose be assembled before eight motion have be made elsewhere for repeal of paper duty be to be discussed be known that mind of many goose be violently set against measure presumed to be most deleterious to country old pan under rigorous instigation of robinson have given in adhesion be prepared to vote for measure to talk for also

to friend by worthy goose young poppins at eight o'clock at quarter past eight robinson be not there crowdy not wishing to lacerate foe till foe must be there to feel wound sat silent in usual seat pancabinet who understood well beauty of silence must not begin fray buggins be ever ready to talk be cunning enough to know that future opportunity might be more valuable than present one then up jumped poppins now poppins be orator felt that a friend of robinson be bound to address meeting on present occasion there be circumstance must be explained most worthy grand began starting suddenly to leg whereupon worthy grand slightly drew back head still holding pipe between lip winked at unhappy poppins a friend of absent robinson went on be at once interrupted by loud cry of order from side of

have frowned at member three time that member be silenced for night in matter assembly at goose gridiron have not copied rule from other body be worthy of consideration whether other body might not do well to copy beg grand pardon again said unhappy poppins meant in place hereupon worthy goose got up suggested that number must be counted now there be rule that debate must be continued unless dozen goose be present debate once closed be closed for night when hint be given to grand became grand duty to count goose in order to effect in accordance with constitution of assembly be necessary that servant must withdraw stranger also be sometimes present at such moment be politely asked to retire when suggestion be made suggestor doubt knew that requisite number be not there usually happened on such occasion that hanger on be at hand to replenish room goose two might be eating bread cheese in little parlour for food must not be introduced into debating room few of younger goose might often be found amusing with young lady at bar word must be passed to that grand be about to count indeed must hear tap of tobacco stopper on table then there must be rush among hungry amorous goose so number must be made up that called making flock when suggestion be given on present occasion grand put down tankard from hand proceeded to performance of duty turning mouthpiece of long pipe clay out from pointed slowly to one after counting a so pointed first counted up old pancabinet slight twinkle might be seen in eye of two old men a did so then turning pipe round room pointed at be found that there be fifteen present there be flock discreet worthy goose be in possession of room said bowing to poppins poppins again began speech be blundering affair a be too often case with speech made there then when poppins sat down great crowdy rose slowly to leg will not attempt to give speech of eloquent goose at length for great crowdy often made long speech may suffice to say that having good cause made best of that pitched into poor robinson most unmercifully always declaring a did so that a friend enterprising worthy goose be absent own mouth be effectually closed may be noted here that whenever goose be in commerce epithet enterprising be always used when be mentioned if held ever have held service of trust a poppins did be called discreet goose then just a crowdy finished speech

chamber must have have baseness to stop voice when order order order may have be wrong to say baseness in chamber however base worthy goose may be therefore with permission of worthy grand will substitute 'hardihood whereupon worthy grand again bowed still there be cry of question from side of room opposite to on robinson sat then old pancabinet rose from seat voice be hushed if may be

a british merchant be mentioned here in order that fitting record may be made of very high compliment be paid to on occasion by old pancabinet most worthy grand said old pan a spoke looked first at chairman then down long table of room be sure may truly say that have of heard statement made by enterprising worthy goose with sentiment of regret pain be equally sure that have none of heard with idea that dishonour disgrace can attach in matter to name of order order order worthy goose be little too quick continued veteran debater with smile to name of one whom so highly value hear hear hear then old pancabinet moved that enterprising worthy goose be entitled to full confidence of chamber crowdy magnanimously seconded motion resolution when carried be communicated to robinson by worthy

whom have be good enough to have dealing on large scale robinson be at first cowed when be called upon to see men who be now becoming aware that must not receive more than s d in pound out of hundred be owed to feeling very soon wore off found laughing talking with giles stationer burrow printer sloman official assignee a though bankruptcy be excellent joke a though a one of bankrupt have by far best of men be about to lose rather have lost large sum of money nevertheless took all a matter of course be perfectly good humoured word of reproach fell from lip when asked george robinson to give advantage of recognized talent in drawing up bill for sale put to quite a favour sloman assignee went so far a to suggest that must be remunerated for work if can only be of service to said robinson modestly of greatest service said mr giles tremendous sacrifice know enormous liability unreserved sale regardless of cost sort of thing lord bless said mr burrow do think doe understand how to do that better than can tell will draw out heading of poster wo mr robinson put number figure into catalogue suggested mr sloman best way be to put down at about cost price find can generally do 'em at if can only get people to come sharp enough then a evening have fallen upon at labour adjourned to four swan opposite robinson be treated to supper at expense of victim on next day house be closed be done in order that good might be catalogued prepared for final sale shop must then be again opened for week after there must be end of brown jones robinson in spite of good humour be shown by from whom ill humour on occasion might have be expected there be melancholy about be inexpressible have be said that there be nothing so exciting in trade a grand final sacrificial sale be like last act of tragedy be very good while last what be to come after robinson a descended into darkened shop walked about amidst lumber be being dragged forth from shelf drawer felt that be like marius on ruin of carthage here have be scene of glory then remembered with what ecstasy have walked down shop when crowd without be anxiously inquiring fate of johnson of manchester have be great triumph to what have such triumph led men woman have gone away to breakfast be standing there alone leaning against one of counter heard slight noise behind turning round saw mr brown who have crept down from own room without assistance be first time since illness that have left floor on lived have be intended that must never go into shop again oh mr brown be prudent said going up to that might give assistance of arm wished to see once more george there be then there be much to see deal to feel be there george deal to feel did look very pretty that day opened very pretty colour seem to have got dirty now bright colour will become dull dirty mr brown be way of world brighter be in brightness more dull will look when tinsel gloss be gone must have painted again spring if 'd stopped here there be thing mr brown one can not paint again iron wood can anything of like of yes mr brown may repaint iron wood who can restore faded colour to broken hope bankrupt ambition see arch here with so light span bear burden of house above so be span of heart on opening day weight of labour then seemed to be too much for arch remain will remain a for human heart george will kill if see down in mouth will be repainted continued robinson other breast will glow beneath with hope a high a felt when others stood here to welcome public what artist can ever repaint aspiration soiled column of window will be regilded here will be bright young again for man when loses glory there be regilding come mr brown will go upstairs will be here soon be place now for then took by hand led tenderly to apartment there be something inexpressibly melancholy in idea of bankruptcy in trade unless indeed when may have be produced by absolute fraud in such form a to allow of bankrupt going forth with pocket full in ordinary way know nothing more sad than fate of men who have embarked in trade venture have failed may be probably be fact that in almost such case failure be fault of bankrupt fault be so generally hidden from own eye that can not see justice of punishment be often so occult in cause that justice can not be discerned by without deep scrutiny who have struggled lost feel only that have worked hard worked in vain that have thrown away money energy that there be end now for ever to sweet hope of independence with embarked small boat upon wide ocean of commerce fate of such men be very sad of course hear of bankrupt who come forth again with renewed glory who shine brighter in consequence of temporary obscurity be men who can manage to have repainted regilded number be not great one hears of such because be in way memorable one doe not hear of poor wretch who sink down out of world back behind counter to menial work in warehouse of ordinary bankrupt one hears nothing be generally men who having saved little with long patience embark lose with rapid impotence come forward once in life with little venture then retire never more to be seen noticed of shop be opened year after year in london not above half remain in existence for period of twelve month not half ever afford livelihood to who open be not that matter ought to fill one with melancholy on establishment of new shop there be same high hope very hope with brown jones robinson commenced career be not that expect to shine forth upon world a merchant prince do expect to live upon fruit of labour to put by will make old age respectable ala ala of who thus hope how much larger proportion be doomed to disappointment little lot of good be bought brought together with so much pride turn into dust rubbish gloss gilding wear
