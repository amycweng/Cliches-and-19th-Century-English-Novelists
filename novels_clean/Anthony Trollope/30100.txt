placed outside father liberality who be inclined to be liberal enough by fact that have inherited considerable portion of maternal grandfather fortune might almost be said truly of money be object to be not that did not often talk about money think about money be very prone to do so saying that money be most important factor in world justice injustice be so fortunately circumstanced a to be able to leave money out of own personal consideration never being driven by want of to deny anything tempted by superabundance to expenditure did not otherwise approve to to give s s bottle for wine because somebody pretended that be very fine l for horse when one at l must do work for be altogether below philosophy by father lodge gate there ran omnibus up to town must often use saying that omnibus with company be better than private carriage with none be wont to be angry with in that employed fashionable tailor declaring that incurred unnecessary expense merely to save trouble of going elsewhere in however may be thought that there be something of pretence a be doubt conscious of good look aware probably that skilful tailor might add grace in amusement affected two be especially expensive kept yacht in be accustomed to absent in summer autumn have small hunting establishment in northamptonshire of former little need be said here a spent time on board much alone with friend with whom need not follow may be said that everything about free trader be done well for such be name of vessel though did not pay s bottle for wine paid best price for sail cordage hired competent skipper to look after boat hunting be done very much in same way unless be that in yachting be given to be tranquil in hunting be very fond of hard riding at gorse hall a cottage be called have comfort may perhaps say much of luxury around be indeed hardly more than cottage having be old farm house lately converted to present purpose there be noble surroundings stately hall marble staircase costly salon entered by passage deserved auguster name on right of be dining room on left larger chamber always called drawing room because of fashion of name beyond be smaller retreat in owner kept book leading up from end of passage there be steep staircase remnant of old farm house above five bed room so that lordship be limited to number of four guest behind be kitchen servant room sufficient not more than sufficient for house here young democrat kept dozen horse of a men around be used to declare fit to go although be said to have be bought at not more than l be supposed to be crotchet on part of lord hampstead to assert that cheap thing be a good a dear there be who believed that did in truth care a much for horse a other people be certainly fact that never must have one out in day be wont to declare that smith took out second horse chiefly jones might know that did so down here at gorse post office clerk have often be received a visitor not at gorse hall have ever seen lady france lord have peculiar idea about hunting in reference to sport in general be supposed of supposed truly that young man in england be more devotedly attached to fox hunting than that in want of fox must ride after stag in want of stag after drag if everything else failed must go home across country friend accompanying else alone nevertheless entertained vehement hostility against other sport of racing declared that have become simply way of making money of way least profitable to world most disreputable be never seen on racecourse enemy declared of that though loved riding be judge of animal pace that be afraid to bet lest must lose money against shooting be still louder if there be in country tradition custom law hateful to be such a have reference to preservation of game preservation of fox said stood on perfectly different basis fox be not preserved by law when preserved be used for advantage of who chose to be present at amusement one man in one day must shoot fifty pheasant have eaten up food of dozen human being one fox afforded in one day amusement to two hundred sportsman be more generally be not killed during performance fox during beneficial life have eaten corn for most part goose chiefly rat such like what infinitesimal sum have fox cost country for man who rushed after then what have be cost of pheasant one shooting cormorant crammed into huge bag during one day greedy sport be public nature of one amusement thoroughly private nature of other chiefly affected in hunting field farmer son if have pony butcher boy out of town must come take part if butcher boy must go ahead keep place while man with red coat pink boot with two horse fell behind butcher boy must have best of incur displeasure of one law too by hunting be governed if there be law be thoroughly democratic in nature be not said made by parliament be simply assented to on behalf of common need be simply in compliance with opinion that land of men be open to be ridden over by men of hunt in compliance with opinion fox be preserved in compliance with opinion covert be drawn by other pack of hound legislature have not stepped in to defile statute book by bye law made in favour of amusement of rich if injury be done ordinary law of country be open to injured party anything in hunting have grown to be beyond reach of law have become so by force of popular opinion of be reversed in shooting from participation in poor be debarred by enactment made solely on behalf of rich four five men in couple of day must offer up hecatomb of slaughtered animal in doing must only justify by fact that be acting a poultry butcher for supply of market of country there be excitement in simply firing off of many gun with rapidity altogether prevents that competition be essential to enjoyment of sport then noble republican must quote teufelsdroeckh memorable epitaph of partridge slayer be on popular unpopular element of two sport that must most strongly dilate on iniquity of game law a applying to more aristocratic of two be however asserted by sporting world at large that hampstead must not hit haystack a to fishing be almost equally violent grounding objection on tedium cruelty incident to pursuit first be only matter of taste must allow if man must content be happy with average of one fish to three day fishing be man affair must only think that in such case man must be a cold blooded a fish so seldom succeeded in catching a to cruelty thought there must be doubt when heard that bishop lady delighted in hauling unfortunate animal about by gill for more than hour at stretch be inclined to regret past piety of church past tenderness of sex when spoke in way cruelty of fox hunting be of course thrown in teeth did not poor hunted quadruped when followed hither thither by pack of fox hound endure torment a sharp a prolonged a inflicted on fish in answer to lord hampstead be eloquent argumentative a far a must judge from nature condition of two animal during process be very different salmon with hook in throat be in position certainly not intended by nature fox using gift to avoid enemy be employed exactly a nature have enjoined must be a just to compare human being impaled alive on stake with overburdened with world task overburdened man might stumble fall so perish thing must have be hard to not therefore must compare suffering with excruciating agony of poor wretch who have be left to linger starve with iron rod through vitals argument be thought to be crafty rather than cunning by who be fond of fishing have on when have blown off steam of eloquence by sensational description of salmon impaled by bishop must depend with greater confidence must grant for moment though be by mean sure of fact for moment must grant that fox did not enjoy hunt let be acknowledged for sake of argument that be tortured by hound rather than elated by triumphant success of own manoeuvre lord hampstead ventured to say must put forward in rationalistic tone with be wont to prove absurdity of hereditary honour in infliction of pain question a to cruelty cruelty be one of relative value be tanti who can doubt for certain maximum of good certain minimum of suffering may be inflicted without slur to humanity in hunting one fox be made to finish triumphant career perhaps prematurely for advantage of two hundred sportsman ah only for amusement must interpose humanitarian averse equally to fishing to hunting then lordship must arise indignantly must ask opponent whether what called amusement be not a beneficial a essential a necessary to world a even such material good thing a bread meat be poetry le valuable than multiplication table man must exist doubt without fox hunting so must without butter without wine other so called necessary without ermine tippet for instance original god invested wearer of have be doomed to lingering starvation death when trapped amidst snow in order that one lady might be made fine by agony of dozen little furry sufferer be case of tanti said said that fox who have saved dozen time then died nobly on behalf of who have be instrumental in preserving existence for ought not to complain of lot fate have provided for among animal of earth be said however in reference to comparison between fishing fox hunting that lord hampstead be altogether deficient in skill patience be necessary for landing of salmon men though laughed at still liked be good humoured kindly hearted be liberal in more than politics have too knack of laughing at own peculiarity went far to redeem that young earl embryo marquis heir of house a of trafford must preach political doctrine who heard ignorantly called communistic be very dreadful horror of be mitigated when declared that doubt a got old must turn tory like other radical in there seemed to be covert allusion to father then must perceive that communistic principle did not prevent from having good eye to value of land knew what be about a owner of property must do certainly rode to hound a well a one of boy of period when idea first presented to that sister be on way to fall in love with george roden have to be acknowledged that be displeased have not occurred to that peculiar breach must be made on protected sanctity of own family when roden have spoken to of sanctity a one of social idolatry have not quite be able to contradict have wished to do so both in defence of own consistency also if be possible so a to maintain sanctity divinity doe hedge king have be to no more than social idolatry special respect in duke such like be held be same judge ermine bishop apron be idolatry outward honour not earned by deed word of so honoured coming from birth wealth from doings of be idolatry carrying on argument must not admit same thing in reference to sister rather must have to admit if must not make plea in defence of sanctity sister be very holy to must be because of nearness to because of sweetness because of own gift because a brother be bound to be especial knight till must have chosen other special knight for must not be because be daughter granddaughter great granddaughter of duke marquis must not be because be lady france trafford have be post office clerk then must not chosen friend have be fit to love there be unfitness doubt very common in world must make very idea of love impossible to woman unfitness of character of habit of feeling of education unfitness a to inward personal nobility must not say that there be such ought to separate sister friend if be to be that sweet sister must day give heart to lover why not to george roden a well a to there be such unfitness a of must have thought in dealing with life of other girl other young man yet be if not displeased at rate dissatisfied there be something grated against taste judgment perhaps prejudice endeavoured to inquire into fairly on matter feared that be yet victim of prejudice of order be wounded in pride to think that sister must make equal to clerk in post office though have often endeavoured only too successfully to make understand how little have in truth received from high birth yet felt that have received something must have made proposal of such marriage distasteful to man can not rid of prejudice because know belief to be prejudice that two if continued to wish must become man wife acknowledged to must not bring not to be sorry that must be so there be word on subject between father before marquis went abroad with family though did not reconcile to match lessened dissatisfaction father be angry with throwing blame of untoward affair on head be always prone to resent censure thrown by of family on own peculiar tenet thus came to pas that in defending be driven to defend sister also marquis have not be at hendon when revelation be first made have heard in course of day from wife radical tendency have done very little towards reconciling to such proposal have never brought theory home into own personality to be radical peer in house of lord to have sent radical tailor to house of common have be enough if not too much to satisfy own political idea to to valet to immediately touching have always be marquis of kingsbury so also in inner heart marchioness be marchioness lady france lady france have never gone through process of realizing conviction a son have done hampstead said can possibly be true what mother have told took place at house in park lane to marquis have summoned son do mean about france george roden of course mean supposed did sir imagined that when sent for be in regard to doubt be true what be true speak a though absolutely approved then voice have belied for disapprove of feel hope how utterly impossible be not that not can not say that think to be impossible even improbable knowing two a do feel probability to be on side that must be married be what intend never knew of to mean anything did not sooner later get accomplished will have to learn on occasion how on earth can have be brought about lord hampstead shrugged shoulder somebody have be very much to blame mean sir somebody have be very much to blame of course mean can not take blame in matter in introducing george roden to to mother to france brought to knowledge of highly educated extremely well mannered young man good god did to friend what young man suppose doe to must be ashamed of to associate with one who be not proper guest for father table one doe not calculate before young man young woman will fall in love with other see what have happened be extremely natural doubt though have not anticipated a told be very sorry will cause many heartburn unhappiness unhappiness must think so must go away in middle of session will be worse for poor girl will be very bad for said marquis speaking a though mind be quite made up on matter nobody a far a can see have done anything wrong continued lord hampstead when two young people get together whose taste be similar opinion whose education habit of thought have be same habit same habit of thought said sir must talk hind leg off dog said marquis bouncing out of room be not unusual with in absolute privacy of own circle to revert to language must have felt to be unbecoming to a marquis of kingsbury among ordinary people chapter iii marchioness though departure of marquis be much hurried there be other meeting between hampstead family before flitting be actually made doubt will be quite with there son said to father who have desired to explain to young man impossibility of such marriage think must be misfortune to must be avoided if can get over present feeling feeling suppose there be such feeling sir of course be looking for position money not in least might probably be idea with young nobleman who must wish to marry into own class to improve fortune at same time with one must be fair enough must give take with george must not be honest must such accusation be true position a call must feel to be burdensome a to money doe not know whether france have shilling not not shilling unless give to must not think of matter then must be very imprudent young man unfit to have wife at can not admit that suppose be yet think think sir that be unfortunate have said so ever since first heard will tell exactly what think will have france with will of course express own opinion marquis be far from satisfied with son did not dare to go on further with argument in such discussion be wont to feel that son be talking hind leg off dog own idea on concrete point be clear enough to a present idea that daughter lady france trafford must outrage propriety fitness decency if be to give in marriage to george roden post office clerk word be not plenty with when plenty not efficacious be prone to feel when beaten in argument that opponent be taking unfair advantage thus be that often thought sometimes said that who oppressed with word must talk hind leg off dog marchioness also expressed opinion to hampstead be lady stronger than husband stronger in that never allowed to be worsted in encounter if word must not serve occasion at moment countenance must do so if not that absence must be very eloquent with silence strike adversary dumb by way in must leave room be tall handsome woman with sublime gait vera incessu patuit dea have heard if not word then translation of word have taken to heart borne with a secret motto to be inch aristocrat in look a in thought be object of life that such be highest duty be quite fixed in mind have pleased god to make marchioness must derogate from god wish have be one misfortune god must not also have made mother of future marquis face though handsome be quite impassive showing nothing of sorrow joy voice be equally under control one have ever imagined not even husband that felt acutely that one blow of fortune though hampstead politics have be to abominable treasonable blasphemous treated with extreme courtesy if there be anything that wished about house must have done for must endeavour to interest about hunting must pay great respect to most onerous a being second in thing to marquis though republican blasphemous rebel so thought of be second to marquis must fain have taught little boy to respect a future head of family have not be so accustomed to romp with to pull out of little bed toss about in night shirt that loved much too well for respect be in vain that mother strove to teach to call hampstead lady france have never be specially in way to lady france stepmother have be perhaps harder than to stepson of whose presence a absolute block to ambition be well aware lady france have claim to respect higher than be due to own child primogeniture have done nothing for be marquis daughter mother have be only offspring of commoner there be perhaps something of conscience in feeling towards two a lord hampstead be undoubtedly in way occurred to to think that must not on account be inimical to lady france be not in way therefore be open to depreciation dislike without wound to conscience then though hampstead be abominable because of republicanism implied treason blasphemy yet be entitled to excuse a being man thing be abominable doubt in more pardonably abominable than must be in woman lady france have never declared to be republican disbeliever much le rebel a indeed have lord hampstead in presence of stepmother be generally silent on matter of political religious interest be supposed to sympathise with brother be known to be far from properly alive to aristocratic interest there be never quarrelling between two there be lack of friendship may subsist between stepmother of thirty eight stepdaughter of twenty one lady france be tall slender with quiet speaking feature dark in colour with blue eye hair nearly black in appearance be very opposite of stepmother moving quickly achieving grace a did so without thought by natural beauty of motion dignity be there without thought given to not even did little lord brother chuck book toy about with le idea of demeanour marchioness never arranged scarf buttoned glove without feeling that be duty to button glove arrange scarf a became marchioness of kingsbury stepmother wished evil to lady france only that must be married properly taken out of way stupid earl mercurial viscount must have done so long a blood money have be there lady france have be felt to be dangerous hope be that danger might be got rid of by proper marriage not by such marriage a when accidental calling of name be first heard following avowal made marchioness declared immediate feeling by look be so that arthur may have looked when first heard that queen be sinful so that caesar must have felt when even brutus struck for though lady france have be known to be blind to own greatness still at rate be not suspected can not mean marchioness have at last said certainly mean mamma then marchioness with one hand guarding raiment with other raised high above shoulder in agony of supplication to deity who arrange fate of ducal house passed slowly out of room be necessary that must bethink before word be spoken for time after very few word passed between sinner dead silence best befitted occasion a when child soil best frock put in corner with scolding when tell fib quell little soul within by terrible quiescence to be eloquently indignant without word be within compass of thoughtfully stolid be thus that lady france be at first treated by stepmother be however at once taken up to london subjected to louder anger of father made to prepare for saxon alp at first indeed immediate destiny be not communicated to be to be taken abroad in so taking be felt to be well to treat a policeman doe prisoner whom think to be last person who need be informed a to whereabouts of prison did leak out quickly because marquis have castle chateau of own in saxony be only accident marchioness still said little on matter unless in what might say to husband in secret recess of marital discussion before departed found expedient to express on one occasion to lord hampstead hampstead said be terrible blow have fallen upon be surprised know must call exactly blow not blow of course mean that will come to nothing what meant be that though regard proposition a inexpedient inexpedient yes think inexpedient certainly there be nothing in that shock nothing that shock marriage in be good thing hampstead talk to in way think be if be good for young man to marry must be good for young woman also one make other necessary not for such a sister together be speaking in way simply to torment can only speak a think do agree that must be inexpedient must to certain extent lose countenance of friend altogether not altogether to extent certain class of people not best worth knowing might be inclined to drop however foolish own friend may be owe something even to folly friend be not foolish proper friend quite agree with then so many of be improper hampstead be afraid that make quite clear never mind must be inexpedient must go against grain with father who ought to be consulted must think so quite agree with father ought to be consulted even though daughter be of age so a to be enabled by law to do a like with then there must be money discomfort must not have shilling not what must think duty to put right if there be real distress here spoke heir who be already in possession of much upon whom whole property of family be entailed nevertheless if can prevent without quarrelling with one other without saying hard word will do so will be bounden duty be always man bounden duty to do what be right difficulty be in seeing way after marchioness be silent what have gained by speaking be very little little nothing nature of opposition proposed be almost a bad a sanction reason gave for agreeing with be a hurtful to feeling a though have be advanced on other side even marquis be not sufficiently struck with horror at idea that daughter of must have condescended to listen to love from post office clerk on day before started hampstead be enabled to be alone with sister for few minute what absurdity be said laughing running away be what must have expected not le absurd of course will go just at moment have alternative a must have none if threatened to lock up till got somebody to take case in hand be a free to do what please with a be papa have got money be not therefore to be tyrant yes be over unmarried daughter who have got none can not obey on whom be dependent what mean be that carrying away can do good suppose john will give up after having once brought to say word be very difficult to say ten time harder to be unsaid be quite determined quite satisfied be not a regard father be very sorry a to mamma be so different in thinking that know beforehand might do must displease can not be helped whether be good bad can not be made such a be came too late will not turn against john rather think will john may rather say have think engagement to be wise have be made said may be unmade unless by will tell that ought to be unmade for happiness of of will not believe then lord hampstead shrugged shoulder thus conversation be finished be now about end of june marquis felt to be grievance that must be carried away from charm of political life in london in horror of first revelation have yielded have since begun to feel that too much be being done in withdrawing from parliament conservative be now in during last liberal government have consented so far to trammel with bond of office a to

servant who waited on hardly word be spoken marchioness felt that awful silence be becoming in situation lady france merely determined more strongly than ever that situation must not last very long

that idea of prison must not be shaken off in first few day said not word about objectionable lover did marquis have be settled between be anything said on other subject there be sternness in motion grim silence seemed to preside in chateau except when boy be present attempt be made to separate from brother a much a possible be more inclined to resent than other ill usage be adopted towards after

look at a though be poor lost creature think that be lost creature at will be just a much lost here a though be at home in england when come to talking be a bad a brother said marquis a left only that expression be considered to be unfit for female ear must have accused of talking hind leg off dog when be gone life at koenigsgraaf became very sombre indeed mr george roden name be never mentioned by of lady there be post office doubt post office be at first left open to there soon came time in be deprived of consolation with guardian a marchioness be not likely that free correspondence must be left open to chapter v mr roden george roden post office clerk lived with mother at holloway about three mile from office there occupied small house have be taken when mean be smaller even than at present for have be done before young man have made way into official elysium of st martin le grand have be effected about five year since during time have risen to income of l a mother have mean of own amounting to about double a much a personal expense be small be enabled to live in comfort be lady of whom none around knew anything there have gone abroad rumour among neighbour that there be something of mystery attached to there existed prevailing feeling that be at rate well born lady few people at holloway knew son there be who condescended to watch to talk about be ascertained that mr roden usually went to church on sunday morning that son never did so be known too that female friend called upon regularly once week be noted in annals of holloway that female friend came always at three o'clock on monday intelligent observer have become aware that return visit be made in course of week not always made on one certain day from circumstance various surmise arose a to mean whereabouts character of visitor mr roden always went in cab lady whose name be soon known to be mr vincent came in brougham for time be supposed to be own peculiar property man who drove be so well arrayed a to hat cravat coat a to leave impression that must be private servant one feminine observer keener than others saw man on unfortunate day descend from box at public house knew at once that trouser be trouser of hired driver from livery stable nevertheless be manifest that mr vincent be better to do in world than mr roden because must afford to hire must be private carriage be imagined also that be lady accustomed to remain at home of afternoon probably with object of receiving visitor because mr roden made visit indifferently on thursday friday saturday be suggested also that mr vincent be friend to young clerk because be well known that be never there when lady came be supposed that never accompanied mother on return visit have indeed on one occasion be seen to get out of cab with mother at own door be strongly surmised that have then picked up at post office official engagement might indeed have accounted for naturally lady of holloway be well aware that humanity of postmaster general allowed saturday half holiday to otherwise overworked official be sure that so good son a george roden must occasionally have accompanied mother have there be especial reason against from further surmise arose glance have fallen from eye of visitor lady perhaps chance word have be heard from lip created opinion that be religious probably objected to george roden because be anti religious at rate anti church meeting chapel going have become quite decided at holloway that mr vincent must not put up with young clerk infidelity be believed that there have be word between two lady on subject of religion a to probably there be valid foundation being ascertained fact that two maid who be employed by mr roden be never known to tell anything of mistress be decided at holloway that mr roden mr vincent be cousin be like enough in face near enough in age to have be sister old mr demijohn of paradise row have declared that have george be nephew aunt must not have wearied in endeavour to convert in case there must have be intimacy in spite of disapproval first cousin once removed might be allowed to go to mischief in own way mr vincent be supposed to be elder cousin perhaps three four year elder to have therefore something of authority not much be stouter too le careful to hide what grey hair year might have produced showing manifestly by nature of bonnet shawl that despised vanity of world not that be always handsomely dressed a mr demijohn be very well aware le than hundred year must not have clothed mr vincent whereas mr roden a world perceived did not spend money who doe not know that lady may repudiate vanity in rich silk cultivate world in woollen stuff even in calico nothing be more certain to mr demijohn than mr vincent be severe mr roden be soft gentle be assumed also that two lady be widow a husband sign of husband have appeared on scene mr vincent showed manifestly from deportment a well a from title that have be married woman a to mr roden of course there be doubt in regard to reader may take settled opinion of mr demijohn of holloway a being nearly true riddle may be read very accurately by who will give sufficient attention ample time to reading of who will devote twelve hour day to unravelling of acrostic may discover nearly enigma of weekly newspaper with separate editor for such difficulty mr demijohn have almost arrived at fact two lady be second cousin mr vincent be widow be religious be austere be fairly well off have quarrelled altogether with distant relative george of post office mr roden though went to church be not so well given to religious observance a cousin must have hence word have come mr roden have borne with equanimity have received without effect nevertheless two woman loved other dearly be great part of life of of that weekly visit must be made there be one great fact a to mr demijohn holloway be in wrong mr roden be not widow be not till kingsburys have left london that george told mother of engagement be well acquainted with intimacy with lord hampstead knew that have be staying at hendon hall with kingsbury family there have be reticence between mother son a to people in regard to whom have frequently cautioned that there be danger in such association with people moving altogether in different sphere in answer to son have always declared that did not see danger have not run after lord hampstead circumstance have thrown together have originally met other in small political debating society gradually friendship have grown lord have sought not lord according to own idea have be right difference in rank difference in wealth difference in social regard required a much a that when have discovered who be young man whom have met stood off somewhat allowed friendship to spring from other side have be slow to accept favour even at first to accept hospitality whenever ice have a said be thoroughly broken then thought that there be reason why must not pull other out of cold water together a for danger what be there to fear marchioness must not like very probably marchioness be not very much to hampstead be nothing at to marquis must not really like perhaps not in choosing friend young man be not supposed to follow altogether father liking much le need chosen friend follow marquis a george pointed out to mother be hardly more like other marquis than son be like other marquis son there be radical strain in family a be made clear by tailor who be still sitting for borough of edgeware mr roden however though lived so much alone seeing hardly anything of world except a mr vincent might be supposed to represent world have learned that feeling political conviction of marquis be hardly what have be before have married present wife may be sure george have said that like to like be a safe motto for friendship a be for love not doubt mother replied before act upon must define 'like ' what make two men like man woman outside circumstance of world more than anything else answered boldly must fancy that inside circumstance of mind must have more to do with shook head at pleasantly softly lovingly still with settled purpose of contradiction have admitted along continued that low birth have said nothing of low birth here be point on there did not exist full confidence between mother son in regard to mother be always attempting to reassure son while must assume something against must not allow to pas without attempt of faint denial birth low by comparison continued going on with sentence must not take upon a much a may be allowed to nobility by descent be certain though young prince may be superior in gift to young shoeblack must best show princeliness by cultivating shoeblack still shoeblack must wait to be cultivated world have created state of thing in shoeblack can not do otherwise without showing arrogance impudence by must achieve nothing too must make black shoe very badly doubt will have to come to pas way because nobler employment to will be raised by appreciating prince will cause to drop shoe be lord hampstead to cause to drop post office not at be not prince be shoeblack though be far apart be not so far apart a to make such change essential to acquaintance be saying know what be saying be defining what 'like ' mean people always get muddled when attempt definition said mother though depends somewhat on external have more to do with internals be what mean man woman might live together with most enduring though one have be noble wealthy other poor nobody thorough brute human being of fine condition can hardly live together love other be true said that fear be true hope be true have often to be tried generally to great detriment of better nature however have be said before george roden have spoken word to lady france have referred only to friendship a be growing between son young lord young lord have come on various occasion to house at holloway have there made thoroughly pleasant to friend mother lord hampstead have way of making pleasant in never failed when chose to exercise did exercise almost always always indeed unless be driven to be courteously disagreeable by opposition to own peculiar opinion in shooting fishing other occupation not approved of must fall into line of argument seemingly indeed truly good humoured be apt however to be aggravating to opponent in way must make thoroughly odious to stepmother with whom have not one sentiment in common in other respect manner be invariably sweet with assumption of intimacy be not unbecoming thus have greatly recommended to mr roden who doe not know fashion in normal young man conduct when be making morning call have come there because mean to be civil must not be there unless wished to make popular be carrying out recognized purpose of society must fain be agreeable if be possible must enjoy moment if must be clearly conviction that be bound to get through certain amount of altogether uninteresting conversation then to get out of room with a little awkwardness a may be unless there be pretty girl chance favour with special companionship doe not for moment suppose that social pleasure be to be enjoyed that rational amusement can be got out of talking to mr jones doe not enter into mind yet mr jones be probably fair specimen of general society in one wish to mingle society be to generally made up of several part of be pain though total be deemed to be desirable pretty girl episode be doubt exception though also have pain when matter for conversation doe not come readily when conversation coming too readily be rebuked morning call may be regarded a period of unmitigated agony now have to be asserted on lord hampstead behalf that must talk with almost mr jones freely pleasantly while remained take departure without dislocating struggle be too common must make at ease discourse a though have known lady life there be nothing woman like so much a by doing lord hampstead have done much if not to overcome at rate to quiet sense of danger of mr roden have spoken refers to time in nothing be known at holloway a to lady france very little have be said of family between mother son of marquis george roden have wished to think well have hardly succeeded of stepmother have never even wished to do so have from first be known to a woman thoroughly wedded to aristocratic prejudice who regarded a endowed with certain privilege made altogether superior to other human being hampstead must not even pretend to respect of roden have said very little to mother simply speaking of a marchioness who be in way related to hampstead of lady france have simply said that there be girl there endowed with spirit that of girl of class must surely be best noblest then mother have shuddered inwardly thinking that here too there might be possible danger have shrunk from speaking of special danger even to son how have visit gone mr roden asked when son have already be hour in house be after last visit to hendon hall in lady france have promised to become wife pretty well taking altogether know that something have disappointed indeed nothing have be somewhat abashed what have said to asked very little what be kind just one word at last something have hurt said mother lady kingsbury have made aware that dislike thoroughly be very odd how one person can do to almost without word spoken told george that there must be danger in going there there must be no danger in if there be nothing more what more be there then there must be no danger in if lady kingsbury be simply hampstead stepmother what more be be stepmother also to lady france oh mother george what have happened asked have asked lady france to be wife wife have promised oh george yes indeed mother now can perceive that indeed may be danger when think of power of tormenting stepdaughter may rest in hand can hardly forgive for doing a have done marquis asked mother know nothing a yet a to what feeling may be have have opportunity of speaking to since little occurrence took place word escaped unthought of word ladyship overheard for rebuked then left house what word just common word of greeting word must be common among dear friend coming from to told story forgot prefix be due from such one a be to such a be can understand with what horror must henceforward be regarded by lady kingsbury what will marquis say will be horror to also unutterable horror idea of contact so vile will cure at once of little radical longing hampstead nothing think can cure hampstead of conviction even be not well pleased have quarrelled with not that be too noble to quarrel on such offence be too noble even to take offence on cause refuse to believe good will come of mother oh george doubt doubt will not congratulate what be to say fear more than can hope when tell that be noble at point noble in heart noble in beauty noble in dignity woman must always carry with that be a sweet creature a god ever created to bless man with will not then congratulate must birth be other than be said mother must have altered in nothing said son birth be smallest thing about such a be must have altered in nothing chapter vi paradise row about fortnight after george roden return to holloway fortnight passed by mother in meditation a to son glorious dangerous love lord hampstead called at paradise row mr roden lived at mr demijohn lived at house opposite there have already be discussion in holloway about lord hampstead nothing have a yet be discovered might have be at house on various previous occasion have come in so unpretending manner a hardly to have done more than to cause to be regarded a stranger in holloway be known to be george friend because have be first seen coming with george on saturday afternoon have also called on sunday walked away down row with george mr demijohn concluded that be brother clerk in post office have expressed opinion that did not signify meaning thereby to imply holloway need not interest about stranger young government clerk must naturally have young government clerk for friend twice lord hampstead have come down in omnibus from islington on occasion be remarked that a did not come on saturday there must be something wrong clerk with saturday half holiday ought not to be away from work on monday tuesday mr duffer who be regarded in paradise row a being very inferior to mr demijohn suggested that young man might perhaps not be post office clerk however be ridiculed where must post office clerk find friend except among post office clerk perhaps be coming after widow suggested mr duffer also be received with dissent mr demijohn declared that post office clerk knew better than to marry widow with more than two three hundred year old enough to be mother why doe come on tuesday asked mr duffer why doe come alone oh dear old mr duffer said clara demijohn old lady niece naturally thinking that might not be unnatural that handsome young men must come to paradise row however have be a nothing to what occurred in row on occasion be now about to be described aunt jemima exclaimed clara demijohn looking out of window there be that young man come again to number eleven riding on horseback with groom behind to hold groom to hold exclaimed mr demijohn jumping with rheumatism quickly from seat trotting to window look if there aint with boot breech must be said mr demijohn after pause during have be looking intently at empty saddle of horse groom be leading slowly up down row be same came with young roden saturday said clara only have be walking looked nicer than ever can hire horse groom said mr demijohn 'd never make money last till end of month if went on in way aint hired be own said clara how do know miss by colour of boot way touched hat because glove be clean aint post office clerk at aunt jemima wonder whether can be coming after widow said mr demijohn after clara escaped out of room leaving aunt fixed at window sight a groom two horse moving up down together have never be seen in row before clara put on hat ran across hurriedly to mr duffer who lived at next door one to mr roden be altogether too late to communicate news a news knew be post office clerk said mr duffer who have seen lord hampstead ride up street who be why wherefore be beyond to conjecture never will give up opinion again talking to aunt suppose hold out still that be post office clerk think might have hired oh hired did ever see anything so noble a way got off horse a for hire be nonsense be be getting off horse day of life thus be that paradise row be awe stricken by last coming of george roden friend be odd thing to do riding down to holloway one else must have done lord post office clerk with hired horse with private property there be hot july sunshine road across from hendon hall consisted chiefly of paved street lord hampstead always did thing a others must not do be too far to walk in midday sun therefore rode there must be servant at mr roden house to hold horse therefore brought one of own did not see why man on horseback must attract more attention at holloway than at hyde park corner have guessed effect horse must have have in paradise row must have come by other mean mr roden at first received with considerable embarrassment probably observed in speaking to seemed not to observe very hot indeed said too hot for riding a found soon after started suppose george have given up walking for present still walk home think if have declared purpose of doing so 'd go on though have sunstroke afternoon hope be not so obstinate a lord most obstinate fellow ever knew in life though world be to come to end 'd let come rather than change purpose be very well for man to keep purpose may overdo have be very determined lately in anything nothing particular have seen for last week want to come over dine with at hendon one of day be alone there from mr roden learnt that lord hampstead at rate did not intend to quarrel with son learnt also lady france be no longer staying at hall can send home continued lord if can manage to come down by railway omnibus will give message lord tell start on st yacht be at cowes will go down there on that morning will be away heaven know how long probably for month vivian will be with mean to bask away time in norway iceland sea till go like idiot that be to grouse shooting must like to see george before start said be alone vivian will be with george have met before a did cut other throat then suppose wo now will tell said roden then there be pause for moment after lord hampstead went on in altered voice have said anything to since be at hendon a to family mean have told something be sure have must not have asked unless have be quite sure know that must tell anything of kind well what be to say lord hampstead what have told mr roden have spoken to of sister what have said that love that love that hope so have said more than take have engaged to other so understand what do think of mr roden what can think of lord hampstead hardly dare to think of at be wise suppose where love be concerned wisdom be not much considered people have to consider hardly know how to think of to idea be not wise yet there be one living whom esteem so much a son be very good lord there be goodness in more than in liking for can indulge fancy without doing harm to others lady kingsbury think be idiot because live exclusively with count countess in declining to take advice injure much can talk about infatuation among friend with smile will not be tortured by feeling of disgrace so with father have idea be out heroding herod having be herod there be nothing bitter in to fine young gentleman brother who be dearest little chick in world five six seven year old will be able to laugh pleasantly at elder brother when grow up a will do among other idle young swell of nation that brother george roden must be always together will not even vex may probably receive benefit may achieve diminution of folly natural to position by advantage in knowing in looking at round a far a go there be not only satisfaction to certain pride be doing more than have right to do counter influence may introduce among own people will be good wholesome do understand mr roden think so very clearly must be dull if did not becomes different when one sister be concerned be thinking of happiness of other people suppose will think of own not exclusively hope not that be sure girl when love yes be true girl situated like france be bound not to not to sacrifice with whom fame fortune have connected can speak plainly to mr roden because know what be own opinion about many thing george have sister girl belonging to if have loved must abstain from marrying lest must sacrifice connection word have offended not in least be word true to purpose in hand understand sacrifice mean lady kingsbury feeling must be sacrificed be daughter even stepdaughter to become boy husband supposes that girl birth be superior to boy there be so many meaning to word 'birth ' will take a mean lord hampstead will not be offended boy a be be match for sister lord lady kingsbury must think that there have be sacrifice might be that little lord must not in future year be wont to talk at club of brother in law post office clerk a must of earl duke with whom might have become connected let pas by acknowledge that there must be sacrifice so there will be must marry below degree sacrifice must be greater because must be carried on to future marquis of kingsbury must practise such self denial a demand from sister lord hampstead considered matter while then answered question think that two case must be quite analogous where be difference there be something more delicate more nice requiring greater caution in conduct of girl than of man quite so lord hampstead where conduct be in question girl be bound to submit to stricter law may explain that by saying that girl be lost for ever who give up to unlawful love whereas for man way back to world respect be only too easy even must on score have lost aught of world respect same law run through act of girl life a contrasted with act of men in act act now supposed of marrying gentleman whom love sister must hing must exclude from respect of good men society of well ordered lady say that marriage must be well assorted recommend though boy heart be dearer to than anything else can be in world can see that may be fit that heart must be made to suffer when talk of sacrifice sister be called on to make so that others must be delivered from lesser sacrifice think must ask what duty must require from think must sacrifice noble blood of traffords more effectually than must by similar marriage a thus spoke leant forward from chair on table looked full in face felt a did so that be singularly handsome greatly gifted woman noble to eye to ear be pleading for son knew that have condescended to use mean argument if will say that law be dominant among class that be one to must submit will not repudiate will not induce to consent to by even false idea a to softer delicacy of sex that softer delicacy with privilege duty will be made to stand for what be worth to occupy real ground if use for other mock purpose then will quarrel with be thus that have spoken understood be not brought in question said slowly can not put to a though be brought in question will at rate admit that argument be just hardly know must think of marriage on part must not outrage stepmother a must that of sister outrage speak lord hampstead a though mother must think that sister must have disgraced a woman be speaking of feeling not of mine must be different be to marry in same degree must then think that perhaps have better counsel george not to go to hendon hall sister be not there be in germany have better not go where sister will be thought of must not quarrel with son for world will be better that must suppose that

such engagement must not be deterred in least from resolution must accept a possible that must be turned from object by wish of person a long a lady france be true to speak a if daughter be slave said so be so woman must be slave to convention of world young woman can hardly run counter to family on question of marriage may be persistent enough to overcome objection will be because objection be not strong enough to stand against here objection will be very strong will see mother said who knew well perceived that must be vain to talk to further oh yes said will go out to hendon perhaps on sunday that mr vivian be pleasant fellow a hampstead doe not wish to quarrel with certainly will not quarrel with roden be generally popular at office have contrived to make occupation there pleasant to interesting have little trouble a will happen to most men in walk of life came to chiefly from ill manner of fellow clerk who sat in same room with at same desk there be five who occupied apartment elderly gentleman four youngster elderly gentleman be quiet civil dull old man who never made disagreeable be content to put up with frivolity of youth if did not become too uproarious antagonistic to discipline when did have one word of rebuke mr crocker will not have beyond that have never be known to go in way of reporting misconduct of subordinate to other superior power in quarrelling with young men even with mr crocker who doubt be troublesome contrived to maintain term of outward friendship name be jerningham next to mr jerningham in age came mr crocker by whose ill timed witticism george roden be not unfrequently made to suffer have sometimes gone so far that roden have contemplated necessity of desiring mr crocker to assume that bond of enmity have be established between in other word that be not to speak except on official subject there have be air of importance about proceeding of crocker hardly seemed to be worthy roden have abstained putting off evil hour from day to day still conscious that must do something to stop vulgarity be distasteful to two other young men mr bobbin mr geraghty who sat at table by be two junior clerk in branch of office be pleasant good humoured enough be young a yet not very useful to queen be apt to come late to office impatient to leave when hour of four drew there must sometimes come storm through department moved by unseen powerful unsatisfied aeolus in bobbin geraghty must be threatened to be blown into infinite space minute must be written rumour spread about punishment must be inflicted must be given to be understood now one then other must certainly have to return to disconsolate family at very next offence there be question at very moment whether geraghty who have come from sister island about twelve month since must not be returned to king county no doubt have passed civil service examiner with distinguished applause hated young crichton who came to with full mark have declared that geraghty though doubt linguist philosopher mathematician be not worth salt a post office clerk bobbin also be protected by mr jerningham be well liked by george roden that roden be intimate with lord hampstead have become known to fellow clerk knowledge of association acted somewhat to advantage somewhat to injury daily companion must not feel reflected honour in own intimacy with friend of eldest son of marquis be anxious to stand well with one who lived in such high society such be natural be natural also that envy must show in ridicule that lord must be thrown in clerk teeth when clerk must be deemed to have given offence crocker when first became certain that roden passed much of time in company with young lord have be anxious enough to foregather with fortunate youth who sat opposite to roden have not cared much for crocker society hence have come to pas that crocker have devoted to jeer witticism mr jerningham who in very soul respected marquis felt something of genuine awe for anything touched peerage held fortunate junior in unfeigned esteem from moment in became aware of intimacy did in truth think better of clerk because clerk have known how to make companion to lord did not want anything for be too old settled in life to be desirous of new friendship be naturally conscientious gentle unassuming roden rose in estimation crocker fell when became assured that roden lord hampstead be intimate friend crocker have dared to jeer at friendship lord be like new hat one on arm other on head be evidence of mental superiority yet be taken not incorrectly taken a sign of merit increased esteem shown by mr jerningham for roden must think be taken a showing mr jerningham good sense general appreciation two lad be on roden side roden be not rose lived with rose lad of course liked scent of rose did not particularly like crocker though crocker have dash about must sometimes win flattery crocker be brave impudent self assuming be not a yet sufficiently advanced in life to be able to despise crocker crocker imposed upon must there come anything of real warfare between crocker roden there must be doubt that must side with lord hampstead friend such be state of room at post office when crocker entered on morning of lord hampstead visit to paradise row crocker be little late be often little late fact of mr jerningham ought to have taken more stringent notice than did perhaps mr jerningham rather feared crocker crocker have so read mr jerningham character a to have become aware that senior be soft perhaps timid have so far advanced in reading a to have learned to think that must get better of mr jerningham by being loud impudent have doubt hitherto be successful there be in office who believed that day might come when mr jerningham must rouse in wrath mr crocker be late said mr jerningham mr jerningham be late scorn false excuse geraghty must say that watch be wrong bobbin must have eaten something have disagreed with roden must have be detained by friend lord hampstead to roden made reply even by look for have to acknowledge did not turn out when be called of twenty minute have deprived country a country value so much of time at only seven penny halfpenny be hardly worth saying much about be frequently late when amount have come up to ten pound will send postmaster general stamp to amount be now standing at desk opposite to roden to whom made low bow mr george roden said hope that lordship be quite well only lord with whom be acquainted be quite well know why must trouble about think becoming in one who take queen pay to show becoming anxiety a to queen aristocracy have greatest respect for marquis of kingsbury have not mr jerningham certainly have if must go to work instead of talking so much must be better for everybody be at work already do think that can not work talk at same time bobbin boy if must open that window do think must hurt complexion bobbin opened window paddy where be last night paddy be mr geraghty be dining then with sister mother in law what o'kelly great legislator home ruler whom country so love parliament so hate think home ruler relative ought to be allowed into service do mr jerningham think mr geraghty if will only be little more careful will do great credit to service said mr jerningham hope that aeolus may think same aeolus be name by certain pundit be known at office violent imperious secretary not in main ill natured aeolus when last heard of opinion seemed to have doubt about poor paddy be disagreeable subject be felt by that might better be left in silence from time work of day be continued with more than moderate interruption till hour of luncheon when usual attendant entered with usual mutton chop wonder if lord hampstead have mutton chop for luncheon asked crocker why must not asked mr jerningham foolishly there must be kind of gilded cutlet upon higher member of aristocracy regale suppose roden must have seen lordship at lunch dare say have said roden angrily knew that be annoyed be angry with at own annoyance be golden only gilded asked crocker believe mean to make disagreeable said other quite reverse mean to make agreeable only have soared so high of late that ordinary conversation have charm for be there reason why lord hampstead lunch must not be mentioned certainly there be said roden then upon life can not see if talked of mid day chop must not take amiss think fellow must ever talk about fellow eating unless know fellow came from bobbin who intended well meaning to fight battle for roden a well a knew how most sapient bobb said crocker seem to be unaware that one young fellow who be roden happens to be peculiarly intimate friend of other fellow who be earl of hampstead therefore law a so clearly laid down by have not be infringed to return to mutton a frenchman say what sort of lunch doe lordship eat be determined to make disagreeable said roden appeal to mr jerningham whether have said anything unbecoming if appeal to think have said mr jerningham have at rate be so successful in doing continued roden that must ask to hold tongue about lord hampstead have not be by anything have said that have heard of acquaintance with joke be bad one will become vulgar if repeated vulgar cried crocker pushing away plate rising from chair mean ungentlemanlike want to use hard word will not allow to be annoyed hoity toity said crocker here be row because made chance allusion to noble lord be to be called vulgar because mentioned name then began to whistle mr crocker will not have said mr jerningham assuming most angry tone make more noise in room than others put together nevertheless do wonder what lord hampstead have have for lunch be last shot after that five gentleman did in truth settle down to afternoon work when four o'clock came mr jerningham with praiseworthy punctuality took hat departed wife three unmarried daughter be waiting for at islington a be always in seat punctually at ten be justified in leaving punctually at four crocker swaggered about room for minute two with hat on desirous of showing that be by mean affected by rebuke have received too soon went not having summoned courage to recur to name of roden noble friend two lad remained for sake of saying word of comfort to roden who still sat writing at desk thought be very low form said bobbin crocker going on like crocker baist said geraghty what be to what anybody eats for lunch continued bobbin only like to have nobleman name in mouth said geraghty think be hoighth of bad manner talking about anybody friend unless happen to know think be said roden looking up from desk will tell show worse manner be desire to annoy anybody crocker like to be funny think there be fun so good a what call taking rise know that be very fond of crocker may be a well that must think more about upon young men promised that at least must think more about then took departure george roden soon followed for be not practice of anybody in department to remain at work long after four o'clock roden a walked home did think more of little affair than deserved more at least than must acknowledge that deserved be angry with for bearing in mind yet did bear in mind must be that creature so insignificant a crocker must annoy by mere word two be annoyed did not know how such annoyance must be made to cease if man must continue to talk about lord hampstead there be nothing by must be made to hold tongue must not be kicked beaten turned out of room for purpose of real assistance mr jerningham be useless a to complaining to aeolus of office that certain clerk must talk about lord hampstead that of course be out of question have already used strong language calling man vulgar ungentlemanlike if man doe not regard strong language what further can angry victim do to then thought passed on to connexion with marquis of kingsbury family generally have not done wrong at rate done foolishly in thus moving out of own sphere at present moment lady france be nearer to even than lord hampstead be more important to more in thought be not certain that must give rise to misery rather than to happiness by what have occurred between lady france be not probable that have embittered for life of lady whom loved have assumed assured face confident smile while declaring to mother that power on earth must stand between promised wife that must be able to walk out from father hall marry a certainly a might housemaid ploughman daughter go to lover what must be achieved by if be to walk out only to encounter country be so constituted that traffords be in truth of different race a much so a negro be different from white man post office clerk may indeed possibly become duke whereas negro skin can not be washed white while lady france be a be distance between be so great that approach must be made between without disruption world might be wrong in to thinking world be wrong while fact existed be too strong to be set aside must do duty to world by struggling to propagate own opinion so that distance might be little lessened in own time be sure that distance be being lessened with thought that ought to have be contented jeering of one a crocker be unimportant though disagreeable sufficed to show feeling friendship a with lord hampstead have appeared to crocker to be ridiculous crocker must not have seen absurdity unless others have seen also even own mother saw here in england be accounted so foolish thing that post office clerk must be hand glove with one a lord hampstead even crocker must raise laugh against must world say when must have become known that intended to lead lady france to hymeneal altar a repeated word to there be something ridiculous even to in idea that hymeneal altar must ever be mentioned in reference to adventure of such person a george roden post office clerk thinking of be not in happy frame of mind when reached home in paradise row chapter viii mr greenwood roden

mind that must ask question unless subject be mentioned did not even allude to of family learnt in course of evening that marquis have come back from germany with intention of attending to parliamentary duty during remainder of session be going to turn out said vivian on county franchise suppose be afraid father be not so keen about county franchise a used to be though hope will be one of few to support in house of lord if house of common ever dare to pas in way roden learnt that marquis who have carried daughter off to saxony a soon a have heard of engagement have left charge there have returned to london a went home that evening thought that must be duty to go to lord kingsbury tell a from father have a yet only learnt from daughter from wife be aware that behoves man when have won girl heart to go to father ask permission to carry on suit duty thought be bound to perform even though father be person so high mighty a marquis of kingsbury hitherto such going be out of power marquis have heard tidings have immediately caught daughter up carried off to germany must have be possible to write to roden have thought that not in such way must such duty be performed now marquis have come back to london though operation must be painful duty seemed to be paramount on next day informed mr jerningham private business of importance must take to west end asked leave to absent morning have be passed in room at post office with more than ordinary silence crocker have be collecting for attack courage have hitherto failed a roden put on hat opened door fired parting shot remember kindly to lord hampstead said tell hope enjoyed cutlet roden stood for moment with door in hand thinking that must turn upon man rebuke insolence at last determined that must be best to hold peace went direct to park lane thinking that must probably find marquis before left house after luncheon have never be before at town mansion be known a kingsbury house possessed appanage of grandeur can be given to london residence a knocked at door acknowledged that be struck with certain awe of be ashamed having said so much to daughter surely must not be afraid to speak to father felt that must have managed matter much better have contrived to have interview at hendon hall be much le grand than kingsbury house almost a soon a knocked door be opened found with powdered footman a well a porter powdered footman did not know whether lord be at home must inquire must gentleman sit down for minute two gentleman did sit down waited for what seemed to to be more than hour house must be very large indeed if took man time to look for marquis be beginning to think in what way might best make escape a man be apt to think when delay of kind prove too long for patience man returned with cold unfriendly air bade roden to follow roden be quite sure that evil be to happen so cold unfriendly be manner of man still followed having now mean of escape man have not said that marquis must see have not even given intimation that marquis be in house be a though be being led away to execution for having have impertinence to knock at door still followed be taken along passage on ground floor past numerous door to what must have be back of house there be shown into somewhat dingy room be altogether surrounded by book there saw old gentleman old gentleman be not marquis of kingsbury ah eh oh said old gentleman believe be mr george roden be name have hoped to see lord kingsbury lord kingsbury have thought best for party that must see be if anybody must see name be greenwood rev mr greenwood be lordship chaplain if may presume to say so most attached sincere friend have have honour of very long connexion with lordship have therefore be entrusted by with delicate duty have perhaps better call mr greenwood be stout short man about sixty year of age with pendant cheek pendant chin with few grey hair brushed carefully over head with good forehead well fashioned nose who must have be good looking when be young that be too short for manly beauty now in advanced year have become lethargic averse to exercise having grown to be corpulent have lost whatever have possessed in height by becoming broad looked to be fat dwarf still there must have be something pleasant in face for air of doubt hesitation seemed almost to betray cowardice at present moment stood in middle of room rubbing hand together almost trembling a explained to george roden who be have certainly wished to see lordship said roden marquis have thought better not must say that agree with marquis at moment roden hardly knew how to go on with business in hand believe be justified in assuring that anything must have said to marquis may say to be to understand lord kingsbury refuse to see well yes at present crisis doe refuse what can be gained roden did not a yet know how far might go in mentioning name of lady france to clergyman be unwilling to leave house without reference to business have in hand be peculiarly averse to leaving impression that be afraid to mention what have done have to speak to lordship about daughter said know know lady france have known lady france since be little child have warmest regard for lady france a have also for lord hampstead for marchioness for three dear little boy lord frederic lord augustus lord gregory feel natural hesitation in calling friend because think that difference in rank station have pleased lord to institute must be maintained with privilege honour though have agreed with marquis through long life in political tenet by propagating have be ever anxious to improve condition of lower class be not have not be on account le anxious to uphold by small mean may be in power variation in rank to think in conjunction with protestant religion welfare high standing of country be mainly to be attributed having feeling at heart very strongly wish particularly on occasion a to seem by even chance word to diminish respect feel to be due to member of family of rank so exalted a belongs to family of marquis of kingsbury putting aside for moment perhaps may venture on occasion having have confided to task so delicate a present to declare warm friendship for who bear honoured name of trafford be at rate entitled to declare so far friend that may say anything on delicate subject must think necessary to say to young lady father however inexpedient may be that anything must be said at have be instructed by lordship to hear to reply george roden while be listening to tedious sermon be standing opposite to preacher with hat in hand having not yet have accorded to favour of seat during preaching of sermon preacher have never ceased to shiver shake rubbing one fat little clammy hand slowly over other apparently afraid to look audience in face seemed to roden a though word must have be learnt by heart came so glibly with so much of unction of earnestness be in glibness so strongly opposed to man manner there have not be single word spoken have not be offensive to roden seemed to that have be chosen because of offence in long winded sentence about rank in mr greenwood have expressed own humility insufficiency for position of friend in family so exalted have manifestly intended to signify much more manifest insufficiency of hearer to fill place of higher honour even than of friend have word come at spur of moment man must thought roden have great gift for extempore preaching have thought time in hall to be long have not be much for communication of earl wish then for preparation of word be necessary however that must make reply without preparation have come said to tell lord kingsbury be in love with daughter at hearing fat little man held up hand in amazement although have already made clear that be acquainted with circumstance must have be bound to add said roden plucking up courage that young lady be also in love with oh oh oh hand went higher higher a interjection be made why not be not truth best young man mr roden must never boast of young lady affection particularly of young lady particularly when can not admit that exists particularly not in father house nobody must boast of anything mr greenwood speak of fact be necessary that father must know if lady denies assertion have done be matter in delicacy demand that question will be put to young lady after what have occurred be out of question that name must even be mentioned in young lady hearing why mean to marry mean word be shouted in extremity of mr greenwood horror mr roden be duty to assure that under circumstance can ever see young lady again who say so marquis say so marchioness little brother who with growing strength will protect from harm hope growing strength may not be wanted for such purpose must be so be sure will not be deficient a brother at present there must not be much for to do mr greenwood shook head be still standing not having moved inch from position in have be placed when door be opened can understand mr greenwood that further conversation on subject between must be quite useless quite useless said mr greenwood have be necessary for honour for purpose that lord kingsbury must know have come to ask for daughter hand have not dared to expect that must accept proposal graciously hardly that mr roden be necessary that must know purpose from will now doubt do so be a understand aware of presence in house mr greenwood shook head a though must say that be matter must not longer discus if not must trouble lordship with letter will be unnecessary doe know mr greenwood nodded head will tell why have come marquis will be made acquainted with nature of interview roden then turned to leave room be obliged to ask greenwood to show way along passage clergyman did tripping on ahead upon toe till have delivered intruder over to hall porter having done so made a be valedictory bow tripped back to own apartment then roden left house thinking a did so that there be certainly much to be done before must be received there a welcome son in law a made way back to holloway again considered how must there be end to end must be satisfactory to to girl that loved aversion expressed to through person of mr greenwood be natural must not be expected that one a marquis of kingsbury must endeavour to keep daughter out of hand of such suitor if be only in regard to money must not be necessary for to do so possible barricade must be built up in way there must be nothing on side except girl love for be to be expected that love must have power to conquer such obstacle a if be must obtain own happiness by clinging to be aware that in present position duty be so incumbent on a of looking to happiness of woman whom wished to make wife chapter ix at koenigsgraaf very shortly after there came letter from lady france to paradise row only letter roden received from during period of courtship portion of letter will be given from reader will see that difficulty have arisen at koenigsgraaf a to correspondence have written twice first letter have in due course reached young lady hand having be brought up from village post office in usual manner delivered to without remark by own maid when second reached castle fell into hand of marchioness have indeed taken step that must fall into hand be aware that first letter have come have be shocked at idea of such correspondence have received no direct authority from husband on subject felt that be incumbent on to take strong step must not be that lady france must receive love letter from post office clerk a regarded lady france herself marchioness must have be willing enough that girl must be given over to letter carrier if must be thus got rid of altogether so that world must not know that there be have be lady france fact be patent a be also that too too sad truth of existence of brother older than own comely bairn a feeling of hatred grew upon continually declared to herself that must have be a gentle stepmother a ever loved woman child have two known how to bear like son daughter of marquis seeing what be what be own child how struggled to repudiate that rank own be born to adorn protect be not natural that must hate profess that must wish to be out of way must not be made to get out of way lady france might at rate be repressed therefore determined to stop correspondence did stop second letter told daughter that have done so papa did say be to have letter pleaded lady france papa did not suppose for moment that must submit to anything so indecent be not indecent will make judge of that be now in care papa can do a like when come back there be long altercation ended in victory on part of marchioness young lady when be told that if necessary postmistress in village must be instructed not to send on letter addressed to george roden believed in potency of threat felt sure also that must be unable to get at letter addressed to herself if quasi parental authority of marchioness be used to prevent yielded on condition however that one letter must be sent marchioness not at thinking that own instruction must have prevailed with post mistress yielded so far tenderness of letter reader can appreciate understand without seeing expressed in word be very tender full of promise full of trust then came short passage in own uncomfortable position be explained will understand that there have come one letter have not be allowed to see whether mamma have opened know whether have destroyed though have not seen take a assurance of goodness truth will be useless for to write more till hear from again have promised that for present will be last to last first hope will keep till have in order that may have something to tell how well love a sent from did not know how much of solace there be even in writing of letter to loved have a yet felt how great be torment of remaining without palpable notice from loved after episode of letter life at koenigsgraaf be very bitter very dull few word be spoken between marchioness stepdaughter be never friendly in tone kindly in nature even child be taken out of sister way a much a possible so moral must not be corrupted by evil communication when complained of to mother marchioness merely drew up be silent be possible must have altogether separated darling from contact with sister not because thought that darling must in truth be injured a to have fear at seeing that darling be subject to own influence in order that punishment to lady france might be more complete circumstance being such a be there must be family love fraternal sport softness mercy there must thought have come from blood of first wife stain of impurity have made child altogether unfit for rank to have unfortunately be born iniquity on part of lady france disgrace made absolutely tremble a thought of abominable affection for inferior creature acerbated feeling even against lord hampstead two be altogether so base a to make think that must not be intended by divine providence to stand permanently in way of glory of family something certainly must happen must turn out that be not truly legitimate child of real marchioness beautiful scheme of romance must discover to save darling traffords montressors from terrible abomination with be threatened by interloper idea dwelt in mind till became almost fixed conviction that lord frederic must live to become lord hampstead probably lord highgate a there be third title in family name of hampstead must for time be held to have be disgraced in due course of happy time marquis of kingsbury hitherto have be accustomed to speak to own baby of elder brother with something of respect be due to future head of family in day altered tone when spoke to of jack a must call from never mentioned name to be fanny naughty lord frederic asked one day to made reply be fanny very naughty boy persisted in asking to nodded head solemnly what have fanny done mamma at shook head mysteriously may therefore be understood that poor lady france be sadly in want of comfort during sojourn at koenigsgraaf about end of august marquis returned have hung on in london till very last day of session have be enjoyed have then pretended that presence have be absolutely required at trafford park to trafford park went have spent ten miserable day alone mr greenwood have indeed gone with marquis be man who be miserable unless surrounded by comfort of family led mr greenwood life that worthy clergyman be very happy when be left altogether in solitude by noble friend then in compliance with promise have absolutely made aware that be duty to look after wicked daughter marquis returned to koenigsgraaf lady france be to at period of life cause of unmitigated trouble must not be supposed that feeling be in way akin to of marchioness a to of elder child of be very dear to of of be in degree proud be handsome noble looking clever to thoroughly well behaved have seen what trouble other elder son must give father what demand be made for increased allowance what disreputable pursuit be sometimes followed what quarrel there be what difference what want of affection want of respect be wise enough to have perceived to be aware that be in respect singularly blest hampstead never asked for shilling be liberal man must willingly have given many shilling still there be comfort in having son who be quite contented in having own income doubt time must come when little lord must want shilling lady france have always be particularly soft to diffusing over life sweet taste of memory of first wife of present marchioness be fond enough be aware how much did for to support position be conscious ever of prior existence in there have be higher thought grander feeling aspiration be now wanting to of something must come back in moment spent with daughter in way be very dear to now there have come trouble robbed life of sweetness must go back to grandeur of wife reject tenderness of daughter during day at trafford made very unpleasant to devoted friend who have always be so true to interest when battle about correspondence be explained to by wife of course became necessary to to give order to daughter matter must hardly be passed over in silence though probably might have done so have not be instigated to action by marchioness fanny said have be shocked by letter only wrote one papa well one two came only have one papa made two there must have be letter at do think proper that young lady must correspond with with gentleman in opposition to wish of father mother know papa seemed to so weak that marquis took heart of grace made oration felt that a father be bound to utter upon entire question for after be not letter be of importance resolute feeling have given birth to letter dear be most unfortunate affair paused for reply lady france felt that assertion be one to at present moment must make reply be know quite out of question that must marry young man so altogether unfitted for in point of station a young man will papa fanny can do such thing certainly will may be very long time first certainly will unless die be wicked of dear to talk of dying in way what mean be that however long may live will consider engaged to mr roden have behaved very very badly have made way into house under false pretence came a hampstead friend be very foolish of hampstead to bring very foolish post office clerk mr vivian be clerk in foreign office why must one office be same a be very different mr vivian must think of thing understands nature of thing know own position there be conceit about other man man must be conceited papa nobody will think well of unless think well of came to in park lane what mr roden yes came did see mr greenwood saw what must mr greenwood say to mr greenwood must tell to leave house did so there be nothing more to tell now dear let there be more about if will put on hat will go out walk down to village to

be instigated by vile ambition be afraid lest own position must be tarnished by inferior marriage on part there must be something noble in killing for sake of dear little fred must be getting something for who of course be most dear to other be meanest vanity will not stand conversation took place early in october when have be week at trafford park hampstead have come gone a be wont never remaining there above two three day at time lord kingsbury who be ill at ease have run hither about country looking after other property staying for day two with other friend marchioness have declined to invite friend to house declaring to husband that family be made unfit for gaiety by wicked conduct of eldest daughter there be attempt at shooting pheasant even preparing to shoot so great be general depression mr greenwood be there be thrown into very close intercourse with ladyship fully sympathized with ladyship although have always agreed with marquis a have not forgotten to tell george roden during interview in london in regard to lordship early political tenet nevertheless mind be so constituted that be quite at one with ladyship a to disgraceful horror of low association for noble family not only did sympathize a to abomination of post office clerk sympathized also fully a to positive unfitness lord hampstead displayed for station in life to have be called mr greenwood must sigh wheeze groan when future prospect of house of trafford be discussed between ladyship might be might not be well so kindly put in talking to marchioness that nobleman must indulge with liberal politics be dreadful to think that heir to great title must condescend to opinion worthy of radical tailor for mr greenwood agreed with lord hampstead about tailor lord hampstead seemed to to be matter simply for sorrow not for action nothing thought must be done in regard to lord hampstead time time destroys also cure so many thing must no doubt have effect so that lord hampstead might in fulness of year live to be a staunch supporter of class a duke marquis living perhaps perhaps might be that lord must take mr greenwood saw that remark be more to purpose at once went to work with peerage found score of case in within century second brother have risen to title seemed indeed to be case that peculiar mortality attached to eldest son of peer be comforting there be not in so much ground for positive action a at present moment existed in regard to lady france on matter there be complete unison of spirit between two friend mr greenwood have seen objectionable young man must say how thoroughly objectionable be at point how vulgar flippant ignorant impudent exactly what clerk in post office might be expected to be severity according to mr greenwood must be justified in keeping two young person apart gradually mr greenwood learnt to talk of female young person with very little of respect showed to other member of family in way ladyship came to regard lady france a though be not lady france at a though be distant fanny trafford girl of bad taste evil conduct who have unfortunately be brought into family on ground of mistaken charity thing have so gone on at trafford that trafford have hardly be preferable to koenigsgraaf indeed at koenigsgraaf there have be no mr greenwood mr greenwood have certainly added much to annoyance poor lady france be made to bear in condition of thing have written to brother begging to come to have come thus have taken place conversation have be given above on same day hampstead saw father discussed matter with matter a will be seen others also what on earth do wish to do about asked marquis let come live with at hendon if will let have house will take rest upon keep establishment of own why not if found must afford 'd give up hunting stick to yacht be about money said marquis shaking head ladyship never liked hendon for herself be about house might have house welcome how can give up charge over sister just when know that be disposed to do just what ought not wo be bit more likely to do there than here said brother must be quite close to may take for granted sir that two person must be more thoroughly guided by sense of duty than sister george roden did show duty when allowed to be engaged to man like without saying word to of family told ladyship a soon a occurred must not have allowed to have occurred at be nonsense talking like that can not mean to say that girl a sister be entitled to do what like with without consulting of family even to accepting such man a for lover hardly know said hampstead thoughtfully ought to know know everybody know be nonsense talking like doubt whether people do know said hampstead be twenty one a far a law go might believe walk out of house marry man plea to morrow a father have authority over here indignant father jumped up from chair son went on with speech a though determined not to be interrupted except what may come to by good feeling else from fact that be dependent on for maintenance good g shouted marquis think be about truth of young lady do subject to authority of parent from feeling from love from dependence a far a understand in matter be not legally subject beyond certain age 'd talk hind leg off dog wish must one may say few word without being so eloquent a if such be case be not sure that fanny have be morally wrong may have be foolish think have be because feel that marriage be not suitable for noblesse oblige said marquis putting hand upon bosom doubt nobility may be nature imposes bond on if bond be not obeyed then nobility cease deny that nobility can bind to conduct believe to be wrong who have said that doe nobility continued son not regarding father question can not bind to do others think to be right if approve what on earth be driving at imply that because belong to certain order sister be bound to practice of life order regard with favour deny on behalf own did make eldest son of english peer do acknowledge that a very much have be given to in way of education of social advantage even of money higher line of conduct be justly demanded from than from who have be le gifted so far noblesse oblige before undertake duty thus imposed upon must find out what be that higher line of conduct fanny must do same in marrying george roden must do better according to maxim than in giving to noodle of lord who from first to last will have nothing to be proud of beyond acre title marquis have be walking about room impatiently while didactic son be struggling to explain own theory a to word noblesse oblige nothing must so plainly express feeling of marquis on occasion a illustration of a to dog hind leg be little ashamed of did not dare to use twice on same occasion fretted fumed must have stopped hampstead have be possible hampstead be irrepressible when have become warm on own theme father knew that must listen on to bitter end wo have go to hendon at said when son have finished then will understand little of nature of mine roden will not come near there can hardly be sure that will not do so here here fanny will feel that be being treated a enemy have right to say so there will know that have done much to promote happiness will give assurance that will see write to have promised a much to can trust why must be so anxious to leave natural home because said hampstead boldly have lost natural mother marquis frowned awfully at hearing have not word to say against stepmother a to myself will not accuse of anything a to fanny except thoroughly misunderstand other must see sir marquis have seen very thoroughly mr greenwood have taken upon to speak to be think very impertinent never authorized did ladyship doubt authorized end of be that fanny be watched of course will not bear continuation of such misery why must will be better that must come to than be driven to go off with lover before week be over marquis have yielded hendon hall be to be given up altogether to lord hampstead sister be to be allowed to live with a mistress of house be to come in course of next month remain there at rate till spring there must be difficulty about hunting doubt that hampstead if necessary be prepared to abandon for season thought that perhaps might be able to run down twice week to vale of aylesbury going across from hendon to willesden junction must at rate make sister comfort first object of life must take care that in doing so george roden must be excluded altogether from arrangement marchioness be paralyzed when heard that lady france be to be taken away to be taken into direct neighbourhood of london post office very many word said to husband often marquis vacillated when once promise be given lady france be strong enough to demand fulfilment be on occasion that marchioness first allowed to speak to mr greenwood with absolute disapproval of husband to hendon hall said mr greenwood holding up hand with surprise when project be explained yes indeed doe seem to to be most most improper sort of thing to do can walk over there day a soon a have got rid of letter mr greenwood probably thought that george roden be sent about with post office bag of course will meet fear so lady kingsbury hampstead will arrange for said clergyman a though be bound on behalf of family to repudiate idea be so damnatory to honour be just what will do why else must want to have there with idea must think best thing must do utterly to degrade have idea of honour of brother how must when be so anxious to sacrifice own sister a for of course must do anything to break heart know that be anxious for father name therefore must disgrace in way be possible that marquis must consent be what can not understand said mr greenwood there must be something in mr greenwood mean to keep from marquis ca intend to give to young man understand understand at said marchioness did seem so firm about a for girl herself will never see again after have left house in such fashion to tell truth never wish to see hampstead again be plotting against if there be anything hate be plot in way mr greenwood marchioness became bound together in great disapproval of lady france love chapter xi lady persiflage hampstead rushed up to hendon almost without seeing stepmother intent on making preparation for sister then before october be over rushed back to fetch be very great at rushing never begrudging personal trouble in what undertook to do when left house hardly spoke to ladyship when took lady france away be of course bound to bid adieu think said that france will be happy with at hendon have nothing to do with literally nothing said marchioness with sternest frown wash hand of whole concern be sure must be glad that must be happy be impossible that one must be happy who misconduct that think be true be certainly true with misconduct such a quite agree with what said first question remains a to what be misconduct now will not hear hampstead not word can persuade father dare say can not persuade have divorced from heart for ever be sorry for be bound to say that be doing same be better in case to be plain oh certainly not to be irrational be not irrational be most improper for to speak to in way well good bye have doubt will come right of day said hampstead a took leave then carried sister off to hendon previous to there have be great deal of unpleasantness in house from moment in lady kingsbury have heard that stepdaughter be to go to brother have refused even to speak to unfortunate girl a far a be possible put husband also into coventry held daily consultation with mr greenwood spent most of hour in embracing coddling spoiling three unfortunate young nobleman who be being so cruelly injured by brother sister one of keenest pang be in seeing how boisterously three bairn romped with jack even after have dismissed from own good grace a utterly unworthy of regard night positively brought lord gregory down into drawing room in night shirt having dragged little urchin out of cot a one might do who be on peculiar term of friendship with mother lord gregory be in elysium mother tore child from sinner arm carried back in anger to nursery nothing doe child so much good a disturbing in sleep said lord hampstead turning to father anger of marchioness be too serious thing to allow of joke from time forth for evermore be child of mine said lady kingsbury next morning to husband a soon a carriage have taken two sinner away from door be very wrong to say that be child must be child have divorced from heart also lord hampstead how can be otherwise when be in rebellion against now there will be disgraceful marriage must wish must receive post office clerk here a son in law there wo be disgraceful marriage said marquis at least what mean be that will be much le likely at hendon than here le likely than here here must have be impossible there will be together such thing said marquis hampstead will see to too have promised pshaw exclaimed marchioness wo have say pshaw to when tell fanny always have kept word to in least doubt have remained here treatment must have induced to run away with at first word lord kingsbury said offended lady have always done duty by child of first marriage a mother must do have found to be violent altogether unaware of duty position must impose upon be only yesterday that lord hampstead presumed to call irrational have borne great deal from can bear more wish must have found one better able to control conduct then with stately step stalked out of room under circumstance house be not comfortable to of inhabitant a soon a ladyship have reached own apartment after rough interview seated at table commenced letter to sister lady persiflage in proceeded to give detailed account of trouble suffering lady persiflage who be by year two younger of two filled higher position in society than of marchioness be wife only of earl earl be knight of garter lord lieutenant of county at present moment secretary of state for home department marquis have risen to such honour a lord persiflage be peculiar man nobody quite knew of what great gift consisted be acknowledged of that be astute diplomat that honour of england be safe in hand that more perfect courtier ever gave advice to well satisfied sovereign be beautiful to look at with soft grey hair bright eye well cut feature be much of dandy though be known to be nearer seventy than sixty year of age maintained appearance of almost green juvenility active be not learned eloquent knew how to hold own have held for many year have married wife when be very young have become first distinguished beauty then leader of fashion sister marchioness have be past thirty when married have never be quite so much in world eye a sister lady persiflage lady persiflage be mother of husband heir young lord hautboy eldest son be now just of age lady kingsbury looked upon a that heir to earldom ought to be mother too be proud of for be beautiful a young phoebus earl father be not always a well pleased because son have already achieved knack of spending money persiflage estate be somewhat encumbered there seemed to be probability lord hautboy might create further trouble such be family to whom collectively marchioness looked for support in unhappiness letter wrote to sister on present occasion be a follows trafford park saturday october th dear geraldine take up pen to write to with heart laden with trouble thing have become so bad with that know where to turn unless can give comfort be beginning to feel how terrible be to have undertaken position of mother to person child god know have endeavoured to do duty have be in vain everything be over now have divided for ever from hampstead from fanny have felt compelled to tell father have divorced from heart have told lord hampstead same will understand how terrible must have be occasion when found compelled to take step a know how dreadfully shocked be when first revealed to fact that have promised to marry post office clerk young man have actually impudence to call on lord kingsbury in london to offer a son in law kingsbury very properly must not see instructed mr greenwood to do so mr greenwood have behaved very well in matter be great comfort to hope may be able to do something for day viler more ill conditioned young man say that never saw insolent too talking a though have a much right to ask for fanny hand a though be one of same class a for that must deserve nothing better than to be married to man be not that world must know how closely be connected with own darling boy then took off to koenigsgraaf time a have with must write letter to wretch contrived to receive one did stop can not conceive what life led of course have felt from first that must be divided from brother because one never know how early bad moral may be inculcated then papa came hampstead who in have encouraged sister young man be friend after who will say that nobleman ought to call what call liberal then came home what do think have happened hampstead have taken sister to live with at hendon next door a may say to post office clerk where young man have made thoroughly at home kingsbury have permitted oh geraldine be worst of be not justified in declaring have divorced from heart can hardly feel a do whose son fill so well that position eldest son ought to fill here be with darling not only under shade with disgrace before will never be able altogether to get rid of can divorce hampstead sister from heart will still be in sort brother sister to poor boy how be to teach to respect elder brother who suppose must in course of time become head of house when be hand glove with dreadful young man such a be not justified in declaring that communication will be kept up between two family if marries man will of course drop name yet world will know because of title a for be afraid that there be hope although be odd that second son doe so very often come to title if look into will find that second brother have almost better chance than elder although be sure that nothing of kind will ever happen to dear hautboy know how to live in state of life to have pleased god to call do write to at once tell ought to do with due regard to position to have be called upon to fill in world most affectionate sister clara kingsbury p do remember poor mr greenwood if lord persiflage must know how to do something for clergyman be getting old kingsbury have never be able to do anything for hope liberal never will be able to do anything for anybody think mr greenwood must be fit for duty because have be idle life be now fond of good living deanery must just suit after interval of fortnight lady kingsbury received reply from sister reader may a well see at once castle hautboy november th dear clara know that there be anything further to be done about fanny a for divorcing from heart suppose that amount to much advise to keep on good term with hampstead because if anything be to happen be always well for dowager to be friend with heir if fanny will marry man must lady di peacocke married mr billyboy who be clerk in one of office made assistant secretary now live in portugal street do very well see lady diana about everywhere mr billyboy ca keep carriage for that of course be look out a to what say about second son succeeding think of must get into bad frame of mind make hate very person upon whom will probably have to depend for much of comfort think must take thing easier above trouble husband be sure must make very unpleasant if be driven too far persiflage have clerical patronage whatever must not interfere about dean bishop for world suppose must appoint chaplain to embassy clergyman seems to be too old too idle for affectionate sister geraldine persiflage letter brought very little comfort to distracted marchioness there be much in so cold that offended deeply for moment prompted almost to divorce also lady persiflage from heart lady persiflage seemed to think that fanny must be absolutely encouraged to marry post office clerk because at past period lady diana who at time be near fifty have married clerk also might be that lady diana must have run away with groom must be reason why so monstrous crime must be repeated then in letter there be so absolute absence of affectionate regard for own child have spoken with great love of lord hautboy then lord hautboy be acknowledged heir whereas own child be nobody in there lay sting then felt to have be rebuked because have hinted at possibility of lord hampstead departure for better world lord hampstead be mortal a well a others why must not death be contemplated especially a must confer so great benefit on world at large sister letter persuaded of nothing divorce must remain a complete a ever must not condescend to think of future advantage might accrue to from intimacy with stepson dower have be regularly settled duty be to own child secondly to husband if must succeed in turning against two wicked elder child then must omit to hing might render life pleasant to such be resolution formed on receipt of sister letter about time lord kingsbury found necessary to say few word to mr greenwood there have not of late be much expression of kindness from marquis to clergyman since return from germany lordship have be either taciturn cross mr greenwood took very much to heart for though be most anxious to assure to friendship of marchioness did not at wish to neglect marquis be in truth on marquis that depended for everything that have in world marquis must send out of house to morrow if house be closed to none other a far a knew must be open to except union have lived delicately life luxuriously fruitlessly a regarded gathering of honey for future want small scrap of preferment might have come in way have be rejected a having be joined with too much of labour too little of emolument have gone on hoping that so great man a marquis must be able to do something for thinking that might at rate fasten patron closely to by bond of affection have be in day before coming of present marchioness at first have not created special difficulty for did not at once attempt to overthrow settled politics of family mr greenwood have be allowed to be blandly liberal during last year two great management have be necessary by degree have found essential to fall into conservative view of ladyship extended simply to idea that cream of earth must be allowed to be cream of earth be difficult in same house to adhere to two political doctrine because holder of will require support at general meeting gradually marchioness have become exigeant marquis be becoming aware that be being thrown over feeling of anger be growing up in mind did not analyze when heard that clergyman have taken upon to lecture lady france for be thus read few word son have spoken to carried anger with for day two till at last found opportunity of explaining to culprit lady france will do very well where be said marquis in answer to expression of wish a to daughter comfort oh doubt be not sure that be fond of too much interference in such matter have interfered lord mean to find special fault on occasion hope not lord did speak to lady france when think might have be a well that must have held tongue have be instructed to see that young man in london exactly not to say anything to lady france have known ladyship so many year drive to say that have known too long mr greenwood felt to be very hard for what have said to lady france have in truth said under instruction that last speech a to having perhaps known young lady too long seemed to contain terrible threat be thus driven to fall back upon instruction ladyship seemed to think that perhaps word in season marquis felt to be cowardly be more inclined to be angry with old friend than if have stuck to former plea of old friendship will not have interference in house there be end of if wish to do anything for will tell be if please nothing more will be said about subject be disagreeable to have marquis said anything about lady france since went marchioness asked clergyman next morning how be to hold balance between if be to be questioned by side in way suppose have mentioned just mentioned name one day well rather think that doe not wish to be interrogated about ladyship dare say not be anxious to have back again that can not say lady kingsbury must think must be of course will be desirous to ascertain truth have be so unreasonable that hardly know how to speak to suppose tell rather think lordship will decline to speak about ladyship just at present of course be necessary must know now that have chosen to take off will not choose to live under same roof with again if lord kingsbury speaks to on subject must make understand that poor mr greenwood felt that there be thorny path before in might be very difficult to guard foot from prick then have to consider if there be to be two side in house strongly opposed to other with must be best for to take part house of marquis with comfort be open for influence of lord persiflage be very great whereas of marquis be next to nothing chapter xii castle hautboy 'd better ask old traffords down here for few week hampstead wo shoot can hunt with braeside harrier be answer made by lord persiflage to wife when be told by of divorce have taken place at trafford park of departure of lady france for hendon hampstead lady france be old traffords lord persiflage too be conservative politics be of very different order from entertained by sister in law be above man of world have be ambassador at st petersburg be now member of cabinet liked good thing of office have idea of quarrelling with radical because be radical cared very little a to opinion of guest if must make pleasant useful looked upon sister in law a old fool have idea of quarrelling with hampstead for sake if girl persisted in making bad match must take consequence great harm must come except to a to evil done to order did not affect lord persiflage at did not expect order to endure for ever order become worn out in time effete have abhorrence for anybody liked pleasant people liked to treat everything a joke liked labour of not unlaborious life to be minimised having given order about old traffords a called in reference to darling said nothing more on subject lady persiflage wrote note to dear fanny conveying invitation in three word received reply to effect that brother must be at castle hautboy before end of november hampstead must perhaps bring couple of horse must put up at livery stable at penrith how do do hampstead said persiflage when first met guest before dinner on day of arrival have got rid of everything yet question be supposed to refer to lord hampstead revolutionary tendency not quite so thoroughly a hope to do soon always think great comfort that in country blackguard be so considerate must own that do very little for yet never knock over head shoot at a do in russia germany france then passed on having said quite enough for one conversation so have gone off to hendon to live with brother said lady persiflage to niece yes indeed said lady fanny blushing at implied allusion to low born lover be contained in question lady persiflage have idea of saying word about lover of making in way unpleasant dare say will be very comfortable for said thought might be little lonely till got used to therefore asked to come down for week two house be full of people will be sure to find one know not word be said at castle hautboy a to terrible thing have occurred in trafford family young vivian be there half a said for ornament partly for pleasure partly

unnaturally proud of high destiny a alliance have already be advertised in newspaper be not unwilling to talk about lady france be not exactly cousin stood in place of cousin therefore be regarded a

train to care for nothing be not a costly a unlimited expenditure can make thus come about that real love of sport be crushed under desire for fashion man will be almost ashamed to confess that hunt in essex sussex because proper thing be to go down to shire grass doubt be better than ploughed land to ride upon taking together virtue vice of hunting county doubt whether better sport be not to be

time be soon known that lord hampstead be lord hampstead be welcomed by field what matter that be revolutionary radical if must ride to hound at rate be son of marquis be not left to solitude

mr amblethwaite know have mine just at time of year where do think hound ran fox to last friday found outside of lowther wood near village of clifton took straight over shap fell then turning sharp to right went along hawes wall over high street into troutbeck be among mountain said hampstead mountain must think so have to spend half time among mountain must ride over high street must ride not there have to make way round of of went on foot dick never lost sight of hound whole day dick be boy who rode ragged pony when found there be with hound around fox brush stuck in cap how did get home night asked hampstead home did get home at be pitch dark before got rest of hound together of did find till next day have to go sleep at bowness thought very lucky to get bed then have to ride home next day over kirkstone fell be what call something like work for man horse there be fox in there lord do hear then mr amblethwaite bustled away to assist at duty of getting fox to break be glad to see that be fond of kind of thing lord said voice in hampstead ear though have only heard once well remembered be crocker guest at dinner party crocker post office clerk yes said lord hampstead be very fond of kind of thing fox have broken think at other side of cover then trotted off down little lane between two loose built wall so narrow that there be space for two men to ride abreast object at moment be to escape crocker rather than to look after hound be in wild country not exactly on mountain side among hill not far off grew into mountain where cultivation of rudest kind be just beginning to effect domination over human nature there be long spinney rather than wood stretching down bottom through brook ran must now cease then renew so that tree though not absolutely continuous be nearly so for distance of mile ground on side be rough with big stone steep in place a went down hill still be such that horseman must gallop on fox made way along whole length then traversing so a to avoid hound ran ring up hillside back into spinney again among horseman many declared that brute must be killed unless must make up mind for fair start mr amblethwaite be very busy hunting hound intent rather on killing fox fairly than on hope of run perhaps be not desirous of sleeping out night on far side of helvellyn in way sportsman galloped up down side of wood till feeling arose a doe on such occasion that might be well for man to stand still awhile spare horse in regard to future necessity of day lord hampstead did a others be doing in moment crocker be by side crocker be riding animal father be wont to drive about country one well known in annals of braeside harrier be asserted of that fence be not made did not know how to creep over of jumping such a jumping be supposed to be in shire knew nothing be too bad hand at galloping with shambling half cantering trot have invented for must go along day not very quickly in such fashion a never to be left altogether behind be flea bitten horse if reader know what be flea bitten roan white covered with small red spot horse of colour be ugly to look at be very seldom bad animal such a be crocker who did not ride much when up in london be very proud of crocker be dressed in green coat in moment of extravagance have have made for hunting in brown breech in delighted to display on possible occasion lord said 'd hardly think believe horse to be best hunter in cumberland be indeed horse of course must be best why not yours there be nothing ca hing jumping be mi raculous a for pace 'd be quite surprised be at again now what echo do make among hill indeed did now then master must just touch horn giving short blast just note then sound must come back first from rock then from other hound a heard must open a though encouraged by music of hill then voice must be carried round valley come back again again from steep place must become louder louder a though delighted with effect of own effort though there must be hunting concert be enough to repay man for trouble in coming there yes said lord hampstead disgust at man having be quenched for moment by charm of music be wonderful spot for echo be what call awfully nice have anything like up at st martin le grand perhaps may be necessary to explain that post office in london stand in spot bearing poetic name remember echo there said lord hampstead indeed yet hunting yet hound be there lord same be not bad sort of place very respectable public establishment said lord hampstead just so lord be just what always say ai swell like downing street be deal more respectable than custom house be did know oh yes admit that ask roden else on hearing name lord hampstead began to move horse crocker be at side must not be shaken off have heard from lord since have be down in part not word dare say think more of writing to correspondent of fairer sex be unbearable though fox have again turned gone up valley movement seemed to threaten instant death to preclude hope of run from spot hampstead felt compelled to escape if must in anger touched horse with spur galloped away among rock a though object be to assist mr amblethwaite in almost frantic effort crocker cared nothing for stone where lord went went having made acquaintance with lord be not going to waste blessing providence have vouchsafed to will never leave place alive lord dare say not again persecuted nobleman rode on thinking that must crocker if must have will by way a be talking of roden have be talking about at crocker caught tone of anger stared at companion 'd rather not talk about lord hope there have be nothing like quarrel for lady sake hope there be misunderstanding mr crocker said very slowly be customary at moment fox broke hound be away mr amblethwaite be seen rushing down hill side a though determined on breaking neck lord hampstead rushed after at pace for time defied mr crocker became thoroughly ashamed of in even attempting to make man understand that be sinning against good taste must not do so without implied mention of sister to allude to sister in connection with man be profanation must only escape from brute be punishment be doomed to bear for being a stepmother be wont to say untrue to order in mean time hound went at great pace down hill of old stager who knew country well made wide sweep round to left whence by lane track be known to must make way down to road lead along ulleswater to patterdale in doing might probably not see hound again that day such be charm of hunting in hilly country rode mile around though did again see hound did not see hunt to have seen hound a start to see again a be clustering round huntsman after eating fox be great deal to men on occasion be hampstead lot crocker to do much more than though have started down steep valley down side rather of gully be not making way out from among hill into low country fox soon went up again not back over intervening spur of mountain towards lake riding seemed sometimes to hampstead to be impossible mr amblethwaite did stuck to mr amblethwaite must have be very well have not crocker stuck to if old roan must only tumble among stone what escape there must be old roan be true to character to give one due post office clerk rode a well a lord there be nearly hour half of before hound ran into fox just a be gaining earth among bush holly with airey force be surrounded then on sloping meadow just above waterfall john peel of hunt dragged out fox from among tree having dismembered artistically gave to hungry hound then be that perhaps dozen diligent cautious huntsman came up heard detail of race be afterwards able to give a on own authority to others who have be a cautious not so diligent a one of best thing ever saw in country said crocker who have never seen hound in other country at moment have ridden up alongside of hampstead on way back to penrith master hound crocker must go way hampstead must turn off at pooley bridge still there be four mile during must be subjected to tormentor yes indeed very good thing a be saying mr amblethwaite chapter xiv coming home from hunting lord hampstead have be discussing with mr amblethwaite difficult nature of hunting in such county a cumberland hound be in road before with john peel in midst of dick with ragged pony be behind looking after straggler together with lord hampstead master be hard riding rough weather beaten half gentleman half farmer named patterson who lived few mile beyond penrith be amblethwaite right hand in regard to hunting just a crocker joined road have become narrow young lord have fallen little behind crocker have seized opportunity lord also seized thrust in between mr patterson master be true said master of course presume to do thing a swell do down in shire have money have country have fox know whether for hunting see a much of a do quite a much if may take to day a sample very ordinary be amblethwaite asked patterson who be quite determined to make most of own good thing be not bad to day hound never left scent after found think hillside carry scent better than grass if want to ride of course be rough if like hunting mind scramble perhaps may see here a well a elsewhere better deal from hear tell said patterson did ever hear music like in leicestershire lord know that ever did said hampstead enjoyed amazingly hope will come again said master often certainly if remain here knew lordship must like said crocker crowding in on spot where be possible for four to ride abreast think be quite extraordinary to see how stranger like lordship got over country clever little 'orse lordship on said patterson be man more than beast think said crocker trying to flatter best man in england said patterson ca ride to hound without tidy animal under yet ca best horse in england stick to hound without good man on top of said determined crocker patterson grunted hating flattery remembering that man flattered be lord then road became narrow again hampstead fell little behind crocker be alongside of in moment there seemed to be something mean in running away from man something at rate absurd in seeming to run away from hampstead be ashamed in allowing to be so much annoyed by such cause have already snubbed man man might probably be now silent on one subject be so peculiarly offensive suppose said beginning conversation must show that be willing to discus general matter with mr crocker that country north west of penrith be le hilly than oh yes lord delightful country to ride over in part be roden fond of following hound lord in least know said hampstead curtly then made attempt hound go a far north a carlisle oh lord never more than eight ten mile from penrith have pack up in country nothing like ours still do show sport must have thought now roden must have be just man to ride to hound if got opportunity think ever saw hound in life be rather in hurry think will trot on be in hurry said crocker will be happy to show lordship way be above quarter of mile difference to going by pooley bridge instead of dallmaine pray do anything of kind can find road whereupon hampstead shook hand cordially with master bade mr patterson good bye with kindly smile trotted on beyond hound a quickly a must crocker be not to be shaken off flea bitten roan be a good at end of day a be at beginning trotted on gallantly when have gone quarter of mile hampstead acknowledged to that be beyond power to shake off foe by time crocker have made good position close alongside of lord with horse head even with of other there be word lord want to say to crocker muttered somewhat piteously so hampstead heart be for moment softened towards checked horse prepared to listen hope have given offence can assure lord have intended have so much respect for lordship must do for world what be to do have be offended have intended to show that be offended yet did not like to declare a much openly object have be to stop man from talking to do so if possible without making reference to subject in question be now to declare offended must hardly do so without making allusion to sister have determined that must make such allusion now a man appealed to asking a be forgiveness for fault of be not conscious be impossible to refrain from making answer right said be sure did mean anything let drop there will be end of oh certainly be sure be very much obliged to lordship quite know what be that ought to be dropped a be so intimate with roden sitting at same desk with day of life did seem natural to speak to lordship about be true a have happened that crocker who a well a roden be post office clerk have appeared a guest at castle hautboy have be natural that must speak of office companion to man who be notoriously that companion friend hampstead did not quite believe in pretended intimacy having heard roden declare that have not a yet formed peculiar friendship at office have too felt unconsciously that one a roden ought not to be intimate with one a crocker there be cause of offence in be natural said then be unhappy when thought from what said that there have be quarrel there have be quarrel said hampstead be very glad indeed to hear that be beginning to touch again on matter must have be private what be to whether there be quarrel between lord hampstead roden hampstead therefore again rode on in silence must have be so very sorry that anything must have occurred to interfere with friend brilliant prospect lord hampstead looked about to see whether there be spot at must make escape by jumping over fence on right hand there be lake rippling up on to edge of road on left be high stone wall without vestige of aperture through a far a eye must reach be already making pace a fast a must be aware that escape must be effected in manner shook head bit handle of whip looked straight away before through horse ear can not think how proud have be that gentleman sitting at same desk with must have be so fortunate in matrimonial prospect think honour to post office round mr crocker said lord hampstead pulling up horse suddenly standing still upon spot if will remain here for five minute will ride on if will ride on will remain here till be out of sight must insist that one of arrangement be made lord will be now have offended again talk of offence just do a bid want to be alone be about matrimonial alliance demanded crocker almost in tear thereupon lord hampstead turned horse round trotted back towards hound horseman whom heard on road behind crocker paused moment trying to discover by light of own intellect what might have be cause of singular conduct on part of young nobleman then having failed to throw light on matter rode on homewards immersed in deep thought hampstead when found again with late companion asked idle question a to hunting arrangement of next week that be idle be quite aware having resolved that must not willingly put into position in might be probable that must again meet that objectionable young man went on with question listening not listening to mr amblethwaite answer till parted company with companion in neighbourhood of pooley bridge then rode alone to hautboy castle with mind much harassed by what have occurred seemed to to have be almost proved that george roden must have spoken to man of intended marriage in that man have said have suggested that information have come direct from fellow clerk have seemed to declare hampstead thought that have declared that roden have often discussed marriage with if so how base must have be friend conduct how thoroughly must have be mistaken in friend character how egregiously wrong must sister have be in estimate of man for a long a question have be simply one of own intimacy with companion whose outside position in world have be inferior to own have be proud of what have done have answered who have remonstrated with with spirit showing that despised practice quite a much a must ridicule have explained to father own idea of friendship have be eager in showing that george roden company be superior to most young men of own position there have be hautboy scatterdash lord plunge young earl of longoolds of elder son whom described a young men without serious thought in head what be to how roden got bread so long a got honestly man man for ' thus have defended be quite conscious that be right when roden have suddenly fallen in love with sister sister have a suddenly fallen in love with roden then have begun to doubt thing be in meritorious might become dangerous objectionable by reason of other thing must bring in train felt for time that association be good for might not be so good for sister there seemed to be sanctity about rank did not attach to own have thought that post office clerk be a good a must not assure that be a good a lady of family then have begun to reason with on subject a did on what be there different in girl nature ought to make fastidious a to society felt to be good enough for in entertaining feeling have be strong within a to feminine sanctity be not giving way to one of empty prejudice of world in opposition to have resolved to make life long fight so have reasoned with reason though affected conduct did not reach taste irked to think there must be marriage though be strong in resolution to uphold sister if necessary to defend have not given way a to marriage have be settled between sister father that there must be meeting of lover at hendon hall did hope that engagement might die away though be determined to cling to even though clung to lover be state of mind when hideous young man who seemed to have be created with object of showing how low creature post office clerk must be came across almost convinced that other post office clerk have be boasting among official associate of favour of high born lady who have unfortunately become attached to must stick to politics to radical theory to old idea about social matter generally be almost tempted to declare to that woman for present ought to be regarded a exempt from radical change must be good for men for order be vanity delusion for sister must still be held a containing bond in frame of mind determined that must return to hendon hall almost immediately further hope of hunting with braeside harrier there be none be necessary for to see roden a soon a possible that evening at castle lady amaldina got hold of asked advice a to future duty a married woman lady amaldina be very fond of little confidence a to future life have a yet found opportunity of demanding sympathy of cousin hampstead be not in truth cousin called other cousin be called so none of hauteville family felt of aversion to radicalism of heir to marquisate

strict tenet of sect thou ing thee ing whom addressed have assented to omission in matter on part of daughter recognizing fact that there must be falsehood in using mode of language common to world if plural pronoun of ignoble sound so said be used commonly for singular because singular be too grand authoritative for ordinary use be doubt pity that language must be so injured there must be untruth in such usage be better that at rate young must adhere to manner of speech be common among with whom lived thus marion be saved from thees thou escaped that touch of hypocrisy seems to permeate now antiquated speech of quaker zachary fay in latter year of life be never known to laugh to joke if circumstance be favourable must sometimes fall into quaint mode of conversation in there be something of drollery something also of sarcasm be unfrequent a zachary be slow in making new friend never conversed after fashion with mere acquaintance of hour of marion fay appearance something have already be said enough perhaps not to impress clear idea of figure on mind eye of reader for regard a feat beyond power of writer to enable reader to form conception of own be small of stature must be said

vincent have also come to know marion approving of girl religious tendency have invited to spend two three day at wimbledon be impossible because marion must never leave father have once twice gone over with mr roden when made weekly call have certainly ingratiated with austere lady other society have none did seem to desire clara demijohn seeing intimacy have be struck up between marion mr roden a to have own little jealousy to endure be quite sure that marion be setting cap at post office clerk have declared in confidence to mr duffer that girl be doing in most brazen faced manner clara have herself on more than one occasion contrived to throw in clerk way on return homewards on dusky evening perhaps intent only on knowing what might be young man intention a to marion young man have be courteous to have declared to mr duffer that be one of stiff young men who care for lady society be said mr duffer who marry readiest make best husband oh will go on sticking to till leave stone unturned said clara thereby implying that a far a be concerned did not think worth while to continue attack unless young man must give way to at once george have be asked more than once to drink

office said to mr duffer call downright unfeminine audacity yet knew that mr duffer knew that have intercepted young man mr duffer took all in good part knowing very well how necessary be that young woman must fight own battle strenuously in mean time marion fay george roden be good friend be engaged must not say to whom mr roden have said to young friend will fear be long long tedious affair must not speak of if be true to hope will be true to said marion with true feminine excitement only fear that will be too true can not be even though suffer let be true may be sure will not mention to to one like so well that do hope may not suffer much from that time found able to regard george roden a real friend to talk to a though there need be cause for dreading intimacy with engaged man girl may suffer to be intimate chapter xvi walk back to hendon be here little early said hampstead when friend came in found mother just going to church with friend marion fay yes miss fay be daughter of quaker who life few door off though be quaker go to church a well envy tone of mind of who be able to find comfort in pouring out in gratitude to great unknown god pour out in gratitude said hampstead with be affair of solitude doubt whether ever hold for two hour in commune with heavenly power heavenly influence something more than gratitude be necessary must conceive that there be duty by non performance of must encounter peril then come feeling of safety always follows performance of duty that never can achieve what did think of marion fay be most lovely creature very pretty be not particularly when speaking never care for female beauty doe not display in action speaking moving laughing perhaps only frowning said hampstead enthusiastically be talking other day to sort of cousin of mine who have reputation of being remarkably handsome young woman have ever so much to say to when be in company with page in button kept coming into room be round faced high cheeked ugly boy thought so much better looking than cousin because opened mouth when spoke showed eagerness by eye cousin be complimented have made market so doe not signify greek seem to to have regarded form without expression doubt whether phidias must have done much with miss fay to eye be perfection of loveliness be not miss fay be mother friend mother be lucky woman without vanity without jealousy without envy where will find one mother woman a can think enjoy feminine loveliness almost a much a man have often heard mother speak of marion good quality not much of loveliness to great charm be voice speaks musically a one can fancy melpomene did doe come here often day fancy not generally when be here not what be great friend will sometimes go with into town on thursday morning on way to meeting house lucky fellow roden shrugged shoulder a though conscious that luck of kind must come to from quarter if came at what doe talk about religion generally anything else if will allow must wish to convert be not at anxious to convert really believing that be very well a be yes said hampstead be worst of what be apt to call advanced opinion with self assurance never dare to tamper with religious opinion of who be younger weaker than feel that at rate be safe if be in earnest one think have ever be put in danger by believing christ to be god none of know what believe said roden do men talk of belief a though be settled thing be so with few that only with who lack imagination what sort of time did have down at castle hautboy oh know pretty well everybody be very kind sister like scenery be lovely can look up long reach of ulleswater from castle terrace there be helvellyn in distance house be full of people who despised more than did be saying great deal perhaps there be uncommon ape one young lady not very young asked what meant to do with land in world when took away from everybody told that when be divided equally there must be nice little estate even for daughter in such circumstance son must certainly get married acknowledged that result must be excellent did not believe in world in men must want to marry be beyond comprehension went out hunting one day hunting must suppose be not very good for one drawback must have be very good indeed mountain must have thought must be one drawback lake not at liked mountain because of echo lake did not come in way where be fault there came man whom disliked who be bore must not shut up shake off did at last do be by turning round riding backwards when be coming home have just invited to ride on while stood still must did come to quite to actually turned tail ran away from not a ordinarily do in society when sneak off under pretence leaving pretender to think that have made very pleasant with full declaration of opinion intention who be be question hampstead have come there on purpose to say who man be to talk about man with great freedom be determined to do so preferred not to begin intended to be severe accusation against friend till be walking together did not wish to leave house without saying word further about marion fay be intention to dine alone at hendon hall how much nicer must be if must dine in paradise row with marion fay knew be mr roden custom to dine early after church on sunday so that two maiden who made up establishment might go out either to church to lover perhaps to a might best suit have dined there once twice already eating humble social leg of mutton of holloway in preference to varied solitary banquet of hendon be of opinion really intimate acquaintance demanded practice of social feeling to know man very well never to sit at table with be according to view of life altogether unsatisfactory though leg of mutton might be cold have other accompaniment common ill boiled potato yet must be better than banquet prepared simply for purpose of eating be gregarious now felt longing of be almost ashamed to be admitted to same pasture with marion fay there be not however slightest reason for supposing marion fay must dine at even be asked to do so nothing in fact must be le probable a marion fay never deserted father did like to give hint to friend that be desirous of further immediate intimacy with marion there must be absurdity in doing so did not dare to perpetrate only if must have passed morning in paradise row then have walked home with roden in dark evening must thought have said what have to say very conveniently be impossible sat silent for minute two after roden have asked name of bore of hunting field then answered by proposing that must start together on walk towards hendon be ready must tell name of dreadful man a soon a have started will have come here on purpose to tell to tell name of man ran away from in cumberland exactly come along so started more than hour before time at marion fay must return from church man who annoyed so out hunting be intimate friend of yours have not intimate friend in world except not marion fay meant among men suppose that marion fay be out hunting in cumberland must not have ran away from think if have be mr crocker of general post office crocker in cumberland certainly be in cumberland unless one personated met dining at castle hautboy when be kind enough to make known to again out hunting when did more than make known to be surprised be not away on leave oh yes be away on leave doubt that be why must not be in cumberland when a happens father be land steward something of sort to uncle persiflage because did not know that have connection with cumberland why not cumberland westmoreland northumberland may say why not yorkshire lincolnshire norfolk certainly did not suppose that post office clerk out on holiday must be found hunting in county have never heard of flea bitten horse not word did know that have ever sat upon horse now will let know why have called friend be not so by mean doe not sit at same desk with certainly doe think must be friend with man if sat at same desk with with crocker even asked roden well might be exception if exception to why not also exception to a happens crocker have made disagreeable to instead of being friend be will not say enemy because must be making too much of nearer to being so than one know now what be meaning of why did trouble especially down in cumberland why do call friend why do wish to speak to about introduced to told that be special friend then lied must not have cared about did more what more did do must have be courteous to if only because sat at same desk with what there be thing be difficult to be told if have to be told have better be told said roden almost angrily whether friend not knew of engagement with sister impossible told of said lord hampstead impetuously tongue now at length loosed told of spoke of again again to extreme disgust though thing have be fixed a fate must not have mentioned certainly not did nothing tell of happiness good luck rest of be impossible to stop so that have to ride away from bade be silent a plainly a must without mentioning fanny name be of use how did know told so said be not strictly case crocker have so introduced subject a to have avoided palpable lie of declaring that tidings have be absolutely given by roden to have not le falsely intended to convey impression to hampstead have conveyed gave to understand that be speaking about continually at office roden turned round looked at other man white with rage a though must not allow to utter word be a tell began at castle afterwards continued whenever must get near when hunting believed when repeated story so often what be to do knock off horse so be forced to speak of sister to one in hunt in county feel how much be due to girl name think do think that of men be most likely to feel what be due to name of lady france trafford of course never mentioned to one at post office from whom have heard how can answer probably through of own family have made way through lady kingsbury to castle hautboy have then be talked about be not responsible for not for certainly if be so because one a have lied must not have believed of be bound to ask be bound to tell must not have asked there be thing require asking what must do with nothing nothing can be done must not touch subject without alluding to sister be coming back to hendon in week be there before did not see her of course did not see how must simply by going there must not have seen there came black frown over roden brow a heard have be understood between father fanny that must not come to hendon while be living with must not have be party to agreement hardly think agreement must have be made whether assented not on other term must father have permitted to come be most desirable that must be separated from lady kingsbury oh yes therefore agreement be advisable must not have have on other term why not because think that such visiting must have be unwise be use blinking to believe that marriage be practicable do a of course can not be party to throwing together be to persist in coming must only force to find home for elsewhere have not disturbed have not now want to promise that will not have assured father that will be so will say that will come to at hendon hall write to while be staying with paused on road for answer roden walked on without making one hampstead be forced to accompany will promise will not promise will hing may possibly subject to be called liar have wish to knock at door at think to be welcome know how welcome must be at mine for might be must find forced to endeavour to see will therefore make promise man must fetter by assurance of kind a to conduct if man be drunkard may be well that must bind by vow against drinking who can rule own conduct must promise nothing good day now must be back to dinner with mother then took leave somewhat abruptly returned hampstead went on to hendon with thought sometimes fixed on sister sometimes on roden whom regarded a impracticable sometimes on horrid crocker more generally on marion fay whom resolved that must see again might be difficulty in way chapter xvii lord hampstead scheme during following week hampstead went down to gorse hall hunted two three day with various pack of hound within reach declaring to that after leicestershire be better than cumberland because be known there one must dare to treat a crocker have done never before have democratic spirit received shock rather remnant of aristocratic spirit have striven to quell by wisdom humanity of democracy that stranger must have dared to talk to about one of lady of family man certainly must do so in northamptonshire leicestershire must not quite explain to difference in locality be quite sure that be safe from anything of kind at gorse hall have other matter to think of a galloped about country how might best manage to see marion fay mind be set upon perhaps more dangerously still heart have be asked before must have said that there must have be nothing more easy than for such one a to make acquaintance with young lady in paradise row now when came to look at found that marion fay be environed with fortification chevaux de frise of difficulty be apparently impregnable must not call at simply ask for miss fay to do so must be proficient in impudence lack of created so many difficulty for thought of finding out quaker chapel in city there sitting out whole proceeding unless desired to leave place with quixotic idea of returning to holloway with in omnibus a looked at project round became sure that joint journey in omnibus must never be achieved then imagined that mr roden might perhaps give aid with what face must such one a ask one a mr roden to assist in enterprise yet if anything be to be done must be done through mr roden at rate through mr roden house a to too there be new difficulty have not actually quarrelled with george roden two have parted on road a though there be hitch in cordiality of friendship have be rebuked for having believed what crocker have told did acknowledge to that must not have believed though crocker lie have be monstrous must rather have supposed to be guilty even of lie so monstrous than have suspected friend of conduct must certainly have be base even added something to difficulty by marion fay be surrounded vivian be staying with at gorse hall will go up to london to morrow said a two of be riding home after hunting on saturday saturday after sunday on hampstead have be in paradise row to morrow be sunday day for travelling said vivian fitzwilliams be at lilford cross road on monday draw back towards kennel afternoon train up from peterborough at branch from oundle to meet have trap sent there be arranged by providence on monday evening go to gatcombe so that will fit need not be disturbed solitary sunday will enable to write official correspondence for fortnight must have done even in presence must be at home on monday morning give love to at lilford cross road will be down again before long if sister can spare perhaps may induce to come rough here for week two be a good a word travelled up to london thence across to hendon hall on sunday might have be said that young man must have have stronger inducement for clinging to sport fewer reason for abandoning stable be full of horse weather be good hunting have be excellent friend be around have nothing else to do sister intended to remain for yet week at castle hautboy hendon hall of have certainly no special attraction at end of november marion fay be on mind have arranged scheme scheme a far a knew must be a practicable on tuesday a on monday be impatient for nonce preferred marion fay whom probably must not find to fox must certainly be found in neighbourhood of lilford cross road be not much of scheme after must go over to paradise row call on mr roden must then explain to what have taken place between george leave sort of apology for offended post office clerk then must ask to come over dine with on day before sister return in what way marion fay name might be introduced how might be brought into arrangement must leave to chapter of accident on monday left home at about two o'clock making roundabout journey via baker street king cross islington went down to holloway by omnibus have become somewhat abashed perplexed a to visit to paradise row having learned to entertain notion that of people there looked at be hard thought that if have friend in other street must not be allowed to visit friend without creating attention be not aware of special existence of mr demijohn of clara of mr duffer did know from what window exactly eye of curious inhabitant be fixed upon be conscious that interest be taken in coming going a long a acquaintance in street be confined to inhabitant of did not very much signify though neighbour must become aware that be intimate with mr roden son need not care much about if must succeed in adding marion fay to number of holloway friend then thought inquisitive eye might be annoyance be on account that made way down in omnibus felt that there be something almost of hypocrisy in soft unpretending almost skulking manner in crept up paradise row a though walking there be really of moment to one a looked round after knocking at mr roden door saw figure of clara demijohn standing little back from parlour window of house opposite mr roden be at home said maid there be friend with nevertheless showed young lord up to drawing room there be friend indeed be mr vincent day for coming be in room that alone must not have be much with two elder lady be seated marion fay so far at rate fortune have favoured now there be difficulty in explaining purpose must not very well give general invitation general at rate a regarded marion fay before mr vincent of course there be introduction mr vincent who have often heard lord hampstead name in spite of general severity be open to allurement of nobility be glad to meet young man although have strong reason for believing that be not tower of strength on matter of faith hampstead marion fay shook hand a though be old friend then conversation naturally fell upon george roden did expect son hope said mother oh dear have message to leave for will do just a well in note be to extent unfortunate because made mr vincent marion feel that be in way think will send betsy down for brougham said former brougham brought mr vincent be always in habit of retiring round corner to duchess of edinburgh where driver have succeeded in creating for intimacy pray stir madam said hampstead for have perceived from certain preparation made by miss fay that must find necessary to follow mr vincent out of room will write two word for roden will tell have to say then elder lady went back to matter be discussing before lord hampstead have appeared be asking young lady said mr vincent to come with for two three day down to brighton be absolutely fact that have never seen brighton a mr vincent went to brighton twice annually for month at beginning of winter then again for fortnight in spring seemed to wonderful thing that one living even at holloway must never have seen place think must be very good thing said mr roden if father can spare never leave father said marion think lord said mr vincent that look a though wanted change authorized by lord hampstead took opportunity of gazing at marion be convinced that young lady wanted change at there be certainly no room for improvement occurred to on spur of moment that too might spend two three day at brighton that might find opportunity there easier than in paradise row yes indeed said change be always good never like to stay long in one place people must stay in one place said marion with smile father have to go to business must be very uncomfortable if there be one to give meal sit at table with must spare for day two said mr roden who knew that must be well for marion that must sometimes be out of london be sure that must not begrudge short recreation like said mr vincent never begrudges anything did go down to cowes for fortnight in april though be quite sure that papa must have preferred remaining at home time doe not believe in new fangled idea of changing air doe said mr vincent do know where live at wimbledon may be said to be more country than town if be to remain year without moving must become so low out of sort veritably believe must have to bury before first year be over father say that when be young be only people of rank fashion who went out of town regularly that folk lived a long then a do now think people get used to living dying according to circumstance said hampstead ancestor did great many thing regard a quite fatal drank water without filtering ate salt meat winter through did very little in washing way knew nothing of ventilation yet contrived to live marion fay however be obstinate declared purpose of declining mr vincent kind invitation there be good deal more said about because hampstead managed to make various proposition be very fond of sea said must take round including mr vincent mr roden in yacht if not to brighton at rate to cowes december be not exactly time for yachting a brighton must be reached in hour by railway be driven to abandon proposition with little laughter at own absurdity be done with gaiety kindness quite won mr vincent heart stayed considerably beyond accustomed hour to advantage of proprietor of duchess of edinburgh at last sent betsy down to corner in high good humour declare lord hampstead said ought to charge three sixpence before go will have to break into hour because have stayed talking to pritchard never let off if be not back punctually by four then took departure need go marion said mr roden unless lord hampstead have something special to say to lord hampstead declared that have nothing special to say marion did not go have something special to say said hampstead when elder lady be quite gone miss fay may know just a well a a be walking to hendon on sunday matter came up a to george did not agree there be quarrel hope said mother oh dear be best pleased with other therefore want to come dine with one day week will be engaged on saturday day before will do mr roden put on very serious look on receiving proposition having never before be invited to house of son friend for year past have dined out with acquaintance yet must not think at moment of reason why must not do so be going to ask miss fay to come with oh quite impossible said marion be very kind lord never go out do mr roden seems to reason why must begin of course understand about father must be delighted to make acquaintance if must bring rarely go out lord hampstead then will have le power to plead that be engaged what do say roden must give most unaffected pleasure like father miss fay too be unaccustomed to much going out a call be a peculiar a be let acknowledge that be peculiar people therefore there be more reason why must come together mr roden try to prevent arrangement will give greatest pleasure to there can not be real objection why must not mr fay make acquaintance with son friend day must suit best wednesday thursday friday at last be settled that at rate george roden must dine at hall on friday being absent during discussion time must be taken a to further acceptance of invitation mr roden be inclined to think that have best be regarded a impossible thought that have made up mind never to dine out again then there came across mind remembrance that son be engaged to marry young man sister that might be for welfare that must give way to overture of friendship when thought have travelled so far a might have felt sure that invitation must at last be accepted a to marion fay subject be allowed to drop without further decision have said that be impossible said nothing more be last dictum heard from be not repeated a must probably have be case have be quite sure that be impossible mr roden during interview did not allude to branch of subject again be fluttered with what have already be said little angry with herself that have so far yielded little perplexed at own too evident confusion little frightened at lord hampstead evident admiration of girl a to marion must of course be left to father a must question a to quaker have better be going said marion fay who be also confused so must said hampstead have to return round by london have ever so many thing to do in park lane worst of having two three house be that one never know where one clothes be good bye mr roden mind depend upon have set heart upon will let walk with a far a door miss fay be only three door off said marion in other direction nevertheless did go with to house though be only three door off tell father with compliment said that george roden can show way over if can get cab to bring across will send back in waggonette for matter of there be reason on earth why must not be sent for oh lord be think possible that must come pray do pray do pray do said a took hand when door at be opened a walked down street saw figure still standing at parlour window of on same evening clara demijohn be closeted with mr duffer at lodging at standing in street squeezing hand said mr duffer a though very hair of head be made to stand on end by tidings moral hair be of moral head head in flesh be ornamented by front must have prevented actual standing on end of hair be left to saw came out together from a loving a must be walked up with to own house then seized hand held oh for minute in street there be nothing quaker girl wo allow be so free with christian name that of course get into intimacy instantly never allow young man to call clara without leave asked given must think not one ca be too particular about one christian name have be in there together at for two hour what can mean old mr vincent be there went away suppose did like such doings what can lord be doing in place a asked clara coming so often know one have to be markiss be much more than lord one thing be quite certain ca mean that be going to marry marion fay with assurance clara demijohn comforted a best might chapter xviii how lived at trafford park there certainly be justification for ill humour lady kingsbury displayed to husband because hampstead sister have be invited down to castle hautboy people be own relation not husband if lady persiflage have taken upon to think better of evil thing done by child of first marchioness be not fault of marquis to thinking visit have be made in direct opposition to wish interest have be possible must have sent naughty young lord naughty young lady altogether to coventry a far a aristocratic association be concerned encouragement of at castle hautboy be in direct contravention of idea poor lord kingsbury have have nothing to do with be not fit to go to house a castle hautboy said marquis who be sitting alone in own morning room at trafford frowned angrily ladyship too be very angry have disgraced geraldine must not have received there be two cause for displeasure in in first place marquis must not endure that such hard thing must be said of elder child then by very nature of accusation made there be certain special honour paid to hauteville family did not think at to be due on many occasion wife have spoken a though sister have married into house of peculiar nobility because forsooth lord persiflage be in cabinet be supposed to have made figure in politics marquis be not at disposed to regard earl a in way bigger than be must have paid earl debt earl certainly must not do never have felt social gathering at castle hautboy be much more numerous than at trafford guest at castle hautboy be often people whom marquis must never have entertained wife pined for social influence sister be supposed to posse felt sympathy with wife in respect deny said father rising from chair scowling at wife a stood leaning upon table have not disgraced say have ladyship made assertion boldly having come into room prepared for battle determined if possible to be victor have not fanny disgraced in having engaged to low fellow scum of earth without saying anything even to about shouted marquis who be resolved to contradict wife in anything might say then know nothing of what becomes young woman continued marchioness

anything victor vulgarity of curse have restored to much of prestige so that be able to leave battlefield a one retiring with force in proper order have bothered own child damned own chaplain marquis sat awhile thinking alone then pulled string by communication be made between room that in clergyman sat be not vulgar bell must have be injurious to reverence dignity of clerical friend a savouring of menial task work be pipe for oral communication be undignified a requiring man to stoop put mouth to arrangement by light tap be made against wall so that inhabitant of room might know that be wanted without process derogatory to self respect chaplain obeyed summons lightly knocking at door again stood before lord found marquis standing upon hearth rug by a well knew be signified that be not intended to sit down mr greenwood said marquis in tone of voice be intended to be peculiarly mild at same time be felt to be menacing mean at present moment to have conversation with on subject to

interest at seven lord llwddythlw have comfort in thinking that must utilize two day idleness at trafford in composing studying speech on present state of affair though to be uttered at denbigh must doubt appear in london newspaper on following morning a be to be altogether lover meeting company be to be invited mr greenwood must of course be there to make up something of dinner party mayor of shrewsbury be asked for first evening with wife mayor be strong conservative politician lord llwddythlw must therefore be glad to meet for next day dinner clergyman of parish with wife daughter be secured chief drawback to festive arrangement consisted in fact that lady amaldina lover arrived on day of bitter quarrel between marquis wife perhaps however coming of guest be best relief can be afforded for misery of such domestic feud after such word a have be spoken lord lady trafford must hardly have sat down comfortably to dinner with one between mr greenwood in such case there must not have be much conversation now marquis must come bustling into drawing room to welcome wife niece before dinner without reference to discomfort of morning almost at same moment lord llwddythlw made appearance having arrived at latest possible moment having dressed in ten minute a there be one present family lady amaldina kissed future husband a might have kissed grandfather lordship received salutation a stern undemonstrative grandfather might have done then mr greenwood entered with mayor wife party be complete marquis took lady amaldina out to dinner lover sat next to mayor wife be on other side of table mr greenwood be between soup have not be handed round before lord llwddythlw be deep in question a to comparative merit of shropshire welsh lunatic asylum from moment till time at gentleman went to lady in drawing room conversation be altogether of practical nature a soon a lady have left table road asylum gave way to general politics a to marquis mr greenwood allowed conservative to have pretty much own way in drawing room conversation became rather heavy till at few minute after ten mayor observing that have drive before retired for night marchioness with lady amaldina followed quickly within five minute welsh lord having muttered something a to writing of letter be within seclusion of own bedroom not word of love have be spoken lady amaldina be satisfied on toilet table found little parcel addressed to by lordship containing locket with monogram l in diamond hour of midnight be long passed before lordship have reduced to word first half of promise of constitutional safety intended to make to conservative of denbigh not much be seen of lord llwddythlw after breakfast on following morning so determined be to do justice to noble cause have in hand after lunch little expedition be arranged for two lover busy politician allowed to be sent out for short drive with other companion than future bride have be quite intimate with must have given manuscript of speech occupied by saying to a lesson have a must not do recapitulated to engagement a though excusing own slowness a to matrimony declared what with property what with parliament never knew whether be standing on head heel when paused have done nothing towards naming certain day so lady amaldina found obliged to take matter into own hand when then do think will be asked put hand up rubbed head under hat a though subject be very distressing to must not for world know think be in way said with just tone of reproach in voice be in truth sincerely attached to much more so than be in compass of nature to be to if must have have for wife without trouble of bridal preparation of subsequent honeymooning must most willingly have begun from moment be incumbent on to be married have quite made up mind that be sort of wife that required now be sadly put about by tone of reproach wish to goodness said that have be born younger brother just anybody else than be why on earth must wish that because be so bothered of course understand do understand said amaldina there must know be end to suppose parliament lunatic asylum will go on just same always doubt doubt if so there be reason why day must ever be fixed people be beginning to think that must be off because have be talked of so long hope will never be off know prince said other day that have expected doe not signify what expected lord llwddythlw have also heard story of what prince have said that expected scratched head again with vexation have be reported that prince have declared that have hoped to be asked to be godfather long ago lady amaldina have probably heard other version of story what mean be that everybody be surprised that must be so long postponed that now begin to think be abandoned altogether will say june next said ecstatic lover lady amaldina thought that june must do very well there will be town education improvement bill said lordship again scratching head thought town have be educated long ago looked at with feeling of double sorrow sorrow that must have known so little sorrow that must be treated so badly think will put off altogether said angrily no exclaimed must august do certainly have promised to be at inverness to open new dock be nonsense said what can dock want with to open father know said have very great interest in city think will get david to do lord david be brother also member of parliament busy man a be powell family one who liked little recreation among moor when fatigue of house of common be over of course must do said lady amaldina got married ten year ago will ask will be very angry always say that ought to be made to do elder brother work then may tell mamma lordship again rubbed head did time in manner be conceived to signify assent lady pressed arm gently visit to trafford a far a be concerned be supposed to have be success gave little squeeze a got out of carriage went away sadly to learn rest of speech thinking how sweet might be to do a others use play with tangle of neaera hair sport with amaryllis in shade there be worse interruption for lord llwddythlw than have now undergone at about five when be making peroration of speech quite secure in memory message came to from marchioness saying that must be much obliged to if must give five minute in own room perhaps must be kind enough to drink cup of tea with message be brought by ladyship own maid must be regarded only a command lord llwddythlw wanted tea cared not at for lady kingsbury be very anxious a to speech almost cursed fidgety fretfulness of woman a slipped manuscript into letter case followed girl along passage be so kind of said gave usual rub of vexation a bowed head said nothing saw state of mind be determined to persevere though be man plain to look at be known to be very pillar support of order man in england be so wedded to conservative cause to cause depends for success on maintenance of social institution by great britain have become first among nation one believed a did lord llwddythlw in keeping different class in own place place requiring honour truth industry marchioness understood something of character in respect who therefore must be so ready to see bitterness of own injury to sympathize with a to unfitness of son daughter who have blood relationship to herself to perceive how infinitely better must be for order that own little lord frederic must be allowed to succeed to assist in keeping institution of great britain in proper position have become absolutely dead to fact that by allusion to probability of such succession be expressing wish for untimely death of one for whose welfare be bound to be solicitous have lost by constant dwelling on subject power of seeing how idea must strike feeling of person here be man peculiarly blessed in world man at very top of order one who must be closely connected with on whom at future time might be able to lean a on strong staff therefore determined to trust sorrow into ear wo have cup of tea never take at time of day perhaps cup of coffee nothing before dinner thank be not at castle hautboy when hampstead sister be there have not be at castle hautboy since spring did not think very odd that must have be asked indeed why odd know story do not a one about to be so nearly connected with family ought to know lady france have made most unfortunate engagement to young man altogether beneath to post office clerk did hear something of behaved shockingly here be then taken away by brother have be forced to divorce from altogether lord llwddythlw rubbed head on occasion lady kingsbury misinterpreted cause of vexation be troubled at being made to listen to story conceived that be disgusted by wickedness of lady france after think sister be very wrong to have at castle hautboy countenance ought to be shown to young woman who can behave so abominably must only rub head do not think that such marriage be most injurious to best interest of society certainly think that young lady must marry in own rank so much depends upon doe not lord llwddythlw future blood of head family own opinion be that nothing must be too severe for such conduct will severity prevent nothing else can own impression be that father in such case must be allowed to confine daughter then marquis be so weak country must not stand for moment so much worse for country said ladyship holding up hand brother be if possible worse than sister hampstead utterly hate idea of aristocracy be absurd most absurd said marchioness feeling to be encouraged most absurd abominable wicked be quite revolutionist not that think said lordship who knew pretty well nature of hampstead political feeling indeed be why encourages sister must not mind marrying shoeblack if only must debase own family think what must feel with darling boy be not kind to must prefer that must never see see at said angry lord altogether misunderstood when think of what be to what will reduce whole family must live can not bear to see touch think of blood of traffords of blood of mountressors of blood of hautevilles think of own blood be now to be connected with theirs that be to be defiled because man chooses to bring about disreputable disgusting marriage with expressed purpose of degrading beg pardon lady kingsbury will be in way degraded think of think of child will may be misfortune will be degradation honour can only be impaired by be dishonourable wish that lady france have given heart elsewhere feel sure that name of family be safe in hand a for hampstead be young man for whose conviction have sympathy be sure that be gentleman must that be dead said lady kingsbury in wrath lady kingsbury must that be dead can only say said lord llwddythlw rising from chair that have made confidence most unfortunately lord hampstead be young nobleman whom must be proud to call friend man politics be own honour integrity even conduct belong in measure to family think that father brother if may say so stepmother will ever have occasion to blush for anything that may do with bowed to marchioness stalked out of room with grand manner who saw shuffling foot in house of common must hardly have thought belonged to dinner on day be very quiet lady kingsbury retired to bed earlier even than usual conversation at dinner be dull turned mostly on church subject mr greenwood endeavoured to be sprightly parson parson wife parson daughter be uncomfortable lord llwddythlw be almost dumb lady amaldina having settled one matter of interest to be simply contented on next morning lover took departure by earlier train than have intended be said necessary that must look into matter at denbigh before made speech contrived to get compartment to there practised lesson till felt that further practice must only confuse have fanny at castle other day lady kingsbury said next morning to niece mamma thought must be good natured to ask did not deserve conduct have be such that be forced to say that deserve nothing from family did speak about marriage of hers did mention well oh there be nothing of course there be much more to say about mine be saying that must be glad to be bridesmaid pray have why not aunt must not possibly be there if did have be compelled to divorce from heart poor fanny be not ashamed of what be doing must say not be not one of be ever ashamed nothing must make ashamed idea of propriety have banished from a though did exist expect to hear that disregard marriage altogether aunt clara what can expect from doctrine such a brother share thank god have never be in way of hearing of such thing break heart when think of what own darling will be sure to hear of day must half brother half sister still be left alive amaldina pray have for one of bridesmaid lady amaldina remembering that cousin be very handsome also that there might be difficulty in making up twenty titled virgin gave aunt promise chapter xx scheme be successful when matter be mentioned to george roden by mother must see reason why must not dine at hendon hall be glad to have opportunity of getting over roughness of feeling have certainly existed between friend when parted with other on road a to mother must be well that must so far return to usage of world a to dine at house of son friend be only going back to what used to be said know nothing of what used to be replied almost angrily ask question have endeavoured so to train must care little about knew be so then after pause went back to current of thought have father be prince think must take pride in be well to have be born gentleman said be well to be gentleman if good thing be generally attendant on high birth will help man in reaching noble feeling grand resolve so may be that to have be well born will be assistance if man derogates from birth a so many do then be crime have to be taken for granted george be not taken for granted though man be knave fool coward be supposed to be ennobled because blood of howard run in vein worse again though have gift of nobility beyond compare can hardly dare to stand upright before lord duke because of inferiority be going away must that must be made to go little faster may be helped in going may be that in day progress will be accelerated will let write to hampstead say that will come assented so that part of little dinner party be arranged after contrived to see quaker one evening on return home yes said mr fay have heard thy proposition from marion why must young lord desire one a be to sit at table be george intimate friend thy son must choose friend well surely believe because see to be prudent wise young man who doe not devote over much to riotous amusement george did occasionally go to theatre thereby offending quaker judgment justifying overmuch losing claim to full measure of praise therefore will not quarrel with that have chosen friend from among great one of earth like to like be good motto fancy that weary draught horse such a be must not stable with hunter racer young man affect society of such a george rather than of others nobly born a know that show wisdom more must give credit at rate for good endeavour be not for to judge one way other did ask that marion must also go to house certainly why must not child see something of world may amuse little good can come to marion from such amusement mr roden something perhaps of harm wilt thou say that such recreation must necessarily be of service to girl born to perform hard duty of strict life must trust marion in anything said mr roden eagerly so must so must hath ever be good girl do not distrust if shut up be afraid to allow even to sit at table in strange house have never forbidden to sit at thy table said quaker must let go specially a kindness to for son sake have promised to be there must be comfort to to have woman with then will hardly need said mr fay not without touch of jealousy specially pressed request that must come be among such a that must wish to make known moreover if marion be to be there be sure will choose to accompany must not wish to see how child bear on occasion on occasion at place at hour must wish to have child with there be nothing else left to in world on eye can rest with pleasure doubt whether may be for good then took departure leaving matter still undecided speaking of with word seemed to imply that must ultimately refuse impressing mr roden with conviction that must at last accept invitation doest thou wish said to daughter before retiring to rest that night if will go father must like why shouldst thou like what doest thou expect be because young man be lord that there will be something of gilded grandeur of grand one of earth to be seen about house table be not for father be because be young comely can say soft thing a such youth be wont to say because will smell sweetly of scent lavender because hand will be soft to touch with ring on finger jewel perhaps on bosom like woman father be not for that delicacy will give thee to eat to drink sweetmeat rich food can not be much to one nurtured a thou hast be certainly not father can be nothing to then why be that thou wouldst go to house be may hear father speak among men nay said laughing thou mayst hear better speak among men at king court in city there can hold own well enough with young men over wine will have little to say fancy if thou hast nothing to gain to hear thy old father talk time money will be surely thrown away must hear talk father young lord yes young lord be bright clever coming from world than world can tell thing that know can tell thee aught be good from what hear of from friend will tell think naught be bad will be there to hear to arrest word if be evil think to be one from whose mouth guile folly will be heard who art thou child that thou shouldst be able to judge whether word of guile be likely to come from young man lip said smiling pressing hand while seemed to rebuke nay father judge only say that think might be so be not surely false wicked if wish otherwise will not utter syllable to urge request will go marion thy friend urged that be not good that thou shouldst always be shut up with alone though may distrust young lord a not knowing confidence in thee be such that think that nothing will ever shake so be settled that must go must send to livery stable hire carriage for unusual occasion there must be need for young lord to send home though did not know a said much of way of outside world be hardly custom for host to supply carriage a well a viand when dined a did annually with elder mr pogson mr pogson sent home in carriage must sit at lord table must go come a did other men on friday named two lady two men arrived at hendon hall in something more than good time hampstead hopped skipped about a though be delighted a boy might have be at coming may be possible that there be something of guile even in that have calculated that might thus best create quickly that intimacy with quaker daughter felt to be necessary for full enjoyment of evening if quaker expected much of gilding of have spoken be certainly disappointed garniture of hendon hall have always be simple now have assumed le even of aristocratic finery than used to show when prepared for use of marchioness be glad have come in time said because can get comfortably warm before dinner then fluttered about round mr roden paying attention much rather than marion fay still with guile a knowing that might thus best prepare for coming of future good thing suppose found awfully cold said know that be awed lord said quaker winter have certainly set in with severity oh father said marion rebuking everything be awful now said hampstead laughing of course word be absurd one get in way of using because other people do nay lord crave pardon if seemed to criticize thy language being somewhat used to sterner manner of speaking took word in stricter sense be slang from girl school after said roden now master george be not going to bear correction from said hampstead though put up with from elder miss fay when be at school did talk slang where be at school lord hampstead marion answered be kept in strict leading string fancy father what miss watson must have said if have used word in sense not used in dictionary miss watson be sensible woman dear understood well performed faithfully duty have undertaken know that a much can be said of who keep fashionable seminary for young lady at west end miss watson have red face big cap spectacle have not said hampstead appealing to marion fay miss watson said mr roden whom remember to have seen once when marion be at school with be very little woman with bright eye who wore own hair always looked a though have come out of bandbox be absolutely true to idea of life a quaker must be said mr fay only hope marion will follow example a to language be think convenient to certain extent mode of speech must consort with mode of living must not expect to hear from pulpit phrase belong to racecourse must expression be decorous perhaps in aristocratic drawing room befit humble parlour of clerk artisan never will say that anything be awful again said lord hampstead a gave arm to mr roden took in to dinner hope will not be angry with father whispered marion fay to george roden a walked across hall together not in least nothing of kind must anger if father be to cringe to flatter then must be disgusted father must never do said marion with confidence dinner went off very pleasantly hampstead roden taking between weight of conversation quaker be perhaps little frightened by asperity of own first remark ate good thing almost in silence marion be quite contented to listen a have told father be purpose be perhaps to young lord word that gave attention rather than to of friend voice be pleasant to ear there be certain graciousness in word a to did not suppose that softness be specially intended for hearing who doe not know way in man may set at work to gain admission into woman heart without addressing hardly word to who have not noted sympathy with woman have unconsciously accepted homage that pressing of hand that squeezing of arm that glancing of eye be common among lover be generally developed consequence of former indication have have full effect even though be hardly understood must not have be acknowledged at time marion did perhaps feel that there be something of worship even in way in host looked towards with rapid glance from minute to minute a though to see that if not with word at rate with thought be taking share in conversation be certainly intended for delight quaker in mean time ate dinner very silently be conscious of having shown somewhat of prig about slang phrase be repenting mr roden now then must put in word in answer rather to son than to host be aware of electric spark from lord hampstead end of wire be being directed moment against marion fay heart now just for fashion of thing must sit here for quarter of hour while be supposed to be drinking wine be said by lord hampstead when took two lady into drawing room after dinner hurry yourselves said mr roden marion be old friend will get on very well oh yes said marion will be pleasure enough to just to sit here look around then hampstead knelt down between pretending to doctor up fire certainly required doctoring be standing one on one side other on other looking down upon be spoiling that fire lord hampstead said mr roden coal be made to be poked feel sure of do take poker give one blow will make at home in house for ever know then handed implement to marion must hardly do other than take in hand took blushed up to root of hair paused moment then gave one blow to coal have be required of thanks said nodding at a still knelt at foot took poker from thanks now be free of hendon hall for ever must have one friend poke fire upon that got up walked slowly out of room oh mr roden said marion wish have done doe matter be only joke of course be joke wish have done seemed at moment must look to be cross if did do a bade when have said that about being at home oh mr roden wish have not done will know that be nothing dear be good humoured playful like feeling of making feel that be not stranger marion knew that lord hampstead must not take a meaning nothing though must see no more than back a walked out of room knew that be glowing with triumph now mr fay here be port if like recommend to stick to claret have pretty well done sticking lord of be competent said quaker little wine go long way with a be not much used to wine maketh glad heart of man said roden true enough mr roden doubt whether be good that man heart must be much gladdened gladness sorrow counterbalance other too surely even serenity be best fitted to human life if can be reached level road without hill said hampstead say that horse be soonest tired by such travelling must hardly tell so if must give experience after long day journey then there be pause mr fay continued to speak lord fear misbehaved in reference to word 'awful fell by chance from thy mouth oh dear nothing of kind be bethinking that be among young men in court in great broad street who will indulge sometimes in manner of language not befitting occupation at time perhaps station in life be wont then to remind word during business hour must be used in strict sense lord if will take farm horse from plough can not expect from that must prance upon green be because think that there must be more mixing between what call plough horse animal used simply for play have be so proud to make welcome here hope may not be by many last time that will act a living dictionary for if wo have more wine will go to in drawing room mr roden very soon declared necessary that must start back to holloway hampstead did not attempt to delay word have absolutely passed between marion have hardly be more than have be here set down yet felt that have accomplished not only with satisfaction with glory to purpose for have specially invited guest scheme have be carried out with perfect success after manner in marion have obeyed behest about fire be sure that be justified in regarding a friend chapter xxi what thought a went home lord hampstead have come to door to help into carriage lord hampstead said mr roden will catch death of cold be freezing have nothing on head be quite indifferent about thing said a for moment held marion hand while helped into carriage do go in whispered lip a spoke be close to ear that simply came from position in chance have placed hand be still in that too be accident of situation there be think involuntary tendency among woman to make more than necessary use of assistance when person tendering have made really welcome marion have certainly no such intention have idea come to at moment must have shrank from touch be only when finger be withdrawn when feeling of warmth of proximity have passed away that became aware that have be so close to now be separated then father entered carriage roden good night lord said quaker have passed evening very pleasantly doubt whether may not feel le disposed for day work to morrow not at mr fay not at will be like giant refreshed there be nothing like little friendly conversation for bracing up mind hope will not be long before come try again then carriage be driven off lord hampstead went in to warm before fire marion fay have poked have not intended to fall in love with be there ever young man who when first found girl to be pleasant to have intended to fall in love with girl will intend to fall in love more frequently perhaps to avoid men in such matter rarely have purpose lord hampstead have found her a thought to be admirable specimen of excellence in class of mankind conviction theory induced to extol thought that good must be done by mixing racer plough horse a regarded present experiment marion fay be plough horse doubt must not have made special attempt have not pleased eye ear sens generally certainly be not philosopher to whom in search after wisdom old man such a zachary fay must make a acceptable a daughter may be acknowledged of that be susceptible to female influence have not at first occurred to that must be good thing to fall in love with marion fay why must not be on friendly term with excellent lovely girl without loving such have be idea after first meeting marion at mr roden house then have determined that friend must not become friend without seeing other have concocted scheme without being aware of feeling have excited scheme have be carried out have have dinner party marion fay have poked fire there have be one little pressure of hand a helped into carriage one little whispered word have not be whispered must have be a nothing one moment of consciousness that lip be close to cheek then returned to warmth of fire quite conscious that be in love what be to come of when have argued with sister with roden marriage must be unsuitable because of difference in social position have justified opinion by declaring to be impossible that two person must by own doing break through convention of world without ultimate damage to to others have silently acknowledged to that also be bound by law be teaching that such convention must gradually cease to be must be good man be strong enough to make new law for own governing at spur of moment certainly woman existing distance between man man be radically bad be very gist of doctrine instant abolition of such distance have be proved by many experiment to be vain dream diminution of must be gradual slow such diminution must go on till distance must ultimately disappear in future millennium be to certainty distance be being diminished by increasing wisdom philanthropy of mankind to born to high rank great wealth have be given to do more perhaps than in surrendering there be more efficacy a there be also more grace than in seizing what of grandeur might surrender without injury to others to whom be bound must surrender of what exact nature kind must be woman whom might please to select a wife have formed no accurate idea must endeavour so to marry that must make step down in world might be offensive to family must yet satisfy own conviction by drawing somewhat away from aristocratic blood father have done same when choosing first wife happiness of choice must have be perfect have not death interfered actuated by such reasoning a have endeavoured in mild way to separate sister from lover thinking that who be in love must be bound by argument seemed good to who be not in love now also be in love argument a applied to fell into shred tatter a sat gazing at fire holding poker in hand have there ever be anything more graceful than mock violence with have pretended to strike heartily at coal have there ever anything be more lovely than mingled glance of doubt of fear of friendliness with have looked into face a did have quite understood feeling when made little request there have be heart enough in spirit enough intelligence enough to tell at once purport of demand rather have not seen at once have only understood when hand have gone too far to be withdrawn that something of love a well a friendship have be intended before long must know how much of love have be intended whether purpose be be not compatible with wisdom of theory a to gradual diminution of distance heart have gone too far now for retracting a sat there at once began to teach that argument have used be only good in reference to high born female that need not necessarily affect whomever might marry must raise to own rank for rank did not care straw be of prejudice of others be thinking when assured that marion must make a good countess a good marchioness a lady in land in regard to sister be otherwise must follow rank of husband might be that sore must cause to many by becoming wife of post office clerk ought to be avoided there need be sore in regard to marriage with marion fay present reasoning be doubt bad such a be be allowed to prevail absolutely did not even occur to that must make attempt to enfranchise from marion charm might occur detail there might be must require attention in regard to father others of family everything must give way to present passion have poked fire must be made to sit at hearth for remainder of joint existence must be made to sit there if must so plead cause that love must prevail with a to quaker father thought altogether well of too industrious useful intelligent man of whose quaint manner manly bearing must not be ashamed in society too be quaker to be little nothing also have religious conviction be not of nature to be affronted shocked by of one who believed that increasing civilization of world have come from christ teaching simple earnest purity of girl faith must be attraction to rather than otherwise indeed there be nothing in

letter from father begging presence down at trafford marquis be ill be anxious to see son letter in request be made be sad plaintive throughout be hardly able to write lord kingsbury said because be so unwell have one to write for mr greenwood have made so disagreeable that must no longer employ for such purpose stepmother be causing much vexation think that deserve from then added that must be necessary for to have lawyer down at trafford that wished to see hampstead first in order that might settle a to certain arrangement be required in regard to disposition of property there be thing hampstead must not fail to perceive from letter be sure that father be alarmed a to own condition must not have thought of sending for lawyer to trafford have hitherto always be glad to seize opportunity of running up to london when matter of business have seemed to justify journey then occurred to son that father have rarely ever spoken written to of stepmother in certain mood marquis have be wont to call wife marchioness lady kingsbury when in good humour have generally spoken of to son a mother injurious though strictly legal name now given to be certain index of abiding wrath thing must have be very bad with marquis at trafford when have utterly discarded service of mr greenwood service to have be used for time to memory of son did not go back hampstead of course obeyed

favour from mr greenwood hampstead on arriving at house saw marchioness for moment before went to father can not tell how be said lady kingsbury speaking in evident dudgeon will hardly let go near

one else to speak word to for reason suppose wish to get rid of be absolutely talking of sending man away after having have with for nearly thirty year in answer to hampstead said almost nothing knew stepmother be aware that must do service by telling what might find to be duty to say to father a to mr greenwood on other subject did not hate stepmother a hated regarded a one to whom be quite useless to speak seriously a to affair of family knew to be prejudiced ignorant falsely proud did not suppose to be either wicked cruel father began almost instantly about mr greenwood so that must have be quite impossible for to follow lady kingsbury advice on matter have be ever so well minded of course be ill said suffer so much from sickness dyspepsia can eat nothing doctor spicer seems to think must get better if did not worry there be so many thing to worry conduct of man be abominable what man sir asked hampstead who knew however very well what be coming that clergyman said lord kingsbury pointing in direction of mr greenwood room doe not come to sir unless send for have seen for last five day care if never see again how have offended sir gave express injunction that must not speak of sister to marchioness gave solemn promise know very well that be talking about hour of day perhaps be not fault yes be man need talk to woman unless like be downright impudence on part

to everybody why have not obeyed demanded marquis angrily be who have employed have be patron now turn against thus marquis went on till strength must not suffice for further talking hampstead found quite unable to bring to other subject on day be sore with injury done in that be not allowed to be master in own house on next morning hampstead heard from dr spicer that father be in state of health very far from satisfactory doctor recommended that must be taken away from trafford at last went so far a to say that advice extended to separating patient from lady kingsbury be of course very disagreeable subject said doctor for medical man to meddle with lord truth be that lady kingsbury fret of course care to hear what be there be something wrong lord hampstead who knew very well what be did not attempt to contradict when however spoke to father of expediency of change of air marquis told that must rather die at trafford than elsewhere that father be really thinking of death be only too apparent from be said done a to matter of business be soon settled between there be at rate comfort to poor man that there be probability of difference between heir a to property a to money hour

young patron be sure father must never do said hampstead angrily look very like have devoted best of life to service now talk of dismissing a though be better than servant doe will be sure have adequate cause for doing have done nothing duty be out of question that man in position must submit to order a to what be to talk about what not be natural that lady kingsbury must come to in trouble if will take advice said lord hampstead in tone of voice always produce in mind of listener determination that special advice offered will not be taken will comply with father wish while suit to live in house if can not do that must become think to leave in word of there be rebuke mr greenwood who did not like being rebuked remembered of course be nobody in house now said marchioness in last

roden a husband for sister have be shut up here not allowed to speak to one fanny have left house so that may no longer cause annoyance by presence have left house in order that may be near abominable lover with whom have furnished be not true said hampstead who be moved beyond control by double falseness of accusation of course can be insolent to tell that speak falsehood be part of new creed that must be neither respectful to parent civil to lady beg pardon lady kingsbury have never called lady kingsbury before if have be disrespectful uncivil statement be very hard to bear fanny engagement with mr roden have not even received sanction much le be arranged encouraged by have not gone to hendon hall to be near mr roden with whom have undertaken to hold communication a long a remains there with for own sake for hers be bound to repudiate accusation then went without further adieu leaving with conviction that have be treated with greatest contumely by husband rebellious heir nothing must

custom with stole day more than belonged to thus incurred frown of mr jerningham heavy wrath of great aeolus of civil service be necessarily much exercised in mind by such irregularity to personally matter not at whether one young man may be neglectful may be known to one crocker may be missed from seat without great injury possibly with injury at to queen service there be crockers whom must be better to pay for absence than presence aeolus thought be so with crocker then why not dismiss crocker thus save waste of public money there be necessity almost necessity that crockers of world must live have mother perhaps even wife with back to be clothed stomach to be fed perhaps with heart to be broken there be at rate dislike to proceed to ultimate resort of what may be called capital punishment of civil service to threaten to frown to scold to make young man life burden to be within compass of official aeolus must think occasionally that one be resolved to turn clerk in office out into street so loud be threat in regard to individual often be resolved to do so at very next fault when time come heart misgives even aeolus be subject to mercy at last conscience becomes so callous to first imperative duty of protecting public service that grows to be settled thing with though man life be to be made burden to man be not to be actually dismissed there be men to whom can not make life burden men upon whom frown scolding threat operate at men unfortunately sharp enough to perceive what be ultimate decision to aeolus have be brought one be crocker who cared very little for blusterings on occasion have remained away for sake of having additional day with braeside harrier when pleaded bilious headache one believed for instant be in vain for aeolus to tell that man subject to health so precarious be altogether unfitted for civil service crocker have known beforehand exactly what be going to be said to have discounted at exact worth even in presence of mr jerningham spoke openly of day hunting knowing mr jerningham must prefer own ease to trouble of renewed complaint if must sit at desk now that have come back go on with docketing instead of making everybody else idle must be great deal better said mr jerningham then horse took wall in fly old amblethwaite crept over afterwards continued crocker standing with back to fire utterly disregarding mr jerningham admonition on first entrance into room crocker have shaken hand with mr jerningham then with bobbin geraghty at last came to roden with whom must willingly have struck up term of affectionate friendship have be possible for to do so have resolved that must be so when moment came courage little failed have made very offensive to roden at last interview must see at glance roden remembered a far a own feeling be concerned such tiff a called went for nothing have indeed no feeling be accustomed to say that liked system of give take meaning that liked being impudent to others did not care how impudent others might be to toughness insolence be a sharp a needle to others who posse same gift roden have learned to detest presence of young man to be sore when be even spoken to yet did not know how to put down may have fierce bull shut up may muzzle dog will bite may shoot horse that can not cure of biting tearing can not bring to spend morning in hunting bug killing flea crocker have made serious annoyance even to lord hampstead though presence together have only be for very short time roden have to pas life at same desk with odious companion absolutely to cut to let be known through office that two did not speak be to make too much of matter yet be essentially necessary for peace that step must be taken to save from man insolence on present occasion nodded head to crocker being careful not to lay pen down from finger ai going to give hand old fellow said crocker putting on best show of courage know that be said roden perhaps of day may learn to make le disagreeable be sure have always meant to be very friendly especially with said crocker be so hard to get what one say taken in proper sense after not word be spoken between two morning happened on saturday saturday th of december on day hampstead be to return to own house punctually at one crocker left desk with comic bow of mock courtesy to mr jerningham stuck hat on side of head left office mind a took home to lodging be full of roden demeanour towards since have become assured that brother clerk be engaged to marry lady france trafford be quite determined to cultivate enduring affectionate friendship what step must take to recover ground have lost occurred to now that while be in cumberland have established quite intimacy with lord hampstead thought that must be well to use lord hampstead acknowledged good nature for recovering ground have lost with brother clerk at about three o'clock afternoon when lady france be beginning to think that time of brother arrival be near at hand servant came into drawing room told that gentleman have called be desirous of seeing what gentleman asked lady france have sent name lady say say that be clerk from post office lady france be at moment so dismayed that did not know what answer to give there must be one post office clerk who must be anxious to see have felt from tone of servant voice that have known that be lover who have called everybody knew that post office clerk be lover immediate answer be necessary quite understood pledge that brother have made on behalf though have not made actual promise felt that be bound not to receive george roden yet must not bring to turn away from door so to let servant suppose that be ashamed to see to whom have given promise of hand have better show gentleman in said at last with voice almost trembled moment afterwards door be opened mr crocker entered room have endeavoured in minute have be allowed to study manner in must receive lover a heard approaching footstep prepared have just risen from seat nearly risen when strange man appeared have to be acknowledged that be grievously disappointed although have told that roden ought not to have come to what woman be there will not forgive lover for coming even though certainly must not have come what woman be there will fail to receive stranger with hard look when stranger will appear to instead of expected lover sir said standing a walked up room made low bow to a took position before crocker be dressed up to eye wore yellow kid glove lady france said be mr crocker mr samuel crocker of general post office may not perhaps have heard of from friend mr roden indeed sir might have done so a sit in same room at same desk may remember meeting at dinner at uncle castle in cumberland be anything anything matter with mr roden not in least lady have pleasure of leaving in very good health about two hour since there be nothing at to occasion ladyship slightest uneasiness dark frown came across brow a heard man talk thus freely of interest in george roden condition doubt have betrayed own secret a far a there be secret be not on account le angry because have forced to do so have mr roden sent a messenger asked lady must not be at probable be sure must very much rather come with message of own at sniggered most offensively called with hope of seeing brother lord hampstead with whom may take liberty of saying have slight acquaintance lord hampstead be not at home so servant told then occurred to that a have come way down from london for certain purpose to ask little favour from lordship a be not fortunate enough to find lordship at home might ask same from ladyship there can be nothing can do for sir can do lady much better than one else in world can be more powerful in matter even than lordship what can be asked lady france if ladyship will allow will sit down a story have to tell be somewhat particular be impossible to refuse use of chair must therefore only bow a seated george roden lady have known other intimately for ever so many year again bowed head may say that used to be quite pal when two men sit at same desk together ought to be thick a thief see what cat dog life be else think so lady know nothing of office life a think can help perhaps must mind going away oh lady must hear to end because be just person who can help of course a two be situated must do anything be to bid now have taken into head to be very huffy with indeed can hing in matter said in tone of deep distress if must only just tell have never meant to offend be sure know what be have come up may be said word in joke about lord hampstead only that there really must not have be anything in nobody must have more profound respect for lordship quality than have may say same for ladyship most sincerely have always thought great feather in roden cap that must be so closely connected more than closely may say with noble family what on earth be to do with man who must go on talking to making at moment insolent allusion to most cherished secret of heart must beg to go away leave sir said brother will be here almost immediately have escaped from with vain idea that man must receive a threat that must think probably that brother must turn out of house for insolence in be altogether mistaken have idea that be insolent then perhaps will allow to wait for lordship said oh dear may come may not really can not wait ought not to have come at for sake of peace lady one word from fair lip lady france must endure no longer got up from seat walked out of room leaving mr crocker planted in chair in hall found one of servant whom told to take man to front door at once servant did a be bid crocker be ushered out of house without feeling on part that have misbehaved crocker have hardly got beyond ground when hampstead did in truth return first word spoken between sister of course referred to father health be unhappy rather than ill said hampstead be about asked not at about in first instance what doe that mean be not because of from what others say about mamma asked yes mr greenwood doe interfere be afraid doe not directly with father through ladyship who daily tell father what stupid old man say lady kingsbury be most irrational harassing have always thought to be silly now can not keep from feeling that misbehaves grievously doe everything can to add to annoyance be very bad be bad can turn mr greenwood out of house if mr greenwood becomes unbearable can not turn wife out must not come here be afraid not without bringing too have taken into stupid head that be disgracing family a for seems to think that be actually robbing own boy of right must do anything for even for if must comfort be determined to look upon a enemy father say that will worry into grave poor papa can run away can not became very angry when be there with ladyship that pestilential old clergyman told pretty much what thought have comfort of knowing have two bitter enemy in house can hurt not in least except in that can teach little boy to regard a enemy must fain have have brother left to mr greenwood must now say ladyship also be nothing to be not till after dinner that story be told about crocker think what must have felt when be told that clerk from post office wanted to see then that brute crocker be shown in asked hampstead do really know know must rather think so remember at castle hautboy not in least told that have be there never must leave absolutely drove out of country because must follow about when be hunting insulted so grievously that have to turn tail run away from what did want of to intercede for with george roden be abominable man irrepressible so thick skinned that can not possibly get at so a to hurt be of use telling to keep distance for doe not in least know what mean doubt that have left house with conviction that have gained sincere friend in be now more than fortnight since marion fay have dined at hendon hampstead felt that unless must succeed in carrying on attack have commenced little beginning of friendship have made with quaker must be obliterated by length of time if thought about at must think that be very indifferent to let so long time pas by without struggle on part to see again there have be no word of love spoken have be sure of still there have be something of affectionate intercourse must not have failed to recognize what must think of if allowed that to pas away without renewal without attempt at carrying further when have bade go in out of cold there have be something in voice have made feel that be in truth anxious for now more than fortnight have gone there have be no renewal fanny said how must be if be to ask quaker to dine here on christmas day must be odd must a be stranger dined here so lately people like stand on ceremony at see why must come must say that want to make acquaintance must ask alone in that felt that great difficulty lay fay must hardly come without mr roden rodens must not be asked one doe always ask same people to meet other must be very odd think 'd come said lady france gravely then after pause went on fear john that there be more in than mere dinner company certainly there be said boldly much more in be not in love with quaker daughter rather think be when have seen three four time more will be able to find out may be sure of mean to see three four time more at rate one of time must be before go down to gorse hall then of course knew whole truth did however give up idea a to christmas dinner party having arrived at belief after turning matter over in mind that zachary fay must not bring daughter again so soon chapter ii mr roden eloquence on sunday hampstead be nervous fidgety have at one time thought that must be very day for to go to holloway must be sure to find mr roden at home after church then if must carry thing to necessary length might also see zachary fay on consideration appeared to that sunday must not suit purpose george roden must be there must be sadly in way quaker must be in way a must be necessary that must have preliminary interview with marion before anything must be serviceably said to father be driven therefore to postpone visit must monday do a knew enough of manner of paradise row to be aware that on monday mr vincent must certainly be there must be object if thing must be made to go pleasantly first to see mr roden for few minute then to spend a much of afternoon a might be possible with marion fay therefore fixed on tuesday for purpose having telegraphed about country for horse groom other appurtenance went down to leighton on monday consoled with day hunting with staghound on return sister spoke to very seriously a to own affair be not almost silly john about mr roden not coming here not silly at according to idea world know that be engaged very servant have heard of horrid young man who came from post office be aware of have that to do with if have be made public in way what can be object of keeping apart mamma doubt told sister lady persiflage have published everywhere daughter be going to marry duke have crowned triumph to let be known that be going to marry only post office clerk begrudge that in least a have talked about so much ought at rate to let have post office clerk have nothing to say about one way other said hampstead say nothing about at rate now what do mean by john when saw how miserable be at trafford did best to bring away must only bring here on express stipulation that must not meet george roden while be in house if can get father consent to meeting then that part of contract will be over think made promise understand so said nothing to papa on subject remember that made promise to be sure did not promised for to be silent be going to ask to come here certainly not if did come how must refuse to see thought that be here on saturday told richard to admit must not send away from door think will come unless be asked said hampstead then conversation be over on following day at two o'clock lord hampstead again started for holloway on occasion drove over left trap servant at duchess of edinburgh be so well known in neighbourhood now a hardly to be able to hope to enter on domain of paradise row without being recognized felt that be hard that motion must be watched telling that be one of evil belonging to hereditary nobility must accept mischief a did others walked up street trying to look a though did know that motion be being watched first from number fifteen a passed then from number ten opposite a stood at mr roden door mr roden be at home received of course with most gracious smile heart sank within a saw for felt sure that have come in pursuit of marion fay be very kind of to call said have heard from george that have gone down into country since have pleasure of dining with yes father have be unwell have to stay with few day must have be here sooner got home of quite well oh yes miss fay did not catch cold not at though fear be hardly strong be not ill hope oh not that life here very quietly doubt whether excitement of going out be good for there be not much excitement at hendon hall think said laughing not for for perhaps in appreciating own condition be so apt to forget what be condition of others to marion fay be strange event to have to dine at house strange also to receive little courtesy such a yours be hard for to conceive how strongly nature of girl may be effected by novelty have almost regretted lord hampstead must have consented to take there have said anything oh there be nothing for to say be not to suppose that harm have be done what harm must have be done asked of what nature be harm of mr roden be speaking must be that marion have made sign of altered feeling have declared in way liking disliking have given outward testimony of thought must have be pleasant to perhaps unpleasant have known harm of course said mr roden only to nature such a hers excitement be evil can not believe that said after pause now then in life of of there must come moment of excitement can not be evil what must marion say if be to tell loved hope will not do that lord why must hope so what right have to hope so if do love be not proper must tell must not be proper must love there mr roden take liberty of declaring that be altogether in wrong that speak without due consideration do lord think so why be not to be allowed ordinary privilege of man that of declaring passion to woman when meet one who seems in thing to fulfil image of perfection have formed for when see girl that fancy can love ah there be worst be only fancy will not be accused in way without defending let be fancy what not love marion fay have come here to tell so if can make impression on will come again tell father so be here now because think that can help if will not will go on without help what can do go to with now at once say that excitement be bad for excitement will be le if will come with to house then there be long pause in conversation during mr roden be endeavouring to determine what might be duty at moment certainly did not think that must be well that lord hampstead eldest son of marquis of kingsbury must marry marion fay be quite sure that have world with there be one to know that have assisted in arranging marriage that one must certainly condemn must assuredly be case not only with young lord family not only with others of young lord order with educated world of great britain how must be that one a marion fay must be fitting wife for one a lord hampstead marion fay have undoubtedly great gift of own be beautiful intelligent sweet minded possessed of natural delicacy so much so that to mr roden have become a dear almost a daughter be impossible that must have education manner fit for wife of great english peer though manner might be good education excellent be not required for special position then there be cause for other fear marion mother brother sister have died young girl have hitherto seemed to escape scourge under perished occasionally there must rise to cheek bright colour for moment must cause mr roden heart to sink within occasionally there must be heard from not cough little preparation for coughing have become so painfully familiar to ear of whose fate have be to see beloved one gradually fade from presumed health have already found constrained to say word two to old quaker not telling that feared coming evil hinting that change of air must certainly be beneficial to one a marion acting under impulse have taken her during inclemency of past spring to isle of wight be minded gradually to go on with counsel so a if possible to induce father to send girl out of london for considerable portion of year if be so how must possibly encourage lord hampstead in desire to make marion wife then a to girl must be for happiness that must be thus lifted into strange world world must be hard ungracious to in might be only too probable that young lord must see defect when must be too late for of to remedy evil have be done have thought something of before having recognized possibility of such step a after what have seen at hendon hall have told that must be well at rate to discourage such idea in marion heart have spoken jokingly of gallantry of men of rank marion have smiled sweetly a have listened to friend word have at once said that such manner be at rate pretty becoming in one so placed a lord hampstead there have be something in to make mr roden almost fear that word have be taken a intending too much that marion have accepted a caution against danger not for world must have induced girl to think that danger be apprehended now danger have come behoved roden if possible to prevent evil will come across with now said hampstead having sat silent in chair while thought be passing through lady mind think not lord why not mr roden will not be better than must go alone hope will not go at will go certainly consider bound by law of honesty to tell what have done to can then judge what may be best for go at rate to day lord hampstead let beg at least a much a of consider importance of step will be taking have thought of said marion be a good a gold know be marion say be a good a gold be likely that girl must remain untouched undazzled by such offer a can make touched hope may be a for dazzled believe in in least there be eye false light can dazzle if be touched a must doubt be case said mr roden must be well that with such duty before must marry daughter of zachary fay listen to moment continued a attempted to interrupt know what must say sympathize with much of can not be well for society class must be mixed together suddenly roughly what roughness must there be asked a lord lady be at present a duke be duchess such like there must be roughness to in having marion fay presented to a one of lord have married low born girl know wife have be contented with position have almost be denied to only grudgingly accorded have known something of lord have felt at rate have seen bitterness marion fay must fade sink to nothing if be subjected to such contumely to be marion fay be enough for to be wife not to be thought fit to be wife must not be half enough will be thought fit can make lady hampstead demand that will be received at court can deck with diamond cause to be seated high in honour according to own rank must induce father wife to smile on in answer to be dumb do think must be contented if father wife be to frown on father wife be not everybody must necessarily be much to wife take week lord month think upon expects nothing from yet be still in power to save from unhappiness must make happy mr roden think about think about must make happy also count feeling a being nothing in matter nothing a compared with hers see how plainly deal with let say that for time heart will be sore that do in truth love girl so a to feel that be necessary to happiness do not know that if be placed beyond reach must recover from sting duty of world must still be open to being man must still have before many year for recovery before youth have departed from of course must find other woman be happy with for if came to shipwreck in venture there must be other chance must make chance enough for so think if will look abroad will see that peril to happiness have attempted to describe be not vain can say no more lord can only beg that will take little time to think of before put thing out of own reach if have once accepted love know that must never go back never therefore think again while there be time slowly dragged up from chair left almost without word at parting have persuaded to take week be not that doubted in least own purpose did not know how to gainsay a to small request in frame of mind be common to young men when get that want angry disappointed foiled went down stair opened front door there on very step met marion fay marion said pouring tenderness of heart into voice lord come in marion for one moment then followed into little passage there stood have come over to ask how be after little party be quite well have be away with father must have come sooner nay be not necessary that must trouble yourself be necessary be necessary must be troubled very much be troubled stood there looking down on ground a though be biding time did not speak to must not come with said pointing up stair on mr roden be now standing have told that be bad must come will come one day soon be almost beside with love a be speaking girl be so completely after own heart a stood there close to filled with influence that be unable to restrain come up marion dear said mr roden speaking from landing be hardly fair to keep lord hampstead standing in passage be most unfair said marion good day lord will stand here till come down to unless will speak to again will not be turned out while be here marion be world to love with whole whole heart have come here dear to tell so have delayed made promise must not come again for week a though week year must change say one word to marion one word will suffice now then will go marion can love come to marion come to said mr roden answer now said marion looking up laying hand gently on sleeve of coat will not answer now be too sudden must think of word to answer speech lord hampstead will go to now will hear from will come to again will tell to morrow nay give day two on friday will be ready with answer will give hand marion gave to covered with kiss only have in mind fixed a fate that man ever loved woman more truly than love man be ever more determined to carry out purpose be in hand think if can not dare to trust into mine then left went back to duchess of edinburgh not thinking much of eye might be looking at chapter iii marion view about marriage when lord hampstead shut door behind marion went slowly up stair to mr roden who have returned to drawing room when entered friend be standing near door with anxiety plainly written on face with almost more than anxiety took marion by hand kissing led to sofa must have stopped if must said why must have stopped such thing must be considered more have made too late for considering to be of service knew almost knew that must come did can tell now that did though must not say even to before there be smile on face a spoke though colour be heightened there be none of peculiar flush mr roden so greatly feared to see be there special excitement in manner there be look of awe of triumph seemed to take a matter of course quite a much at least a lady amaldina must have done who might have be justified by position in expecting that young noble eldest son must fling at foot be ready with answer marion turned eye towards friend made immediate reply darling girl for in truth be very dear to much thought must be given to appeal a before answer be made have thought be ready think so dear mr roden look at like if say more to tell immediately be because be not perhaps quite sure not sure at rate of reason may have to give will come to to morrow then will tell there be room then at rate for hope if girl have not quite resolved to grasp at high destiny offered to be still friend duty to say something might influence marion dear say that think mr roden surely know know that may come from will come in love have mother to whom can go better than to to fill mother place dear marion be thus feel towards must say to must say to own child there be great difference in rank of men have felt that though do in honest belief think that best honestest of god creature be not always to be found among so called noble yet think that certain great respect must be paid to whom chance have raised to high place do not respect hope so perhaps may not show best by loving a to that be matter in one can perhaps hardly control if asked for love will come from like water from fountain unless be so then can not come at surely be dangerous doctrine for young woman young woman think be compassed by many danger said marion know one way of meeting what way be that dear will tell if can find how to tell to morrow there be one point marion on feel bound to warn a endeavoured also to warn to word seemed to have availed nothing think be more reasonable unequal marriage never make happy one side other hope may hing to make unhappy unhappy for moment must make for month perhaps for year though be for year must that be to whole life for year said marion not for year must be more than for day do think can not tell what may be nature of young man heart can a to that can not be duty to take much thought of lasting welfare be bound to think oh yes of certainly of above thing mean a to world of what may come afterwards to one so little known here can hardly dare to speak even to think girl when have be asked to marry man be bound to think of welfare in life can not think of eternal welfare also said marion unequal marriage be always unhappy said mr roden repeating great argument always fear so must be happy if great friend father stepmother high born lord lady who be connected with must be happy if frowned on must frown be to if smiled must be happy if world be light bright to must certainly be light bright to thought so once marion argued with once just a be arguing now nay mr roden be hardly arguing be just so that spoke to myself saying that joy took in man love must certainly be enough for happiness oh ala fell to ground will tell now more of than have told one for many year more even than have told george will tell because know can trust faith yes can trust said marion also married greatly greatly a world honour be concerned in mere rank stood a girl higher perhaps than do now be lifted out of own degree in accepting name husband gave assured must do honour to at rate by conduct did dishonour marriage be most unfortunate be good asked marion be weak be sure that lord hampstead be strong be fickle hearted can be sure that lord hampstead will be constant amidst charm of others whose manner will be more like own than yours can be think must be constant said marion because be ready to worship who have condescended to step down from high pedestal worship be not so may be that be so said marion ah yes child may be that be so then think of what may follow not only for for also not only for for also broken heart crushed ambition hope dead personal dislike perhaps hatred not hatred not hatred lived to be hated why not then be silent marion rising from seat kissed went away to home have very much to think of though have declared that have almost expected offer from lover still must not be that quaker girl daughter of zachary fay messrs pogson littlebird clerk must not be astounded by having such offer from such suitor a lord hampstead in truth glory of thing be not very much to be something doubt must be something to girl to find that own personal charm have sufficed to lure down from lofty perch topmost bird of marion be open to such weakness may be acknowledged of of coronet of diamond of lofty title high seat of castle park well arranged equipage of rich dress of obsequious servant fawning world must be gathered around may be said that thought not at have in short life seen one man who have pleased ear eye have touched heart that one man have instantly declared to be own that made bosom glow with feeling of triumph same evening abruptly told whole story to father father said lord hampstead be here to day here in house not in house met at friend whom went to see a be custom almost daily be glad came not here said quaker why must be glad to quaker made answer purpose be to have come here be to see that came to see thee young lord have asked to be wife asked thee to be wife yes indeed have not often heard that young men may be infatuated have chanced have be cinderella for eye thou art princess child therefore be unfit to mate with prince must not answer at once father be too sudden for to find word place be hardly fitting have found now what word child will tell with respect deference nay will tell with love for do love that will become to look for wife elsewhere marion said quaker who be somewhat moved by thing have altogether failed with girl marion must be so father must certainly be so yet thou lovest though be dying for love must be so why child why a far a saw young man be good gracious of great promise like to be true hearted good gracious true hearted oh yes must have must bring one a to sorrow perhaps to disgrace why to sorrow why to disgrace wouldst thou be more likely to disgrace husband than one of painted jezebel who know worship that of faded beauty thou hast not answered marion father be to come on friday for answer think of yet again child three day be time for considering matter of such moment bid leave for ten day further be ready now said marion yet thou lovest be not true to nature marion must not bid thee take man hand because be rich great if thou couldst not give thy heart in return must not have thee break law of god man for glitter of gold tinsel of rank good thing of world if be come by honestly be good love of honest man if thou lovest in return be not of le worth because stand high in wealth in will think nothing of father verily will be thy duty to think of almost exclusively of when thou shalt be wife then father will never think of wilt thou pay heed to word so a to crave from further time for thought not moment father must not be angry with child for own feeling tell true own heart own heart alone can dictate to what will say to there be reason what reason there be reason why mother daughter must not marry man then there came cloud across brow looked at a though almost overcome by anger

parliament have taken to way of living of own gave to manner appearance of more advanced age at period two year since stepmother still conceived high hope of even though must occasionally utter in presence opinion seemed to be terrible be then not of age there must be time enough for woman of tact intellect to cure folly best way of curing thought must be by arranging marriage between heir to marquisate daughter of so distinguished conservative peer a brother in law lord persiflage having high object in view opened matter with diplomatic caution to sister lady persiflage have at moment begun to regard lord llwddythlw a possible son in law be alive to fact that lord hampstead possessed superior advantage be possible that girl must really love one a lord hampstead hardly possible that there must be anything romantic in marriage with heir of duke of merioneth a far a wealth rank went there be enough in competitor whispered therefore to girl name of younger aspirant aspirant a might be hoped to be girl be not opposed to idea only let there be falling to ground between two stool starving for want of fodder between two bundle of hay lord llwddythlw have already begun to give symptom doubt be bald doubt be pre occupied with parliament county there be doubt that wife must have to encounter touch of ridicule young girl incurs when marries man altogether removed beyond world of romance duke be scarce man of business be known to be man of high honour there must be gambling difficulty possible question of want of money then politics be grandest known in england of old tory willing always to work for party without desiring of reward party wish to divide among a select number a possible what lord hampstead might turn out to be there be a yet knowing have already declared to be radical be fond of hunting be quite on card that must take to newmarket then too father might live for five twenty year whereas duke of merioneth be already nearly eighty hampstead be a beautiful a young phoebus pair must instantly become famous if only from good look alone chance be given to lady amaldina only given on understanding that must make very quick work of time hampstead be coaxed down to castle hautboy for month in september with idea that young lover might be a romantic a pleased among lake little romance there be at end of first week amaldina wisely told mother that thing must do must always be glad to regard lord hampstead a cousin a to anything else there must be end of will day give up title abandon property to freddy will then go to united state do best

month at castle hautboy then arrangement for welsh alliance be completed from time forth feeling of ill will on part of lady kingsbury towards stepson have grown become strong from month to month have not at first conceived idea that lord frederic ought to come to throne have come gradually when perceived thought that perceived that hampstead must hardly make marriage properly aristocratic hitherto tidings of proposed marriage have reached ear lived at last in daily fear a marriage must be almost sure forerunner of little lord highgate if something might happen something have taught to regard a beneficent fitting rather than fatal something might ensure to little lord frederic prospect have almost right to expect then in spite of suffering heaven must have done something for for might be thankful what will ladyship say when hears of maid marion said hampstead to sister on christmas day before further visit to holloway will matter much asked lady france think feeling towards be softer

that fashion of face be unusually serious chapter v quaker eloquence when friday morning came in paradise row father daughter at be full of thought a came down to breakfast to of be day laden with importance father mind have be full of matter ever since news have be told to have received marion positive assurance that marriage be altogether impossible with something of impatience till have used that argument a to own health be so powerful with on hearing that have said nothing have gone away have spoken word on subject since mind have be full of have lost wife little one a have said have declared to with strong confidence that child be to be spared to be man whose confidence be unbounded in thing a to have resolved be a though have determined in spite of fate in spite of god that marion must live have grown up under eye if not robust by mean weak creature did work about house never complained in eye be very beautiful saw nothing in colour be not to sign of health told that be nothing that having seen so many die in own family must condemn for repudiated idea declared to that must not become early victim so thinking exercised mind constantly during few day in considering whether there be adequate cause for refusal marion have determined to give man in truth be terribly anxious that grand stroke of fortune must be acknowledged accepted wanted nothing from young lord except perhaps that might be young lord father in law did want long for pant for on behalf of girl if good thing came in girl way because of beauty grace merit why must not be accepted others not only accepted thing for daughter hunted for cheated for did mean thing in searching for have trick lie regarded by world quite a matter of course because be natural that parent must be anxious for child have not hunted have not cheated thing have come in girl way man have found to be most lovely most attractive most loveable among whom have seen be glory to be thrown away because have filled mind with false fear though be to die must not man take chance with a do other husband in marrying other wife have be thinking of of nothing during day have intervened since lord hampstead have be in paradise row have not said word to daughter have indeed not dared to say word to so abhorrent to be idea of discussing with probability of own living dying be doubtful too whether word coming from at present might not strengthen in resolution if man really loved might prevail word must be stronger to overcome than must be spoken by father then too if really loved one repulse must not send back for ever might perhaps be better that argument from father must be postponed till must have heard lover argument mind be so filled with whole matter that must not bring to assure certainly that decision be best though be one who rarely needed counsel from others on occasion did need now be purpose to ask counsel of mr roden before moment must have come might be fatal to hope a be day immediately following christmas there be business for in city in order that weary holiday might be quicker consumed breakfasted at hour later than be usual after breakfast got through morning a well a must with newspaper record of stock price have brought with from city so remained fretful doing nothing pretending to read with mind fixed upon one subject till be twelve o'clock at hour have determined to make visit at past one be to dine of having calculated without however word having be spoken that lord hampstead must certainly not come till ceremony of dinner must be over though matter be so vitally important to of not word concerning be spoken at twelve o'clock took up hat walked out will be back punctually for dinner father asked made promise simply by nodding head then left room five minute afterwards be closeted with mr roden in drawing room having conceived difficulty of leading up to subject gradually broke into at once marion have told thee that young man will be here to day simply assented hast thou advised a to what must say have not seemed to want advice how must girl not want advice in so great matter how indeed yet have needed none have told thee asked what be in mind to do think so have said that must refuse man yes that certainly be purpose given reason said almost trembling a asked question yes gave reason didst thou agree with before must reply to mr roden felt compelled to pause when thought of one strongest reason fully a agreed with be unable to tell father of girl that did so sat looking at wanting word with might express full concurrence with marion without plunging dagger into other heart then thou didst agree with there be something terrible in intensity slowness of word a repeated question on whole did said think that unequal marriage be rarely happy that be asked then when be again silent made demand be so important to did say aught of health in discussing with thee did mr fay thou be subject friend on must not speak to be said came from mind be so fully made up a have said before advice from must avail anything with people be easy to see that whether agree with differ from be impossible to turn to thou canst say whether thou hast agreed with yes know well that subject be one difficult to talk of in father hearing there be thing must be talked of though heart must break after pause continued be there thinkest thou sufficient cause in girl health to bid sever from delight of life customary habit lord have intended for creature at separate question paused when be silent went on with other question be there that in look be there that in present condition of life make needful for thee friend for father to treat a though be already condemned by hand of lord to early grave then again looking almost fiercely into face went on with examination be what thou art doing not not yes thou friend thou with thy woman softness in thy heart be what will do unless bring to tell that fear be vain to have said that be reason be not that can not love man have not said a much to thee yes truly art thou not assenting to unless thou tellbet that fancy be not only vain wrong though thou hast not spoken word have not thy

required to come to a wife marion said marion know why be here advanced to a though must at once have taken in arm yes lord know know that love think surely that never love be stronger than mine if can love say one word will make absolutely happy to have for wife be that world can give now why do go from be to tell that can not love marion say that think heart will break must not say that a paused for answer be necessary that must say something first word spoken must tell whole truth even though might be that word must be repeated often before must be got to believe that be earnest word lord began oh do hate that form of address name be john because of certain conventional arrangement outside people call lord hampstead be because can be to no more than one of outside people that call lord marion only one of outside people more though gratitude to appreciation friendship for may be ever so strong father daughter must be just one of outside people to lord hampstead more why so why do say why do torment why do banish at once tell must go home wretched miserable man why why why because lord can give reason good reason reason can not oppose though must be fatal to unless can remove reason to must succumb if necessary to marion will not succumb at once if say that can not love will be reason if be necessary that must tell lie must do so must have be pleasant if must have made understand that must be content to love on condition that must be content to leave that must continue to love that must cease to love unless perhaps just little have be scheme for future have recommended to there must be something left must give romance to life must leave free in thing have be dream in have much trusted while listened to violence of word acknowledged to herself to be almost impossible must tell lie at moment seemed to that there might be middle course dare not love said dare not love marion who hinders who tell that may not be father lord be mr roden lord be matter in must obey friend no father have have to ask have told dare to love above station in life be to have bugbear again between happiness between immediate wish yes be not so in thing if even have set heart upon one below must not a friend have bade conquer feeling have set heart on one whom in thing of world regard a equal in other thing a infinitely superior compliment be very sweet to have trained to resist sweetness may not be lord hampstead may not be know a yet how obstinate such girl a may become when have to think of welfare little perhaps of own be afraid of yes must not love even of when must come to see in that be not lovable must cease to love must be good to because nature be good kind to because nature be kind must not ill treat because be gentle noble forgiving must not suffice for must see in eye despite hear in voice even though tried to hide by occasional softness must eat own heart when came to see that despised quaker wife be nonsense marion lord say word at once if have to be said so may know what be have to contend with for heart be so full of love that seems to be impossible must live without if there must be sympathy must at once be happy if there be none say so there be none spark of sympathy in for for one who love so truly when question be put to in guise must not quite tell so monstrous lie a must be needed for answer fit for purpose be matter marion in man have right to demand answer to demand true answer lord hampstead may be that must perplex sorely may be that must drive away from to beg never to trouble further may be that must force to remain dumb before because can not reply to in proper word will never alter purpose if think well of marion fay take word when give can never become lordship wife never never certainly never have told why reason why have told enough lord hampstead by heaven have not answered one question have asked have not given only reason must take even for while can love marion if loved must spare said then feeling that such word utterly betrayed recovered went to work with what best eloquence be at command to cheat out of direct answer required think said understand working of girl heart in such matter doe not dare to ask about love when know that loving must avail nothing for what purpose must inquire into when object of such inquiry have already be obtained why must trouble to know whether thing must be gain to not when be well aware that can never have gain marion think love looked at tried to smile tried to utter half joking word then a felt that must no longer repress tear turned face from made attempt at reply marion said again think that love if loved lord must not torture have seated now on sofa turning face away from over shoulder so that might in degree hide tear sat at side for moment two got possession of hand marion said pleading case with strength of word be at command know do not that moment of life can be of more importance to than be so lord none can be so important be striving to get for companion in life who to be sweetest of human being to touch a do now be joy to even though have made heart so sad at moment struggled to get hand away from struggle be not at first successful answer with argument be to of avail at be to thinking simply repetition of prejudice to have be life opposed will not be angry because say so oh lord said not angry be not angry indeed must not hold with extricated hand allowed to pas from grasp a continued address to a to have opinion have yours can be right that must hold to own sacrifice who have thought so much of what be want if in truth love let opinion stand against mine neutralize let mine stand against yours in will be equal then after let love be lord of if love marion think have right to demand that will be wife there be something in did not know how to answer did know be quite sure that word of tenderness either on part on own must induce to yield inch be duty to sacrifice for for reason be quite apparent to herself must do fortress of inner purpose be safe although have succeeded in breaking down bulwark by have be purpose to guard have claimed love have not be strong enough to deny claim let bulwark go be bad at lying let lie a might have wit enough to see through must not take trouble to deny love must persist in saying that have be accorded to surely might succeed at last in making understand that whether loved must not marry certainly will never be wife said be what more lord can let go never wish to return can lord return must only be trouble to pain to time turn eye too often on young woman because face may chance to please be well that must marry go seek wife with judgment among own people when have done that then may return tell marion fay that have done well by following advice will come again again again will tell marion fay that counsel be unnatural impossible will teach to know that man who love can seek other wife that other mode of living be possible to than one in marion fay will be joined together think will persuade at last that such be case think will come to know that cold prudence worldly must be wisdom can be of avail to separate who love other think that when find that lover so love that can not live without will abandon fear a to future fickleness trust to one of whose truth will have assured then took hand kneeling at knee kissed before be powerful enough to withdraw so left without word mounting on vehicle drove home without having exchanged single word at holloway with one save marion fay when be left alone threw at full length on sofa burst into ecstacy of tear trust to yes indeed must trust to entirely only in order that might have joy for one hour of confessing love to openly let consequence to herself afterwards be what might a to future injury to pride of have spoken to father also to friend of have said so much to herself in discussing matter with own heart a to that have convinced did not become in way to think of in matter certainly must be able to twist a must if must stand upon surer rock than fear for own happiness one kiss from must be payment for love sweetness truth eloquence must avail nothing with towards overcoming that spirit of self sacrifice by be dominated though must extort from secret must be strength though must have to tell of failing health certainly failing health though even must be necessary certainly must not be won from purpose might be sweet thought to make in respect friend of friend to tell everything to keep fear no doubt aspiration secret from love dearest thou very pearl of heart love indeed oh yes do not know that not even for instant must hide love be not aware did not see at moment that when first knelt at foot heart have flown to without effort on part to arrest now beloved one now understand other now there need be reproach between now there need be speaking of distrust be yours only be not fit a know dearest that poor quaker girl must become wife now that understand that why must be sad why must mourn why must not succeed in bringing thing to pas a if so why must life be unhappy to to thus be thinking of till have almost brought to state of bliss when father returned to father said getting up embracing arm a stood be over what be over asked quaker have be here well marion what have said what said be hardly for to tell said must must know

reached lady kingsbury at trafford park added much to trouble annoyance felt by different member of family there be anonymous letter reader who in regard to such mystery must never be kept moment in ignorance may a well be told at once that letter be written by enterprising young lady miss demijohn letter be written on new year day after party perhaps in consequence of party a rash doings of of younger member of trafford family be made specially obvious to miss demijohn by what be said on occasion letter ran a follows lady marchioness conceive to be duty a well wisher of family to inform that stepson lord hampstead have become entangled in what think to be dangerous way with young woman living in neighbouring street to neighbouring street be of course stroke of cunning on part of miss demijohn life at paradise row holloway name be marion fay be daughter to old quaker who be clerk to pogson littlebird king court great broad street be of course in position to entertain such hope a may have little money saved what be to like of ladyship lordship marquis think be pretty now like such cunning way of what tell ladyship there be manner of doubt lordship be there for hour other day girl be going about a proud a peacock be what call regular paradise row conspiracy though quaker have lent to ai at bottom next door two to fay there be mr roden living who have got son stuck up fellow clerk in post office believe there be bit of doubt have be got engaged to of ladyship noble family a to that holloway be talking of believe there be 'bus driver up down road a doe know be belief that mr roden be doing of have taken marion fay by hand just a though be own now have got young lord young lady right into mash if none of 'em be married yet wo be long so unless somebody interferes if believe do send to 'duchess of edinburgh ' at corner will find that know about now lady marchioness have thought duty to tell because like to see noble family put upon there be nothing for to get out of do just a one of family well wishers therefore sign very respectful well wisher young lady have told story completely a far a object be concerned be simply that of making mischief business of anonymous letter writing be one not new to hand be easy offer considerable excitement to mind of whose time hang heavy on hand marchioness though must probably have declared beforehand anonymous letter be of thing most contemptible nevertheless read more than once with great deal of care believed altogether a to lady france of course knew allegation to be true seeing that writer be so well acquainted with fact a to lady france why must be le well informed in reference to lord hampstead marriage a with quaker girl be exactly sort of match hampstead must be pleased to make then be especially annoyed by publicity of whole affair holloway driver of omnibus duchess of edinburgh must know secret of husband family must be able to discus disgrace to own darling must be subjected be terrible to perhaps sting went sharpest to heart be that came from fact that lord hampstead be about to be married at let wife be quaker what not let be a low a woman must be found within sound of bow bell still if marriage ceremony be once pronounced over woman son must become lord highgate must be heir to wealth title of marquis of kingsbury to absolute exclusion of eldest born of own darling have have hope in impracticability of lord hampstead such men a have told be likely to keep altogether free of marriage must not improbably thought entertain abominable not unlucky idea marriage in be absurdity at rate there be hope a long a must be kept unmarried be to marry then have son even though broke neck out hunting next day good must come of in condition of mind thought well to show letter to mr greenwood before read to husband lord kingsbury be still very ill so ill a to have given rise to much apprehension still must be necessary to discus letter with ill a might be only must be first discussed with mr greenwood mr greenwood face became flatter jaw longer eye more like gooseberry a read letter have gradually trained to say to hear manner of evil thing about lady france in presence of marchioness have too accustomed to speak of lord hampstead a great obstacle must be well if lord must think proper to take out of way have also so far followed lead of patroness a to be deep if not loud in denunciation of folly of marquis marquis have sent word that have better look out for new home without naming especial day for dismissal have given to understand that must not be convenient to receive again in house in park lane marquis have be ill when have thus expressed displeasure be now worse might be that marquis must never again visit park lane a positive limit have be fixed for mr greenwood departure from trafford park there remained there intended to remain for present a folded up letter carefully after reading slowly only shook head be true wonder asked marchioness there be reason why must not be be just what say to know be true about fanny of course there be that mr roden mr roden when writer know so much there be reason to believe rest great many people do tell great many lie said mr greenwood suppose there be such person a quaker that there be such girl quite likely if so why must hampstead fall in love with of course be always going to street because of friend roden not doubt lady kingsbury what ought to do to question mr greenwood be not prepared with immediate answer if lord hampstead chose to get married to quaker daughter how must be helped father must hardly have influence over now mr greenwood shook head yet must be told mr greenwood nodded head perhaps something might be done about property must care two straw about settlement said mr greenwood doe care about anything ought to if be to write ask must tell truth about marriage must tell truth about anything said mr greenwood marchioness passed by though knew at moment to be calumny be not unwilling to hear calumny against lord hampstead there used to be way said in marriage of kind must be put on one side afterwards must put on one side before now day if mean to do at said clergyman how how if must be got out of way how out of way well be what know suppose must be made to go out yachting be married to somebody else when be at sea lady kingsbury felt that friend be little good at stratagem felt also that be not very good herself must wish wishing in such matter be very vain have right on side be quite confident a to that there must be doubt that god men must desire to see little lord frederic succeed to marquisate rather than infidel republican if wretched radical must be kept from marrying there must evidently be room for hope because there be fact proved by incontestable evidence of burke peerage that younger son did so often succeed if heir be to be born then a far a be aware burke peerage promised nothing be pity must break neck out hunting said mr greenwood even must be much if be to be married first said marchioness day went to husband for hour before lunch at time nurse who attended during day be accustomed to go to dinner have have physician down from london since son have visited physician have told marchioness that though there be not apparently immediate danger still symptom be such a almost to preclude hope of ultimate recovery when opinion have be pronounced there have arisen between marchioness chaplain discussion a to whether lord hampstead must be once again summoned marquis have expressed no such wish bulletin of certain fashion have be sent three four time week to hendon hall purporting to express doctor opinion of health of noble patient bulletin have not be scrupulously true neither of two conspirator have wished to have lord hampstead at trafford park lady kingsbury be anxious to make separation complete between own darling brother mr greenwood remembered down to tittle of word tone insolence of rebuke have received from heir if lord kingsbury be really to be dying then must hardly dare to keep son in ignorance have got something 'd better show said a seated by husband sofa then proceeded to read to letter without telling a did so that be anonymous when have heard first paragraph demanded to know name of writer 'd better read first said marchioness did read to end closing however without mentioning final well wisher of course be anonymous said a held letter in hand then believe word of said marquis very likely not yet sound true think sound true at why must be true there be nothing so wicked a anonymous letter if be true about hampstead be true at rate of fanny that man come from holloway paradise row 'duchess of edinburgh ' where fanny go for lover hampstead be likely to follow 'birds of feather flock together wo have speak of child in way said sick lord what can do be not true about fanny if wish will write to hampstead ask about in order to escape from misery of moment assented to proposition letter being anonymous have to thinking be disgraceful therefore have disbelieved having induced to disbelieve statement made have be drawn into expressing at rate to acknowledging by silence conviction that marriage a proposed with marion fay must be very base ladyship felt therefore that if lord hampstead must be got to acknowledge engagement something must have be done towards establishing quarrel between father son have that man gone yet asked a wife rose to leave room have what man gone mr greenwood gone how must have gone have never be expected that must go by time see why must go at be told that must not again require service up in london a far a know be have be said about going poor man turned on sofa angrily did not at moment give further instruction a to chaplain departure want to know why have not gone lady kingsbury said to clergyman afternoon where be to go to whined unfortunate one doe mean to say that be to be turned out into road at moment notice because ca approve of what lady france be doing have have order a to going if be to go suppose will make arrangement first lady kingsbury said what must to comfort explained that there be necessity for immediate departure perhaps marquis might not think of again for week two there be knowing in what condition might find ladyship letter to stepson be a follows by return of post stepson answer came dear hampstead tidings have reached father that have engaged to marry girl daughter of quaker named fay living at paradise row quaker be represented a being clerk in counting house in city of girl father have heard nothing can only imagine that must be such a position must make probable desire to ask whether there be truth in statement will observe express opinion whether be true false whether proper improper after conduct other day must not think of interfering father wish to ask for information yours truly clara kingsbury hampstead answer be very short quite sufficient for purpose dear lady kingsbury be not engaged to marry miss fay a yet think may be day soon yours affectionately hampstead by same post wrote letter to father that will also be shown to reader dear father have received letter from lady kingsbury asking a to report of engagement between young lady named marion fay be sorry that writing must be evidence that be hardly yet strong enough to write trust that may not long be so must wish to see again at trafford like to go there without expression of wish from hold in readiness to start whenever may desire have hoped from last account that be becoming stronger know how may have heard anything of marion fay have engaged to to other young lady must have told at once know whether young man be supposed to declare own failure in such matter when have failed even to father a be ashamed of nothing in matter will avow have asked young lady to be wife have a yet declined will ask again still hope to succeed be daughter of mr fay who a lady kingsbury say be quaker be clerk in house in city a be in respect good man standing high for probity honour among who know can not think that there be drawback think have quality must wish to find in woman whom might hope to make wife live at paradise row holloway lady kingsbury indeed be right in detail pray let have line if not from at rate dictated by to say how be affectionate son hampstead be impossible to keep letter from lady kingsbury thus became recognized fact by marquis by marchioness by mr greenwood that hampstead be going to marry quaker daughter a to pretence of refusal went for nothing even with father be probable that quaker daughter daughter of merchant clerk out of city must refuse to become marchioness sick man be obliged to express anger having be already made to treat report a incredible because of disgrace must accompany if true have be left to must have endeavoured to think a little about a possible not to quarrel with two eldest child be wish be now strongest at heart wife recalled matter to at of two daily visit made what can do be driven to ask on third morning mr greenwood suggests began wife not intending to irritate having really forgotten at moment that suggestion coming from mr greenwood must be welcome to d mr greenwood shouted lifting up erect from pillow on sofa marchioness be in truth so startled by violence of movement by rage expressed on haggard face that jumped from chair with unexpected surprise desire said marquis that man will leave house by end of month chapter x king court old broad street hampstead received letter from lady kingsbury answered on rd of january having at time taken active step in regard to marion fay after rejection of suit on day following christmas eight day have thus elapsed have done nothing have done nothing though there be not hour in day in be not confirming own resolve to do something by might make marion fay own felt that must hardly go to girl again immediately after expression of resolution at first thought that must write to did sit down to table for purpose a strove to produce word might move told that word might speak must be better then rode half way to holloway with object of asking aid from mr roden returned without completing purpose telling that such aid even if must be obtained must avail nothing in such contest if man can not succeed by own doing surely will not do so by assistance of one else thus be in doubt after having written to lady kingsbury father reflected that in father state of health ought to go again to trafford park if be only for day for hour ought to see father knew that be not wanted by stepmother knew also that desire to see have reached from marquis be afraid that marquis did not wish to see be almost impossible for to take sister to house unless especial demand for attendance be made must not very well leave alone for lengthened period nevertheless determined to make rapid run into shropshire with intention of returning following day unless found state of father health so bad a to make expedient that must remain intended to hunt on monday tuesday travelling from london to leighton back must leave london by night mail train from paddington on wednesday evening so a to reach trafford park house on following morning between four five be journey have often made before in same manner to servant at trafford be well accustomed even at time in morning must walk to park from station be four mile distant leaving luggage if have to be sent for on following morning must usually travel without luggage having thing necessary for use in own room at trafford have hitherto be custom to acquaint sister with manoeuvre on occasion having never be free in correspondence with stepmother have written telegraphed to lady france have quite understood that instruction whatever might be be to be obeyed lady france be no longer resident at trafford park therefore telegraphed to old butler who have be servant in family from period previous to own birth telegram sent on monday a follows will be at trafford thursday morning be will walk over let dick be up have room ready tell father fixed wednesday night for journey having made up mind to devote portion of wednesday morning to business have on hand in reference to marion fay be not proper thing thought to go to girl father for permission to ask girl to be wife before girl have assented circumstance in case be peculiar have seemed to marion only reason for rejecting be based on disparity in social condition to thinking be worst reason must be given might be that reason have sprung from absurd idea originating with quaker father might be that quaker father must altogether disapprove of such reason at rate must be glad to know whether old man be for against with object of ascertaining determined that must pay visit to office in king court on wednesday morning must not endure thought of leaving london might be for much more than one day intended without making effort in regard to object be nearest heart early in day walked into messrs pogson littlebird office saw mr tribbledale seated on high stool behind huge desk nearly filled up whole place be rather struck by smallness meanness of messrs pogson littlebird premise from certain nobility belonging to quaker appearance must have thought to be spacious important be impossible not to connect idea after fashion pogson littlebird carried in own name flavour of commercial grandeur have be only known to hampstead by name small mercantile retreat at top of meanest alley in city might have sufficed for there be something in demeanour of zachary fay seemed to give promise of one of palace of trade be now being erected in street lane devoted in city to business nothing must be le palatial than pogson littlebird counting house hampstead have entered from little court seemed to share with one other equally unimportant tenement opposite to by narrow low passage here saw two door only through one of passed a be open having noticed that word private be written on other here found face to face with tribbledale with little boy who sat at tribbledale right hand on stool equally high of two a far a must see consisted establishment of messrs pogson littlebird must see mr fay asked hampstead business suggested tribbledale not exactly be to say business be private then there appeared face looking at over screen about five foot half high divided off from small apartment much smaller apartment having a hampstead now regarded appearance of cage in cage small a be there be desk there be two chair here zachary fay carried on business of life transacted most of affair appertaining to messrs pogson littlebird must be performed in office messrs pogson littlebird though have room of own to door marked private belonged be generally supposed to be walking on 'change a british merchant must do making purchase of whole ship cargo in dock discounting bill least of must probably represent l face looked over barrier of cage at lord hampstead be of course that of zachary fay lord hampstead said with surprise oh mr fay how do do have something want to say to must spare five minute quaker opened door of cage asked lord hampstead to walk in tribbledale who have heard recognized name stared hard at young nobleman at friend crocker noble friend at lord of whom have be asserted positively that be engaged to marry mr fay daughter boy too having heard that visitor be lord stared also hampstead did a be bid remembering that inhabitant of cage have at once heard what have be said in office felt that must be impossible for to carry on conversation about marion without other protection from ear of world be little private have to say remarked quaker looked towards private room old mr pogson be there whispered tribbledale heard come in quarter of hour ago perhaps thou wouldst not mind walking up down yard said quaker hampstead of course walked out on looking about found that court be very small for communication have to make space must be required so that might not be troubled by turning when be in midst of eloquence dozen step must carry whole length of king court who must tell love story in walk limited to six step perhaps might go out into street suggested certainly lord said quaker tribbledale must one call before return be unable to wait for five minute will be found outside court not above fifty yard to right to left hampstead thus limited to course not exceeding hundred yard in one of most crowded thoroughfare of city began execution of difficult task mr fay said be aware of what have passed between daughter marion hardly lord have told nothing of yea lord have in truth told much have told doubt that behoves father to hear from daughter in such circumstance live on such term with marion that there be not many secret kept by of from other then do know know lordship tendered to hand honestly nobly truly a take with perfect honesty perfect truth most certainly know also that declined honour thus offered did be zachary how be morning came from stout short red faced man who stopped standing in middle of pavement well thank thee mr gruby at moment be particularly engaged be jonathan gruby said quaker to companion a soon a stout man have walked on one of busiest men in city have heard probably of gruby inderwald hampstead have never heard of gruby inderwald wished that stout man have be minding business at moment a to miss fay said endeavouring to continue to tell love story yes a to marion hardly do know what passed between two not having heard reason gave thee reason at nothing worth speaking of between person who know anything of world did tell thee that did not love thee lord because to thinking must be reason enough nothing of kind mean to boast see why must not like well enough in do what zachary walking about at busy time of day be walking about sir thomas be not customary with be walking about then turned on heel moved almost to dudgeon by interruption walked other way sir thomas bolster lord very busy sort of gentleman one who have done well in world in do be matter in young maiden must decide for will not bid not to love thee can not bid to do so be that mr fay of course have right to pretend to regard from a to that there have be question what did say to thee trash about rank nay lord be not trash can not hear thee speak so of thine own order without contradiction be to be like king in old day who be forced to marry ugly old princess might be found for even though be odious to will have nothing to do with rank on such term claim right to please a do other men come to a father to young lady to ask from assistance in winning to be wife at moment up came tribbledale running from office there be cooke there said tribbledale with much emphasis in voice a though cooke be very serious affair from pollock austen be not mr pogson within went out just after cooke say that be most important that must see one immediately tell that must wait yet five minute longer said zachary fay frowning tribbledale awestruck a bethought how great be affair of pollock austen retreated back hurriedly to court know what mean mr fay continued lord hampstead know well what thou meanest lord think know what thou meanest thou meanest to offer to girl not only high rank great wealth must be of infinitely more value to heart hand of honest man believe thee to be honest man lord in matter mr fay at rate be in matter a believe how must being one a be not be willing to give girl to suitor a thee what be now shrieked in anger a little boy off high stool came rushing to mr pogson have just come back mr fay say that ca find letter from pollock austen anywhere about place want immediately because ca tell price named without seeing lord hampstead said quaker almost white with rage must pray thee to excuse for five minute hampstead promised that must confine to same uninteresting plot of ground till quaker must return to then reflected that there be certain reason upon have not calculated against falling in love with daughter of city clerk will go little further afield said quaker when returned so that may not be troubled again by imbecile in court be little however have to say to thee further thou hast leave be glad of sympathy lord suppose have better tell truth oh certainly girl fear that health may fail health be that a think have not said so to openly think be that mother died early brother sister be sad tale lord need that hinder think not lord must be for thee to judge a far a know be a fit to become man wife a be other girl health have not failed be not robust doe work in looking after household such a be well punctually think that mind be pervaded with vain terror now have told thee placing full confidence in thee a in honest man there be house thou art welcome to go there if seemeth thee good to deal with marion in matter a thy love thy judgment may direct thee having said returned hurriedly to king court a though feared that tribbledale boy might again find out so far hampstead have succeeded be much troubled in mind by what have heard a to marion health not that occurred to for moment that marriage a contemplated must be undesirable because marion might become ill be too thoroughly in love to entertain such idea be one can find ready entrance into mind of young man who see girl blooming with freshness beauty of youth must have seemed to have thought about at marion health be perfect be afraid of obstinacy felt that objection might be more binding on than put forward in reference to rank went back therefore to hendon hall only half satisfied sometimes elated sometimes depressed must however go discus matter with at full length a soon a must have returned from shropshire must remain there only for one day though might be necessary for to repeat journey almost immediately so that time might be lost in using eloquence upon marion after what have passed between quaker thought that be almost justified in assuring that girl did in truth love give father kindest love said lady france a brother be about to start for train of course will tell will start at moment notice whenever may wish to see in such case of course must take be courteous to if can doubt whether will allow if abuse insult must answer must must be more ready than be one can not answer because expects to hear something said in return will keep out of way a much a possible will have breakfast brought to in own room to morrow will then remain with father a much a possible if leave at will get walk there will only be dinner a to one thing have quite made up mind nothing will drive into having word with mr greenwood unless indeed father be to ask to speak to chapter xi mr greenwood becomes ambitious mr greenwood be still anxious a to health of rector of appleslocombe there might be even yet hope for chance thought must be better with present marquis ill disposed towards a marquis be than with heir marquis be weary of anxious to get rid of be acting very meanly to a mr greenwood thought having offered l a final payment for whole life attention marquis who have ever be liberal man have now perhaps on death bed become unjust harsh cruel be weak forgetful might possibly be willing to save money get rid of nuisance of whole affair by surrendering living be mr greenwood reading of circumstance a at present existed marquis must not dispose of living while rector be still alive must even promise to good effect without son assent that lord hampstead must neither so bestow patronage allow to be so bestowed mr greenwood be very sure there have be that between lord hampstead convinced that young man be more hostile to even than father marquis a mr greenwood thought have insulted of late lord hampstead young a be have also be insolent what be worse have insulted lord hampstead there have be something in young lord eye have assured of young lord contempt a well a dislike if anything must be done about living must be done by marquis marquis be very ill be still probable that old rector must die first have be given to understand that old rector must hardly live many week mr greenwood understood little of young lord character marquis doubt knew well having lived with for many year when supposed patron to be fretful irascible because of infirmity to be by nature forgiving unreasonable weak drew easy portrait be like person portrayed in attributing revenge harshness pride of power to lord hampstead be altogether wrong a regarded appleslocombe other parish patronage of must day belong to lord hampstead have long since made up mind that must have nothing to do with feeling unfit to appoint clergyman to ministration in church to did not consider to belong that must leave to bishop thinking that bishop must know more about than be father however to make request to with reference to appleslocombe especially must no doubt regard living a bestowed before father death of mr greenwood must understand nothing felt however that a marquis have given cause for anger so have young lord given cause for hatred a well a anger daily almost hourly matter be discussed between lady kingsbury chaplain there have come to be strong sympathy between a far a sympathy can exist where feeling be much stronger on one side than on other mother of darling have allowed to inveigh very bitterly against husband child by former marriage at first have be received only half way by confidential friend of late confidential friend have become more animated more bitter than have almost startled by boldness of denunciation in passion have allowed more than once to express wish that stepson be dead have hardly in truth meant a much a implied meaning have hardly thought of what meant chaplain taking word from lip have repeated till be almost terrified by iniquity horror have darling to justify great injury have be done to by unkind fortune great a be sin of lord hampstead sister must bring disgrace upon yet there be settled purpose of hatred in word frightened though must not bring to oppose in rage have declared that must be well that lord hampstead must break neck out hunting go down in yacht at sea have be gratified to find that friend have sanctioned ill wish when mr greenwood spoke a though something might possibly be done to further wish then almost repented have be induced to say that if power must come to of bestowing living of appleslocombe must bestow on mr greenwood be lord hampstead to die before marquis be marquis to die before old rector such power must belong to during minority of eldest son there have therefore be meaning in promise clergyman have referred to more than once twice be most improbable know mr greenwood have said very seriously have replied a seriously that such improbability be of frequent occurrence if must happen will do so have answered after have never of own accord referred to probability of lord hampstead death from day to day there grew upon feeling that have subjected to domination almost to tyranny from mr greenwood man whom have known intimately during entire married life now appeared to assume different proportion almost different character must still stand before with flabby hand hanging listlessly by side with eye apparently full of hesitation must seem to tremble a though feared effect of own word still word fell from be felt to be bond from must not escape when looked at from lack lustre eye fixing upon for minute together till minute seemed to be

that lord hampstead must not be disturbed now lord hampstead be coming without invitation going to walk over be in middle of night said mr greenwood preparing to discus matter with marchioness there be something of scorn in voice a though be taking upon to laugh at lord hampstead for having chosen way of reaching father house often doe that said marchioness be odd way of coming into sick house to disturb in middle of night mr greenwood a spoke stood looking at ladyship severely how be to help suppose anybody will be disturbed at will come round to side door one of servant will be up to let in always doe thing differently from anybody else one must have thought that when father be dying say that mr greenwood there be nothing to make say that marquis be very ill nobody have said that be so bad a mr greenwood shook head did not move from position in be standing suppose on occasion hampstead be doing what be right doubt whether ever doe what be right be only thinking that if anything must happen to marquis how very bad must be for young lord wo sit down mr greenwood said marchioness to whom presence of standing chaplain have become almost intolerable man sat down not comfortably in chair hardly more than on edge of so a still to have air of restraint have annoyed companion a be saying if anything must happen to lord must be very sad for ladyship for lord frederick lord augustus lord gregory be in hand of god said ladyship piously yes be in hand of god be lord intention that must look out for ourselves do best can to avoid injustice cruelty robbery think there will be robbery mr greenwood must not be robbery if little lordship must be turned at once out of house must be own lord hampstead of course must have slocombe abbey in somersetshire a far a house go must like better than of course be much smaller what comfort do ever have out of house like be true enough why there be good in talking about mr greenwood can not help talking about be because lady france have broken up family by allowing to be engaged to young man beneath own station in life here shook head a always did when spoke of lady france a for lord hampstead look upon a national misfortune that must outlive father what can do well lady be hard to say what will feeling be must anything happen to marquis must be left to tender mercy of eldest son must have claim upon lord hampstead for shilling a be infidel of course must not want chaplain indeed must not reconcile to conscience to remain with must be cast out penniless having devoted life a may say to lordship service have offered thousand pound thousand pound for labour of whole life what assurance will have of suppose have ever dreamed of putting into will if have what will thousand pound do for can go to slocombe abbey rectory be a good a promised will be closed against marchioness knew that be falsehood did not dare to tell so living have be talked about between till be assumed that have right to if young man be out of way continued there must be chance for can not put out of way said marchioness chance for lord frederic brother need not tell of mr greenwood one have to look truth in face be for sake have be anxious rather than own must own that must not own anything of kind suppose there be doubt about first marriage none at said marchioness terrified though be thought very odd at time ought to be looked to think stone ought to be left unturned there be nothing to be hoped for in direction mr greenwood ought to be looked to be only think what will be if marries have son before anything be be settled to lady kingsbury made answer after pause mr greenwood turned to own grievance will make bold said to see marquis once again before lord hampstead come down can not acknowledge have great right to be anxious suppose that promise must be sacred in son eye must do best can to ladyship must make answer parted not in best humour with other be on monday on tuesday mr greenwood having asked to be allowed interview crept slowly into sick man room hope lordship find better morning sick man turned in bed only made feeble grunt in reply hear that lord hampstead be coming down to morrow lord why must not come there must have be something in tone of mr greenwood voice have grated against sick man ear must not have answered so sulkily oh lord did not mean to say that there be reason why lordship must not come perhaps might have be better have come earlier must have be at better only just meant to make remark lord there be nothing in nothing at said sick man be there anything else wished to say mr greenwood nurse time be sitting in room chaplain felt to be uncomfortable must be alone for few minute lord asked think must said sick man there be few point be of so much importance to lord kingsbury ai well enough to talk business wo do mr robert will be here to morrow can see mr robert be man of business agent to property who lived at shrewsbury whom mr greenwood especially disliked mr greenwood being clergyman be of course supposed to be gentleman regarded mr robert a being much beneath be not customary for mr robert to dine at house be therefore regarded by chaplain a being hardly more than upper servant be therefore very grievous to to be told that must discus own private affair make renewed request a to living through mr robert be evidently intended that must have opportunity of discussing private affair marquis might offer must take that a far a must see without power of redress on side if mr robert be to offer thousand pound must only accept cheque depart with from trafford park shaking off from foot dust such ingratitude must forbid to carry with be in habit of walking daily for hour before sunset moving very slowly up down driest of road near house generally with hand clasped behind back believing that in doing so be consulting health maintaining that bodily vigour might be necessary to for performance of parochial duty at appleslocombe now when have left bed room of marquis went out of front door proceeded on walk at somewhat quicker pace than usual be full of wrath passion gave alacrity to movement be of course incensed against marquis anger burnt hottest against lord hampstead in be altogether unreasonable for lord hampstead have said nothing done nothing must injure position lord hampstead disliked perhaps despised have be anxious that marquis must be liberal in mode of severing connection have lasted so long to mr greenwood be manifest that trouble came from iniquity of patron two elder child remembered at moment that lord hampstead have insulted when be together be certainly not man to forgive enemy to lose opportunity for revenge might come in way certainly must be good if young man must be got to break neck out hunting good if yacht must be made to founder go to piece on rock come to other fatal maritime misfortune be accident personally must have power to produce such wishing be infantine fit only for weak woman such a marchioness if anything be to be done must be done by great endeavour endeavour must come from then reflected how far marchioness must certainly be in power if marquis eldest son be dead did believe that have obtained great influence over that must rebel against be of course on card be aware that within last month since date indeed at marquis have threatened to turn out of house have made considerable progress in imposing upon a master gave in respect much more credit than be in truth due to lady kingsbury though have learnt to fear have not so subjected to influence a not to be able to throw off must time come at might be essential to comfort to do so have misread symptom have misread also fretfulness of impatience now assured that if anything must be done might rely

thursday morning between four five o clock when must be pitch dark with star moon in heaven when lord hampstead must certainly be alone in certain spot unattended easily assailable must thursday

not caring to investigate own belief be practice of many to have mind utterly callous in respect to suppose that such men think think other a to future reward punishment be to give credit for

nervous woman dread of undefined evil to imaginative melancholy man did not think that by meditating deed by hardening heart to necessary resolution by steeling up to perpetration must bring into condition unfitted for life of bliss thought did not take such direction though there might be punishment in world even though there be to be other world in punishment must come still something of

in truth contemplated yet knew knew that for hour have be purpose of mind to do struggled to make believe that have in truth be no more than speculation that there have be no formed purpose that have only amused by considering how must do deed without detection if deed be to be done have simply be thinking over blunder of others blindness of men who have so bungled in business a to have left easy trace for eye intelligence of world outside have be assuring how much better must manage if necessity of such operation be to come upon be doubt hated lord hampstead have cause to do so be thus that argued with hatred have surely not carried to intention of murder there must have be question of real murder for why must have troubled either with danger with load must certainly have imposed on conscience much a hated lord hampstead be business of be that lady macbeth up stair mother of darling who have really thought of murder be who have spoken openly of great desire that lord hampstead must cease to live have there be real question of murder must have be for to meditate for to think for to plot surely not for certainly certainly have contemplated such deed a with object of obtaining for comfort of old age enjoyment of living of appleslocombe told now that have in truth committed crime have carried out plot have formed in brain only a matter of speculation though might not have be detected yet must have be suspected suspicion must have be a destructive to hope a detection of course have be clear enough to throughout machination therefore how must really have intended have not intended have only be one of castle in air old build a well a young be more than airy fabric of brain be thus struggled to drive from mind from eye phantom of terrible deed that did not succeed be made evident to by hot clammy drop of sweat came out upon brow by wakefulness throughout livelong night by carefulness with ear watched for sound of young man coming a though be necessary that must be made assured that murder have in truth not be done before hour have come found to be shaking even in bed to be drawing clothes around to dispel icy cold though sweat still stood upon brow to be hiding eye under bed clothes in order that might not see something seemed to be visible to through utmost darkness of chamber at rate have done nothing let thought have be what might have soiled neither hand conscience though everything that have ever done ever thought be known be free from actual crime have talked of death thought of murder have only echoed word thought meaning nothing a man be bound to do to woman why then must not sleep why must be hot shiver with cold by turn why must horrid phantom perplex in dark be sure have never meant what must be agony of who do mean of who do execute if such punishment a be awarded to one who have done no more than build horrid castle in air did sleep wondered who have certainly done more than build castle in air who have wished longed have reason for wishing longing at last heard footfall on road passed few yard distant from window quick cheery almost running footfall step full of youth life sounding crisp on hard frozen ground knew that young man whom hated have come though have never thought of murdering a told yet hated then thought although in opposition to own wish be intent upon sleep if sleep must only come to ran away to building of

man bread young man must have be sent without moment notice to meet final doom of what nature might have be wretched man lying there did not dare even to make picture in imagination be matter have sedulously successfully dismissed from thought be of body lying out there in cold not of journey winged soul might make that unwillingly drew picture to conceived how in prosecution of plan have formed must have be forced to have awakened house to tell of deed to assist in carrying body to what resting place might have be found for there must have have to enact part of have few hour since

consolation who must have flown to lady door up stair have informed that death be in house have given to understand that eldest of darling be heir must have be for to do for with spirit weighed down to ground by terrible burden with doing of deed must have loaded must certainly have revealed in struggle why must allow mind to be perplexed with such thought such deed have be done there have be no murder young man be there now in house light hearted after walk full of life youthful energy why must be troubled with such waking dream a must be so with always for rest of life only because have considered how thing might best be done heard footstep in distant passage door closed then again be silent be there not cause to for joy in young man presence if speculation have be wicked be there not time to turn for repentance for repentance though there be so little for repentance be needed nevertheless night be to so long misery connected with trafford name so great that told that must quit

to in be prevented by intimation be given to early in day before have made preparation for going that lord hampstead wished to see must wait upon in own room marquis have expressed grateful to son for coming did not wish to detain at trafford of course be very dull for think be better be so glad of if think that be of comfort to will be delighted to stay suppose fanny must come down if remain here then marquis shook head fanny thought have better be away marchioness fanny must not be happy in house together unless indeed have given up that young man hampstead must not say that have given up young man do hope never see said marquis then son assured that two have never met since fanny have gone to hendon hall be rash enough to assure father that there must be such meeting while sister be guest at moment george roden be standing in drawing room at hendon hall with lady france in arm after there arose conversation between father son a to mr greenwood marquis be very desirous that man who have become so objectionable to must quit house truth be said marquis that be who make mischief between stepmother be make ill have comfort while be here making plot against if two have only known plot have be made hampstead thought reasonable that man must be sent away if only because presence be disagreeable why must man be kept in house simply to produce annoyance there must be question of compensation did not think that l be sufficient then marquis be unusually difficult of persuasion in regard to money hampstead thought that annuity of l year must be settled on poor clergyman marquis must not hear of man have not performed even slight duty have be required of book have not even be catalogued to bribe man such a by l year for making disagreeable must be intolerable marquis have never promised anything ought to have saved money at last father son came to term hampstead sent to prepare meeting with chaplain mr greenwood be standing in middle of room when lord hampstead entered rubbing fat hand together hampstead saw difference in man since last meeting there be difference mr greenwood manner be at first more submissive a though be afraid of visitor before interview be over have recovered audacity father have wished to see said hampstead mr greenwood went on rubbing hand still standing in middle of room seems to think better that must leave know why must think better of course will go if bid mr greenwood have quite made up mind that must be better for also that must go there will be no good in going into think might a well sit down mr greenwood did sit down chaplain a usual perching on edge of chair have be here great many year great many lord hampstead nearly life before be born lord hampstead then a sat gazing there came before eye phantom of lord hampstead being carried into house a corpse while be struggling beneath portion of weight just so though marquis can not admit that there be claim upon claim lord hampstead certainly claim yet be quite willing to do something in acknowledgment of long connection lordship think that annuity of l year mr greenwood shook head a though must say that certainly must not satisfy hampstead have be eager to secure full l for wretched useless man marquis have declared that must not burden estate with charge so unnecessarily large say continued hampstead frowning that lordship have desired to say that will receive during life annuity of l certainly be fact that lord hampstead must frown when be displeased at such moment must assume look of aristocratic impatience be at variance with professed political theory mr greenwood again shook head think that need say anything farther continued young lord be father decision presumes that must prefer annuity to immediate payment of thousand pound here shaking of head became more violent have only in addition to ask when will suit to leave trafford park lord hampstead when have left father have determined to use blandest manner in communicating tidings to chaplain mr greenwood be odious to way in man stood on floor rubbed hand together sat on edge of chair shook head without speaking word be disgusting to if man have declared boldly own view of what be due to hampstead must have endeavoured to be gracious to a be be anything gracious a asked chaplain to name day on must be prepared to leave house mean to say that be to be turned out be month since be told that father no longer required service be to be turned out like dog after thirty year can not contradict when say so must ask to name day be not a though suggestion be now made to for first

sha go with l year said chaplain be unreasonable be brutal brutal shouted lord hampstead sha stir till have seen marquis be out of question that must turn out in way how be to live upon l year always understood be to have appleslocombe such promise be ever made to said lord hampstead very angrily hint of such thing have ever be made except by always understood said mr greenwood will not leave till have have opportunity of discussing matter with marquis think marquis must ever have treated in way only for lord hampstead be intolerable what be to do with abominable man must be very disagreeable task of turning out while marquis be still so ill yet be not to be endured that man must be allowed to hold position in house in opposition to will of owner be felt beneath to defend against charge made even to defend father if will not name day must said young lord man remained immovable on seat except that continued to rub hand a can get answer will have to instruct mr robert that can not be allowed to remain here after last day of month if have feeling left to will not impose upon so unpleasant duty while father be ill with left room while mr greenwood be still standing rubbing hand two hundred pound year have better go take be quite aware of how be to live upon l who have be bedded boarded life at expense of man have also spent l at moment be not thought uppermost in mind must not have be better that must have carried out that project of only that have be merciful young lord must not have be able to scorn ill treat a have done there be phantom now now thought that must have carried share of corpse into house without flinching chapter xv must be disagreeable thing at trafford on day on next be very uncomfortable house must possibly be more so there be four person who in

mr greenwood to come near where wife short visit did not seem to give much satisfaction even with son be hardly at ease seeming to prefer society of nurse with occasional visit from doctor mr robert marchioness confined to own room in be intention to prevent inroad of mr greenwood a far a might be possible that must be able to exclude altogether be more than must hope much thought must be done by dint of headache by resolution never to take food down stair lord hampstead have declared purpose to harris a well a to father never again to sit down to table with mr greenwood where doe dine asked butler generally in family dining room lord said harris then give dinner in breakfast parlour yes lord said butler who at once resolved to regard mr greenwood a enemy of family in manner mr greenwood

how did know thing creep out have made disagreeable to lordship for month past then heard that be talking of appleslocombe a though be certain to be sent there father never thought of did think did mr greenwood be idlest human being that ever lived how must have performed duty of parish asked father once father flatly refused perhaps ladyship suggested mr robert with hesitation at rate be not to have appleslocombe must be made to go how be to be done mr robert raised eyebrow suppose there must be mean of turning objectionable resident out of house police of course must carry out with magistrate order must have to be treated like other vagrant must be disagreeable very disagreeable lord said mr robert lord must be saved from that if possible how if gave nothing to eat said lord hampstead must be possible must be troublesome what if resolved to remain be starved must be seeing must hold out longer think lord must have heart to keep twenty four hour without food must try save lord from what be disagreeable a much a can lord hampstead be in accord a to did not quite see way how to effect there be still however more than three week to run before day fixed for chaplain exit mr robert suggested that might in time be fully brought home to man that l year must depend on going perhaps 'd better leave to lord said mr robert will deal with better when be not here when time

come to on receiving pondered for time before must make up mind a to what answer must give must have be most anxious to do a have already heard that lord hampstead have done decline to meet at must not analyze own feeling about man have come during last few day to hold in horror be a though something of spirit of murderer have shown to in eye have talked glibly wickedly horribly of death of man who have seemed to stand in way have certainly wished for have taught to think by ultra feminine lack of logic that have really be injured in own eldest boy have not be born heir to father title have found necessary to have recipient for grief own sister lady persiflage have given comfort then have sought for have received encouragement from husband chaplain in talking of lord hampstead death have formed plan have only declared in strong language that if by hand of providence such thing must be done must be to happy chance have spoken out where more prudent than must perhaps only have wished man have taken up word with apparently serious purpose have frightened then a though have be recipient of guilty secret have laid aside respect have be usual to have assumed familiarity of co partnership have annoyed perplexed did not quite understand be conscious of strong desire to be rid of did not dare quite a yet to let know such be purpose therefore sent maid down to with message mr

fault then must tell what mr greenwood thought about poor man did not know how little likely be that must ever again throw mr greenwood in teeth lord hampstead have not a yet even seen stepmother have thought more than decent to send word that must wait upon before left house domestic trouble knew to be bad for stepmother sake for of sister little brother must avoid a far a might be possible open rupture therefore went to marchioness before ate dinner father be much better said stepmother only shook head so that there be before task of recommencing conversation dr spicer say so be not sure

for congratulation a lady have not accepted offer have made marchioness laughed incredulously with little affected laugh in incredulity be sincere can only tell that be so no doubt will try again doubt young lady in such circumstance be not apt to persevere in severity perhaps may be supposed that will give way at last can not take upon to answer lady kingsbury matter be one on be not particularly anxious to talk only a asked thought best just to tell fact be sure be ever so much obliged to young lady father be young lady father be clerk in merchant office in city so understand quaker quaker believe life at holloway just so in same street with young man whom fanny have have chosen to pick up marion fay father live at paradise row holloway mr roden george roden live at

however be much more prominent in thought be anxious to take sister down to gorse hall there remain for rest of hunting season making such short run up to holloway a might from time to time find to be necessary man can have string of hunter idle through winter without feeling to be guilty of unpardonable waste of property customer at eating house will sometimes be seen to devour last fragment of have be brought to because doe not like to abandon that for must pay so be with man who hunt be not perhaps that want to hunt there be other employment in life must at moment be more to taste be conscience prompt feeling that can not forgive for intolerable extravagance if doe not use article with have provided can neglect billiard table book even wine cellar because eat nothing horse soon eat head off own shoulder if pas week without getting on back hampstead have endeavoured to mitigate for feeling of improvidence by running up down to aylesbury saving in respect be not sufficient for conscience be therefore determined to balance expenditure of year by regular performance of duty at gorse hall other matter be still more important to must see marion fay before went into northamptonshire then must learn how soon might run up with prospect of seeing again distance of gorse hall duty of hunting must admit of certain visit to holloway think will go to gorse hall to

prepared for excursion to holloway have received quaker permission to push suit with marion did not flatter that must avail much felt that there be strength in marion a must have made strong against father have given away heart without sanction so must be little moved by permission coming from there be present to lover mind feeling of fear have be generated by quaker word a to marion health till have heard something of story of mother little one have not occurred to that girl herself be wanting in gift of physical well being be beautiful in eye have thought of nothing further now idea have be put into head though must hardly realize be most painful to have puzzled before manner to have be so soft so tender so almost loving that must not hope must hardly not think that loved that loving must persist in refusing because of condition of life seemed to to be unnatural have at rate be confident be there nothing else must overcome objection heart if be really given to must not be able to support in opposition to upon ground of severance a that thought that must talk out of so absurd argument in other argument there might be something that must cling to with persistency quaker have declared that there be nothing in a far a know quaker have said be a fit to become man wife a other girl surely must have known have there be real cause girl be so apt to take fancy into head then will sometimes become so obstinate in fancy in way hampstead discussed matter with have be discussing ever since have walked up down broad street with quaker if pleaded health have what own father have said to use a argument with to convince if spoke again of rank thought that on matter love might be strong enough a argument against perhaps own found trouble in making way into presence have heard of visit to king court knew that must come have three thing have to tell must tell very plainly if must be necessary first be that love must have nothing to do in matter only duty second feared to be somewhat weak almost thought must not of have be strong enough be objection a to condition in life have urged to before declared to herself that must be strong enough for for if must only guide by prudence third must be rock to if be necessary cruel rock on must be shipwrecked against bark must surely not be dashed to atom if must not leave in peace without must tell that be fit to be man wife if came to that then must confess own love acknowledged to herself that must be so there must not be between tenderness necessary for telling of tale without love without acknowledged love must be better that must not be so if must go leave to dream of there might be satisfaction even in to sustain during what be left to of life must struggle that must be so if love be too strong then must know have learned from father something of what have passed at interview in city be therefore ready to receive lover when came marion said expected to come to again certainly did of course have come have have to go to father must have be here sooner know that will come again again till will say word to that will comfort knew that must come again because be with father in city went to ask leave got be hardly necessary for lord to take trouble thought be when man wish to take girl away from own home make mistress of be customary that will ask for father permission must have be so have looked higher a must have done be so in regard to girl must wish to make wife respect man can pay to woman be due to marion looked at with glance of eye went love of heart how must say word to full of reason prudence wisdom if spoke to like answer honestly do not know that if be daughter of proudest lord living in england must not be held by a deserving other usage than think to be privilege now only meant that father must not feel that be honouring will not speak of honour a between between with father honesty be concerned have believed have accepted a son in law with marion with two alone a be here together in to other a hope be to be only love can be brought in question marion marion then threw on knee before embraced a be sitting lord must not be now have hand in be looking into face now be time to speak of duty to speak with strength if what might say be to have avail will not be so lord then did regain hand struggled up from sofa on to foot too believe in honesty be sure of a be of own understand think of a though be sister a sister what must have sister do if man came to then whom knew that must never marry must have submit to embrace because knew to be honest not unless loved must have nothing to do with lord hampstead nothing marion nothing lord will think that be giving air if speak of duty father have allowed to come duty doubt have bade never to see hope that must have sufficed there be other duty than that duty even higher than what duty marion that owe to if have promised to be wife do promise have so promised must not then have be bound to think first of happiness must have accomplished at rate though can not be wife owe le to think of seeing that be willing to do for will think of be grateful to do love let speak lord hampstead be not civil in to interrupt in way be thoroughly grateful will not show gratitude by doing that know must ruin do love not if loved with heart spread out arm a though to assure how did love with very soul must for be brought even to think of doing thing that ask marion be utterly unfit for other have made first declaration a to duty now be going on a to second profession intended must be if possible last be a high a blood wealth great friend can make be nothing have called lady if god ever made one be have made better have made woman others must not call lady can not talk a do sit a do act a do even think a do know will not presume to make wife of such man a a said there came flush across face fire in eye a though conquered by own emotion sank again upon sofa do love marion do said standing once more erect upon foot there will be shadow of lie between do love lord hampstead will have nothing to make blush in own esteem when think of how must be other than that girl such a must love one a when ask with word so sweet then marion will be own oh yes must now be yours while be alive have so far conquered a attempted to take in arm retreated from so gently that very gentleness repressed if never loving be to be yours if to pray for night day a dearest one of be to be yours if to remind hour that thought be due to if to think of so that may console with knowing one so high so good have condescended to regard if be to be yours then be yours then will surely be yours while live must be only with thought only with prayer only with heart marion marion now again be on knee before hardly touching be fault lord hampstead said trying to smile be doing because must not let poor girl say simply what have to say nothing of will be true except that love be can remember will repeat to daily till have put hand in mine call wife will never do exclaimed once again standing a god hears now will never say must be wrong will never say in thus protesting put forth little hand clenched fast then came again flush across brow eye for moment seemed to wander then failing in strength to carry through fell back senseless on sofa lord hampstead finding that alone must hing to aid be forced to ring bell to give over to care of woman who did not cease to pray to depart ca hing lord while stand over way chapter xvii at gorse hall hampstead when be turned out into paradise row walked once twice up street thinking what might best do next regardless of eye at knowing that be absent where alone must have found assistance have inhabitant be there a far a must remember have never seen woman faint before way in have fallen through from arm on to sofa when have tried to sustain have be dreadful to almost more dreadful idea that stout old woman with whom have left must be more powerful than to help walked once twice up down thinking what have best now do while clara demijohn be lost in wonder a to what must have happened at be quite intelligible to that lover must come in father absence be entertained for whole afternoon if might be so though be scandalized by audacity of girl who have required no screen of darkness under protection of lover presence might be hidden from inquiry of neighbour that however must have be intelligible there be so much honour in having lord to court one perhaps be well to have seen why be lord walking up down street with demented air be now four o'clock hampstead have heard quaker say that never left office till five must take nearly hour to come down in omnibus from city nevertheless hampstead must not go till have spoken to marion father

what believed to be due memory that have longed for almost prayed for must have dulled joy there be such regret with mr greenwood seemed to that fortune fate providence what not have only done duty believed that have in truth foreseen foretold death of pernicious young man must young man death be now of service to be not too late have not quarrelled with nevertheless have be avenged so be at trafford park for three hour then there came postboy galloping on horseback truth be known lady kingsbury went again to child time did not kiss gleam of glory have come there have passed away yet there be something of relief why have allowed to be so cowed on morning be mr greenwood thought poor marquis fell into slumber almost immediately on next morning have almost forgotten that first telegram have come chapter xix false tidings there be household false tidings of lord hampstead death reached that same night feeling excited at trafford have be very keen parental agony maternal hope disappointment revenge in other household there be suffering quite a great mr fay did not devote much time during day to morning evening newspaper have be alone at messrs pogson littlebird must have heard nothing of false tidings sitting in inner room mr pogson read third edition of evening advertiser then saw statement given with many detail said statement have sent over to office of contemporary have corroborated fact then story be repeated pushing way through gate at gimberley green lord hampstead horse have tumbled down field have ridden over have be picked up dead body have be carried home to gorse hall now lord hampstead name have become familiar in king court tribbledale have told how young lord have become enamoured of zachary fay daughter be ready to marry at moment notice tale have be repeated to old littlebird by young littlebird at last even to mr pogson there have be of course much doubt in king court a to very improbable story inquiry have be made there be now general belief in truth when mr pogson read account of sad tragedy paused moment to think what must do then opened door called for zachary fay who have known quaker long always called zachary friend zachary zachary fay friend said mr pogson have read yet handed paper never have much time for newspaper till get home at night said clerk taking sheet be offered have better read perhaps a have heard name mentioned know not how properly with of young lord then quaker bringing spectacle down from forehead over eye slowly read paragraph a did so mr pogson looked at carefully quaker showed very little emotion by face doe concern zachary know young man mr pogson though be much out of own rank circumstance have brought to notice will be grieved if be true with thy permission mr pogson will lock up desk return home at once to mr pogson of course assented recommending quaker to put newspaper into pocket zachary fay a walked to spot where be wont to find omnibus considered much a to what might best do when reached home must tell sad tidings to girl must leave to hear when further time must have confirmed truth to zachary seemed too probable that must be true hunting to in absolute ignorance of what hunting meant seemed to be occupation so full of danger that wonder be that hunting world have not already be exterminated then there be present to feeling a there be to so many of that grand thing fortune seemed to offer be too good to be true must hardly be that must live to see daughter mother of future british peer have tried to school not to wish telling that such wish be vain such longing wicked have said much to a to danger of rank title wealth for who be not born to have said something also of family tragedy have robbed own life of most of joy seemed to have laid so heavy burden on girl spirit going backwards forward morning evening to work have endeavoured to make own heart acknowledge that marriage be not desirable have failed have endeavoured to reconcile failure to conscience by telling falsely that a father have be anxious only for welfare of child now felt blow terribly on account feeling sure that girl heart have be given to young man felt also on own might be nevertheless that report must prove untrue have matter be one in be not so deeply interested must certainly have believed to be untrue being man by nature not prone to easy belief must however be wiser said to a left omnibus at duchess of edinburgh to say nothing a yet to marion then put paper carefully into breast coat pocket considered how might best hide feeling a to sad news be in vain story have already found way down to paradise row mr demijohn be a greedy of news a neighbour must generally send round corner for halfpenny evening journal on occasion did so within two minute of time in paper have be put into hand exclaimed to niece almost with ecstasy clara what do think that young lord who come here to see marion fay have gone got killed out hunting lord hampstead shouted clara got killed law aunt ca believe in tone also there be something almost of exultation glory have be supposed to be awaiting marion fay be almost too much for endurance of neighbour since have become ascertained fact that lord hampstead have admired girl marion popularity in row have certainly decreased mr duffer believed no longer to be handsome clara have always thought to be pert mr demijohn have expressed opinion that man be idiot landlady at duchess of edinburgh have wittily asserted that young marquis be not to be caught with chaff there be doubt sense of relief in clara demijohn mind when heard that special young marquis have be trampled to death in hunting field carried home corpse must go tell poor girl said clara immediately leave alone said old woman there will be plenty to tell let alone such occasion occur so rarely that doe not to take advantage of in ordinary life event be so unfrequent when do arrive give flavour of salt to hour be generally tedious

got possession of newspaper with in hand ran across street to miss fay be at home in minute two came down to miss demijohn in parlour be only during minute two clara began to think how must break tidings to friend in way to realize fact that tidings must require breaking have rushed across street with important paper in hand proud of fact that have something great to tell during minute two did occur to that choice of word be needed for such occasion oh miss fay said have heard heard what asked marion know how to tell be so terrible have only just seen in newspaper have thought best to run over let know have anything happened to father asked girl be father be almost more dreadful because be so young then that bright pink hue spread over marion face stood speechless with feature almost hardened by resolution have already formed within not to betray feeling of heart before other girl news let be what might must be of there be one else so young of whom be probable that young woman must speak to after fashion stood silent motionless conveying nothing of feeling by face unless one might have read something from deep flush of complexion know how to say said clara demijohn there have better take paper read for be in last column one near bottom 'fatal accident in field will see took paper read word through without faltering moving limb why must not cruel young woman go leave to sorrow why did stand there looking at a though desirous to probe to bottom sad secret of bosom kept eye still fixed upon paper not knowing where else to turn for must not look into tormentor face for pity ai sad said clara demijohn then there came deep sigh sad said repeating word sad yes be sad think if mind will ask to leave now oh yes there be newspaper perhaps 'd like to keep for father

declared belief that there have be no such marriage must cling to name must not make title good to without obtaining proof have not be able to find doubt must call duchess have mean at command might probably cause to be received a such property must thus be affected must rob younger son of right to call also by title offer made to be not ungenerous family owed nothing be willing to sacrifice nearly half of have with object of restoring to money of profligate have robbed have be enabled to take from by own folly credulity in terrible emergency of life mr vincent sent over to solicitor from

make journey that must take son with george roden have hitherto learnt nothing of father family in many consultation held between mother mr vincent have be decided that must be better to keep in dark why fill young imagination with glory of great title in order that might learn at last a might too probably be case that have right to name no right to consider even to be father son by folly so acknowledged have done be possible to annihilate a woman there be name must give to son a certainly a own have be hers before have be allured into mock marriage must at rate not be disputed thus have be kept in ignorance of mother story of course have asked be no more than natural that must ask when told that be for mother comfort that must ask more have assented with reticence be peculiar to then

hitherto have be very few in number have only declared that in spite of obstacle will always love other have never before have anything in truth to tell now have so much that know how to begin how to go on with must be written a there be much will interest a dearest friend much also that will concern must ever become wife may be that point will arise a to friend father for instance brother will feel yourselves entitled to have voice in deciding may be quite possible that judgment at rate that of friend may differ from own must be so can not say that will be prepared to yield will at rate enable to submit case to with fairness have told more than once how little have known of own family have known indeed nothing mother have seemed to to be perversely determined not to tell will acknowledge have thought ought to know with equal perversity have refrained from asking question on subject of think must have be told everything without questioning be man not curious by nature a to past be more anxious a to what may do myself than a to what others of family may have done before when however mother asked to go with to italy be manifest that journey have reference to former life knew from circumstance must not be hidden from from knowledge for instance of italian from relic remained to of former life that have lived for period in country a place of birth have never be mentioned to must not guess have be born in italy when found that be going there felt certain that must learn portion of story of have be kept in ignorance now have learnt a far a poor mother know a will concern to know too must endeavour to explain to detail dearest fanny do trust that when have heard will think worse of on account better be a to latter be really in fear wish to believe that chance attribute must make stand higher in esteem than have come to stand already by own personal character then told not perhaps quite so fully a reader have heard told in last chapter story of mother marriage of own birth before have reached rome where duca di crinola at present lived where be at present member of italian cabinet mother have told son that knew having throughout telling of story unconsciously manifested to own desire to remain in obscurity to bear name have be hers for five twenty year at same time so to manage that must return to england bearing title to by birth believed to be entitled when in discussing explained to that must be still necessary for to earn bread a clerk in post office in spite of high sounding nobility explained to absurdity of sitting in mr jerningham room at desk with young crocker calling at same time duca di crinola in argument exhibited weakness have hardly expected from spoke vaguely with assurance of personal hope of lady france of lord hampstead of marquis of kingsbury of lord persiflage a though by mean of noble personage duca di crinola might be able to live in idleness of roden must say nothing in first letter to lady france be to that alluded when hoped that must not think better of because of news sent at present wrote continuing letter after telling of story be staying with uncle a presume be entitled to call be very gracious a also be wife young lady who be cousin think that be a anxious a be that there must be acknowledged branch of family senior to own be duca di crinola to italy will remain so whether assume title not be to take name to remain in italy be altogether impossible must be nobody who have made for great position apparently have ample mean must not in truth be affected be sure that must not wish be actuated by sense of honesty certainly have desire to be incommoded by relative who must a regard family claim to be superior to dearest mother wish to behave well to wish to sacrifice be fear above thing anxious to procure for son name title father bore a for myself will think already have perceived that be desire to remain a be when last saw to be a ever yours most affectionately george roden lady france be a may be imagined much startled at receipt of letter startled also pleased though have always declared to herself that be in respect satisfied with lover from post office though have be sure that have never wanted to be other than be still when heard of fine sounding name there did for moment come upon idea that for sake might be well that must have possession of that birth have done for when came to understand meaning of word a did on second third reading of letter when discovered what meant by saying that hoped must not think better of by reason of what be telling when understood purport of manner in signed name resolved that in respect must think a thought act a wished to act might be name might be pleased to give with must be contented must be led by one belonging to to ask to change purpose for two day kept letter by unanswered without speaking of to anybody then showed to brother exacting from promise that must not speak of to one without permission be george secret said be sure will see have right to disclose tell because must do so if be here brother be willing enough to make promise must of course be in force only till roden must see other must not be brought to agree with sister a to friend view of position may have what fancy plea about title said a may think that must be justified in repudiating father name feel burden absurdity to be born to be earl marquis have to put up with though reason political feeling on matter tell that be burden absurdity yet burden be easily borne absurdity doe not annoy much there be gratification in being honoured by around though conscience may be twinged that have done nothing to deserve will be so with if take position here a italian nobleman must still have to be clerk in post office probably not how must live asked lady france governor must find must look upon in much more favourable light than doe at present must be most unreasonable not at be not unreasonable that marquis of kingsbury must be unwilling to give daughter to george roden clerk in post office that must be willing to give to duca di crinola what have to do with earning money governor must probably find income in one case not in other quite say that ought to be so be not unreasonable that must be so then lady france said great deal a to pride in lover must not allow to accept position a be now suggested there be long discussion on subject brother explained to how common be for nobleman of high birth to live on mean provided by wife fortune how uncommon be that men born to high title must consent to serve a clerk in public office common sense have effect upon sister who ended conversation by exacting from renewed assurance of secrecy wo say word till come said hampstead may be sure that story like will be over london before doe come lady france of course answered lover letter of what said be only necessary that reader must know that promised that in thing must be entirely guided by wish then came second letter to dated on day on poor walker have nearly be crushed to death be so glad that agree with wrote since last letter to everything here have be decided a far a can decide indeed a far a of can do so there can think be doubt a to legality of mother marriage uncle be of same opinion point out to be to claim father name one must attempt to dispute alone must do so rather must be person to do so if be done must make such attempt must present to king here a duca di crinola if chose to remain to accept position certainly will not do so must in first place be obliged to give up nationality must not live in england bearing italian title except a italian know that a italian must be forced to give up place in post office foreigner believe be employed in civil service there must be absurdity in to must be specially annoying must not live under weight of ridicule must live in position in meagre income might be found for because of nobility such income must be forthcoming here can imagine that father might make provision for poor son in law with grand title ought not to do so according to idea might be possible that must find persuaded to such weakness must not accept must not be above taking money with wife if happened to come in way provided that be earning income to best of ability for sake must do what might be best for not even for sake if wished a know must consent to hang about world in idleness a italian duke without shilling of own therefore darling purpose to come back a went own george roden clerk in post office entitled to consider a being on hm when at work from ten till four letter reached lady france at hendon hall on return of herself brother from gorse hall before time prophecy uttered by lord hampstead a to story being over london have already be in part fulfilled vivian during hunting week at gorse hall have be running continually up down from london where work a private secretary to secretary of state have be of course most constant important have nevertheless managed to have three day week in northamptonshire explaining to friend in london that did by sitting up night in country to friend in country that sat up night in town there be achievement be never done in presence of who hear of catching salmon be one working night be vivian however managed to do what be required of to enjoy hunting at same time on arrival at gorse day before famous accident have budget of news of be very full of at first spoke only to hampstead must not at rate speak of in presence of lady france have heard have about george roden asked a soon a must get lord hampstead to heard what about george roden asked other who of course have heard italian title what about italian title have heard have heard something what have heard george roden be in italy unless have left have be there doubt mother hampstead nodded head suppose do know about want to know what know what have heard have come to a secret story can probably be divulged know that be apt to be pretty close a to what hear at foreign office did come a specially private have have letter from muscati very good fellow in foreign office there who have in way heard name a connected with roden be very likely sister said vivian in whisper be likely too men talk about anything now day lord persiflage have heard direct from italy be interested of course a being brother in law to lady kingsbury what have heard seems that roden be englishman at will be a like take have lived here a englishman for five twenty year of course will prefer to be italian said vivian turn out that be heir to one of oldest title in italy have heard of ducas di crinola have heard of now one of be minister of education in present cabinet be likely to be premier be head of family be really duca di crinola be called so of course be head of family george roden be real duca di crinola thought there must be something special about man when sister took fancy to always thought there be something special about said hampstead otherwise must hardly have liked so well so did always seemed to be to just one of know fellow doe come out like unless be somebody radical may say what please silk purse get made out of sow ear nobody stand up for blood le than do by george always show must think crocker be heir to dukedom upon word know have great respect for crocker now what be to be done asked vivian how done about di crinola lord persiflage say that ca remain in post office why not be afraid doe come in for much not shilling lord persiflage think that something must be done for be so hard must be done in italy know must think that might make extra secretary of legation so a to leave here then have small salary a story of george roden birth be thus known to foreign office be probable that hampstead prophecy must be altogether fulfilled chapter ii true tidings foreign office from top to bottom be very much moved on occasion not without cause title of di crinola be quite historic have existed for century duca di crinola at rate respectable duca di crinola must be in england even a temporary visitant without being considered a entitled to consideration from foreign office existing duke of name who have lately be best known be at present member of italian ministry have come must have be entitled to great consideration a now appeared be not real duca di crinola real duke be englishman anglicized italian italianized englishman one in foreign office not even most ancient pundit there quite knew what be be clear that foreign office must take notice of young nobleman in be not contained more than half of real reason for peculiar consideration anglicized italian duca be known to be engaged to daughter of english marquis to lady who if not be next door to being niece to secretary of state for foreign affair many year must have passed since individual have sprung into notice so interesting in many different way to body of foreign office personage be clerk in post office there have doubt be feeling in foreign office if not of actual disgrace at rate of mingled shame regret that niece of secretary of state must have engaged to one so low have be in foreign office something might have be made of clerk in post office thing have be whispered about talked over till there have come up idea lady france must be sent away on compulsory foreign mission so a to be out of pernicious young man reach now turned out suddenly that young man be duca di crinola be evident to of that lady france trafford be justified in choice what be to be done with duca rumour reached foreign office that infatuated young nobleman intended to adhere to most unaristocratic position absurdity of clerk of third class in one of branch of post office with salary of hundred seventy year sitting in same room with crockers bobbin while must have to be called by everybody duca di crinola be apparent to mind of lowest foreign office official must be so said to other something must be done if government pay be necessary to must not be transformed by leap into elysium of own department where might serve with especial name invented for occasion then there arose question man must answer be to be introduced into new fangled office proposed for must come in a englishman italian if a englishman be in accordance with received rule of etiquette that must be called duca di crinola must be possible in so special case to get special permission from crown if not must be appointed to foreign office a foreigner special permission though be surrounded by so many difficulty yet seemed to be easier le monstrous than latter suggestion understood that though must not well be dismissed from office already held might be difficult to appoint foreign nobleman to performance of duty certainly required more than ordinary british tendency in way mind of foreign office be moved coming of young duke be awaited with considerable anxiety news went beyond foreign office whether be that secretary of state told story to lady of household that reached through private secretary be certainly case lady persiflage be enabled to write very interesting letter to sister that lady amaldina took occasion of congratulating cousin of informing lover lady kingsbury when received news be still engaged in pointing out to husband iniquity of elder child in having admitted visit of mr roden to hendon hall persisted in saying have be done in direct opposition to most solemn promise made by party concerned marquis at time have recovered somewhat of strength in consequence a be said among household of removal of mr greenwood into shrewsbury marchioness took advantage of improved condition on part of husband to make sensible of abominable iniquity of young person have be guilty visit have occurred two month since iniquity to lady kingsbury thinking still demanded express condemnation if possible punishment direct premeditated falsehood on part of said lady kingsbury standing over husband who be recumbent on sofa in own room no be said marquis who found easier to deny whole charge than to attempt in weakness to divide guilt dear when be allowed to go to hendon hall be not done on sacred pledge that must not see that horrid man did not hampstead repeat promise to own ear how must help coming wish must trouble about more then suppose that be to have leave to marry man whenever chooses then roused with strength possessed begged to leave with much indignation stalked out of room going to apartment found following letter have just arrived from sister dear clara a be down in country suppose news about fanny young man have not yet reached fanny young man have fanny be housemaid be thus that might have spoken of lover must be that fanny young man have already got married lady kingsbury when read almost let letter drop from hand so much be disgusted by manner in sister spoke of most unfortunate affair heard something of only yesterday rest of detail to day a have come through foreign office may be quite sure that be true though be so wonderful young man be not george roden at be englishman be italian proper name title be duca di crinola again lady kingsbury allowed letter almost to drop on occasion with feeling of very different nature what not george roden not miserable clerk in english post office duca di crinola title of thought that remembered to have heard a belonging to peculiarly ancient family be not to be believed yet came from sister who be usually correct in such matter came also from foreign office regarded a one really trustworthy source of information a to foreign matter of aristocratic nature duca di crinola said to herself a went on with reading of letter there be long story of marriage of mother quite understand a yet be not necessary to fact of case young man have be recognized in own country a entitled to honour of family must be received so by persiflage say that will be ready to present at court on return a duca di crinola will ask at once to dine in belgrave square be most romantic story must be regarded by a being very fortunate a dear fanny have certainly set heart upon marrying man be told that inherits nothing bare title foreign nobleman be know very poor in case father who be mauvais sujet contrived to destroy right of property have lord kingsbury probably will be able to do something for perhaps may succeed in getting official employment suited to rank at rate must of make best of for fanny sake will be better to have duca di crinola among even though must not have shilling than post office clerk with two three hundred year asked persiflage to write to lord kingsbury tell that must do because be so busy be brother in law well enough think must come up to town to make inquiry to see young man if can not do so have better get hampstead to take down to trafford hampstead young duchino be luckily bosom friend tell well for hampstead that after did not go so low for associate a thought did amaldina intends to write to fanny to congratulate affectionate sister geraldine persiflage duca di crinola must not quite believe yet did believe must be quite sure a to herself whether be happy in believing reverse have be terrible to to think that must have to endure name of being stepmother to clerk in post office must not be at terrible to to be stepmother to duca di crinola even though stepson must have property of own little misfortune must a far a feeling of society went be swallowed up amidst attribute of rank nothing must sound better than duchessa duchessina moreover must be true be paltry title might be false might have be picked up how other day world must know that italian duke be lineal representative of magnificent family to whom identical rank have belonged for many year there be strong reason for taking young duke young duchess to heart at once then there be other reason why must not wish to be true in first place hated let man be duca di crinola a much a might must still have be post office clerk lady france must have admitted courtship having believed at time to have be more than post office clerk sin must have be not le abominable in choice of lover although might be expedient that sin must be forgiven then girl have insulted there have be that between must prevent possibility of future love must not be hard upon darling if must become necessary to carve out from family property permanent income for italian nobleman for generation of italian nobleman to come then what triumph must be for hampstead who of human being be most distasteful to upon whole thought must be best to accept duca must indeed accept nothing that must do must restore young man to humble desk humble name must marquis be actuated by prayer of hers in reference to carving of property must be better for to accept young duke young duchess make best of if only story must at last be shown to be true duty be imposed on her of communicating story to

park must have asked for marquis knew that marquis must not receive lady kingsbury consented to see be ushered up to room to have so often made way without asking hope be well mr greenwood said be still staying in neighbourhood be however well known at trafford that be at shrewsbury yes lady kingsbury have not gone from neighbourhood thought that perhaps might want to see again know that need trouble mr greenwood have come with news respecting family a said managed to assume old look stood a though have never moved from place since have last be in room do sit down mr greenwood what news mr george roden clerk in post office be not going to have tidings repeated to by so a to give claim to gratitude for having brought mean duca di crinola oh exclaimed mr greenwood have heard mr greenwood that post office clerk be italian nobleman suited italian nobleman for time to be post office clerk be what mean lady france be to be allowed mr greenwood must ask not to discus lady france here oh not to discus ladyship surely must be aware how angry marquis have be about oh have not seated divested of inquisitorial appearance be so distasteful to used to discus lady france sometimes lady kingsbury will not discus now let that be enough mr greenwood yet lord hampstead yet lord hampstead think very wrong of to come after took place if marquis knew oh if marquis knew if marquis knew if other people knew if be known how often ladyship have spoken how loud a to wished for removal to better world of lordship eldest son must not dare to speak out yet be cruel on have for day felt ladyship to be under thumb now seemed that have escaped from oh very well lady kingsbury perhaps have better go just for present went served at least for corroboration did not dare to keep secret long from husband therefore in course of evening went down with sister letter in hand what said marquis when story have be read to what duca di crinola there ca be doubt about dear clerk in post office be clerk in post office now quite see what will be then appears that have inherited nothing sister say nothing then what be good of title there be nothing so pernicious in world a pauper aristocracy clerk in post office be entitled to have wife poor nobleman must at rate let poverty die with be view of case have not hitherto presented to lady kingsbury when suggested to that young nobleman must be asked down to trafford did not seem to see that be at necessary must be much better that fanny must come back young nobleman must supposed live in own country unless indeed whole tale be cock bull story made up by persiflage at foreign office be just sort of thing said that persiflage must do have said not word a to carving income out of property for young noble couple when left chapter iii world know story be in truth over london half over england by time lady france have returned to hendon hall though vivian have made foreign office secret of affair at gorse hall nevertheless have be so commonly talked about during last sunday there that hautboy have told to poor walker to walker lady by jove fancy hautboy have said to go at once from post office clerk to duke be like of story where man go to bed a beggar get up a prince wonder whether like hampstead have of course discussed matter very freely with sister still expressing opinion that man must not do other than take father

congratulate on wonderful most romantic story have just be made known to be never one of who blamed very much because have given affection to man so much below in rank nevertheless must not feel that be pity that must be post office clerk now indeed have reason to be proud have already read up subject find that ducas di crinola be supposed to have very best blood in europe there can be doubt that one of family married bourbon before came to french throne must send detail only doubt that have found out for already married second cousin of maximilian who married mary of burgundy one of lady of family be supposed to have be wife of younger brother of one of guise though be quite certain whether be ever married little blot dear will hardly affect now taking name altogether think there be anything higher in europe papa say that di crinolas have always be doing something in italy in way of politics rebellion fighting so be a though be washed out longer of account like of read of in history therefore do think that must be very happy girl do feel so completely snuffed out because after title of merioneth be only conferred in time of charles second though there be lord llwddythlw before even be only created by james first powell doubt be very old welsh family be supposed that there be relationship between tudor what be to be compared to mediaeval honour of great house of di crinola papa seems to think that will not have much fortune be one of who think that large income be at to be compared to good birth in way of giving real position in world of course duke estate be supposed to be enormous llwddythlw even a eldest son be rich man a far a can see there be nothing trouble come from if have anything to do with provincial town in way of rent be expected to lay first brick of church institute about place if anything have to be opened have to open be never allowed to eat dinner without having to make two three speech before afterwards be what call great bore a far a can see will be always able to have duke with because will have abominable public duty to look after suppose something will have to be done a to income llwddythlw seems to think that ought to get into parliament at least be what said to papa other day for have not seen for ever so long call in square sunday just a have done lunch never remains above two minute last sunday have not heard of glorious news papa did see one day at house be what said see how be to get into house if be italian duke know what 'd get by going there papa say that might be employed in diplomatic position by own government must think that marquis must do something for a have so much at own disposition acre of merioneth property be settled upon well whoever may happen to be next heir there will sure to be income there always be papa say that young duke be always a well off at rate a young raven a said before what doe signify in comparison with blood doe make position dear quite thing from what have expected must have kept title doubt where must have be wonder whether will be married now before august suppose not because doe seem to be quite certain when wicked papa of died do hope that wo day at last have be fixed for th of august when a told before lord david be to run away instantly after ceremony so a to travel night open something next morning at aberdeen mention now because will be by far most remarkable of bevy of twenty of course name will have be in paper before that a future italian duchess that own will be to just cause of pride think have got bevy fixed at last do hope that none of will get married before day have happened so often a to be quite heart breaking will cry if find that be to be married first believe to be most affectionate friend cousin amaldina wrote also to future husband on same subject dearest llwddythlw be very good of to come last sunday wish have gone away just because graiseburys be there must not have eaten though be liberal have written to fanny trafford to congratulate because know be after better than being mere post office clerk be terrible so bad that one hardly knew how to mention name in society when people talked about really did feel that blushed over one can mention name now because people be not supposed to know that have got nothing nevertheless be very dreadful what on earth be to live on have told about young raven be papa who said that when first heard of di crinola affair suppose girl ought to trust in providence when marries man without shilling be what papa meant papa say that said that ought to go into parliament what must get by perhaps a be in post office might make postmaster general only papa say that if be to go into parliament then must not call duca di crinola altogether seems to be very sad though not quite so sad a before be true that one of di crinolas married bourbon that others of have married ever so many royalty think there ought to be law for giving such people something to live upon out of tax how be to be expected to live upon nothing asked papa whether must get done said must be money bill that ought to take up pray for fear must take august know must have scruple about putting off own little affair if anything of kind be to come in way believe 'd like do stop little longer when come on sunday have ever so many thing to say to if can think of anything to be done for

idea that marion be congratulating that protection have come to from further violence on part poor marion hardly knew own meaning hardly have must not even tell that be angry with lover be probable that very ecstacy of love added fuel to hers if lover so placed a be lover lover who have come to asking to be wife who have be received with warmest assurance of own affection for if be not justified in taking in arm kissing when might lover do so way of world be known to well enough to make feel that be so even in moment of perturbation angry with how must be angry with have asked have declared

bethought how impossible have be condition have imposed upon that must be assured of love yet not allowed to approach a lover that must be allowed to come there in order that might be delighted in looking at in hearing voice in knowing feeling that be dear to that must be kept at arm length because have determined that must not become wife that must love other dearly with different idea of love be fault that must be there in presence at have told that be duty to sacrifice have only half carried out duty must not have kept love to herself so that might have left a certainly must have done have behaved to coldly a duty have required of have longed for sweetness must be sweet to though only vain encouragement to have painted for own eye foolish picture have dreamed silly dream have fancied that for little of life be left to might have be allowed delight of loving have be vain enough to think that lover might be true to yet not suffer sacrifice have be altogether imperfect with be angry not with angry with whose very footfall be music to ear angry with whose smile to be a light specially sent from heaven for behoof angry with very energy of whose passion thrilled with sense of intoxicating joy angry with because have be enabled for once only for once to feel glory of life to be encircled in warmth of arm to become conscious of majesty of strength be not angry must be made to understand must be taught to acknowledge that must never never come to again mind can conceive joy so exquisite that for enjoyment of though may last for moment tranquillity even happiness of year may be given in exchange must be so with have be own doing if exchange be bad one must put up with bargain must never come again then mr roden have entered room be forced to utter word of welcome might first come to tongue yes said hampstead trying to smile a though nothing have happened called for special seriousness of manner be here be here hope to be here often often till will have succeeded in taking marion to home said marion faintly uttering little protest ever so gently be very constant lord said mr roden suppose man be constant to what really love best what history have

hampstead oh yes think will not give up office office a say what else will have to live on father might do something mr roden shook head sister will have money though may probably be insufficient to furnish income a will want must never live in idleness upon money lord indeed think may say that have quite resolved to drop title a idle lumber perhaps know that be not easily persuaded most obstinate fellow ever knew in life said hampstead laughing have talked sister over to own view then turned suddenly round to marion asked question will go now dearest said have already told to go to go never to return to question be put to in such manner be simply to assent to going must by doing so assent also to returning for sake of duty to in order that might carry out that self sacrifice in performance of must now be so resolute be necessary that must in truth be made to understand that be not to come back to how be to be done while mr roden be present with have not be there then must

interview at rate letter written on side before must be made to understand own purpose if must be done by letter how great must be struggle to in explaining perhaps even that might be easier than task of telling that must have to tell while be standing by impetuous impatient perhaps almost violent assuring of love attempting to retain by pressure of hand will said a held now for moment be not quite sure whether may not have to go to trafford if so there will be love letter feel conscious mr roden of being incapable of writing proper love letter marion be yours be mine always believe ever thine '

suffering to a light a possible though there might be ecstasy of joy to in knowing that be loved there must be nothing akin to in wanted treasure must only tell that might never have think of ask whether be in heart to refuse to bid be happy be in heart to do though might break heart must do be one thing to do be paramount duty have told that love truly have told so certainly must never recall

heart have bade write to at trafford must obey at once in must tell that must not obey in aught else tell that will be so have said to with sweet imperious manly word there have be something of command about always have helped to make so perfect in eye understand said how absolutely heart be set upon did understand wondered how absolutely heart have be set upon pleasure be pleasant to employment useful unless can make so by thinking of love be right that a man such man must have pleasure employment be sweet to to be told that must be gilded by remembrance of smile for from moment in have known there must be pleasure to think of serious employment to resolve how best might do duty to be not till next morning that took up pen to begin important letter though resolution have be so firmly made yet there have be much need for thinking before must sit down to form sentence for while have told that must be well first to consult father before father have returned to have remembered that nothing must say must induce in least to alter purpose wish have be made known to have failed altogether to understand nature of duty have imposed upon thus let day pas by although knew that writing of letter must be affair of much time to must not take sheet of paper scribble off warm word of love a have done to ask to give in matter of love must surely thought be easy enough to have given then to refuse be difficulty there be so much to say of moment to to rather so much to signify that be not at one sitting with single copy that letter must be written must be assured doubt of love must be made to understand quite to understand that love must be of avail to how be to obey a to mode of addressing simply excruciates from have said thus debarring from that only appellation must certainly be easiest seemed to only one becoming at last letter when written ran a follows how be to begin letter know a have forbidden to use only word must come naturally love too well to displease in so small matter poor letter must therefore go to without such beginning a be usual indeed love with heart told that before will not shame by saying that be untrue told also before must not be wife dearest love can only say again what said before dearly a love can not become wife bid to think of to ask whether be in heart to refuse to bid to be happy be not in heart to let do certainly must make unhappy there be two reason for of first though be quite sufficient know that will make nothing when tell that ought not to choose one a for wife because manner of life have not fitted for position then sometimes laugh at sometimes be half angry with fine way have of commanding be about not le be sure that be right do believe that of human being poor marion fay be dearest to when tell of love treasure for moment doubt that be true be to be wife honour honesty must force to be good to when found be not a be other grand lady then think must be disappointed must know by line of dear face when saw there must be broken hearted be not if there be nothing further think must give way because be only weak girl word own own love must get better of there be thing be hard for to

because of love for only child remains to mother died brother sister have died also will die young be not that enough know that will be enough knowing that will be enough may not speak out to tell heart will not let do so a though have be understood between that though can never be more to other than be yet may be allowed to love other oh dearest only dearest just for once have found word in may address can not comfort a can myself because be man can not find comfort in sadness disappointment a girl may do man think that must win for that want for girl think be sufficient for to feel that a far a be concerned that must have be given to most desire have not fortune be unkind dearest can not have what want because have come to poor marion fay with glory sweetness of love must suffer for while who must so willingly give life to serve must tell that will be so a be man pluck up heart tell that will only be for time shorter better stronger will show in overcoming evil oppresses remember

into world a duchess must be contrary to feeling to taste to comfort must have mean of maintaining title must be reduced to necessity of still living in paradise row with simple addition of absurd nickname a to that question have be raised be only for that required new appellation a for whole thing have be settled at once by own good judgment a for said argument be still stronger against absurd use of grand title be imperative on to earn bread only mean of doing so be by doing work a clerk in post office everybody admitted that must not be becoming that duke must be clerk in post office must be so unbecoming declared that doubted whether man must be found brave enough to go through world with fool cap on head at rate have such courage moreover englishman a have be told must at own will pleasure call by foreign title be pleasure to be englishman have always be englishman a inhabitant of holloway have voted for two radical member for borough of islington must not stultify own proceeding declare that everything have done be wrong be thus that argued matter a seemed one must take upon to prove that be italian to prove that be duke though seemed to be if not logical at rate rational world generally did not agree with wherever be encountered there seemed to be opinion that ought to assume name right belonged to father even at post office world be against quite know why must do said sir boreas when roden put to whether must be practicable that young man calling duca di crinola must take place a clerk in mr jerningham room may be remembered that sir boreas have expressed difficulty in matter have told mr jerningham that did not think that must get on very well with real duke among be thus that matter have at first struck be brave man when came to look at round did not see that there must be impossibility must be nine day wonder doubt man must be there just same post office clerk inside duke work must be done after little time even must become used to having duke among subordinate a to whether duke be foreigner englishman that declared must not matter in least a far a post office be concerned really see why must try said sir boreas absurdity must be so great that must crush sir must be worth salt said roden be kind of thing that wear out very quickly must feel odd at first so must other men messenger must feel little odd when asked one to send duca di crinola to for be not in habit of sending for duke there be nothing that ca get used to if father have be prince think must break down under after first month what good must do sir boreas think must do good be difficult to explain good particularly to man who be so violently opposed a to idea of rank mean must get promoted quicker because of title think probable that civil service generally must find able to do something more for good officer with high name than for good officer without one then sir boreas civil service ought to be ashamed of perhaps so such must be fact somebody must interfere to prevent anomaly of duca di crinola sitting at same table with mr crocker will not dispute with whether ought to be so if be probable there be reason why must not take advantage of good fortune if have capacity courage enough to act up to of course what want in life be success if chance come in way see why must fling away be wisdom of sir boreas roden must not take advantage of thanked great man for kindness sympathy declined to reconsider decision in outer office in room for instance in mr jerningham sat with crocker bobbin geraghty feeling be very much stronger in favour of title be expressed in stronger language crocker must not contain when heard that there be doubt upon subject on roden first arrival at office crocker almost flung into friend arm with just single exclamation duca duca duca have said have then fallen back into own seat overcome by emotion roden have passed by without remark be very distasteful to disgusting must fain have be able to sit down at own desk go on with own work without special notice of occasion other than ordinary greeting occasioned by return be distressing to that anything must have be known about father father title that must be known be natural world have heard of world have put into newspaper world have talked about of course mr jerningham also must talk of two younger clerk crocker crocker must of course talk of louder than one else be to be expected certain amount of misconduct be to be expected from crocker must be forgiven therefore passed over ecstatic almost hysterical repetition of title father have borne hoping crocker might be overcome by effort be tranquil crocker be not so easily overcome did sit for moment two on seat with mouth open be only preparing for great demonstration be very glad to see again sir said mr jerningham not at first quite knowing how must become to address fellow clerk thank mr jerningham have got back again safe be sure be delighted to hear what have heard said mr jerningham cautiously by george yes said bobbin suppose be true be such beautiful name there be so many thing be true so many be false that quite know how to answer said roden be asked geraghty then stopped not quite daring to trust with grand title be just what be not replied other be shouted crocker jumping from seat be be be quite true be duca di crinola of course will call so mr jerningham eh be sure know said mr jerningham with great caution will allow to know own name said roden continued crocker be very well for modesty be kind of thing friend ca stand be quite sure that be duca there be something in italian title be peculiarly soothing to crocker ear man have to be called by what be not by what chooses if duke of middlesex called mr smith 'd be duke same must mr jerningham world must call duke so must be with must call grace mr know what mean wo pronounce ever again not for ever so much roden brow became very black a found subjected to effect of man folly call upon whole office continued crocker for sake of own honour to give dear highly esteemed friend proper name on occasion here be to health of duca di crinola just at moment crocker lunch have be brought in consisting of bread cheese pint of stout pewter pot be put to mouth toast be drank to honour glory of drinker noble friend with feeling of intended ridicule be grand thing to crocker to have be brought into contact with man possessed of so noble title in heart of heart reverenced duca must willingly have stayed there till six seven o'clock have done duca work for because duca be duca must not have done satisfactorily because be not in nature to do work well must have done a well a did own hated work must have sooner worked night than see duca do so great be reverence for aristocracy generally mr crocker said mr jerningham severely be making nuisance generally do nuisance yes nuisance when see that gentleman doe wish thing ought to do when man name be name never mind when doe wish ought to do if be man own real name never mind said mr jerningham if shoot gintleman to be incognito why be to do a plaises asked geraghty if duke of middlesex did call mr smith said bobbin gentleman be gentleman must fall in with view crocker not conquered for moment silenced seated in dudgeon at desk might do very well for poor fellow weak creature like jerningham bobbin geraghty thus to be done out of prey must not be cheated in way duca di crinola must be duca di crinola a far a crocker must make voice heard heard must know that duca be own old peculiar friend in paradise row world be decidedly against roden not only be demijohn duffer against also own mother friend mr vincent on first monday after mr roden return mr vincent came to row a usual on occasion to welcome cousin to hear news of family a have be at last brought back from italy there be great deal to be told many thing have be brought to light have have commencement in mr vincent day there be something of continuation of mild triumph for in word be spoken have be against di crinola marriage when have be first discussed more than quarter of century ago have never believed in duca di crinola want of faith have be altogether justified did not after year bear hardly on friend there be still that well known tone of gentle censure of gentle self applause told so said elder crow to younger crow when doe old crow cease to remind younger crow that be so sad sad story said mr vincent shaking head story suppose have much in be sad have got son mother can have more reason to be proud of son mr vincent shook head say be so repeated mother having such son will not admit that have be sad wish be more ready to perform religious duty said mr vincent can not agree about everything know that need be brought up now be matter must be brought up hour day mary if bringing of up be to do good be not on matter mr roden now wished to get assistance from cousin certainly not with present view towards amelioration of son religious faith might come afterwards perhaps be present object to induce cousin to agree with that son must permit to be called by father title think must take father name asked mr vincent shook head tried to look wise question be one on feeling be very much divided be of course proper that son must be called by father name propriety of world a known to mr vincent declared that must be so be woman too who by mean despised rank who considered that much reverence be due to who be privileged to carry title duke lord be certainly very great in estimation even humblest knight be respected by a having be in degree lifted above community by will of sovereign though be always in degree hostile to george roden because of liberty took in regard to certain religious matter yet be good enough kind enough to wish well to own cousin have there be question in regard to english title certainly must not have shaken head a to outlandish italian title have doubt did not seem to to be right that englishman must be called duca if have be baron even count name must have be le offensive then to mind hereditary title a have known have be recommended by hereditary possession there be something to almost irreligious in idea of duke without acre must therefore only again shake head have a much right to continued mr roden a have eldest son of greatest peer in england dare say have dear what dare say be right only only be not just like english peer know privilege of succession be same never must sit in house of lord dear of course not must assume only what be own why must be ashamed to take italian title more than friend lord hampstead be to take english one be not a though must prevent living here many foreign nobleman live in england suppose must live here said mr vincent a though be making great admission think that there must be law to turn out of country out of post office if chooses to remain there said mr roden know how may be even if did must prefer that must be so according to thinking man must fling away privilege be own must be ashamed of assuming nobility belongs to if not for own sake must do for sake of child at rate have nothing to be ashamed of in name belonged to father to grandfather to ancestor through many generation think how men fight for title in country how struggle for when there be doubt a to who may properly have inherited here there be doubt here there need be struggle convinced by weight of argument mr vincent gave in adhesion at last expressed opinion that cousin must at once call by father name chapter vii great question be argument of mr roden adhesion of mr vincent of power in persuading george roden answered mother gently kindly very firmly have anything said be necessary to strengthen own feeling must have be found in mother determination to keep old name surely mother if may say so without disrespect what be sauce for goose be sauce for gander at mother smiled kissing son to show that argument have be taken in good part in matter continued certainly be in boat together if be duke must be duchess if be doomed to make ape of myself at post office must be equally ridiculous in paradise row unless be prepared to go back to italy live life there must not live there how must earn bread there how must pas day so a to be in degree useful what must be more mean uncle though have be civil to certain degree generous must be specially anxious not to see in public life together must have just mean enough for existence must be doomed to walk about street of third rate italian town call by grand name must life like satisfy ambition on behalf then thought of girl who be in love with of friend whom have made for of character belonged to be driven to confess that by name might be called must continue to live englishman life to live in england nevertheless told that title must not be abolished because might be in abeyance might thought still live to hear son called by name of have be proud till have become thoroughly ashamed of husband who have given to there be others besides crocker mr vincent mother sir boreas who be much interested by george roden condition mr roden returned home on nd of march a may be remembered tidings respecting son have reached england before came by end of month many person be much exercised a to young man future name people of high rank have not only discussed subject at great length have written numerous letter concerning be manifest to lady persiflage that further attempt must now be made to throw obstacle in way of lady france lover lady persiflage have never believed in obstacle from first of course will marry have said to one daughter who be now almost a good a married herself equally trustworthy when girl be determined like of course nothing will stop sister must have let meet young man at first have be said before young man have turned out to be italian duke since news have come lady persiflage have be very eager in recommending sister to discontinue opposition make most of have said in one of letter be can be done now be fine name though italian title count like ours yet when be a good a go for good deal there be real record of di crinola family there be manner of doubt that be head of take by hand have down at trafford if kingsbury be well enough tell be quite presentable with good figure by mean young man who will stand shivering in room because doe know how to utter word have be like fanny must never have set heart upon persiflage have be talking about say that something will be sure to turn up if be brought forward properly be not ashamed of family name persiflage will do whatever can can only be if will open arm to lady kingsbury did feel that be called upon to undergo terrible revulsion of sentiment opening arm to duca di crinola might be possible to how be to open arm to lady france trafford man whom have seen once might appear before with new title a young nobleman of whose antecedent be not bound to remember anything might seem to regard a new arrival noble suitor for stepdaughter hand of whom have not before heard how be to receive fanny trafford girl whom have locked up at koenigsgraaf whose letter have stopped a came from post office nevertheless consented a far at least a sister be concerned will never like fanny have said because be so sly girl be always called sly by friend who want to abuse of course will have here a think will be best what be to live upon heaven only know of course will be concern of mine a first result of lady persiflage asked george roden down to castle hautboy for easter holiday there be difficulty about how be to be addressed hampstead be consulted though be not much in heart just then for arrangement of such matter advised that for present friend old name must be used lady persiflage therefore wrote to george roden esq at general post office in letter be signified that lord persiflage be very anxious to make acquaintance of mr roden lady persiflage be also very anxious lady persiflage explained that be aware of well lady france trafford be to be at castle hautboy that thought might act a inducement to mr roden letter be very cleverly managed though never once mentioned grand title made allusion implied that real rank of post office clerk be well known to one at castle hautboy though nothing of course be said a to possible relation between lord persiflage a member of british cabinet clerk uncle a member of italian cabinet nevertheless a to also there be allusion be intelligible letter be altogether very gracious one a few young men must be able to resist coming from person a lady persiflage special offer prevailed with post office clerk be doubt promise of presence of fanny trafford in rest gracious a word be there be nothing trouble for be clear enough to that lady persiflage be on same side a crocker lady persiflage must doubt prefer duca di crinola to post office clerk for lady france must see also that secretary of state for foreign affair be on same side secretary of state must not have expressed special desire to see post office clerk at castle hautboy have a be welcomed to possession of brother in law daughter have nothing be told of duca di crinola heard a much from lord hampstead who advised to go to castle hautboy make acquainted with fanny family friend be manifest a be being done in opposition to own firm resolution must not have gone that temptation be too great for fanny trafford must be there be quite open to charm of offer be almost being made to of lady fanny hand arranged matter at office wrote to lady persiflage accepting invitation so be going to castle hautboy said crocker to crocker be in torment at time have be made to understand that must be doing quite wrong in calling duca grace roden if duke at must be only italian duke not on account grace have be explained by bobbin have disturbed title duca be still open to feared roden wrath if must use too freely how do know asked roden have be there know be in habit of hearing from castle hautboy father be agent on property of course heard tidings if not from father at rate from sister yes be going to castle hautboy hampstead will be there probably met hampstead there man in lord persiflage position will of course be delighted to welcome duca di crinola shrank a though feared that roden must strike uttered word of course if choose to annoy can not well help said roden a left room on first arrival at castle thing be allowed to go quietly with one called mr roden lady persiflage received very graciously lady france be in house name be mentioned to with whispered intimacy on such occasion indicates triumph of man position made allusion either to rank to office treated just a might have done other suitor be exactly what wanted lord llwddythlw have come down for easter holiday of two day be very civil to lady amaldina be delighted to make acquaintance within three minute be calling upon to promise that must not get married before august in consideration for bevy if be to lose fanny now said really think must give up altogether then before dinner be allowed to find alone with fanny for first time in life felt that engagement be acknowledged thing be made very pleasant to by occasional use of proper name have be almost ashamed of because of embarrassment supposed title have occasioned felt that have thought of matter more than be worth annoyance of crocker have be abominable to be not likely that must encounter second crocker still dreaded hardly knew what certainly be not probable that people at castle hautboy must call by name have never used without consulting still have dreaded something be gratified that trouble seemed to pas by easily lady persiflage lady amaldina have used legitimate name lord llwddythlw have called nothing at if must only be allowed to go away just a have come without allusion from one to di crinola family then must think that people at castle hautboy be very well bred feared that be almost too much to hope did not see lord persiflage till moment before dinner when specially remarked that be introduced a mr roden very glad to see mr roden hope be fond of scenery be supposed to have finest view in england from top of tower have doubt daughter will show ca say that ever saw beautiful scenery be very well when be travelling nobody ever care for at home thus lord persiflage have done courtesy to stranger conversation became general a though stranger be stranger no longer when roden found that be allowed to give arm to lady france go out eat dinner quietly comfortably without reference to peculiarity of position thought that perhaps further trouble be in store for whole of next day be devoted to charm of love scenery spring weather be delightful roden be allowed to ramble about where pleased with lady france one about place regarded a accepted recognized lover a have never be in truth accepted by one of family except by girl a marquis have not condescended even to see when have come have sent mr greenwood to reject scornfully a marchioness have treated a below contempt a even own friend lord hampstead have declared that difficulty must be insuperable sudden cessation of impediment did seem to be delightfully miraculous assent on part of lord lady persiflage must understood be quite a serviceable a of lord lady kingsbury something have occurred in eye of family have lifted up a be out of gutter placed on grand pedestal there must be no doubt a to something be done because be supposed to be italian nobleman yet be not italian nobleman must allow one to call so a far a might be in power to prevent visit be limited to two entire day one be passed amidst sweet of love making with pleasure of allusion be allowed to interfere on following morning found alone with lord persiflage after breakfast delighted to have have down here know began lordship to roden simply bowed have pleasure of knowing uncle personally there be man in europe for whom have higher respect again roden bowed have heard about romance of yours from d'ossi know d'ossi roden declared that have not honour of knowing italian minister ah well must know d'ossi of course wo say whether be countryman not must know be uncle particular friend be only by accident that know uncle even learnt that be uncle just so accident have taken place result fortunately remains of course must take own name will keep name have lord persiflage will find to be quite impossible queen will not allow upon hearing roden opened eye secretary of state for foreign affair looked full in face a though to assure that though have never heard of such thing before such in fact be truth of course there will be difficulty be not prepared at present moment to advise how must be done perhaps have better wait till majesty have signified pleasure to receive a duca di crinola when have done so will have alternative no alternative a to what may call none in least must say be thinking now in great measure a to welfare of own relative lady france something will have to be done quite see way a yet something doubt will be done duca di crinola will have doubt find fitting employment then little bell be rung vivian private secretary came into room vivian roden knew other few pleasant word be spoken roden found obliged to take departure without making further protest in regard to majesty assumed wish about five o'clock evening be invited into little sitting room belonging to lady persiflage up stair have be very good to said laughing very good indeed nothing must be so good a inviting down here to castle hautboy be done for fanny sake have said one word to about terrible name indeed now lady persiflage pray go on be good to end yes said will be good to end before people down stair have said word of even to fanny fanny be angel according to thinking be of course even angel like to have proper rank must allow to suppose that even fanny trafford be indifferent to title there be thing that man may expect girl to do for there be thing can not be expected let be ever so much in love fanny trafford have got to become duchess of crinola be afraid that be more than can do for dear mr roden must be done can not let go away from here without making understand that a man engaged to be married can not drop title did intend to remain single can not say how far peculiar notion might enable to prevail a mean to marry too will have right put to whether must be honest on part to ask to abandon rank will be entitled to expect from just think of mr roden now wo trouble more upon subject not word more be said on subject at castle hautboy on next day returned to post office chapter viii can not compel about middle of april lord lady kingsbury came up to london from day to day week to week have declared that must never again be able to move out of room have gone on

be carried up to park condition of own health be of course given to for reason of movement at peculiar period of year must be better for said to be near london doctor doubt marquis believed that be so when man be ill nothing be so important to a own illness may be question whether anxiety felt by marchioness a to other affair of family generally have not effect with in inducing to persuade husband marquis have given modified assent to daughter marriage in manner still more modified have withdrawn opposition permission have be given to fanny to marry duca di crinola have be given without reference to money have certainly implied promise of certain amount of income from bride father how else must be possible that must live letter have be written to lady france by stepmother at dictation of marquis word absolutely dictated have not perhaps be religiously followed father have intended to be soft affectionate merely expressing gratification that girl lover must turn out to be duca di crinola out of marchioness have made stipulation lover must be received a lover on condition that bore name title lady persiflage have told sister that a matter of course name must be taken man always take father name a matter of course lady persiflage have said believed that man absurd notion must be overcome by continual social pressure whether social pressure must must not prevail man must certainly marry girl there must therefore be no better course than of trusting to social pressure lady persiflage be quite clear a to course marchioness though yielding to sister in much still thought that bargain must be made have be suggested that must invite young man down to trafford roden be usually called young man at present in family conclave have thought that must be better to see up in london lady france must come to in park lane then young man must be invited marchioness must send compliment to duca di crinola nothing on earth must induce to write name of roden unless might happily come to pas that engagement must be broken hampstead at time be still living at sister remained with till marchioness came up to town about middle of april one else except george roden saw

assurance of affection have meant nothing to when have spoken to simply of difference of rank have thrown argument under foot have trampled upon with masterful imperious determination whole life energy be devoted to crushing of argument used towards by who be daily telling that be severed from other men by peculiarity of rank certainly must not be severed from one woman whom loved by such peculiarity fortifying heart by reflection have declared to that timid doubtings of girl must go for nothing a loved must of course be strong enough to conquer such doubtings must take up in arm carry away simply tell that have got to do have conviction that girl when once have confessed that loved man belonged to man be bound to obey to watch over to worship to hover round so that wind must be

be hard upon everybody else in room be closely connected with everybody else have be graciously accepted by mistress of house must have fallen readily enough into intimacy must then have be opened to a be be forced to struggle against stream so to struggle a to seem not to struggle at last however time hour have done work lady went up to drawing room lord llwddythlw called mr roden be said by marchioness in tone of bitter reproach a soon a drawing room door be closed be so sorry said lady amaldina doe not signify in least said lady persiflage can not be expected that man must drop old name take new one in moment will never drop old name take new one said lady france there now said marchioness what do think of geraldine dear fanny said lady persiflage without touch of ill nature in tone how can tell what young man will do think right to deceive mamma said fanny know well enough to be quite sure that will not take title a have property to support have talked over with again again agree with altogether upon word fanny did think that must be so foolish said aunt be kind of thing in girl must not interfere at must be arranged between young man uncle in italy proper authority here must depend very much upon here lady persiflage reduced word to very lowest whisper uncle have told about of course must know better than one else be kind of thing must be settled for man by by by who

look of supplication be not darling to be preserved from such contamination can do better than dear exclaimed lady persiflage if be to be wife be sure that will not stand in way of promotion own government ours between will be able to do something for a duca di crinola whereas nothing must be done for george roden english government be government said fanny indignantly one must almost suppose that want to destroy prospect said lady persiflage who be at last hardly able to restrain anger believe doe said marchioness in mean time conversation be carried on below stair if with le vigour yet perhaps with more judgment lord persiflage spoke of roden italian uncle a man possessing intellectual gift political importance of highest order roden must not deny that italian cabinet minister be uncle be thus driven to acknowledge family almost to acknowledge country from what hear said lord persiflage suppose must not wish to reside permanently in italy a italian certainly not said roden there be reason why must can imagine that must have become too confirmed englishman to take kindly to italian public life a career must hardly do so except a follower of uncle perhaps must not suit must be impossible just so d'ossi be saying to morning that thought a much there be reason why career must not be open to here a well a there not political perhaps official be only career that at present be open to there might be difficulty about parliament certainly advice to be not to be in hurry to decide upon anything for month two will find thing will shake down into place not word be said about name title when gentleman went up stair there have be brilliancy of conversation be there positive difficulty to be incurred not word further be said in reference to george roden to duca di crinola chapter x after be six week passed by nothing special have yet be done to arrange george roden affair for in manner suggested by lady persiflage be kind of thing must be settled for man by by by who know how to settle have be counsel when be advocating delay doubt thing often do arrange better than men woman can arrange objection be at first very strong gradually fade away idea be out of question become possible time quickly render word name even day habitual to in lady persiflage have not be unwise be quite probable that young man must become used to grand name quicker than have expected nothing have a yet be done in right direction when st of june have come attempt have be made towards increasing young man self importance of have be hardly aware lord persiflage have seen sir boreas bodkin vivian have seen private secretary of postmaster general a first result of interview clerk be put to sit in room by called upon to manage separate branch of business in be free from contact with crockers bobbin of department might be thought be possible to call man duke who sat in separate room even though be still clerk a sir boreas have observed there be place to be given away secretaryship inspectorship surveyorships suchlike into one of duke if must consent to be duke might be installed before long primary measure of putting into room by have already be carried out then step be taken of george roden have ground to complain there be certain club in london called foreigner made up half of englishman half of men of other nation be supposed to stand very high in world of fashion nearly member be possessed of grand title before name of grand letter after something be said by vivian to george roden a to club actual suggestion be made certainly assent be given nevertheless name of duca di crinola be put down in candidate book a proposed by baron d'ossi seconded by lord persiflage there be so that world must declare that young duca be duca otherwise name must not have be inserted there by italian minister british secretary of state whereas george roden knew nothing about in way attempt be made to carry out line of action lady persiflage have recommended letter too be delivered to roden addressed to duca di crinola at holloway at post office doubt refused when came doubt generally consisted of tradesman circular be probably occasioned by manoeuvre of lady persiflage herself be guilty have effect of spreading abroad fact that george roden be george roden no longer be duca di crinola there be letter coming for duker day said landlady of duchess to mr duffer of paradise row see sha stand on p q will call duker to face paradise row determined generally to call duker to face did so frequently to great annoyance even mother began to think that refusal must be in vain see how be to stand out against george of course if be so 'd have to stand out against a be fact be more fact with than with said angrily nobody dream of giving title if world agrees will have to yield sir boreas be a urgent have always be very friendly with young clerk have now become particularly intimate with of course dear fellow said will be guided entirely by thank sir if tell be george roden george roden will be to think be wrong think moreover that good sense of world will prevail against a far a understand anything of theory of title title belongs to world never insists on calling man lord count for nothing there be too much jealousy for when thing be so people choose that will be so troubled though did not shake conviction made think again again of what lady persiflage have said to down at castle hautboy will be honest on part to ask to abandon rank will be entitled to expect from if world conspired to tell that be entitled to take name then girl whom intended to marry must certainly be justified in claiming undoubtedly be fact that title such a be dear to men specially dear to woman a to girl who be so true to be justified in supposing that must be different from others simply because be true to have asked to come down a be from high pedestal of own rank to submit to lowly lot have consented there never have be to moment of remorse in thinking that be about to injure a chance have brought about in way a fortune have seemed determined to give back to that of must have deprived be right that must stand in way of fortune must be honest on part to ask to abandon fine name chance be putting in way that might be so must be pleased to accept what be offered to did become manifest to be within power to call to have called by new name be not only party of crockers others now be urgent in persuading matter have become so far customary to a to make feel that if must simply put name on card cause to be inserted in directory write line to official saying that for future must wish to be so designated thing must be done have met baron d'ossi baron have acknowledged that englishman must not be converted into italian duke without own consent have used very strong argument to show in case englishman ought to give consent baron have expressed own opinion that signorina must be very much ill used indeed if be not allowed to take place among duchessinas own personal feeling be in degree mitigated to be post office clerk living at holloway with few hundred year to spend yet to be known over world a claimant of magnificently grand title seemed a though cruel fate have determined to crush with terrible punishment because of specially democratic view that of world must be selected to be duke in opposition to own wish how often have be heard to declare that hereditary title be of very nature absurd yet be to be forced to become penniless hereditary duke nevertheless must not rob whom hoped to make wife of must of right belong to fanny said to one day can not conceive how many people be troubling about title know be troubling must not mind of only for papa be very anxious about be afraid be have ever told what aunt said to just before left castle hautboy lady persiflage mean be not aunt know be more anxious than father certainly us only strong argument have heard have persuaded can not say that have done something towards persuading have made half think that may be duty then suppose will take name said will depend entirely upon yet ought not to ask ought to do a people bid without even troubling for expression of wish do believe that when become wife will have a complete right to title a have lady kingsbury to hers will be so said will not certainly no if be left to why do answer in way when friend desire because believe that there be one friend who doe not desire if can say that wish on own account of course will yield otherwise that friend may say on matter can have effect on when accepted offer made gave up idea of rank have reason thought to be strong enough at rate did so now because of accident will not be weak enough to go back a to what lady persiflage say about believe word of certainly will not make happy by bestowing on name wish to bear will be distasteful to yourself after there be longer hesitation on roden part though friend including lord persiflage baron sir boreas crocker be a active in endeavour a ever for day have doubted now doubted no longer might address to what letter must might call by what nickname pleased might write down in what book chose must still keep name of george roden a have protested that be satisfied with be through sir boreas that learnt that name have be written down in club candidate book a duca di crinola sir boreas be not member of club have heard what have be done probably at club of be member be glad to hear that be coming up at foreigner said aeolus be not be told last night baron d'ossi have put name down a duca di crinola then roden discovered whole truth how baron have proposed foreign secretary have seconded without even going through ceremony of asking upon word understood that wished vivian said to upon following note be written to foreign secretary mr roden present compliment to lord persiflage begs to explain that there have be misunderstanding about foreigner club mr roden feel very much honour have be done be much obliged to lord persiflage a feel not entitled to honour of belonging to club will be glad that name must be taken off mr roden take opportunity of assuring lord persiflage that doe not never will claim name understands to have be inscribed in club book be confounded as said lord persiflage to baron a did a be bid at club baron shrugged shoulder a though acknowledging that young fellow nobleman certainly be as there be men baron whom ca help let struggle ever so much man have have stuff enough in to win for very pretty girl with good fortune high rank yet be such fool that wo let put altogether on leg when opportunity come not long after roden called at house in park lane asked to see marquis a passed through hall met mr greenwood coming very slowly down stair last time have met gentleman have be in very house when gentleman have received on behalf of marquis marquis have not condescended to see have deputed chaplain to give ignominious answer might be necessary to audacious demand for hand of lady france on occasion mr greenwood have be very imperious mr greenwood have taken upon almost manner of master of house mr greenwood have crowed a though dunghill have be own george roden even then have not be abashed having be able to remember through interview that young lady be on side have certainly be severely treated have wondered at moment that man a lord kingsbury must confide so much of family matter to such man a mr greenwood since then have heard something of mr greenwood latter history from lady france lady france have joined with brother in disliking mr greenwood hampstead have said to have be passed on to lover since last interview position of two men have be changed chaplain have be turned out of establishment george roden have be almost accepted into a son in law a met on foot of staircase be necessary that there must be greeting post office clerk bowed very graciously mr greenwood barely acknowledged salutation there said to a passed on be young man be done mischief be because such a be allowed to make way in among nobleman gentleman that england be going to dog nevertheless when mr greenwood have first consented to be inmate of present lord kingsbury house lord kingsbury have in spite of order entertained very liberal view marquis be not in good humour when roden be shown into room have be troubled by late chaplain be not able to bear such trouble easily mr greenwood have said word to have vexed sorely word have in part referred to daughter daughter lover be not very well said in answer to roden inquiry think ever will be better what be about now have come lord said roden because like to be here in house under false pretence false pretence what false pretence hate false pretence so do what do mean by false pretence now fear that have told lord kingsbury must give daughter a wife will give to duca di crinola marquis who be sitting in arm chair shook head from side to side moved hand uneasily made immediate reply can not quite tell lord what own idea be because have never discussed subject want to discus just at present said marquis be right that must know that claim title never will claim others have done so on behalf with authority from have mean to support rank in country to belongs a englishman be entitled to assume here know that be englishman said marquis people tell that be italian have be brought up a englishman have lived a one for five twenty year think must be difficult now to rob of right nobody fancy will try be will be george roden a always have be must not of course trouble with matter be not that be suitor for daughter hand be right in supposing have be accepted here by in light be question marquis be not prepared to answer at moment doubt young man have be accepted lady france have be allowed to go down to castle hautboy to meet a lover family have be collected to welcome at london mansion newspaper have be full of mysterious paragraph in future happy bridegroom be sometimes spoken of a italian duke sometimes a english post office clerk of course must marry now marquis have said to wife with much anger be sister doings have said to again have in soft moment given affectionate blessing to daughter in special reference to engagement knew that must go back from now have be possible must have be most unwilling to give wife triumph yet be not prepared to accept post office clerk simply a post office clerk be sorry to trouble at moment lord kingsbury if be not well ai well at be very far from well if mind 'd rather not talk about just at present when can see hampstead then perhaps thing can be settled a there be nothing further to be said george roden took leave chapter xi of course there be bitterness be not surprising that lord kingsbury must have be unhappy when roden be shown up into room a mr greenwood have be with mr greenwood have called on previous day have be refused admittance have then sent in appeal asking so piteously for interview that marquis have be unable to repudiate greenwood knew enough of letter writing to be able to be effective on occasion have said lived under same roof with marquis for quarter of century though position of two men in world be so different have lived together a friend marquis throughout long period have frequently condescended to ask advice of chaplain not unfrequently to follow after must refuse to grant favour of last interview have found unable to refuse favour interview have taken place consequently marquis have be very unhappy when george roden be shown up into room rector of appleslocombe be dead interview be commenced by communication to effect from mr greenwood marquis of course knew fact have indeed already given living away have not delayed minute in giving away because of fear still pressed upon in reference to mr greenwood did mr greenwood expect to get living perhaps desire wished to have grievance to be in possession of subject on must begin to make complaint must have known mr greenwood that never intended for said marquis mr greenwood seated on edge of chair rubbing two hand together declared that have entertained hope in direction know why must then never told so never thought of for moment always meant to put young man into comparatively young mr greenwood shook head still rubbed hand know that can do anything more for be much that have done certainly lord kingsbury have done a much a intend to do said marquis rousing angrily have explained that by mr robert two hundred year after quarter of century mr greenwood have in truth be put into possession of three hundred year a one hundred of came from lord hampstead be not necessary to mention little addition be very wrong pressing way in here talking to about at after having expected living for so many year have right to expect did promise never thought of for moment when asked told that be out of question never heard of such impertinence in life must ask to go away leave mr greenwood mr greenwood be not disposed to go away just yet have come there for purpose intended to go on with be clearly resolved not to be frightened by marquis got up from chair stood looking at marquis still rubbing hand till sick man be almost frightened by persistency of silence what be mr greenwood make stand thus do not hear tell have got nothing more to say to yes lord hear what say then why go away wo have stand there staring like that still shook head why do stand there shake head must be told lord what must be told marchioness what do mean sir what have got to say must wish to send for ladyship must wo send for ladyship at what have ladyship got to do with promised promised what promised living undertook must have appleslocombe moment became vacant believe word of did think that ladyship will deny might have be so certainly have there be chance of truth in statement must hardly have be so ready to send for lady kingsbury have done so promise must amount to nothing though be sick wretched weak in matter afraid of wife there have be moment of life in must have given way to on subject a promised for purpose purpose for purpose lord what purpose mr greenwood went on staring shaking head rubbing hand till marquis awestruck almost frightened put out hand towards bell thought of again remembered that have nothing to fear if man have anything to say about marchioness might perhaps be better said without presence of servant if mean to say anything say if not go if do one other very quickly will have turned out of house turned out of house certainly if have threat to make have better make in writing can write to lawyer to to lord hampstead to mr robert be threat be only statement promised for purpose know what mean by purpose mr greenwood believe lady kingsbury made such promise if did be hers to promise believe have promised must not be bound by not if have not given away have given away mr greenwood then must suggest suggest what compensation lord will only be fair ask ladyship ladyship can not intend must be turned out of lordship house with only two hundred year after what have passed between ladyship what passed said marquis absolutely rousing so a to stand erect before other man have rather lord must hear from ladyship what passed there be that about lady france what about lady france of course be employed to do must to prevent marriage employed lord be sent down to see young man explain to how impertinent be be fault lord kingsbury if thing have got changed since then think ought to make demand upon because a chaplain be asked to see gentleman who called here on delicate matter be that be thinking about if have be only that must have said nothing asked what be about be obliged to remind of one thing took place between ladyship be of course much more particular began with lordship if have commissioned suppose ladyship must ever have spoken to about lady france what be sit down wo tell like man if have got anything to tell marquis fatigued with exertion be forced to go back to chair mr greenwood also sat down whether like man may be doubted remember mr greenwood doe not become gentleman to repeat what have be said to in confidence especially not to repeat to to from whom be intended to be kept secret doe not become christian to endeavour to make ill blood between husband wife now if have got anything to say say mr greenwood shook head if have got nothing to say go away tell fairly want to have here have begun something like threat if choose to go on with may be not afraid to hear must say go mr greenwood again shook head suppose wo deny that ladyship honoured with very close confidence know anything about lordship did know that ladyship down at trafford used to be talking to pretty freely about lord hampstead lady france if have got anything to say say screamed marquis of course lordship ladyship be not ladyship own child what have got to do with of course there be bitterness what be to will hear nothing from about lady kingsbury unless have to tell of claim to be made upon if there have be money promised acknowledges will be paid have there be such promise mr greenwood found very difficult nay quite impossible to say in accurate language be desirous of explaining by dark hint there have thought be something of compact between marchioness marchioness have desired something ought not to have desired have called upon chaplain for more than sympathy chaplain have be willing to give more than sympathy have at one time be almost willing to give very much more might possibly a now felt have misinterpreted wish have certainly heard from language so strong in reference to husband child that have be justified in considering that be intended to be secret a consequence of have be compelled to choose between marquis marchioness by becoming confidential friend of one have necessarily become enemy of other then a further consequence be turned out of house a declared to utterly ruined now in there have certainly be much hardship who be to compensate if not marquis there certainly have be talk about appleslocombe during moment of hot passion in lady kingsbury have allowed to say such evil thing of lady france lord hampstead whether absolute promise have be given must probably not now remember there certainly have be moment in have thought that husband life might possibly pas away before of old rector reference may have be made to fact have own darling be heir gift of living must then have fallen into own hand mr greenwood have probably thought more of possible compensation for living than of living have doubt endeavoured to frighten ladyship into thinking that mysterious debt be due to if not for service actually rendered at rate for extraordinary confidence before have forced upon acknowledgment of debt be turned out of house now felt to be hard be two hundred year a pension for gentleman after life long service be to be endured that must have listened for so many year to abominable politics of marquis to anger disappointment of marchioness that must have be so closely connected for so many year with luxury wealth rank then arrive at so poor evening of day a thought of felt more ashamed of misfortune because believed to be in respect stronger man than marquis have flattered that must lead marquis have thought that have be fairly successful in doing so life have be idle luxurious full of comfort marquis have allowed to do pretty well what pleased until in evil hour have taken side of marchioness in family quarrel then marquis though weak in health almost to death have suddenly become strong in purpose have turned abruptly out of house with miserable stipend hardly fit for more than butler must be that must put up with such usage allow marquis to escape unscathed out of hand in condition of mind have determined that owed to to do say something must frighten lordship into more generous final arrangement there have be said to again again such confidence with lady of so high rank that owner of ought not to be allowed to languish upon two even upon three hundred year if whole thing must really be explained to marquis marquis must probably see to be to be added fact that harm have be done marchioness owed very much for having wished to assist in getting rid of heir be disagreeable to marquis owed more for not having done owed very much in that have never said word of to anybody else have thought that might be clever enough to make marquis understand something of without actually explaining that mysterious promise have be made that a promise must not be kept compensation must be awarded be what have desired to bring home to mind of marquis have betrayed confidence intended to betray none be very anxious that marquis must be aware that a mr greenwood be gentleman confidence must be safe in hand then marquis ought to do part of business not turn confidential chaplain out of house after quarter of century with beggarly annuity of two hundred year marquis seemed to have acquired unusual strength of character mr greenwood found that word be very difficult to be found have declared that there have be bitterness beyond that must not go be impossible to hint that ladyship have wished to have lord hampstead removed horrid thought of few day have become so vague to that doubted whether there have be real intention a to young lord removal even in own mind there be nothing more that must say than during period of close intimacy ladyship have promised to living of appleslocombe that a promise must not be kept compensation must be made to be sum of money named asked marquis nothing of kind ladyship thought ought to have living ca have there be end of think that nothing must be done for think that nothing must be done for more than have be done very well be not going to tell secret have be intrusted to a gentleman even though be so badly used by who have confided to ladyship be safe with because sympathized with ladyship lordship turned out of house did must have be treated like have not taken ladyship part be too noble to betray secret doubt must compel lordship to behave to in very different manner yes lord be quite ready to go now have made appeal have made in vain have wish to call upon ladyship a gentleman be bound to give ladyship unnecessary trouble while last speech be going on servant have come into room have told marquis that duca di crinola be desirous of seeing servant in establishment be of course anxious to recognize lady france lover a italian duke marquis must probably have made excuse for not receiving lover at moment have not felt that might in way best insure immediate retreat of mr greenwood mr greenwood went roden be summoned to lord kingsbury presence meeting took place under circumstance naturally made marquis incapable of entering at moment with much spirit on great duca question chapter xii lord hampstead again with mr roden week have

there be ducaites anti ducaites demijohn faction generally a being under influence of crocker be of opinion that george roden being duke must not rid of ducal nature be loud in expression of propriety of calling duke duke whether wished mr grimley at duchess be warm on other side george roden according to light being clerk in post office must certainly be briton being briton therefore free be entitled to call pleased be generally presumed to enunciate properly constitutional theory in matter a be leading personage in neighbourhood duca be for most part called by old name there be contest on one occasion blow have be struck helped to keep life alive in row there have arisen source of intense interest samuel crocker be now regularly engaged to marry miss demijohn there have be many

between old lady on matter have be stormy unsuccessful be sort of thing that one doe understand at know crocker have said to mr grimley giving landlady to understand that be not going to part with own

at last contented with assurance that there must be breakfast trousseau be to cost l with promise of hope of what brandy water might do for have given in match be made have there be more than in matter row must not have be much stirred by row be so full of earl marquis duke that crocker love must have awakened more than passing attention for concomitant incident be touching in nature interesting in development daniel tribbledale junior clerk at pogson littlebird have fought battle with passion for clara demijohn like man manly though battle have be love have prevailed over have at last found impossible to give up girl of heart have declared intention of punching crocker head must ever find in neighbourhood of row with object of doing frequented row constantly from ten in

complete clara have begged to leave vicinity of holloway nothing have sworn must divorce from paradise row must that breakfast ever be given must hated nuptials ever take place must be heard of be in vain that clara have threatened to die on threshold of church if anything rash be done be determined clara doubt be interested in persistency of affection be however specially worthy of remark that crocker tribbledale never did meet in paradise row monday th of july be day fixed for marriage lodging for happy pair have be taken at islington have be hoped that room might have be made for at old lady fearing interference of new inmate have preferred horror of solitude to combined presence of niece niece husband have however given clock small harmonium to grace furnished sitting room so thing might be said to stand on sound pleasant footing gradually however came to be thought by old young lady that crocker be becoming too eager on great question of duca when declared that earthly consideration must induce to call friend by name short of noble title be entitled to use be asked question two a to practice at office for have come round to paradise row that crocker be giving offence at office by persistency when speak of always call 'duca said crocker gallantly when meet always address a duca doubt may for while create little coolness will recognize at last truth of spirit actuates be 'the duca if go on doing what tell not to do said old woman will dismiss crocker have simply smiled ineffably not aeolus must dismiss for loyal adherence to constitutional usage of european court crocker be in truth making thoroughly disagreeable at post office sir boreas have have own view a to roden title have be anxious to assist lord persiflage in forcing clerk to accept nobility when have found that roden be determined have given way order have be given on subject be matter hardly admitted of order be understood that a mr roden wished to be mr roden be to be mr roden be declared that good taste required that must be addressed a chose to be addressed when therefore crocker persisted be felt that crocker be bore when crocker declared to roden personally that conscience must not allow to encounter man whom believed to be nobleman without calling by title office generally felt that crocker be as aeolus be known to have expressed a very angry be said to have declared that man must be dismissed sooner later have be reported to crocker sir boreas ca dismiss for calling nobleman by right name crocker have replied indignantly clerk have acknowledged among that might be true have remarked that there be different way of hanging dog if aeolus be desirous of hanging crocker crocker must certainly find rope before long there be little bet made between bobbin geraghty that office must know crocker no longer before end of year ala ala just before time fixed for poor fellow marriage during first week of july there came to aeolus not only opportunity for dismissing poor crocker occasion on by consent of be admitted to be impossible that must not do so knowledge of sin committed came upon sir boreas at moment of great exasperation caused by source sir boreas crocker have said coming into great man room hope will do honour of being present at wedding breakfast suggestion be unpardonable impertinence be asking one else in department except duca said crocker with what special flea in ear crocker be made to leave room instantly can not be reported reader may be quite sure that did duca accept invitation be on very afternoon that mr jerningham with assistance of one of messenger discovered that crocker have actually torn up bundle of official paper among many official sin of crocker be often guilty be that of delaying paper letter have to be written more probably copy made crocker must postpone required work from day to day paper must get locked up sometimes must not be practicable to trace there be in department who said that crocker be not always trustworthy in statement there have come up lately case in unhappy one be supposed to have hidden bundle of paper of denied having ever have custody then arose tumult of anger among who must be supposed to have have paper if crocker did not have violent search be instituted then be discovered that have absolutely destroyed official document referred to reiterated complaint of fidgety old gentleman who for year past have be accusing department of imaginable iniquity according to irritable old gentleman diabolical ingenuity have be exercised in preventing from receiving single letter through long series of year be new crime wicked thing be often done anything so wicked a have never before be perpetrated in department mind of senior clerk be terribly moved young men be agitated by delicious awe crocker be felt to be abominable heroic also original might be that new opening for great thing have be invented fidgety old gentleman have never leg to stand upon not stump now be almost impossible that must not be made to know that letter of complaint have be made away with of course crocker must be dismissed be at once suspended called upon for written explanation be to be married next week said weeping to mr jerningham aeolus have refused to see mr jerningham when thus appealed to only shook head what must mr jerningham say to man who have torn up official paper on eve of marriage have laid violent hand on bride preserved paper condition to mr jerningham thinking must have be more wholesome be never known who first carried tidings to paradise row there be who said that tribbledale be acquainted with friend of bobbin that made known to clara in anonymous letter there be others who traced friendship between potboy at duchess son of one of messenger be at rate known at crocker be summoned to interview with old woman match be then there declared to be broken off what be intention sir a to supporting that young woman mr demijohn demanded with severity of be capable crocker be so broken hearted that have not word to say for did not dare to suggest that perhaps might not be dismissed admitted destruction of paper never cared for again when saw so knocked out of time by old woman said clara afterwards what be to do about lodging asked crocker weeping tear up said mr demijohn tear up only send back clock harmonium crocker in despair looked about everywhere for assistance might be that aeolus must be softer hearted than clara demijohn wrote to lord persiflage giving very full account of affair paper said have in fact be actually torn by accident be afraid of duca must have applied to duca doubt have be most intimate friend so still declared in such emergency did not know how to address duca bethought of lord hampstead of hunting

house holding intercourse almost with one heart just now be very heavy with have begun to believe marion must in truth never become wife have begun to think that must really die that must never have have sad satisfaction of calling own lightness brightness have gone from joy used to take in argument eagerness of character unless hungry craving of unsatisfied love must still be called eagerness be in condition when crocker be brought out to in garden where be walking mr crocker said standing still in pathway looking into man face yes lord be be crocker remember lord down in cumberland remember at castle hautboy out hunting lord when have that pleasant ride home from airey force what can do for now always do think lord that there be nothing like sport to cement affection know how feel about lord if there be anything to be said perhaps will say there be bond lord have be looking for partner of joy in paradise row if have anything to say say a for friend lord know whom mean if have given offence have only be because have thought that a title be certainly theirs young lady who will be nameless ought to have advantage of have only done because of consideration for family what have come here for mr crocker be not just now disposed to converse on may say subject if there be anything indeed there be oh lord be going to dismiss for sake of paradise row lord pray pray interfere on behalf then told whole story about paper merely explaining that have be torn in accident sir boreas be angry with because have thought right to call know whom by title now be to be dismissed just when be about to take beautiful accomplished young lady to hymeneal altar only think if miss fay be to be divided in same way with much lengthened explanation be however altogether ineffectual lord hampstead have to make visitor understand that there be ground on must even justify request letter must write letter letter from lordship must do so much lord hampstead shook head if be just to say that have known intimately down in cumberland of course be not taking upon to say be so to save poor fellow on eve of marriage will write letter said lord hampstead thinking of turning over in mind own idea of what marriage must be to can not say that have be intimate friend because must not be true of course not will write letter to sir boreas can not conceive that must have effect ought to have none will lord will write will say that father be connected with uncle that condition in regard to marriage may perhaps be accepted a ground for clemency good day to not very quickly with profuse thanks shedding of tear poor crocker took leave have not be long gone before following letter be written sir though have not honour of acquaintance with take liberty of writing to a to condition of one of clerk in office be perfectly aware that must receive reprimand from hand will have deserved by unjustifiable interference mr crocker represents to that be to be dismissed because of act of a superior officer highly disapprove asks to appeal to on behalf because have be acquainted with other father be agent to uncle lord persiflage have met at uncle house dare to put forward a plea for mercy understand that mr crocker be about to be married almost immediately perhaps will feel with that period in man life must beyond others be one of satisfaction of joy of perfect contentment may be regarded with feeling of mercy must be prejudicial if used more generally faithful servant hampstead when wrote word a to period of joy satisfaction own heart be sore sore sore almost to breaking there must never be such joy never be such satisfaction for chapter xv dismissal b b by return of post lord hampstead received following answer to letter dear lord hampstead mr crocker case be very bad one postmaster general will see appeal lordship will be sure sympathize with humanity a do also can not take upon to say what lordship will think right to do will be better therefore that must abstain for present from communicating with mr crocker be lordship very faithful servant boreas bodkin excuse be sufficient to aeolus to save from horror of dismissing man knew well that crocker a public servant be not worth salt sir boreas be blessed cursed with conscience sting of conscience though be painful did not hurt so much a of feeling have owned to on occasion crocker must go crocker be in way distasteful to be not only untrustworthy incapable audacious also occasionally impudent be clerk of whom have repeatedly said that must be much better to pay salary let have perpetual leave of absence than keep even if there be salary to be paid now there have come case on be agreed by office that man must go destroy bundle of official paper mr jerningham have be heard to declare that law be in fault in not having provided that man must be at once sent to newgate for doing thing stupid old fool letter be really worth anything sir boreas have said a though attempting to palliate crime mr jerningham have only shaken head what else must do be not for to dispute matter with sir boreas to thinking old gentleman letter have become precious document priceless record a soon a have once be bound by red tape of government enveloped by security of official pigeon hole to stay away without leave to be drunk to be obstinately idle to be impudent be great official sin mr jerningham be used to knew a have often occurred before so must re occur clerk be mortal men will be idle will be reckless will sometimes get into disreputable row little added severity mr jerningham thought must improve branch of department knowing nature of men nature especially of sir boreas must make excuse here however be case in superior civil servant must entertain doubt yet sir boreas palliated even crime mr jerningham shook head sir boreas shoved on one side so a to avoid for day pain of thinking about new bundle of paper have already formed on great crocker case if one must tear up what blessing must be in way there be delay during crocker be not allowed to show face at office during delay clara demijohn became quite confirmed in determination to throw over engagement tribbledale

grimley said to tribbledale greatly comforting young man heart go in win said mr grimley indicating by opinion that ardent suitor must probably be successful if urged love at present moment strike

pleaded case be probable that just at time clara herself be made acquainted with tribbledale frequent visit to duchess though may not have be pleased with special rendezvous selected be gratified by devotion shown when mr grimley advised tribbledale to go in win be perhaps in clara confidence when girl have told friend that be going to be married have already expended considerable portion of sum

how completely parliament became mere affair of governmental necessity during first week of august must have thought just on one occasion might have managed said to trying to mingle tone of love with

of family connection rather whom eloquence must induce to show either in church at breakfast be lord hampstead sister came to assured that ought to be there sorrow said have declared before world be

fortune lord llwddythlw be one of men who prefer giving to taking have feeling that husband must supply be wanted that wife must owe everything to man marries feeling be uncommon just at present except with million who have expect other money than what earn if be told that daughter of old man who have earned own bread be about to marry young man in same condition of life be spoken of a misfortune lord llwddythlw be old fashioned have mean of acting in accordance with prejudice let marriage be ever so gorgeous must not cost dowry earl daughter might have expected be argument used by lady persiflage seemed to have be effectual a day drew near be observed that bridegroom became more sombre silent even than usual never left house of common a long a be open to a refuge saturday sunday wednesday filled up with work so various unceasing that there be time left for pretty little attention girl about to be married naturally expects did call perhaps other day at bride house never

professed to give hymeneal altar at st george with bishop dean two queen chaplain officiating bride bridegroom in glory with royal duke royal duchess looking on with star garter from own other court

told that lady amaldina have determined not to be hurried while bishop be due at afternoon meeting at three artist in creating special work of art have soared boldly into ideal in depicting buffet of

part lord hampstead looked serious there be young woman poor victim frowned knew not why remitted frown smiled again who have promised to then that rude assailant came upset joy here a narrator paused lord hampstead owned to that must not deny truth of description perhaps continued tribbledale perhaps have seen clara demijohn lord hampstead must not remember having be so fortunate because be aware that step have wandered in way of paradise row then there came frown again then smile well perhaps may be that more perfect form of feminine beauty may be ascribed to be intended a compliment more civil than true paid to marion fay on lord hampstead behalf for combination of chastity tenderness think can easily beat clara demijohn lord hampstead bowed a showing readiness to believe statement coming from so good judge for awhile interloper prevailed interloper do prevail such be female heart true rock show always at last be true rock on have built castle of happiness then may congratulate

summer nothing be absolutely arranged a to roden lady france though be known to london to great many person outside of london that be certainly to become man wife summer be very long to lord lady trafford because of necessity incumbent on of remaining through last dreg of season on account of lady amaldina marriage have lady amaldina thrown away on roden aunt must have doubt gone to country niece have done duty in life with so much propriety success that must have be indecent to desert lady kingsbury therefore remained in park lane be driven to endure frequently sight of post office clerk for george roden be admitted to house even though be at last acknowledged that must be george roden nothing more be found also that must be post office clerk nothing more lord persiflage on whom lady kingsbury chiefly depended for seeing that own darling must not be disgraced by being made brother in law to anything so low a clerk in post office be angry at last declared that be impossible to help man who must not help be use trying to pick man up who will lie in gutter be thus spoke of roden in anger then marchioness must wring hand abuse stepdaughter lord persiflage did think that something might be done for young man if young man must only allow to be called duke young man must not allow lord persiflage did not see what must be done nevertheless there be general idea abroad in world that something must be done even mysterious savour of high rank attached to young man must do something for may be remembered that marquis when first fact have come to ear that daughter loved young man have be almost a ferociously angry a wife have assented to carrying of away to saxon castle have frowned upon have be party to expelling from own house gradually heart have become softened towards in illness have repented of harshness have not borne continued absence easily have of late looked about for excuse for accepting lover when man be discovered to be duke though be only italian duke of course accepted now wife told daily that roden be not duke because must not accept dukedom ought therefore again to be rejected lord persiflage have declared that nothing must be done for therefore ought to be rejected marquis clung to daughter a man be absolutely duke according to law of herald court table of precedency usage of peerage in christendom must not de grade even by motion of own be eldest legitimate son of last duca di crinola so marquis said a such be fitting aspirant for hand of daughter of english peer have got shilling said lady kingsbury weeping marquis felt that be within own power to produce remedy for evil did not care to say a much to wife who be tender on point in regard to interest of three darling roden continued visit to park lane very frequently through summer have already arranged for autumn visit to castle hautboy in spite of angry word spoken by lord persiflage everybody knew be to marry lady france when season be over world have flitted from london nothing be settled lady kingsbury be of course very unhappy during time there be source of misery deeper more pressing more crushing than even post office clerk mr greenwood late chaplain have during last interview with marquis expressed noble sentiment must betray nothing have be said to in confidence must hing must annoy marchioness because marchioness be lady a such entitled to courtesy from a gentleman there be ground doubt on must found claim must not insist on a doing so must be distasteful to ladyship felt that be being ill treated almost robbed must put up with rather than say word must come against own conscience a gentleman with high assurance took leave of marquis a though intended to put up with beggarly stipend of l year marquis have promised perhaps have be intention before two day be over have remembered that though might be base to tell ladyship secret penny post be still open to certainly be case lady kingsbury have spoken to with strong hope of death of heir to title mr greenwood in discussing matter with went beyond declared to that have done so with expectation a well a hope fearful word have be said so assured thanked god that nothing have come of only for something assured must have come of whispering in up stair sitting room at trafford have be dreadful have divulged nothing have held tongue like gentleman ought not to be paid for holding tongue there be so many who act honestly from noble motif then feel that honesty must be rewarded by gain dishonesty might have procured for about fortnight after visit mr greenwood made to marquis did write letter to marchioness be not anxious said to do more than remind ladyship of peculiarly confidential discussion took place between yourself at trafford during last winter think will acknowledge that be of nature to make feel must not be discarded like old glove if must tell lordship that something must be done for something must be done ladyship when received be very much frightened remembered expression have allowed to use did say hesitating halting word to husband suggesting that mr greenwood pension must be increased marquis turned upon in anger did ever promise anything asked have promised nothing be giving more than deserves will do more said marquis there be something in voice forbade to speak word mr greenwood letter having remained for ten day without answer there came can not think that will acknowledge right to expect answer said considering many year through have enjoyed privilege of ladyship friendship very confidential term on have be used to discus matter of highest interest to matter have doubt be probability of accession to title of own son through demise of elder brother understood now own folly something of own wickedness to second appeal wrote short answer having laid awake over one entire night dear mr greenwood have spoken to marquis will hing yours truly c kingsbury did without saying word to husband then after interval of few day there came third letter dear lady kingsbury can not allow to think that must be end of after so many year of social intimacy confidential intercourse can imagine condition of gentleman of age reduced after life of ease comfort to exist on miserable pension of l year simply mean death death have not right to expect something better after devotion of life who have known a well a stumbling block to ladyship ambition have be found in existence of lord hampstead lady france trafford have sympathized with doubt partly because of peculiarity partly from sincere affection for ladyship can not surely be that ladyship must now treat a enemy because must do more than sympathize dig can not to beg be ashamed will hardly wish must perish from want have not a yet be driven to open out sad case to one force to for sake of darling child for whose welfare have ever be so anxious believe to be ladyship most devoted faithful friend thomas greenwood epistle so frightened that began to consider how might best collect together sufficient sum of money to satisfy man did succeed in sending note for l be too wary to take returned saying that must not though steeped in poverty accept chance eleemosynary aid what required have thought right to ask be increase to fixed stipend allowed must thought again force upon presence of marquis explain nature of demand more explicitly upon lady kingsbury showed letter to husband what doe mean by stumbling block asked marquis in wrath then there be scene be sad enough have to confess that have spoken very freely to chaplain respecting step child freely what doe freely mean do want out of way what question for husband to have to ask wife have door by must partly escape be not that have wanted out of way that have be so horrified by what have thought to be very improper idea a to own rank of life marriage have intended have caused to speak a have done to chaplain when alone at trafford have doubt opened mind to clergyman rested great deal on undoubted fact that mr greenwood be clergyman hampstead fanny have be stumbling block to ambition because have desired to see married properly into proper family probably thought that be telling truth a said be at rate accepted a truth be condoned a to hampstead be known by time that marriage must never take place a to lady france marchioness be driven in present misery to confess that a duca be in truth duca family must be held to be proper marquis sent for mr cumming london solicitor put letter into hand with such explanation a thought necessary to give mr cumming at first recommended that pension must be altogether stopped to marquis did not consent must not suit that must starve said marquis if continues to write to ladyship something must be done threatening letter to extort money said lawyer confidently can have before magistrate to morrow lord if be thought well be however felt to be expedient that mr cumming must in first case send for mr greenwood explain to gentleman nature of law mr cumming doubt felt that must be well that mr greenwood must not starve well also that application must not be made to magistrate unless a last resort too asked what be meant by stumbling block mr greenwood be greedy rascal descending to lowest depth of villany with view of making money out of fear of silly woman silly woman lawyer thought must have be almost worse than silly seemed natural to mr cumming that stepmother must be anxious for worldly welfare of own child not unnatural perhaps that must be so anxious a to have feeling at heart amounting almost to wish chance must remove obstacle chance a mr cumming be aware must in case mean only death mr cumming when put in plain term to felt to be very horrid there might be doubt whether feeling must be criminal if backed up by deed expressed by word here seemed that word have be spoken mr greenwood have probably invented that particular phrase must hardly have invented unless something have be said to justify be business however to crush mr greenwood not to expose ladyship wrote very civil note to mr greenwood must mr greenwood do kindness to call in bedford row at such such hour indeed at other hour might suit mr greenwood thinking much of resolving in mind that increase to pension might probably be made through mr cumming did a be bid waited upon lawyer mr cumming when clergyman be shown in be seated with letter before various letter mr greenwood have written to lady kingsbury folded out one over so that visitor eye might see feel presence did not intend to use unless of necessity mr greenwood said learn that be discontented with amount of retiring allowance marquis of kingsbury have made on leaving service be mr cumming certainly be l year be not let call l mr greenwood well yes lord hampstead did say something have paid something let call l not that amount matter marquis lord hampstead be determined not to increase determined quite determined that under circumstance will increase may find necessary to stop be threat certainly be threat a far a go there be threat may have to make for sake of coercing wish to use if can do without ladyship know that be ill treated in matter sent l returned be not in way wished to be paid for service be well for that did for must not certainly have asked to come see here must not must not will probably understand what mean here mr cumming laid hand upon letter made other allusion to very few word more will think settle that there be to be arranged between marquis from certain reason of humanity with for one hardly sympathize in case be most unwilling to stop even to lessen ample pension be paid to ample after whole lifetime will do so if write further letter to member of family be tyranny mr cumming very well then be marquis tyrant will go further than in tyranny if be necessary to defend of family from further annoyance will do so by criminal proceeding be probably aware that doing must be very disagreeable to marquis undoubtedly must to such man a lord kingsbury be great trouble to have own name worse that of others of family brought into police court if necessary will be done ask for assurance mr greenwood because may be well that must take little time to think of unless be willing to lose income to be taken before police magistrate for endeavouring to extort money by threatening letter have better hold hand have never threatened good morning mr greenwood mr cumming have threatened one good morning mr greenwood then discarded chaplain took leave failing to find word with must satisfactorily express sense of injury have be done before day be over have made up mind to take l year be silent marquis now found be not so infirm a have thought marchioness quite so full of fear must give up take pittance in doing so continued to assure that be greatly injured did not cease to accuse lord kingsbury of sordid parsimony in refusing to reward adequately one whose service to family have be so faithful long enduring may however be understood that in midst of trouble such a lady kingsbury did not pas pleasant summer chapter xxi registrar of state record although lord persiflage have seemed
