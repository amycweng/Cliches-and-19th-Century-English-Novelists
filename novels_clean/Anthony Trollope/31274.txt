made a to state of lord health state of lord mind on behalf of frederic lovel distant heir to title let question of lord marriage with josephine murray go a might frederic lovel who have never seen far away cousin must be future earl of there be doubt new inquiry be to be made might well be that interest of young heir must be more deeply involved in marriage question than in other matter

enabled mighty lord to live a beast of prey among kind be at own disposal have one child certainly lady anna who must inherit be father to die intestate be marriage proved young heir near to altogether disbelieved marriage a be natural have never seen who now called countess who for year after child be born have called mr murray who have be discarded by own relation have taken to live with country tailor a year have rolled by memory of what have really occurred in applethwaite church have become indistinct though reader know that marriage be capable of easy proof that there must have be little difficulty have only difficulty consisted in proving that young heir distant lovels be not assured of interest be adverse be determined to disbelieve earl might probably must leave wealth to stranger have never in way noticed heir cared for none bore name tie in world call love deem respectable regard a happy because have to do with marriage blood relationship a established by law since day of moses be odious to ridiculous in sight because obligation be distasteful to law except preserved to use of own money now there came up great question whether be mad sane be at once rumoured that be about to leave country fly back to sicily then be announced that be dead be dead have died at age of sixty seven in arm of woman have brought there evil career be over soul have gone to future life for have made fit by life have led here body be buried in applethwaite churchyard in further corner of long straggling valley parish lovel grange be situated at grave there stood single mourner young lord be there of right disdaining even to wear crape band round hat woman remained shut up in own chamber difficulty to young lord lawyer who must hardly tell foreigner to pack begone before body of late lover have be laid in grave have be simply intimated to on date within week from funeral presence in house must not longer be endured have flashed round upon lawyer who have attempted to make award known to in broken french have answered simply by word of scorn spoken in italian to waiting maid then will be read in presence of young earl for there be will everything that late lord have possessed be left in one line to best beloved friend signorina camilla spondi be stated very fully explained that camilla spondi be italian lady living at grange at date on will be made of old lord now existing lovel mention be made there be however two other clause part in will there be schedule giving in detail particular of property left to camilla spondi there be rambling

few page will drop altogether from story copy of will be also sent to lawyer who have hitherto taken charge of interest of repudiated countess be intimated that allowance hitherto made to must now of necessity cease if thought fit to prosecute further claim must do so by proving marriage be explained to probably without much of legal precise truth in explanation that such proof must include disproving of assertion made in earl will a be intention of heir to set aside will such assurance be to say least of disingenuous whole thing have now become so confused that must hardly be expected that lawyer must be ingenuous in discussing young earl clearly inherited title small estate at lovel grange italian woman be prima facie heiress to everything else except to such portion of large personal property a widow must claim a widow in event of being able to prove that have be wife in event of will being will italian woman must have nothing in such case male heir must have if marriage be marriage must have nothing if marriage must be made good if marriage must be made good lady anna must have entire property except such portion a must be claimed of right by mother widow thus italian woman young lord be combined in interest against mother daughter a regarded marriage young lord mother daughter be combined against italian woman a regarded will young lord have to act alone against italian woman against mother daughter whom friend regarded a swindler impostor be for to set aside will in reference to italian woman then to stand brunt of assault made upon by soi disant wife in very short time after old earl death double compromise be offered on behalf of young earl money at stake be immense must italian woman take l go way back to italy renouncing further claim must soi disant countess abandon title acknowledge child to be illegitimate go way with l with l a be soon hinted by gentleman acting on earl behalf proposition be one somewhat difficult in making a compromise if made with must be excellent must not be made to good effect with one only young earl certainly must not afford to buy off italian woman for l if effect of such buying off must only be to place whole of late lord wealth in hand of daughter of daughter mother italian woman consented declared with italian energy that late loving friend have never be day insane knew nothing of english law little of english money must take l having have calculation made for her of number of lira into must run number be enormous must take offer when proposal be mentioned to countess explained to by old friend thomas thwaite who have now become poor man in cause repudiated with bitter scorn with scorn in almost included old man who have made to be for that have be fighting said for in part said old

little said mother taking tailor hand in hers kissing child be lady anna dare to barter away right took place down at cottage in cumberland tailor at once went up to london to make known decision of countess a invariably called then lawyer went to work a double compromise must not be effected single compromise must not stand italian woman raved stamped swore that must have half million of lira of course right to claim have be made good to lawyer on behalf of young earl went on with work public sympathy a matter of course went with young earl a against italian woman have with english man woman be horrible to mind of english men english woman that old english earldom must be starved in order that italian harlot might revel in untold rich be felt by most men protested by woman that sign of madness be what might however insignificant must be held to be sufficient against claimant be not fact that man have made will in sufficient proof of madness there be not few who protested that further proof must be necessary with law be same for italian harlot english widow may well be that in nicety will be found kinder to former than to latter earl have be mad law said that be mad when have made will italian woman went away raging into obscurity italian woman be conquered now battle be open free between young earl claimant countess application be made on behalf of countess for fund from estate wherewith to prove claim to certain limited amount be granted such have be life of late earl that be held that cost of litigation resulting from misdeed must be paid from estate ready money be wanted immediate ready money to be at disposal of countess to amount needed by agent be hardly to be obtained by time public sympathy ran almost entirely with earl though be acknowledged that late lord be mad though have become cause of rejoicing that italian woman have be sent away penniless howling into obscurity because of old man madness still be believed that have written truth when declared that marriage have be mock marriage must be better for english world that young earl must be rich man fit to do honour to position fit to marry daughter of duke fit to carry on glory of english peerage than that woman ill reputed in world must be established a countess with daughter dowered with ten of thousand a to whom be already said that be in love with tailor son nothing must be more touching more likely to awaken sympathy than manner in josephine murray have be carried away in marriage then roughly told by man who must have protected from harshly blowing wind of heaven that have deceived that be not wife usage to woman have ever be subjected a have be said before be more adapted to elicit compassion energetic aid nineteen year have now passed by since deed be done fact be forgotten one energetic friend there still be may say two tailor son daniel public belief ran against countess nobody who be anybody in world must give title bet be laid two three to one against be believed that be impostor earl have glory of success over first opponent loud boasting of self confident barrister buoyed up cause loud boasting barrister may nevertheless be wise lawyer question of compromise be again mooted if lady must take thirty thousand pound vanish must have money clear of deduction expense must be paid amount offered be thought to be very liberal did not amount to annual income be at stake be rejected with scorn have be quadrupled must have be rejected with equal scorn loud boasting barrister be still confident though be never admitted in word still be felt that there might be doubt what if contending party be to join force if countess ship of countess be to be admitted heiress ship of lady anna if earl lady anna be to be united in holy wedlock might there not be safe solution from further difficulty in way chapter iii lady anna idea of further compromise of something more than compromise of half acknowledgment of own weakness came from mr flick of firm of norton flick solicitor who be employed in substantiating earl position when mr flick mentioned to sir william patterson great barrister who be at time solicitor general leading counsel on behalf of lord lovel sir william patterson stood aghast be dismayed sir william intended to make mince meat of countess be said of that intended to cross examine countess off leg right out of claim almost into grave certainly did believe to be impostor who have not thought to be entitled to name when first assumed must be sorry mr flick to be driven to think that anything of kind must be expedient must make sure of fortune to family said mr flick what about friend countess let call countess lovel sir william will break bone a to formality of own marriage there can be doubt about can prove by grogram that be told that wife be living said sir william grogram be old butler who have be in old earl service for thirty year believe can sir william be quite clear that will never get other wife to come over face english jury be of use blinking gentleman whom have sent over doubt altogether that there be marriage be certain fear that woman be not old countess there be two sister may be that be other sister sir william be good deal dismayed recovered stake be so high that be quite possible that gentleman who have be sent over might have be induced to open eye to possibility of such personation by overture from other side sir william be of opinion that mr flick must go to sicily be not sure that sir william majesty solicitor general must not make journey in person be by mean disposed to give way tell that girl be better than must be said to mr flick think so bad a of said mr flick be lady anything like lady be told be very beautiful dare say so be mother before never saw handsomer woman of age than friend countess must not recommend young lord to marry underbred bad girl bastard who claim to be cousin support proposition merely on ground of look thirty five thousand year sir william pleaded attorney hope can get thirty five thousand year for client without paying so dear for have be presumed that real countess original countess italian lady whom earl have married in early life must be brought over with properly attested documentary evidence in pocket to prove that be existing countess that other countess must be impostor deluded dupe doubt old earl have declared when first informing josephine murray that be not wife that real wife have died during few month have intervened since mock marriage be acknowledged on side that old earl have be villain liar be part of duty of young earl of who acted for to defend character of old earl to wash that blackamoor white even to make whity brown be not necessary to anybody one be now concerned to account for crooked course if must be shown that have married lady in italy a to there be doubt that lady be still alive that have be alive when second marriage took place then lady anna must not inherit property have be freed from grasp of italian mistress seemed that lady if lived must not be made to come mr flick did go to sicily came back renewing advice to sir william that lord lovel must be advised to marry lady anna

married to old lord now twenty five year ago did believe probably younger sister of woman also believed that wife have be dead before marriage at applethwaite be private opinion mr flick be in way honest man one who certainly must have taken conscious part in getting up unjust claim be now acting a legal agent for young earl be not business to get up evidence for earl opponent did think that be to use ingenuity fund at disposal must be able to reach real truth in such manner that must be made clear indubitable to english jury if real truth be adverse to side why search for understood that english countess must stand ground on legality of applethwaite marriage on acquittal of old earl a to charge of english countess being firm so far a ground must make firm must in reality be for other side for young earl to prove former marriage burden of proof must be with not with english countess to disprove disingenuous lawyer mr flick who though fairly honest must be disingenuous among number have declared contrary such be case a money be scarce with countess friend attempt have be made on part to bring home evidence from sicily mr flick knew doubted how far might be wise for further to disturb sicilian romance italian countess who be hideous worn out old woman professing to be forty four probably fifty five looking a though be seventy seven must not stir step towards england must swear have sworn number of oath documentary evidence from from various priest from servant from neighbour there be in plenty mr flick learned through interpreter that certain old priest ridiculed idea

have not sworn anything be wanted be not to be paid moderate payment be made to hideous screeching greedy old woman trivial payment a to mr flick be heartily ashamed of be made to old priest then mr flick hurried home fully convinced that compromise must be made a to money that legality of title claimed by two english lady must be allowed might be that hideous hag have once be countess lovel certainly be case that old earl in latter year have so called though have never once seen during last residence in sicily might be that clumsy fiction of letter have be perpetrated with view of bolstering up true case with false evidence mr flick thought that there must be compromise expressed opinion very plainly to sir william patterson mean marriage said solicitor general at time mr hardy qc second counsel acting on behalf of earl be also present not necessarily by marriage sir william must divide money girl be not of age said mr hardy be barely twenty a yet said sir william think might be managed on behalf said attorney who must be empowered to sacrifice right said mr hardy who be gruff man might perhaps contrive to tide over till be of age said solicitor general who be sweet mannered mild man among friend though must cross examine witness off leg hers if necessity of case required to do so of course must do sir william what be year in case a not much among lawyer be mr flick think that must bring case into court be good case sir william doubt there be woman countess will call ready to swear have sworn that be old earl wife people round call countess earl undoubtedly

'd be so to say nowhere nowhere at said solicitor general entailed property be worth above thousand year 'd make arrangement said mr flick whose mind may perhaps have have not unnatural bend towards own very large venture in concern that bill including honorarium of barrister must sooner later be paid out of estate did not doubt compromise must make settlement easy pleasant mr hardy be in favour of continued fighting keener honester more enlightened lawyer than mr hardy did not wear silk at moment have not gift of seeing through darkness belonged to solicitor general when mr flick told of strength of case a based on various head of evidence in favour mr hardy believed mr flick word rejected mr flick opinion believed in heart that english countess be impostor not believing in own claim must be gall wormwood to to give to one moiety of wealth must go to support ancient dignity aristocratic grace of house of lovel hated compromise desired justice be great rather than successful lawyer sir william have at once perceived that there be something in background on be duty to calculate be bound to consider with at same time be inexpedient that must form closer more accurate acquaintance must do best must for client earl lovel with thousand year that probably already embarrassed must be poor wretched creature mock lord earl without very essence of earldom earl lovel with fifteen twenty thousand year must be a good a most other earl must be difference between two powdered footman four between four hunter eight between belgrave square eaton place sir william have felt confident must of course have preferred four footman for client eight hunter belgrave square even though poor english countess must have starved be fed by tailor bounty be not confident began to think that wicked old earl have be too wicked for say be very nice girl said sir william very handsome indeed be told said mr flick in love with son of old tailor from keswick said mr hardy will prefer lord to tailor for guinea said sir william thus be decided after indecisive fashion that client must be sounded a to expedience of compromise be certain to that poor woman must be glad to accept for herself daughter half of wealth at stake half must be to almost unlimited rich on condition that rank be secured to rank privilege of honest legitimacy a to such arrangement necessary delay offered doubt serious impediment be considered that wisest course must be to propose marriage who must propose how must be proposed sir william be quite willing to make suggestion to young lord young lord family whose consent must of course be first obtained who must then break ice to countess suppose must ask friend serjeant said mr flick serjeant bluestone be leading counsel for countess be vehemently energetic in case swore everywhere that solicitor general have leg to stand upon that solicitor general knew that have leg let bring italian countess over if dared 'd countess discountess too since have first known english court of law there have be case hard a be hard have not old earl be acquitted of charge of bigamy when unfortunate woman have done best to free from position serjeant bluestone who be very violent man taking up case a though very holding of brief opposite to be insult to have never before be so violent serjeant will take a surrender said mr flick must get round serjeant said sir william there be lady in lovel family must manage through so be arranged by young lord lawyer that attempt must be made to marry to heiress two cousin have never seen other lady anna have hardly heard of frederic lovel before father death since have be brought up to regard young lord a natural enemy young lord have be taught from youth upwards to look upon soi disant countess daughter a impostor who must day strive to rob of birthright in latter day a impostor who be hard at work upon project have be told of intimacy between countess old tailor also of between so called lady anna young tailor to distant lovels to frederic lovel who have be brought up with knowledge that must be earl to uncle aunt by whom have be brought up woman down at keswick have be represented a vulgar odious disreputable know how firm can be faith of family in such matter lovels be not without fear a to result of attempt be being made understood quite a well a did mr flick glory of position must attend upon success wretchedness attendant upon pauper earldom be nervous enough in mood frightened trust in justice of cause be unbounded old earl whose memory be horrible to have purposely left two enemy in way there have be italian mistress backed up by will there have be illegitimate child one be vanquished other ah must be bad with indeed if enemy must not be vanquished too have offered l to enemy enemy must not accept bribe idea of ending trouble by marriage have never occurred to have mr lovel be asked about must have said that anna murray a always studiously called lady anna be not fit to be married young lord who few month after cousin death have be old enough to take seat in house of peer be gayhearted kindly young man who have be brought home from sea at age of twenty on death of elder brother of family have wished that must go on with profession in spite of earldom have be thought unfit that must be earl midshipman at same time cousin death while be still on shore settled question be fair haired well made young lad looking like sailor inch gentleman have believed that lady anna be lady anna earthly consideration must have induced to meddle with money since old lord death have lived chiefly with uncle charles lovel having passed two three month at lovel grange with uncle aunt charles lovel be clergyman with good living at yoxham in yorkshire who have married rich wife woman with two thousand year of own be therefore well to do in world two son be at harrow have one other child daughter with also lived miss lovel aunt julia who be supposed of lovels to be wisest most strong minded parson though popular man be not strong minded be passionate loud generous affectionate indiscreet be very proud of nephew position a head of family very full of nephew wrong arising from fraud of murray woman be violent tory have heard much of keswick radical never doubted for moment that old thwaite young thwaite be busy in concocting enormous scheme of plunder by to enrich to hear that have be convicted transported be hope of life that radical must not be worthy of transportation be to impossible that radical must be honest be to incredible be thoroughly humane charitable man whose good quality be a little intelligible to old thomas thwaite a be of thomas thwaite to to whom must solicitor general first break matter have already have intercourse with lovels have not be impressed with sense of parson wisdom be whig solicitor general for there be still whig in day mr lovel have not much liked mr flick have seen much of family having have many interview with young lord with parson with aunt julia be at last settled by sir william advice that letter must be written to aunt julia by mr flick suggesting that must come up to town mr lovel will be very angry said mr flick must do best can for client said sir william letter be written miss lovel be informed in mr flick most discreet style that a sir william patterson be anxious to discus matter concerning lord lovel case in woman voice must probably be of more service than of man perhaps miss lovel must not object to trouble of journey to london miss lovel did come up brother came with interview took place in sir william chamber one be present sir william miss lovel mr flick mr flick have be instructed to sit still say nothing unless be asked question obeyed instruction after apology be perhaps too soft sweet be by mean needed a miss lovel though very wise be soft sweet great man thus opened case be very serious matter miss lovel very serious indeed can hardly perhaps conceive how great load of responsibility lie upon lawyer shoulder when have to give advice in such case a when perhaps prosperity of whole family may turn upon word can only do best ah yes miss lovel be easy to say how will know what be best suppose truth will prevail at last be impossible to think that young man such a nephew must be swindled out of noble fortune by intrigue of two such woman a ca believe wo believe of course be only woman always thought wrong to offer even shilling sir william smiled rubbed head fixing eye on of lady though smiled must see that there be real sadness in face mean to say doubt said indeed do think that wicked scheme like can succeed before english judge if scheme be not wicked let tell one two thing miss lovel rather own private opinion on one two point believe that two lady be swindler be not lady feel sure that be swindler said miss lovel very firmly turning face a spoke to attorney be telling of course merely own opinion will beg to believe of that in forming have used experience caution long course of practice in matter have taught nephew be entitled to best service at present moment can perhaps do duty to most thoroughly by asking to listen to lady closed lip together sat silent whether mr murray a have hitherto called be be not legal wife of late earl will not just now express opinion be sure that think that be marriage be formal accurate earl be tried for bigamy acquitted people with whom have to do across water in sicily be not respectable can not be induced to come here to give evidence english jury will be naturally averse to question be one simply of fact for jury can not go beyond jury have daughter be son must have be in house of lord to decide young man must be peer a be be simply question of property of fact a to ownership of property must lose case nephew must be very poor man very poor man indeed sir william position must be distressing be bound to say that must go into court to try case with very great distrust mr flick quite agrees with quite so sir william said mr flick miss lovel again looked at attorney closed lip tighter than ever did not say word in such case a prejudice will arise miss lovel be natural that family must be prejudiced against lady for be not aware that anything true can be alleged against girl have disgraced with tailor son almost screamed miss lovel have be told so believe to be true be doubt brought up a child together mr thwaite have be most kind to lady at once occurred to miss lovel that sir william be whig that there be in truth little difference between whig radical to be at heart gentleman at heart lady be to thinking necessary to be tory must be thousand pity so noble property must pas out of family by very splendour ancient nobility be placed in need of ample mean on hearing sentiment might have become even tory miss lovel relaxed somewhat muscle of face be earl to marry cousin be not cousin be earl to marry young lady who may be will be proved to be cousin whole difficulty must be cleared away marry be told that be very lovely that pain have be taken with education mother be well born well bred if must get at truth miss lovel must teach to believe that be not swindler be more swindler than be swindler will go further though perhaps young earl mr flick may think unfit to be intrusted longer with case after declaration believe though be with doubting belief that elder lady be countess lovel that daughter be legitimate child heir of late earl mr flick sat with mouth open a heard beating breast almost with despair opinion tallied exactly with sir william indeed be by opinion hardly expressed perfectly understood that sir william have be led have not thought that sir william must be so bold candid believe that anna murray be real heir gasped miss lovel do with doubting belief be inclined that way having to form opinion on very conflicting evidence mr flick be by time quite sure that sir william be right in opinion though perhaps wrong in declaring having be corroborated in own belief by reflex of on mind more powerful than own thinking a do continued sir william with natural bias towards own client what will jury think who will have such bias if be cousin distant cousin why must not marry be happy one bringing title other wealth there must be no more rational union miss lovel then there be long pause before one spoke word mr flick have be forbidden to speak sir william having made proposition be determined to await lady reply lady be aghast for awhile must neither think utter word at last opened mouth must speak to brother about quite right miss lovel now may go sir william good morning miss lovel miss lovel went have gone farther than thought must sir william said mr flick hardly went far enough mr flick must go farther yet if mean to save part of property for young man what must gain even if succeeded in proving that earl be married in early life to old sicilian hag still life must inherit property then not earl chapter vi yoxham rectory miss lovel wise strong minded a be did not dare to come to decision on proposition made to without consulting one strong a be found at once to be too weak to speak to nephew on subject of late interview with great lawyer without asking brother opinion parson have accompanied up to london in state of wrath against sir william in have not be sent for instead of sister to told have be said brother be away at club when got back to hotel have hour in to think of what have taken place must not at once bring to believe that former belief be vain ill founded if opinion of solicitor general have not prevailed with prevailed still le when reached brother second hand have be shaken mr lovel at first be not shaken at sir william be whig traitor have never known whig who be not traitor sir william be throwing over murray people who be whig have got hold of mr lovel must go at once to mr hardy tell mr hardy what thought case must be immediately taken out of hand of messrs norton flick did not world know that impostor be impostor sir william must be exposed degraded though in regard to threatened degradation mr lovel be almost of opinion that party must like solicitor general better for having shown to be traitor therefore proved to be good whig stormed flew about room using language hardly became cloth if nephew married girl must never own nephew again if swindle be to prevail let nephew be poor honest must give half of have towards supporting peerage be sure that boy must thank for what have done must never call woman cousin a for might tongue be blistered if ever spoke of of woman a countess lovel be inclined to think that whole case must immediately be taken out of hand of norton flick without further notice solicitor employed at last consented to call on mr norton on following morning mr norton be heavy honest old man who attended to simple conveyancing sat amidst tin box of broad acred client have alternative to send for mr flick mr flick came when mr lovel showed anger mr flick became somewhat indignant mr flick knew how to assert mr lovel be not quite same man in lawyer chamber that have be in own parlour at hotel mr flick be of opinion that better counsel be to be have in england than solicitor general opinion more worthy of trust than if earl chose to put case into other hand of course must do so must behove lordship to be very careful lest must prejudice most important interest by showing own weakness to opponent mr flick spoke in interest of client so said not in own mr flick be clearly of opinion that compromise must be arranged having given opinion must say nothing more on present occasion on next day young earl saw mr flick also saw sir william be then told by aunt of proposition have be made parson retired to yoxham miss lovel remained in london with nephew by end of week miss lovel be brought round to think that compromise be expedient took place in may cause have be fixed for trial in following november long interval having be allowed because of difficulty expected in producing evidence necessary for rebutting claim of late earl daughter by middle of june lovels be again in parson sister parson wife earl never saw young woman in life said earl to aunt a for said aunt doubt must see if thought wise to do so suppose might be asked to rectory said mr lovel must be giving up altogether said rector sir william said that must not be against at said aunt julia must have to call lady anna said mr lovel must do said rector must be much better to give half why must take half if whole belongs to said young lord why must ask even for half if nothing belongs to at time young lord have become almost despondent a to alleged right now again have made everybody belonging to miserable by talking of withdrawing from claim have come to understand sir william believed that daughter be real heir thought that sir william must know better than others be down hearted low in spirit not le determined to be just in that did have made inquiry said aunt julia do believe that story heard against girl be untrue tailor son have be most intimate friend said mr lovel because have none others said mr lovel have be settled that by th of june lord be to say whether must must not take sir william advice if must do so sir william be to suggest what step must next be taken a to making necessary overture to two lady if must not then sir william be to advise how best case might be carried on be again at yoxham day necessary communication be to be made to mr flick by post young man have be alone whole morning thinking of condition undoubtedly desire for money have grown on strongly why must not have done so be there nobleman in great britain who can say that must lose fortune posse fortune expects without agony must almost break heart young lord lovel sighed for wealth without title must only be to terrible burden yet be resolved that must take part in anything be unjust girl heard be beautiful soft pleasant now told that evil thing have be reported against have be slander be assured that be neither coarse vulgar unmaidenly two three old men of equal rank with own men who have be father friend be allied to lovels have be taken into confidence by sir william told that proper way out of difficulty have be suggested to there must be nothing said more fitting than two cousin so situated must marry with such acknowledgment of rank birth everybody must visit wife there be not countess duchess in london who must not be willing to take by hand two aunt have gradually given way be clear to that uncle must give way even uncle if must yield be explained to that if girl came to yoxham with privilege of being called lady anna by inhabitant of rectory must of course do so on understanding that must accept cousin hand might not like said young earl to aunt not like said lovel putting hand up to brow pushing away hair be possible that girl must not like such man a earl if did not like aunt lovel then must not ask to be wife thought that there be injustice in yet before day be over have assented think that can call lady anna said rector think can bring tongue to do chapter vii solicitor general perseveres there be considerable difficulty in making overture to two lady rather in making to elder lady for suggestion if made to daughter must of course come to from mother have be decided at last that lady anna must not be invited to rectory till have be positively settled that must be lady anna without further opposition that opposition to claim must be withdrawn at rate till be found that young people be not inclined to be engaged to other how can call lady anna before have made up mind to think that be lady anna said parson almost in tear a to rest of family may be said that have come silently to think that countess be countess that lady anna be lady anna silently in reference to other for not one of except young lord have positively owned to such conviction sir william patterson have be too strong for be true that be whig be possible that be traitor be man of might opinion have domineered over to make thing a straight a must be made must be well that young people must be married what must be earldom of lovel without wealth old mad earl have amassed sir william mr flick be strongly in favour of marriage mr hardy at last assented worst of be that something of doubt on part of earl friend be sure to reach opposite party be shaking in shoe serjeant bluestone said to junior counsel mr mainsail do believe be not going to fight at said to mr goffe attorney for countess mr mainsail rubbed hand mr goffe shook head mr goffe be sure that must fight mr mainsail who have worked like horse in getting up arranging evidence on behalf of countess in sifting a best might italian document be delighted sir william feared felt that be quite possible that earl overture might be rejected because earl must not be thought to be worth having must count upon coronet said sir william to mr flick must not do better even if property be undoubtedly own how be first suggestion to be made mr hardy be anxious that everything must be straightforward sir william assented with certain inward peevishness at mr hardy stiff necked propriety sir william be anxious to settle thing comfortably for party mr hardy be determined not only that right must be done also that must be done in righteous manner great question now be whether must approach widow daughter otherwise than through serjeant bluestone serjeant be such blunderbuss said solicitor general serjeant be counsel for lady be at last settled that there must be general conference at sir william chamber very short note be written by mr flick to mr goffe stating that solicitor general thought that meeting might be for advantage of party meeting be arranged there be present two barrister one attorney for side many anxious thought be given to manner in meeting must be conducted serjeant bluestone be fully resolved that must hold own against solicitor general must speak mind freely mr mainsail got up little telling question mr goffe mr flick felt that must behove to hold peace unless questioned be equally determined to hang fast by client mr hardy in heart of heart thought that learned friend be about to fling away case sir william have quite made up mind a to line of action seated most courteously giving place according to rank great arm chair for serjeant bluestone from serjeant must hardly be able to use arm with accustomed energy then began at once gentleman said must be great pity that property must be wasted fear of mr solicitor said serjeant must be great pity that property must be wasted repeated sir william bowing to serjeant be disposed to think that best thing two young people can do be to marry other then paused three gentleman opposite sat erect barrister a speechless a attorney solicitor general have nothing to add have made proposition be desirous of seeing effect might have before spoke word then acknowledge countess marriage of course said serjeant pardon serjeant acknowledge nothing a matter of course be countess till be proved that wife be living when be married quite a matter of course said serjeant quite a matter of course if will make case stronger continued sir william marriage be formal regular that believed marriage to be righteous marriage before god have never doubted god forbid must have harsh thought against poor lady who have suffered so much cruel treatment why have thing be said then asked serjeant beginning to throw about left arm if be not mistaken said mr mainsail evidence have be prepared to show that countess be party to contemplated fraud then be mistaken mr mainsail said sir william admit at once clearly that lady be not suspected of fraud whether be actually countess lovel not may fear must take year to prove if law be allowed to take course think that can dispose of counter claim in much le time than said serjeant may be so think that must not be so evidence in favour of lady who be now living two league out of palermo be very strong be poor creature old ignorant fairly well off through bounty of late earl always craving for trifle more unwilling to come to country childless altogether indifferent to second marriage except in so far a might interfere with hope of getting further subsidy from lovel family one be not very anxious on behalf one be only anxious can only be anxious that vast property at stake must not get into improper hand that justice must be done said mr hardy that justice must be done of course a friend observes here be young man who be undoubtedly earl of lovel who claim property a heir to late earl here be young lady be told very beautiful highly educated who be daughter of late earl who claim that property believing to be legitimate heiress question between be most intricate onus probandi lie with mr solicitor said serjeant acknowledge that doe case on account be none le intricate with view of avoiding litigation expense in certainty by arrangement enjoyment of property will fall to right owner propose that step will be taken to bring two young people together lady whom for occasion be quite willing to call countess mother of lady whom hope young earl will make own countess have not be sounded on subject must hope not said serjeant excellent friend take up little short said sir william laughing gentleman will probably consult together on subject may be advice will consider to be duty to give to mother be sure that will feel bound to let know proposition have be made hesitate to say that have right to expect that will be made known to need hardly remark be young lady to accept young lord hand must be in boat together in reference to mother rank to widow claim upon personal property left behind by late husband so solicitor general have made proposition conference be broken up with promise mr flick must hear from mr goffe upon subject serjeant have at once made up mind against compromise now proposed desired danger dust glory of battle be true to client interest doubt intended to be intensely true personal doggish love of fighting prevailed in man be clear a to necessity of going on know be beat said to mr goffe mr solicitor know a well a do that have not inch of ground under foot therefore mr goffe wrote following letter to messrs norton flick raymond building gray inn st july dear sir in reference to interview took place at chamber of solicitor general on th ult be to inform that be not disposed a acting for client countess of lovel daughter lady anna lovel to listen to proposition then made apart from very strong feeling entertain a to certainty of client success certainly be not weakened by what heard on occasion be of opinion that must not interfere with propriety in suggesting marriage of two young person who have not a yet have opportunity of becoming acquainted with other must earl of lovel seek hand of cousin lady anna lovel marry with consent of countess must be delighted at family arrangement think that a lawyer if may be allowed to say so that a lawyer have anything to do with matter be dear sir yours very faithfully goffe goffe messrs norton flick balderdash said sir william when have read letter be not going to be done in way be very well going to serjeant a have case in hand though worse messenger in affair of love not love a yet mr solicitor said mr flick mean to be love be not going to be put off by serjeant bluestone must get to lady by other mean do write to tailor down at keswick say that want to see will that be regular sir william will stand racket mr flick mr flick did write to thomas thwaite thomas thwaite came up to london called at mr flick chamber when thomas thwaite received commission be much rejoiced injustice must be done unless so much be owned on behalf nevertheless feeling of disappointment must not analyze crept across heart if once girl be married to earl lovel there must be end of service of son have never really entertained idea that son must marry girl a reader will perhaps remember have warned son that must seek sweetheart elsewhere have told over over again that when countess came to own there must be end of intimacy that there must be nothing in common between radical tailor of keswick really established countess countess while not yet really established have already begged that son might be instructed not to call daughter simply by christian name old thwaite on receiving intimation of difference of position though have acknowledged truth have felt bitterly aggrieved now moment have come of course countess must grasp at such offer of course must give that have desired much more than expected in adjusting feeling on occasion tailor thought little of girl why must not be satisfied of young earl have only heard that be handsome modest gallant lad who only wanted fortune to make one of most popular of golden youth of england why must not girl rejoice at prospect of winning such husband to have husband must necessarily be in heart whether be lady anna lovel plain anna murray what espousal must be so auspicious a feeling without much of calculation tailor said that must do a be bidden have sent for because know that have be so old friend said mr flick who did not quite approve of emissary whom have be instructed by sir william to employ will do best sir said mr thwaite making bow thomas thwaite a went along street alone determined that must perform new duty imposed upon without reference to son chapter viii impossible sent for lady lovel to bid come to ladyship ask ladyship whether must consent to marriage between two young people be thus that tailor repeated for second time message have be confided to showing gall also pride be at work about heart by repeated title gave to old friend desire that anna must marry young lord yes lady be

anna sat looking at mother in dismay must say nothing need have fear about young man one tell that be just man that mother must welcome a husband for daughter will not be glad to see lady anna must only say that be impossible why impossible dear what do mean by impossible oh mamma be impossible countess found that be obliged to give subject up for night must only comfort by endeavouring to believe that suddenness of tidings have confused child chapter ix be law on next morning lady anna be ill must not leave bed when mother spoke to declared that head ached wretchedly must not be persuaded to dress be said to last night asked countess oh mamma be impossible said seemed to mother that mention of young lord name have produced horror in daughter mind nothing must for present subdue before day be over however girl have acknowledged that be bound in duty at rate to meet cousin countess forced to satisfy with so much of concession acting upon fixed in purpose to go on with project lawyer on side must assist be for advantage of that there must be such marriage determined therefore that must at once see mr goffe own attorney give to understand in general term that case might be proceeded with on new matrimonial basis there be grievous doubt on mind fear spark of suspicion of have unintentionally given notice to thomas thwaite when asked whether have a yet spoken of proposed marriage to son have understood what be passing in mind when exacted from promise that nothing must a yet be said to daniel thwaite upon matter yet assured over over again that girl must not be so weak so vain so foolish so wicked a that must not be that after struggle of life when at last success perfect success be within grasp when have be done well done when great reward be then coming up to very lip with full tide must not be that in very moment of victory must be lost through base weakness of young girl be possible that daughter daughter of one who have spent very marrow of life in fighting for position be due to must spoil by preferring journeyman tailor to young nobleman of high rank of ancient lineage one too who by marriage with must endow with wealth sufficient to make rank splendid a well a illustrious if be not so what have girl meant by saying that be impossible that word must have be used once twice in maidenly scruple countess must understand have be repeated with vehemence beyond such natural timidity might have produced now girl professed to be ill in bed when subject be broached must only weep repeat one word with have expressed repugnance to match hitherto have not be like have in own quiet way shared mother aspiration have always sympathised with mother suffering have be dutiful through carrying a one who be bound to special obedience by peculiarity of parent position have be keenly alive to wrong that mother endured have in respect be loving child now protested that must not do one thing necessary to complete triumph must give reason for not doing so a countess thought of swore to herself that must prefer to divest bosom of soft motherly feeling than be vanquished in matter by own child daughter must find that must be stern rough enough if be really thwarted what must life be worth to if child lady anna lovel heiress only legitimate offspring of late earl lovel be to marry tailor then again told that there be sufficient excuse for such alarm daughter demeanour have ever be modest have never be given to easy friendship to propensity to men acquaintance world call flirting might be that very absence of such propensity very fact that hitherto have never be thrust into society among equal have produced that feeling almost of horror have expressed have be driven at rate to say that must meet young man countess acting upon called on mr goffe in chamber explained to gentleman that proposed to settle whole question in dispute by giving daughter to young earl in marriage mr goffe who have be present at conference among lawyer understood in moment overture have be made from other side to client indeed lady said mr goffe do not think will be excellent arrangement in heart of heart mr goffe thought that must be excellent arrangement must not commit to opinion serjeant bluestone thought that matter must be fought out mr goffe be not prepared to separate from legal adviser a serjeant bluestone have said after conference with much argumentative vehemence if be to agree to how must be if marriage must not come off court ca agree to marriage court must direct to whom property belongs profess that can prove that marriage be marriage must do so else must withdraw allegation suppose italian woman be to come forward afterwards with claim a widow where then must be client position title a dowager countess claim upon husband personal estate never heard anything more irregular in life be just like patterson who always think can make law according to light of own reason so serjeant bluestone have said to lawyer who be acting with mr goffe though did think that marriage must be best thing in world must not differ from serjeant doubt there might even yet be very great difficulty even though young earl lady anna lovel must agree to be married mr goffe on occasion said very little to countess left with feeling that certain quantity of cold water have be thrown upon scheme must not allow to be disturbed by that marriage must go on without consent on part of lawyer countess be quite satisfied must marriage be once completed money title must all go a desired have already begun to have more faith in solicitor general than in mr goffe in serjeant bluestone serjeant bluestone be not man to bear such treatment be quiet under heard that very day from mr goffe what have be done be loud in expression of displeasure be most irregular thing that have ever known other man except patterson in whole profession must have done counsel on other side probably patterson have be to client given advice to client have done so after own counsel have decided that such advice must be given must see attorney general ask attorney general what thought about now be supposed in legal circle just at period that attorney general solicitor general be not best friend in world latter be wont to call former old fogey former to say of latter that might be very clever philosopher certainly lawyer so by degree thing got much talked about in profession there be perhaps balance of opinion that solicitor general have done wrong be certain that one must be put into possession of property till court have decided to whom belonged if earl withdrew from claim widow must simply be called on to prove own marriage have in truth be proved more than once already right of legitimate child must follow a matter of course be by mean probable that woman over in italy must make claim on own behalf even must do so must not find mean of supporting must be ass said solicitor general not to see that be fighting battle for that be doing so because can best secure own client interest by securing theirs also even became nervous after day two be anxious to learn that marriage scheme be progressing told client lord lovel that must be well that marriage must take place before court sat in november in case settlement will of course have be made will simply withdraw will state fact of new marriage assert ourselves to be convinced that old marriage be good valid must lose time in wooing lord at time earl have not seen cousin have not yet be decided when must meet be duty to explain to lady lovel a client said serjeant bluestone to countess that arrangement can not afford satisfactory mode to of establishing own position must be so happy for whole family a to can know nothing lady lovel if daughter earl be attached to other there can be reason on earth why must not be married must be separate thing position must not be made to depend upon hers will withdraw serjeant bluestone how do know that will withdraw supposing at last moment lady anna be to decline alliance must withdraw then not bit of matter must be further delayed referred over to next year daughter must be kept out of money there must still be danger must not care for if be married have set up italian countess who never be countess more than be now have put up be bound to dispose of if came forward afterwards on own behalf where must all be then daughter must at rate be safe serjeant did not like at felt that be being thrown over not only by client countess a to might have be indifferent knowing that world at large laity a distinguished from lawyer child of world a who be not lawyer seemed to to be will do must be expected to do foolish thing continually can not be persuaded to subject to lawyer in doings of course go wrong when do so infinite simplicity silliness of mankind womankind at large be too well known to serjeant to cause dismay let be shown in ever so egregious fashion in case fault came from lawyer who have tampered with client who seemed to be a ignorant a though belonged to outside world man have be made solicitor general over head of profession simply because must make speech in parliament solicitor general be becoming uneasy when at end of fortnight learned that young people a have come to call on occasion have not a yet seen other must not like to have said of that have thrown over client there be who still believed that italian marriage have be real marriage italian wife alive at time of cumberland marriage though italian woman now living have never be countess mr hardy so believed in private opinion thought that solicitor general have be very indiscreet think that must ever dare to face jury said sir william to mr hardy when discussed matter about fortnight after proposition have be made why did earl always say that italian woman be wife because earl be very devil mr flick doe not think so yes doe mr flick like attorney with bad case doe not choose to say quite what think even to own counsel mr flick doe not like to throw client over do do with case have right to create increased expense agony of prolonged fallacious hope girl be father heir do suppose must not stick to brief if did not feel sure that be so then let earl be told let girl have right ah there have may be that such must be juster course then hardy can not understand that though be sure be not quite sure that though case be bad one may not be quite bad enough to be thrown up be just case in compromise be expedient if quarter eighth of probability be with take proportion of thing at stake here be compromise give to who must wish to rob girl of noble name great inheritance if be heiress not though earl be client yet how sad must be to have to tell that young man that there be nothing for to submit to lose wealth belonging to family of have be born head if can bring together there will be nothing to make sore heart of of mr hardy acknowledged to that solicitor general pleaded own case very well yet felt that be law chapter x first interview for day after intimation of mother purpose lady anna kept bed begged that might not see doctor have headache nothing headache be quite impossible that must ever marry earl lovel said whenever mother must revert to subject have not seen mamma know be sure must be impossible then when at last be induced to dress be

at time not very full of trust in serjeant having learned that be opposed to marriage scheme be glad that daughter must be induced to go out even to serjeant house a after visit girl must have ground on to oppose meeting be to be arranged must hardly plead that be too ill to see cousin when have dined with mr bluestone during time many plan have be proposed for meeting solicitor general discussing matter with young lord have thought best that lady anna must at once be asked down to yoxham a lady anna young lord must have be quite satisfied with such arrangement must have gone about obligatory wooing among own friend in house to have be accustomed with much more ease than in london lodging uncle who have corresponded on subject with mr hardy still objected must be giving up everything said if be once to call lady anna where must be then if did hit off together believe never will believe that be really lady anna lovel solicitor general when heard of objection shook head finding almost provoked to anger what ass be people not to understand that must see further into matter than must do that best way out of difficulty must be frankly to open arm to heiress must continue to be pig headed prejudiced everything must soon be gone then have scheme for inviting girl to own house to scheme obtained wife consent here courage failed might be fairer to say that prudence prevailed be very anxious intensely eager so to arrange great family dispute that must be benefited believing nay feeling positively certain that concerned in matter be honest must not go so far a to do absolute grievous damage must at last turn out that be wrong in of surmise so that plan be abandoned there be nothing left for that young earl must face difficulty be introduced to girl at lodging in wyndham street a prelude to meeting be arranged at mr flick chamber between countess proposed son in law that earl must go to own attorney chamber be in rule while be there countess came be not in rule almost

steadfast opinion why must not give up to at once must recommend that lord why must give up interest at stake be very great must for moment think of suggesting to to give up want nothing mr flick doe not belong to just so then perhaps doe belong to can never be sure doubt safest way will be for to contract alliance with lady of course must give up then settlement must make property right young earl did not quite like must rather have commenced wooing after girl have be established in own right when must have have obligation on to accept have consented be too late for now to recede have be

thought of there came upon prick of conscience so sharp that must not welcome devil by leaving unheeded how must be foresworn to one who have be so absolutely good whose have be spent for for mother whose whole life have be one long struggle of friendship on behalf who have be only playfellow of youth only man have ever ventured to kiss man whom truly loved have warned against gaud be captivating spirit now in moment of peril must remember warning will be so lord lovel asked again just stretching out hand so that must touch fold of garment can not be so said can not be can not be so lord lovel can not now do mean word to be for ever for ever replied know have be hurried sudden said purposely passing by last assurance do feel that have right to resent seeming assurance of such haste in case

make wretched indeed a for money lord lovel if be mine to give will have think then be that have wanted be that family want can understand that must be wanted a for myself for mamma can hardly understand how have be with when be young despise mr thwaite because be tailor be sure be not fit to be husband of lady anna lovel when lady anna lovel have other friend in world sheltered gave house to live in spent earnings in defence must not yield when who might have be friend strove to wrong where must mamma have be have there be mr thwaite to comfort be only friend father be have in childhood have never kind word from child only from must have be right that must have asked for anything must have refused must not have asked for said lord lovel hoarsely why not a well a be a much

received be strong while be weak be strong to comfort then lord lovel what knew of rank living under father wing told be lady anna child scouted mother be countess so swore at least believed if ever rank title be profitless burden be to do think that have learned then to love rank have learned better now have learned whether better may doubt there be lesson be quickly learned there be who say that such be devil lesson have not be strong enough not to learn must forget again lord lovel must forget also hardly knew how to speak to now whether must be fit for even to wish to persuade to be after have told that have given troth to tailor uneasy thought prompted with idea dismayed must take to heart one who have be pressed close in so vile grasp must accept heart have once be promised to tailor workman must not all world know say that have done solely for money even must succeed in doing yet to fail in enterprise to abandon to give up so enticing road to wealth then remembered what have said how have pledged to abandon lawsuit how convinced have be that girl be heiress to lovel wealth who now told that have engaged to marry tailor there be nothing more that of must say to other at moment went back in silence to inn chapter xvii journey home in absolute silence lord lovel lady anna walked back to inn have be dumbfoundered nearly so by first abrupt statement then altogether by argument with have defended have nothing further to say have indeed said have marvelled at own eloquence while be speaking be there absent from certain pride in have done thing be right have dared to defend be full of regret almost of remorse nevertheless be proud knew now one of great difficulty have be overcome be fully resolved that a have dared to tell to face anger reproach scorn must not falter before scorn reproach anger of other lovels of of lovels of yoxham mother reproach must be dreadful to mother anger must well nigh kill mother scorn must scorch very soul sufficient for day be evil thereof at present moment must be strong with strength have assumed so walked in at sitting room window with bold front earl followed two aunt be there be plain to that something be astray between lover have said among that lady anna must accept offer moment that be in form made to to eye manner of guest have be manner of girl eager to be wooed have imagined that delicately nurtured fastidious nephew might too probably be offended by solecism in conduct falling away from feminine grace such a might too readily be shown by one whose early life have be subjected to rough associate even now occurred to of that have be so earl seated in chair took up book have brought with lady anna stood at open window looking across at broad field river bank beyond of spoke word there have certainly be quarrel then aunt julia in cause of wisdom asked question where be minnie did not minnie go with said earl went in other direction at bidding mr cross be with suppose be evident from tone of voice that displeasure of head of lovels be very great start soon suppose said lady anna after lunch dear be hardly one yet will go up same see about thing will help dear asked mr lovel oh must sooner do alone then hurried into room burst into flood of tear a soon a door be closed behind frederic what ail asked aunt julia if anything ail must tell said lord something be amiss can not wonder that must be anxious knowing that know how great be importance of can not help anxiety just at present aunt julia must always remember that there will be slip between cup lip then there have be slip knew must be so always said so so did brother wish must all remember that about affair a le said better so saying lord walked out through window sauntered down to river side be over said aunt julia see why must suppose at present said aunt jane be over knew a soon a saw face when came in have said something done something be off will be matter of over twenty thousand pound year will be sure to marry somebody with money said aunt jane what with title being so handsome be certain to do well know nothing like will come in way heard mr flick say that be equal to million of money then must have be at once if go up to london about just a be will be head over ear in debt before anybody know what be doing wonder what be like pretty girl there be denying that be handsome perhaps must have be impossible jane came down here on purpose to have went out with morning to be made love to be together three time longer yesterday came home a sweet a sugar to wonder whether can have wanted to make condition about money what condition that mother must have in own keeping doe seem to be sort of young woman said aunt jane there be knowing what that mr goffe serjeant bluestone mother may have put up to frederic must stand kind of thing for minute must be quite right better anything than that man must be own master think 'd better go up to jane will be more comfortable with than with then aunt jane obedient a usual went up to young cousin bedroom in meantime young lord be standing on river brink thinking what must do have in truth very much of to think point of most vital importance a to must resolve what must be action must announcement have heard from cousin dissolve for ever prospect of marriage with be open to still a nobleman gentleman man of honour to make use of influence might command with view of getting rid of impediment of previous engagement being very ignorant of world at large altogether ignorant of man in particular did not doubt that tailor might be bought off then be sure that who must have access to lady anna must help in cause that own mother must be most forward to do so girl must hardly hold to purpose if world own world be against certainly must be beaten from if bribe sufficient be offered to tailor that must be done for sake of lovel family so lady anna lovel might not be known to have married tailor be beyond doubt be not so clear to that must take to a countess who with own lip have told that intended to be bride of working artisan a thought of a imagination went to work on abominable circumstance of such betrothal threw from hand into stream with vehemence of passion little twig held be too too frightful too disgusting then so absolutely unexpected so unlike personal demeanour so contrary to look of eye to tone of voice to motion of body have be sweet gentle gracious till have almost come to think that natural feminine gift of ladyship be more even than wealth of better savour than rank be equal even to beauty have sworn to during past night to be unsurpassed sweet one have told one so soft gracious not that be doomed by hard fate to undergo degrading thraldom that have willingly given to working tailor from love gratitude free selection be marvel to that thing so delicate must have so little sense of own delicacy did not think that must condescend to take tailor place if not if must not take if a might still be possible tailor place must not be made vacant for what then have pledged belief in justice of cousin claim have told that believing own claim to be unjust in case must prosecute be now bound by assurance bound to even to making of tailor fortune might absent from further action in matter leaving entirely in hand of lawyer might not be best for happiness that must do so have be told that even though must not succeed there might arise almost interminable delay tailor must want money before married thus might be rescued from degradation till must be old enough to understand yet how must claim that of have said now score of time that knew that be not own must cease to call girl by name people have acknowledged a own because have refused to be wife declare conviction that be base born only because have preferred to own address of low born man reeking with sweat of tailor board no must not do let marry sweeper of crossing must still call lady anna if called anything something must be done however have be told by lawyer how matter might be made to right if young lady must at once agree to be man wife have not be told what must follow must decline to accept offer mr flick solicitor general must know how to shape course before november came round must doubt want time to shape that must give be to say to mr flick to solicitor general be at liberty to tell to secret girl have told to that be at liberty to say that have rejected offer must be matter of course might go beyond tell whole story must be most expedient for many reason that must know on behalf even might be most salutary with view of liberating from grasp of humiliating lover have told against own interest at own peril to own infinite sorrow in order that might thus allay hope in must otherwise have persevered knew enough of little scheme by way of love of generosity self sacrifice of lover to feel that be bound to confidence have told that if need be might repeat tale have told at same time that tale be secret must not go with secret to lawyer chamber there divulge in course of business have be extracted from by necessity to have submitted of setting free must write to mr flick if at last be resolve that marriage be altogether out of question must not tell why be so wandered slowly on along river having decided only on only on a certainty that must tell secret neither to lawyer to own people then a walked little hand touched behind when turned minnie lovel took by arm why be alone fred be meditating how wicked world be girl in particular where be cousin anna up at house suppose be wicked know that everybody be wicked because eve ate apple adam ate too who bade devil said child whispering spoke by woman mouth why go in get ready to go so will tell one thing fred may be bridesmaid when be married think can have set heart upon why not because will be married first be nonsense fred know be nonsense be cousin anna to be wife look here darling be awfully fond of think prettiest little girl in world if ask

hollowed after told aunt julia cousin frederic be very sulky down by river that be not to wait for when mr lovel went up stair into lady anna room not word be said about occurrence of morning elder lady be afraid to ask question younger be fully determined to tell nothing even have question be asked lord lovel might say what pleased secret be with must tell if chose have given permission to do

sit with mr cross on box minnie looked at face there be still frown there obeyed without remonstrance during whole of long journey home there be hardly word spoken lady anna knew that be in disgrace be ignorant how much of story have be told to two elder lady sat almost motionless looking out upon field accepting position a one be longer thought worthy of notice of course must go back to london must not continue to live at yoxham spoken to speaking minnie went to sleep minnie mother aunt now then addressed few word to other anna felt sure that to latest day of existence must remember that journey on arrival at rectory door mr cross helped lady out of carriage while lord affected to make busy with shawl luggage then vanished be seen no more till appeared at dinner what sort of trip have have asked rector addressing to three lady indifferently for moment nobody answered then aunt julia spoke be very pretty a always be at bolton in summer be told that duke have not be there year at inn be comfortable think that young people enjoyed yesterday very much subject be too important too solemn too great to allow of even word to be said about without proper consideration did frederic like

question what be to do with girl while young earl lawyer be still pondering question of legitimacy girl whether lady anna cousin mere nobody who be trying to rob family be to be left on hand why oh why have allowed to be talked out of own opinion why have ever permitted to be invited to rectory ah how title stuck in throat a asked to take customary glass of wine with at dinner time evening on reaching london towards end of august lord lovel found that solicitor general be out of town sir william have gone down to somersetshire with intention of saying comforting word to constituent mr flick knew nothing of movement clerk be found clerk did not expect back in london till october in answer to lord lovel letter sir william undertook to come up for one day sir william be man who quite recognised importance of case have in hand engaged to tailor be said not however with look of surprise sir william will not repeat even to mr flick to mr hardy have promised lady anna that will not go

to somebody who be there ought not to be angry with shock so well yes a far a can learn father have stood by very closely did so too when there seemed to be little hope might be paid for did at le rate than if stick to nobody can beat out of what mean be that be fair game ran chance did in manly fashion earl did not quite understand sir william who seemed to take almost favourable view of monstrous betrothal what mean be that nobody can touch find fault with have not carried away got up marriage before be of age have kept from going out among friend have wronged suppose think have wronged frightfully ah well mean different thing be obliged to look at a world will look at think of disgrace of such marriage to tailor whose father have advanced mother five six thousand pound to help to win back position that be about truth of must look at round know think then that nothing must be done think that everything must be done can be done have mother on side very probably may have old thwaite on side from what say be quite possible that at very moment girl herself may be on side let remain at yoxham a long a can get to stay let everything be done to flatter amuse go down again play lover a well a doubt know how to do be clear then that great legal pundit did not think that earl must be ashamed to carry on suit to lady who have confessed attachment to journeyman tailor will be trouble to of course because must change plan when case come on in november still think that be heiress so strongly that feel sure of must in truth have have leg to stand on must fight may a well tell at once lord that must do with chance of success what must have gained have done so nothing unless must prove that real wife be dead must have be fighting for italian woman whom most thoroughly believe to be impostor then there be nothing to be done very little in way if young lady be determined to marry tailor think must simply give notice that withdraw opposition to english lady state that have so informed woman who asserts own claim call countess in sicily must let italian woman know that have done so in such case for aught anybody can say here might come forward with own case must find men here who must take up on speculation readily enough there must be variety of complication doubt very great delay in such event must question very closely nature of property a for aught have seen a yet portion of might revert to a real estate be very various be not always easy to declare at once what be real what personal hitherto have appeared a contesting right of english widow to rank not necessarily a claimant of estate italian widow if widow must be heir not lordship for among other reason marriage must be most expedient if italian countess be to succeed in proving that earl have wife living when married miss murray feel sure have not then must come forward again with endeavour to show that first wife have died since a earl undoubtedly declared more than once must be long time before tailor got money with wife feeling of court must be against must buy tailor sir william solicitor general nursed leg before answered mr flick must answer question better than can do in fact mr

asked after luggage at time have heard whole story about daniel thwaite solicitor general have disregarded altogether client injunction a to secrecy have felt that in matter of so great importance behoved to look to client interest rather than client instruction promise of marriage with tailor son must be annihilated on behalf of whole lovel family be duty a thought to see that must be effected if possible a quickly a possible be duty not only a lawyer employed in particular case a man who must be bound to prevent great evil saw looming in future in view of case marriage of lady anna lovel with colossal fortune to daniel tailor must be grievous injury to social world of country be one of evil may probably be intercepted by due discreet precaution doubt tailor wanted money man be entitled to considerable reward for that have done that have suffered in cause sir william must not propose reward must not chaffer for term with tailor must not be seen in matter having heard secret from earl thought that must get work done so sent for mr flick attorney told mr flick that knew gone engaged to tailor said mr flick holding up hand then sir william took lady anna part after such engagement be not a thought unnatural have be made while be very young when knew other man of own age in life when be greatly indebted to man when have have opportunity of measuring young tailor against young lord have done probably in gratitude so said sir william now clung to from good faith rather than affection be severe upon tailor be man especially given to make excuse for poor weak erring unlearned mortal ignorant of law unless when witness attempted to be impervious now made excuse for daniel man might have done so much worse than be doing there seemed already to be noble reliance on in conduct lord lovel thought that there have be correspondence while young lady have be at yoxham there might have be have not be clandestine marriage other reason gave why daniel thwaite must not be regarded a altogether villanous nevertheless tailor must not be allowed to carry off prize prize be too great for what must be done sir william condescended to ask mr flick what thought ought to be done doubt must be very much guided by mr solicitor said mr flick one thing be think plain mr flick must see countess tell get mr goffe to do so be clear that have be kept in dark between at present be living together in same house have better leave place go elsewhere must be kept apart girl if necessary must be carried abroad take there be difficulty about money mr solicitor there ought to be none will take upon to say that there need be none be case in court will willingly allow money out of income of property thing be so large that there must be grudging of money for needful purpose seeing what prima facie claim lady have be bound to allow to live decently in accordance with alleged rank till case be settled doubt be heiress feel quite sure sir william do though a have said before be case of feeling sure not being sure have that italian woman be really widow somebody must have brought case forward more loudly if other italian woman who died be wife must have found out when be there somebody from country must have come to with evidence knowing how much must afford to pay for mind matter have be tried before in shape old earl be indicted for bigamy acquitted be bound to regard that young woman a lady anna lovel be bound to regard mother conjointly a co heiress in different degree to personal property old earl left behind ca with safety take other view there will still be difficulty in way very serious difficulty be to marry tailor between must eventually get money perhaps mr flick have better see must know how to get at view without compromising anybody in first place let countess know everything after what have be done wo have difficulty in meeting mr goffe mr flick have difficulty in seeing mr goffe though felt that there must be very much difficulty in seeing mr daniel thwaite did tell mr goffe story of wicked tailor by mean making excuse solicitor general have made for man presumptuous covetousness knew trouble must have with man said mr goffe who have always disliked thwaites then mr flick went on to say that mr goffe have better tell countess mr goffe on point agreed with adversary two three day after subsequently to date of last letter mother have written to daughter lady lovel be told that lady anna be engaged to marry daniel thwaite have suspected how might be heart have for last month be heavy with dread of great calamity have made plan with view of keeping two apart have asked daughter question founded on very fear yet must not for while be brought to believe how did mr goffe know mr goffe have heard from mr flick who have heard from sir william patterson to whom tale have be told by lord lovel who told lord lovel said countess flashing up in anger doubt lady anna did so said attorney in spite of indignation must retain doubt attorney however be certain there must be hope that be so still pretended not to believe though fully intending to take due precaution in matter since mr goffe thought that must be prudent must remove to other lodging must think of plan of going abroad must be on guard said must not admit to be possible that lady anna lovel daughter of earl lovel daughter must have so far disgraced did believe heart have in truth told that be true at first word lawyer have spoken to how blind must have be not to have known how grossly stupid not to have understood asseveration from girl that marriage with cousin be impossible child have not only deceived have possessed cunning enough to maintain deception must have be going on for at least last twelvemonth while have be kept in

wealth of child have be made positively secure before world when be about to see unquestioned coronet of countess placed upon child brow must be destroyed through passion so mean a must not have be better to have died in poverty obscurity while there be yet doubt before assured disgrace have rested on oh to have proved that be countess child heiress of earl in order that lady anna lovel might become wife of daniel thwaite tailor made many resolution first be that must never smile upon girl again till baseness must have be abandoned loved girl a only mother do love more devoted than pelican

child have borne to earl lovel father have stigmatised a bastard must by mean be known a lady anna heiress of father wealth wealthiest fairest most noble of england daughter then there have come sweet idea that high born heiress of lovels must herself become countess lovel mother have risen higher in delighted pride have be for child have not loved a mother with mother tenderness for what must love still must never again be tender till daughter must have repudiated base monstrous engagement bound up faculty to harshness stern resolution daughter have be deceitful must now be ruthless there might be suffering have not suffered there might be sorrow have not sorrowed there might be contest have not ever be contesting sooner than that tailor must reap fruit of labour labour have be commenced

alliance between earl lovel lady who be at present called by courtesy lady anna lovel by crown courtesy mr flick said tailor who understood nature of title hated allow name grant at present be anxious to promote marriage be most anxious to bring to close ruinous litigation now be told that young lady feel hampered by childish promise have be made to daniel thwaite have expected no such announcement a did not conceive that girl must tell story of engagement be unprepared at moment for reply be not man to remain unready long do call childish said do certainly then what must engagement be if now made with earl engagement with a engagement be not yet twelve month old have be repeated within last month be infant mr flick according to language therefore perhaps child in eye of law if lord lovel wish to marry why doe do so be not hindered suppose by being child marriage with know must in fact be impossible marriage with mr flick must be quite a possible a one with lord lovel when lady be of age clergyman in england dare refuse to marry if rule prescribed by law have be obeyed well well mr thwaite want to argue with about law about possibility marriage must not be fitting know that must not be fitting must be most unfitting unless lady wished a well a just a much may be said of marriage with earl lovel to of have given promise of have known loved of have won by long friendship steady regard of mr flick be attracted to marriage by lately assured wealth of young woman never understood that lord lovel be rival when lady anna be regarded a base born child of deceased madman suppose mr thwaite be not indifferent to money then suppose wrongly a lawyer mostly do when take upon to attribute motif be not civil mr thwaite did not send for here sir in order that there must be civility between will at least be true in regard to lady anna money must become mine by reason of marriage with will guard for sake for of child may bear with power will assert right to a man must do purpose in seeking hand will neither be strengthened weakened by money believe that be hers nay know that law will give to on behalf a being betrothed to defy lord lovel other claimant money hand be two thing apart will never be governed a to one by regard a to other perhaps mr flick have said enough so good morning then went away lawyer have never dared to suggest compromise have be object in sending for man have not dared to ask tailor how much ready money must take down to abandon lady thus to relieve from difficulty doubt exercised wise discretion a have done so daniel thwaite might have become even more uncivil than before chapter xxii there be gulf fixed do think that must be happier a wife of such one a daniel thwaite creature infinitely beneath separated a must be from kith kin from whose blood share from from family than must be a bearer of proud name daughter wife of earl lovel mother of earl to come will not speak now of duty of fitness of happiness of others must depend upon

tailor be case in persecution even to very gate of grave must be wise warrantable if by such persecution odious monstrous marriage might be avoided did believe that persecution must avail at last if be only steady in resolve girl must never dare to demand right to leave mother house walk off to church to be married to daniel thwaite without countenance of single friend girl strength be not of nature be countess to yield inch then evil might come upon have heard that young people can always beat parent if be sufficiently obdurate parent be soft hearted to child be prone to yield so must

opposed by other personal gift knew belonged to lord measuring by own standard regarding man to be most manly who must be most useful in world did think to be infinitely superior to earl be working bee whereas earl be drone be one who used to best of ability mental faculty have be given to whereas earl so believed be hardly conscious of having have mental faculty bestowed upon earl be to thinking a be earl excrescence upon society have be produced by evil habit tendency of mankind thing to be got rid of before near approach must be made to social perfection in future coming of fully believed though useless earl be beautiful to eye though purposeless a regarded true purpose of speech voice be of silver sweet to ear hand must never help to morsel of bread be soft to touch be sweet with perfume idleness never reeked of sweat of labour be possible that girl a anna lovel must resist popinjay backed a must be by own instinct by prayer of one of race then from time to time thought must strike using judgment a best might on behalf ought to wish that must do so idleness of earl might be bad equally bad idleness of countess to be busy wife of busy man to be mother of many child who must be taught to be busy on behalf of mankind be to thinking highest lot of woman there be question with whether accident of birth fortune have not removed from possibility of such joy a how must be with too if in after life must rebuke because have not allowed to be wife of nobleman how must be with if hereafter men said of that held to oath extracted from in childhood because of wealth have

added address in keppel street very address about month back have refused to give of course went to countess fully believing that lady anna must also be at house though believing also that must not be allowed to see at time lady anna be still staying with mr bluestone in bedford square be doubt natural that advantage must be taken of strong position lord lovel held when have extracted promise from lady anna that must write to at end of week told sir william sir william told wife lady patterson told bluestone mr bluestone told countess be now in league against tailor if must only get promise from girl before cause came on anything that must even call promise then thing might be easy united together must not be afraid of what italian woman might do undertaking to write to lord lovel be almost a good a promise when girl once hesitates with lover have a good a surrendered to say even will think of be to accept man then mr bluestone countess putting head together determined that appeal

fraud have be party to reader will have understood a case went on opinion of who acted for young earl more especially opinion of young earl have be changed prompted to do so by various motif who have undertaken to prove that countess be countess have freely accorded to title have entertained daughter with due acknowledgment of rank birth nevertheless name of case remained have become common in

nature of case be two lady mother daughter have claimed personal property of late lord a widow daughter against claim earl lovel made claim a heir at law alleging that there be widow legitimate child case have become infinitely complicated by alleged existence of first wife in case a widow must have inherited still case went on a lovel v murray lovel so named being earl not alleged italian widow such being question presumably at issue became duty of solicitor general to open pleading in ordinary course of proceeding must have be task to begin by explaining state of family by assuming that must prove former marriage existence of former wife at time of latter marriage evidence must have be subject to cross examination then counter statement must have be made on behalf of countess witness must have be brought forward when have be done judge must have charged jury with jury must have rested decision must have taken many day joy sorrow mingled hope anxiety of long trial have be expected bet have be freely made odds being given at first on behalf of lord lovel afterwards odds on behalf of countess interest have be made to get place in court club have resounded now with fact now with have just be brought home from sicily a certain then have come suddenly upon world tidings that there must absolutely be trial that great case of lovel v murray be to be set at rest for ever by marriage of lovel with by acceptance by lovel of murray a mother in law quidnunc must not accept solution doubt lord lovel might marry second party in defence be admitted on hand that probably must do so must not stop case if there be italian widow living that widow be heir to property lovel must take place of lord lovel cause of lovel v murray must still be continued first marriage must not be annulled simply by fact that must suit young earl that must be annulled then while dispute be in progress be told at club that there be to be marriage that girl have got herself engaged to tailor that tailor mastery over be so strong that did not dare to shake off dreadful thing be told about tailor poor lady anna there have be secret marriage there be going to be child latter fact be known a certain fact to great many men at club tailor have made everything safe in twenty different way be powerful over girl equally by love by fear by written bond countess have repelled daughter from house by turning out into street by night have threatened murder suicide fortune have be offered to tailor in vain romance of story have increased greatly during last few day preceding trial be admitted by that trial a trial must be nothing there must probably be simply adjournment must be hard to say how story of tailor leaked out became at last public notorious have be agreed among lawyer that must be kept secret may perhaps have be from one attached to that be first told abroad doubt norton flick knew goffe goffe mr mainsail clerk mr hardy clerk serjeant bluestone clerk knew have promised clerk of solicitor general be of course beyond suspicion two miss bluestone have known story have solemnly undertaken to be silent a grave mr bluestone be lady with most intimately confidential friend be sworn to secrecy might have come from sarah lady maid whom countess have unfortunately attached to daughter when first gleam of prosperity have come upon among last who heard story of tailor last of who professed slightest interest in event of lovel family be lovels of yoxham earl have told nothing in answer to aunt letter then in answer to very urgent appeal from uncle young nobleman have sent only most curt most ambiguous reply when there be really something to tell must tell everything at present must only say that hoped that everything must be well have be extent of information given by earl to relation rector have waxed wrathful be wrath lessened sorrow of two aunt mitigated when truth reached by mouth of very lady fitzwarren who have be made to walk out of room after anna murray a lady fitzwarren persisted in calling young person after have heard story of tailor told story at yoxham parsonage to two aunt brought with printed paragraph from newspaper to prove truth of a be necessary that must now hurry into court to hear what solicitor general have to say about case can not stop to sympathize with grief of lovels at yoxham may however pause for moment to tell burden of poor rector song for evening knew how must be from beginning told so be sure of nobody must believe court of queen bench at westminster be crowded on th of november case be to be heard before lord chief justice be known that at rate sir william patterson must have something to tell if nothing else came of telling of story must be worth hearing preliminary of trial went on a though one believed that be to be carried through to bitter end a though evidence be to be adduced rebutted further contradicted by other evidence must again be rebutted with pleasing animosity between rival lawyer be so gratifying to outside world apparently to also juror be sworn in special jury long be time taken many threat made by chief justice before twelve gentleman must consent to go into box crowd be round door of court of individual man must have paid largely for standing room to hear trial when be wanted for use men must not come forward to accept seat with honour belongs to special juryman yet be supposed that at last there must be question to submit to jury about solicitor began statement be full of smile nod pleasant talk gesture indicative of man who have piece of work before in must take delight be always satisfactory to see assurance of cock crowing in own farm yard to admire easy familiarity with thing be awful to stranger bird if o reader be bound to stand up in court dressed in wig gown to tell story must take six hour in telling one other of knowing to be special duty so to tell that judge counsellor jury must catch clearly point be to be made how ill must story be told how must point escape memory of teller never come near intellect of hearer how must knowledge that must be so confuse tongue mine make exquisitely miserable that moment of rising before audience solicitor general rose to leg happy man with grace of motion that easy slowness unassumed confidence belongs to ordinary doings of familiar life surely must have known that looked well in wig gown a with low

must have taken lawyer by throat have endeavoured to teach what love be then trial came on before day fixed have come round only just before mr goffe showed account to serjeant bluestone god bless soul said serjeant there must be voucher for amount a mr goffe declared that there be voucher except for very trifling part of still thought that amount must be allowed countess be quite willing to make oath if need be that money have be supplied to then further consideration of question be for moment postponed trial came on on tuesday have be left vacant day a regarded trial there be meeting like other proceeding in cause very irregular in nature at chamber of solicitor general at serjeant bluestone attended with messrs hardy mainsail flick goffe at meeting among other matter of business mention be made of debt due by countess to daniel thwaite of debt solicitor general have not a yet heard though have heard of devoted friendship of old tailor support have be afforded to extent that for period shelter of old thwaite roof have be lent to countess that man have be generous trusting did know have learned of course that thence have sprung that early familiarity have enabled younger thwaite to make engagement with lady anna that something must be paid when lady came by own be aware lady be not client into circumstance have not inquired now be astounded almost scandalized by amount of debt do mean to say that advanced l in hard cash said solicitor general includes interest at five per cent sir william also small sum for bill paid by thomas thwaite on behalf have have in actual cash about l where have gone good deal of through hand said mr goffe boldly during two three year have income at during last twenty year have be at law for right advanced money when trial for bigamy took place god bless soul said mr serjeant bluestone did leave will asked solicitor general oh yes will have be proved of have copy there be nothing else to leave debt be left to son must certainly be paid without delay said mr hardy mr mainsail questioned whether must get money mr goffe doubted whether must be have before whole affair be settled mr flick be sure that on due representation amount must be advanced at once income of property be already accumulating in hand of court there be anxiety that just demand demand might be considered to be justly made on family property must be paid without delay think there must hardly be question said mr hardy seven thousand pound advanced by two small tradesman to countess lovel said solicitor general that done at time when relation of own of husband must lend penny wish have known that when went into court yesterday must hardly have done good said serjeant must have enabled one at rate to give credit where credit be due son be man who claim to be affianced to lady anna same man sir william said mr goffe one be almost inclined to think that deserves ca agree with there at said serjeant angrily one at rate be not astonished that young lady must think so continued solicitor general upon word know how be to expect that must throw early lover overboard after such evidence of devotion marriage must be too incongruous said mr hardy quite horrible said serjeant distress one to think of said mr goffe must be much better that must not be lady anna at if be to do said mr mainsail very much better said mr flick shaking head remembering that be employed by lord lovel not by countess fact of seemed to that solicitor general altogether forgot importance gentleman have romance among said sir william have not generosity valour always prevailed over wealth rank with lady in story remember valorous tailor who have succeeded with lady of high degree said mr hardy did not lady of strachy marry yeoman of wardrobe asked solicitor general know that care much about romance here said serjeant marriage must be so abominable that be not to be thought of tailor must at rate get money said solicitor general will undertake to say that if case be a represented by mr goffe certainly be said attorney then there will be difficulty in raising fund for paying if be not to have wife at rate let have money think mr flick that intimation must be made to that earl lovel will join countess in immediate application to court for mean to settle claim circumstanced a be at present there can be doubt that such application will have desired result must of course be intimated that serjeant bluestone be of opinion that money must be allowed for purpose a immediate result of conversation daniel thwaite received on following morning letter from mr goffe mr flick former intimated to that sum of nine thousand odd pound be held to be due to by countess immediate step must be taken for payment that from mr flick be much shorter than letter from brother attorney merely stated that a very large sum of money appeared to be due by countess lovel to estate of late thomas thwaite for sum advanced to countess during last twenty year present earl lovel have be advised to join countess in application to court that amount due might be paid out of income of property left by late earl that application must be made immediately mr goffe in letter went on to make certain suggestion to give much advice a very large debt of proof be extant be freely admitted by countess a step be being at once taken to ensure payment of whole sum named to daniel thwaite a father heir be hoped that daniel thwaite must at once abandon preposterous claim to hand of lady anna lovel then mr goffe put forward in glowing iniquity of daniel thwaite must be guilty must continue fruitless endeavour to postpone re establishment of noble family be thus showing united benevolence by paying to money owed chapter xxxi verdict on wednesday court reassembled in judicial glory there be same crowd same lord chief justice same jury same array of friendly lawyer there have be rumour that third retinue of lawyer must appear on behalf of what be now generally called italian interest certain word have fallen from solicitor general on monday have assured world at large that italian interest must be represented be known that italian case have be confided to firm of enterprising solicitor named mowbray mopus perhaps more feared than respected be supposed to do great amount of speculative business one from house of messrs mowbray mopus be in court on wednesday morning energetic barrister be ever enriched by fee from on behalf of italian widow speculation have be found to be too deep expenditure must be required in advance too great prospect of remuneration too remote even for mowbray mopus appeared afterwards that application have be made by gentleman for assurance expense incurred on behalf of italian countess must be paid out of estate have be refused guarantee to effect must be given at rate till must be seen whether italian lady have show of justice on side be now general belief that if there be truth at in italian claim rested on survivorship at time of cumberland marriage of wife who have long since died a proof of must have given penny to one in italy must simply have shown that earl be heir messrs mowbray mopus retired there be end for ever day of italian interest though there be same throng in court a on monday there did not seem to be same hubbub on opening of day proceeding barrister be le busy with paper attorney sat quite at ease chief justice with assistant judge who be bench fellow appeared for minute to be quite passive then solicitor general arose said that with permission must occupy court for only few minute have stated on monday belief that application must be made to court on behalf of other interest than have be represented when court first met appeared that have be wrong in surmise of course have knowledge on subject did not appear that learned gentleman be prepared to address court for third party a on behalf of client have receded from case lordship must probably say what in lordship opinion must now be proceeding of court earl lovel abandoned plea perhaps court must in circumstance decide that jurisdiction in matter be over then lord chief justice with assistant judge retired for while assembled crowd appeared to be at liberty to discus matter just a everybody pleased be undoubtedly opinion of bar at large at moment of world in general that solicitor general have done badly for client sum of money be at stake be said too large to be played with a advocate of earl sir william ought to have kept aloof from countess daughter in lieu of regarding client have taken upon to set thing right in general according to idea of right doubt be clever man knew how to address jury be always thinking of bolstering up something of own instead of thinking of case bolstering up client conception of character in general of practice in particular became stronger a be gradually believed that living italian countess be certainly impostor there must have be little good in fighting against english countess on behalf if must only have proved that other italian woman who be now dead have be real countess when cumberland marriage be made then what grand thing must have be for lovel family of who held opinion rector of yoxham be strongest most envenomed against solicitor general during whole of tuesday went about declaring that interest of lovel family have be sacrificed by own counsel late in afternoon managed to get hold of mr hardy must nothing be done mr hardy be of opinion that nothing must be done now in course of evening did at rector instance manage to see sir william to ask question must nothing be done nothing more than propose to do then case be over said mr hardy be assured that one will stir on behalf of italian lady if one did stir must only be loss of time money dear hardy understand a well a one people be saying know what must be feeling of many of lovels can only do duty by client to best of judgment in first place must remember that have acknowledged countess by advice said mr hardy mean by mine exactly so with such conviction on own part that positively refuse to be party to suit will be based on assumption that be not countess lovel let advocate be ever so obdurate can hardly carry on case in opposition to client instruction be acting for lord lovel not for lovel family feel assured of be to attempt to set up plea that other woman be alive when marriage took place in cumberland must be ashamed of evidence must become duty to endeavour to foist upon jury must certainly be beaten in ultimate settlement of property must have to do with enemy instead of friend man be tried for bigamy acquitted must jury get over unless have evidence to offer to be plain a pikestaff absolutely incontrovertible do still think girl will marry earl seems to have will of own will be bent other way do think that settlement may be made of property will be very much in earl favour when on following morning solicitor general made second speech did not occupy above quarter of hour became manifest that did not intend to alter course of proceeding while judge be absent be said by everybody in court that countess lady anna have gained suit consider to be most disgraceful course of proceeding on part of sir william patterson said rector to middle aged legal functionary who be managing clerk to norton flick think sir that there be more fight in said legal functionary there be plenty of fight in believe that jury in england must willingly have taken amount of property from head of lovel family for last twenty year ever since first heard of pretended english marriage everybody have known that be more countess than be ca understand upon word ca have not have much to do with law have always be brought up to think that english barrister must be true to client believe case can be tried again if can be shown that lawyer have mismanaged unfortunate rector when made suggestion doubt forgot that client in case be in full agreement with wicked advocate judge be absent for about hour on return chief justice declared that learned brother serjeant namely have better proceed with case on behalf of client went on to explain that a right to property in dispute indeed immediate possession of property must be ruled by decision of jury be imperative that must hear what learned counsel for so called countess daughter have to say what evidence have to offer a to validity of marriage be not to be supposed that intended to throw doubt on marriage such must be safer course doubt in ordinary course of succession widow daughter must inherit divide among in certain fixed proportion personal property of deceased intestate husband father without intervention of jury to declare right in case suspicion have be thrown adverse statement have be made a learned brother be a matter of course provided with evidence to prove plaintiff have come into court with professed intention of disproving case have better go on then wrapped robe around threw back in attitude of listener serjeant bluestone already on leg declared prepared willing to proceed doubt course a now directed be proper course to be pursued solicitor general rising gracefully bowing to court gave consent with complaisant patronage lordship doubt be right word be whispered very probably not heard smile a coming from solicitor general from such solicitor general a sir william patterson be sufficient to put judge at ease then serjeant bluestone made statement case be proceeded with after fashion of such trial will not concern to follow further proceeding of court with close attention solicitor general went away to other business much of interest seemed to drop marriage in cumberland be proved trial for bigamy with acquittal of earl be proved two opposed statement of earl a to death of first wife afterwards a to fact that be living be proved serjeant bluestone mr mainsail be very busy for two day having everything before mr hardy on behalf of young lord kept seat said not word not even asking question of one of serjeant bluestone witness twice foreman of jury interposed expressing opinion on behalf of brother that case need not be proceeded with further judge ruled that be for interest of countess ceased to style so called countess that advocate must be allowed to complete case in afternoon of second day did complete with great triumph fine flourish of forensic oratory a to cruel persecution client have endured solicitor general came back into court in time to hear judge charge be very short jury be told that have alternative to find verdict for defendant be explained to that be plea to show that certain marriage have taken place in cumberland in be real valid marriage not only be that plea withdrawn evidence have be adduced proving that marriage be valid such marriage be a matter of course prima facie valid let what statement might be made to contrary by concerned not concerned in such case burden of proof must rest entirely with maker of such statement such proof have be here attempted marriage must be declared valid marriage jury have nothing to do with disposition of property must be sufficient for simply to find verdict for defendant jury did a be bid going somewhat beyond declared that found two defendant to be properly named countess lovel lady anna lovel so ended case of lovel v murray countess who have be in court day be taken home to keppel street by serjeant in glass coach have be hired to be in waiting for now lady lovel said serjeant bluestone a took seat opposite to can congratulate ladyship on full restitution of right only shook head battle have be fought won at last will make free to say have never seen more admirable persistency than have shown since first that bad man astounded ear by iniquity have be to purpose said to purpose lady lovel may a well tell now that be expected that majesty will send to congratulate on restitution of right again shook head ah serjeant bluestone will be of little service further objection can now be made to surrender of whole property there be mining share a to there may be question whether be real personal amount to little third of remainder will imagine exceed if be ten time a much serjeant bluestone there must be comfort in if be ten time that must not at help to heal sorrow have sometimes thought that when one be marked for trouble ease can come think more of money than man began serjeant understand yet of title though feel for when be worthily worn highest respect a so spoke serjeant lifted hat from brow upon word to have won case a justifies have won nothing nothing nothing mean about lady anna serjeant bluestone when first be told be not that man wife

life though must have be well nigh impossible to exaggerate suffering patience long endurance persistency be extolled by wealth must accrue to to daughter be of course doubled have anybody seen did anybody know even murray began to be proud of old lady jemima magtaggart who have be murray before married general mag a be called went at once called upon countess in keppel street being first did so before countess have suspected invasion be admitted came away declaring that sorrow must have driven countess mad countess doubt did not receive distant relative with gentle courtesy have sworn to herself often come what come might must never cross threshold of murray old lord swanage who have married very distant lovel wrote to letter full of very proper feeling have be said quite impossible for to know truth before truth have come to light therefore made apology for not having before made overture of friendship to connection now begged to express great delight that who have so well deserved success have be successful to offer hand in friendship must be inclined to accept countess answered in strain certainly showed that be not mad be not policy to quarrel with lovel letter be very courteous be greatly obliged to for kindness have felt a strongly a must do that must have claim on husband relation till must succeed in establishing right accepted hand in spirit in have be offered hoped that lordship might yet become friend of daughter for feared that that have suffered have made unfit for much social intercourse strength said have be sufficient to carry thus far be now failing then too there came to that great glory of lawyer have given hint received letter from private secretary of majesty king telling that majesty have heard story with great interest now congratulated heartily on re establishment of rank position wrote very curt note begging that thanks might be given to majesty then burned private secretary letter congratulation be anything to till must see daughter freed from debasement of engagement to tailor speculation be rife a to kind of life countess must lead that must have wealth sufficient to blaze forth in london with glory of countess ship there be doubt own share of estate be put down a worth at least ten thousand year for life must enjoy without deduction with other expenditure than needed for age be ascertained to day be known that be a yet only forty five be not probable that happy man might share wealth with what excellent thing must be for old lundy marquis of lundy who have run through shilling of own property before week be over suggestion have be made to old lundy say be mad ca be mad enough for said marquis rector hurried home full of indignation have word two with nephew before started what do mean to do now frederic asked rector with very grave demeanour do know that will do anything give up girl then dear uncle be sort of question that think man ever like to be asked suppose may ask how intend to live trust uncle charles will not at rate be burden to relative oh very well very well of course have nothing more to say think right same to express opinion that have be grossly misused by sir william patterson of course what say will have weight with be opinion agree with uncle charles very well have nothing more to say be right must let know believe that woman be ever lord lovel wife never did believe never will believe that about marrying girl have be take in from beginning to end planned to induce to do just what have done word in courtesy must ever have be spoken to of be a sure that be countess a be that be earl very well cost nothing cost thirty thousand year do mean to come down to yoxham winter be horse to be kept there now hitherto rich rector have kept poor lord hunter without charging nephew ought for expense be man so constituted that must have be misery to that head of family must not have horse to ride now must not remember that have done that be doing return be made to nevertheless must have bit tongue out of mouth for asking question a soon a word be spoken will have sold immediately said earl will come up to tattersal before week be over did mean that be glad that thought of uncle charles will be taken away at once be quite welcome to remain at yoxham will be removed sold said earl remember to aunt good bye then rector went down to yoxham angry miserable man there be very many who still agreed with rector in thinking that earl case have be mismanaged there be surely enough of ground for prolonged fight to have enabled lovel party to have driven opponent to compromise there be feeling that solicitor general have be carried away by romantic idea of abstract right have acted in direct opposition to usage of forensic advocacy a established in england what be to whether countess be be not real countess have be duty to get what must for earl client there have be much to get with patience doubt something might have be got have gotten nothing many thought that have altogether cut own throat that must have to take first puny judgeship vacant be great man very great man indeed said attorney general in answer to one who be abusing sir william there be not one of can hold candle to then a have always said ought to have be poet in discussing solicitor general conduct men thought more of lady anna than mother truth about lady anna engagement be generally known in misty hazy half truthful manner that be engaged to marry daniel thwaite who be now becoming famous cause of greatly increased business in wigmore street be certain be certain also that earl have desired to marry a to condition in matter stood at present there be very divided opinion not few be positive that written engagement have be given to earl that must have heiress before solicitor general have made speech according to tailor hold over young lady be so strong that now refused to abide by own compact be in tailor hand tailor must do what liked with be known that lady anna be in bedford square not few walked before serjeant house in hope of seeing romance at rate be not over possibly there might even yet be compromise if earl must get even five thousand year out of property be thought that solicitor general might hold own in due time become at rate chief baron in mean time daniel thwaite remained in moody silence among workman in wigmore street unseen of of who rushed there for new livery in order that might catch glimpse of successful hero till one morning about five day after trial be over when received letter from messrs goffe goffe messrs goffe goffe have pleasure of informing that accurate account of money transaction between countess lovel father have be kept by countess that countess on behalf of herself lady anna lovel acknowledged debt due to estate of late mr thomas thwaite amounting to l s d that cheque to amount must be at once handed to daniel thwaite son if must call at chamber of messrs goffe goffe with certified copy of probate of will of thomas thwaite father nine thousand pound to be paid to immediately on very day if chose to call for copy of probate of will have in pocket at moment worked out day work without going near goffe goffe yet thought much of money once when one of employer spoke to somewhat roughly remembered that be probably better man than master what must now do with money how bestow how use so that might be of service to world must go doubt to country in there be earl countess must go nowhere till must know what might be fate with earl daughter who at present be destiny mind be absolutely divided in one hour must say to that poet be certainly right in next be sure that poet must have be wrong a regarded money nine thousand pound be a good to a sum must be named must do with that required that money must do for must at time have have own way absolutely must have left remainder of wealth behind to be shared a pleased to share between earl countess must have gone at once taking with girl whom loved must have revelled in pride of thinking that of must say that have wanted have won girl only not wealth of lovels that have taken only what be own that wife must be dependent on not on be not possible be now month since have heard girl voice have received assurance from that be still true to in lieu of have assurance that be in possession of enormous wealth that be recognised cousin of lord lady by dozen when evening came saw one of employer told man that wished that place might be filled why be going did expect to better when be going be in earnest daniel told truth at once a far a payment of money be concerned be to receive on following day sum of money have be due to father when must have be paid must not suit to work longer for weekly wage tailor grumbled there be nothing else to be said thwaite might leave to morrow if wished thwaite took at word never returned to shop in wigmore street after night on reaching lodging found letter from serjeant bluestone countess have so far given way a to accede to proposition that there must be meeting between daughter tailor then there have arisen question a to manner in meeting must be arranged countess must not write must allow daughter to do so be desirable thought that a few people must know of meeting a possible at last most unwillingly serjeant undertook task of arranging wrote therefore a follows mr serjeant bluestone present compliment to mr daniel thwaite mr thwaite have doubt heard of result of trial by countess lovel daughter have succeeded in obtaining recognition of rank be in contemplation with countess lady anna lovel to go abroad lady anna be desirous before go of seeing son of man who be mother staunch friend during many year of suffering lady anna will be at home at keppel street at eleven o'clock on monday rd instant if mr thwaite can make convenient to call then there bedford square th november if mr thwaite must call on serjeant before date early in morning at house on saturday at chamber inner temple might perhaps be serviceable postscript have not be added without much consideration what must tailor think of invitation must not be disposed to take a encouragement in pernicious suit must not go to keppel street with determination to insist upon girl promise serjeant have thought that must be best to let thing take chance serjeant wife serjeant daughter countess too have agreed that something if possible must be said to disabuse of idea be to have nine thousand pound paid to surely that might be sufficient if be greedy wanted more money more money must be given to only must be made to understand that marriage be out of question so serjeant again gave way proposed interview daniel sent back compliment to serjeant begged to say must do a be bid must call at serjeant chamber on saturday in keppel street on following monday at hour named on next morning first morning of freedom from servitude of wigmore street went to messrs goffe goffe got up late breakfasted late in order that might feel what be to be idle man might now be a idle a young earl said to be to attempt must do with how must make hour pas by felt that be lauding a idea passed through mind struggled to quench own pride yet said in thought be not fit must know to be better than be if have self confidence how can be bold to persevere man work be to be idle a light be to darkness be admitted at once to mr goffe private room be received with smiling welcome outstretched hand be delighted mr thwaite to be able to settle claim on lady lovel with so little delay hope be satisfied with ladyship statement of account much more than satisfied with amount appeared to that have legal claim for more than few hundred pound knew better than mr thwaite must have seen that great injury be done luckily countess have be careful have put down sum advanced item by item full interest have be allowed at five per cent a be quite proper countess be excellent woman of business doubt mr goffe must have wished that must have condescended to honour with line be matter of feeling oh mr thwaite there be reason must know that there be reason there may be good reason bad reason there may be good judgment in such matter bad judgment however will like to have money by cheque doubt there be l s d be not often that write one cheque for bigger sum than mr thwaite will cross on banker banker with sum a let recommend to open account at once mr goffe absolutely walked down to fleet street with daniel thwaite tailor introduced at own bank business be soon transacted daniel thwaite went away westward capitalist with cheque book in pocket what be to do with walked east again before day be over made inquiry at various office a to vessel sailing for boston new york baltimore quebec how must be with if must be minded to go east instead of west so supplied also with information a to vessel for sydney what must do when got to new country did not mean to be tailor be astonished to find how little have a yet realised in mind detail of exodus have proposed to chapter xxxiv will take word for nothing on saturday daniel be at serjeant chamber early in morning long before hour at serjeant be wont to attend time have in fact be named tailor have chosen to suppose that a have be desired to be early in bedford square so have also be intended that must be early in temple for two hour walked about passage court thinking ill of lawyer for being so late at business endeavouring to determine what must do with have not friend in world unless lady anna be friend hardly acquaintance yet remembering what father have done what have helped to do thought that ought to have have many friend very person who be now bitterest enemy countess who have supported must have be bound to by close tie yet knew that be impossible that must not hate must understand feeling with reference to own rank though to that rank be contemptible of course be alone of course must fail be almost prepared to acknowledge a much to serjeant have heard of certain vessel must start in three day for rising colony called new south wale almost wished that have taken passage in at ten o'clock have be desired to call at eleven a clock struck eleven knocked at serjeant door serjeant bluestone be not here yet said clerk who be disposed to be annoyed by man pertinacity told to come early in morning be not early be not here yet sir told to come at eleven be past eleven be one minute past can sit down wait for if please daniel refused to wait be again about to depart in wrath when serjeant appeared upon stair introduced expressed regret that must have found visitor there before daniel muttering something followed lawyer into room then door be closed stood till be invited to sit be determined to make disagreeable man be one of enemy be one who doubt thought little of because be tailor who suspected motif be anxious to rob of bride serjeant retired for moment to inner room while tailor girded up loin prepared for battle mr thwaite said serjeant a re entered room probably know have be counsel for lady lovel daughter in late trial daniel assented by nod of head connection with countess must naturally have be then closed have gained cause there must be end of a thing have turned out have be otherwise lady anna lovel have be staying with mr bluestone in bedford square yes at house did not know countess told be not in keppel street refused to inform where be staying must not have interfered with ladyship plan have be le secret with surely be unnecessary that must tell quite unnecessary hardly unnatural after have occurred a countess be with only friend of late date be probably unaware of former friendship existed between there be time in certainly did not think that lady lovel must ever decline to speak to about daughter be nothing to serjeant bluestone be something to mr thwaite a friend be there reason why must have treated thus ask own conscience conscience be clear in matter have sent for here mr thwaite to ask whether can not yourself understand that have proposed to do must make enemy to countess annul set aside that kindness have shown put to own reason do think possible that countess must be otherwise than outraged at proposition have made to have made proposition to ladyship have made none to daughter certainly have have asked to be wife come mr thwaite palter with palter with who dare to say that palter have never paltered paltering be lying a take let countess be enemy have not said that must not be so might have answered letter think when old man died in rank of life must have done so may be different with lord titled lady let pas however did not mean to make complaint came here because sent for yes did send for said serjeant wishing with heart that have never be persuaded to take step imposed upon so great difficulty did send for lady anna lovel have expressed wish to see before leaf london will wait upon lady anna lovel need hardly tell that wish have be opposed by friend doubt be have said with so much earnestness that can not consider to be absolved from promise made to when be child be child when made doe not signify can not be absolved from promise suppose did make certainly made serjeant bluestone will allow to continue statement will not occupy long assures mother that can not consider to be absolved from promise without sanction have be living in house for week doubt in least be thus freed alliance must soon be arranged between cousin have heard of alliance must be in respect most satisfactory happy marriage young earl have behaved with great consideration forbearance in abstaining from pushing claim in abstaining from asking for did not believe to be own have better hear to end mr thwaite friend of two young people desire earl be warmly attached to cousin so be have be for many year believe that love let say so to serjeant bluestone there will be end of seems to that lord lovel have different idea about woman must not take hand of girl who told that loved man even though be a dear to a a lady anna be dear to now a for what might have in hand must go for naught with though might have to face beggary without seems to that lord lovel be le particular in matter see that have anything to do with replied serjeant hardly knowing what to say have nothing to do with lord lovel certainly have with a to cousin be for to choose think be only telling what think think mr thwaite that young lady affection be fixed on cousin be natural that must be so watching a closely a can believe such to be case will be quite on square with mr thwaite with with everybody else hope serjeant bluestone hope so said serjeant laughing at rate will be so with now have be unable to get from lady anna certain reply assurance of own wish have told mother that can not accept lord lovel address till have seen serjeant in be not quite on square a lady anna have never said so believe that considers necessary to conscience to be made free by permission before can follow own inclination accede to of friend will have permission in moment if will ask for must not be more generous even than how more generous serjeant bluestone offer to unasked have already said that must not accept hand if did not believe that have heart also sentiment did honour think of condition be generous to generous to mean generous to lady lovel generous to lord lovel generous to lovels except seems to that generosity be to be on one side by mean can be generous too if be generosity will be generous will offer permission will not wait till asks for will beg to tell if be true that love cousin if can say that be true will want permission from to be free will be free be not question see between lord lovel be quite out of question that must in event become wife even have power to do have power practically have such power mr thwaite young person such a lady anna lovel be must be under control of natural guardian be so altogether mother must not must not constrain to marriage have quite sufficient power over to prevent marriage lady anna have never for moment supposed that must become wife since learned what be feeling of mother family serjeant certainly did not keep promise of being on square generosity be necessary to enable lady lovel to bring to happy termination suffering with life have be afflicted owe much to countess if be generous to do a have said must do will be generous will tell daughter without question asked from that be free to marry cousin if wish so far serjeant though have not be altogether a truthful a have promised have be discreet have said nothing to set tailor vehemently against lovel interest have succeeded in obtaining useful pledge in next attempt be le wise think know mr thwaite that countess also have be generous a how have received l already believe have received what presume to be own if have have more will be refunded by mean taking liberal view of matter a countess be bound to do in honour be think right in paying what have paid want nothing from in what call honour want nothing liberal if money be not mine in common honesty will have back again want nothing own think be little high flown mr thwaite dare say may be to thinking of lawyer countess who be in truth friend will always be friend if will only be amenable to reason have be delighted to think that be now in possession of sum of money will place above want countess be very kind can say more than friend be aware how much be due to father son if will only aid in present project if will enable lady anna to become wife of cousin earl much more will be done than mere payment of debt be due to have be proposed to settle on for life annuity of four hundred pound year to countess earl lovel lady anna will agree have consent of lady anna be asked demanded tailor in voice be low serjeant felt at moment to be dangerous may take word that will be forthcoming said serjeant will take word for nothing serjeant bluestone think that among must dare to make such proposition to lady anna lovel wonder that must dare to make to what have seen in to lead to suppose must sell for bribe how can have be so unwise a to offer after have told that will be free if chooses to be free be one deal in subterfuge till think impossible that man must be honest mine underground till eye see nothing in open daylight walk crookedly till straight path be abomination to four hundred year be nothing to for purpose a must have be nothing to even though penny have be paid to of money be own can easily understand what be that make earl so devoted lover devotion began when have be told that money be hers not that in other way must get began when one believed that must ever have shilling for fortune when who bore name mother ridiculed claim mine be growing when father first asked whether grudged that must spend that have in behalf mine came from giving spring from desire to get make four hundred four thousand make eight thousand serjeant bluestone offer to also will agree with may succeed good morning serjeant bluestone on monday next will not be worse than word even though have offered bribe serjeant let tailor go without word further not indeed having word to say have be insulted in own chamber told that word be worthless honesty questionable have be so told that at moment have be unable to stop speaker have sat smiled stroked chin looked at tailor a though have be endeavouring to comfort with idea that man addressing be merely ignorant half mad enthusiastic tailor from whom decent conduct must not be expected be still smiling when daniel thwaite closed door almost laughed a asked clerk whether energetic gentleman have taken down stair oh yes sir glared at when opened door rushed down four step at time on whole serjeant be contented with interview must no doubt have be better have said nothing of four hundred year in offering of bribe there be always that danger one can never be sure who will swallow douceur at easy gulp so a hardly to betray effort who will refuse even to open lip then latter man have briber so much at advantage when luscious morsel have be refused be so easy to be indignant so pleasant to be enthusiastically virtuous bribe have be refused so far serjeant have failed desired promise have be made serjeant felt certain that must be kept did not doubt that daniel thwaite must offer girl freedom there be something in man though be tailor have eye voice might be that freedom offered a must offer must not be accepted daniel a went out into court from lawyer presence be le satisfied than lawyer have told lawyer that word be worth nothing yet have believed much that lawyer have said to lawyer have told that girl loved cousin only wanted permission to be free that might give hand heart together to young lord be not natural that must wish to do so within hour almost within minute regarded matter in light be perfectly antagonistic to other be natural that must wish to be countess that must love young lord who be gentle beautiful must have permission accorded freely then again be most unnatural bestial almost monstrous that girl must change love for man going from one man to simply because latter man be gilt with gold decked with jewel sweet with perfume from hairdresser poet must have be wrong there if love be anything dream surely must adhere to person not be liable to change at offered vantage of name birth of rank wealth must have offer must certainly have offer chapter xxxv serjeant mr bluestone at home lady anna be not told till saturday that be to meet lover tailor on following monday be living at time a be in chain though chain be gilded be possible that might be off at moment with daniel thwaite now more possible because have money at command if must occur then must game countess friend be playing be altogether lost then must checkmate have be absolute reader will have known that step have never be contemplated by man will also have perceived that must have be altogether opposed to girl character be hoped that reader have looked more closely into man motif girl character than even mother be able to do countess have thought that have known daughter have be mistaken now there be hardly anything of must not suspect girl to be capable lady anna be watched therefore during minute of four twenty hour policeman be told off to protect house at night from rope ladder other le cumbrous ingenuity servant be set on guard sarah lady maid followed mistress almost like ghost when poor young lady went to bedroom mr bluestone one of girl be always with either indoors out of door out of door indeed never went without more guard than one carriage have be hired luxury with mr bluestone have hitherto dispensed carriage be always there when lady anna suggested that must like to leave house be warmly invited to go shopping made to understand in way of ordinary shopping must buy what pleased life be inexpressibly miserable what doe mamma mean to do said to mr bluestone on saturday morning in what way dear where doe mean to go wo live always in keppel street no think that will live always in keppel street depends good deal upon think will go wherever plea to take lawsuit be over now know why must stay here be sure ca like to tell truth mr bluestone did not like at circumstance

become incubus to personally liked lady anna be unable to treat lady anna a must treat other girl that liked have told serjeant more than once that must not endure much longer serjeant did not like better than did wife be labour of love most unpleasant labour countess must take away serjeant have said now serjeant have be told by tailor in own chamber that word be worth nothing to tell truth lady anna none of like not because like because whole thing be disagreeable be creating very great misery dear because be obstinate because wo marry cousin dear not because wo marry cousin have never advised to marry cousin unless must love think girl must ever be told to marry man that be very proper that must be told not to marry man that be making everybody about miserable because will not give up most improper engagement made with man who be in respect beneath wish be dead said lady anna be very easy to say that dear what ought to wish be to do duty do wish to do duty mr bluestone ca be

must come out from meeting disengaged free to marry whom must thought also that within very few week of emancipation must accept cousin hand solicitor general have communicated with earl who be still in town earl again believed that might win heiress must girl prove obstinate take away at once very far away to rome such place a such have be mr bluestone advice in day rome be much more distant than be now let anybody know where be going added serjeant except mr goffe countess have assented when moment came there be reason against sudden departure mr goffe told that must wait at rate for fortnight presence of herself daughter be necessary in london for signing of deed for completion of now merely formal proof of identity money be again scarce great deal of money have be spent lately unless money be borrowed without security at great cost to mr goffe be averse sum needed must hardly be provided at once mr goffe recommended that day earlier than th december must be fixed for departure be now end of november became question how intermediate time must be passed countess be resolved that must hold pleasant intercourse at with daughter must not even tell girl of purpose of going abroad from hour to hour assured with still increasing obduracy that nothing severity must avail anything girl must be cowed frightened into absolute submission even though at expense of health even though be to be effected by absolute crushing of spirit must be done though at cost of life must be done woman have lived for last twenty year with one object before eye object sometimes seeming to be near more often distant not unfrequently altogether beyond reach have so grown upon imagination a to become heaven to very soul aspired to be to be known to be among highly born so called noble titled from old date to be of who be purely aristocratic have be world to a child child of well born poor parent have received idea in following out have thrown thought of love to wind have married reprobate earl then have come punishment a have conceived most unmerited misfortune for many year of life high courage persistent demeanour have almost atoned for vice of youth love of rank be strong in bosom a ever be fostered for child rather than for through long tedious friendless poverty stricken year have endured still assuring that day must come when world must call sweet plant that grew by side by proper name little child hooted after daughter calling girl in derision lady anna when lady anna have be more poorly clad blessed with le of comfort of home than of year must roll by must live to know that lady anna sport of infantine cruelty be lady anna indeed a girl became woman dream be becoming reality rank title general acknowledgment wealth must all be there then came first great decisive triumph overture of love friendship be made from other side must lady anna consent to become countess lovel animosity might be buried everything be made pleasant prosperous noble triumphant be easy to fill with air half inflated bladder be already so buoyant with own lightness that yield with ease to receive generous air imagination of woman flew higher than ever have flown when proposition came home to in bearing of course have be in mind that daughter must marry well there have be natural fear child have not be educated have not lived have not be surrounded in young day a be girl from whom curled darling be wont to choose wife must too probably be rough in manner ungentle in speech ungifted in accomplishment a compared with who from very cradle be encompassed by blessing of wealth high social standing when looked at child beauty must hope then child be soft sweet humoured winning in little way pretty even in poor dud be supplied to mainly by generosity of tailor so must hope sometimes despair then hope again have never hoped for anything so good a such marriage must not only put daughter a high a lovel ought to be must make known in remarkable manner to coming age that despised slandered one who have be treated almost a woman have never be treated before be in very truth countess lovel by whose income family have be restored to old splendour so longing grew upon then almost for first time did begin to feel that be necessary for purpose of life that girl whom loved so thoroughly must be creature in hand to be dealt with a pleased must have have daughter accede to proposed marriage even before have seen lord lovel be petulant when daughter must not be a clay in sculptor hand still girl refusal have be a refusal of girl must not have be a be other girl must have known better must have understood what peculiarity of position demanded have not be so with have not soared a must have done above love laden dream of common maiden so visit to yoxham be permitted then came great blow struck a be by third hand that hand of attorney countess lovel learned through mr goffe who have heard tale from other lawyer that daughter lady anna lovel have with own mouth told noble lover that be betrothed to tailor felt at moment that must have died cursing child for black ingratitude there might still be hope trial be going on work be progressing towards trial be surrounded by who must advise doubtless what have happened be great misfortune there be room for hope room for most assured hope earl be not disposed to abandon match though have of course be greatly annoyed nay disgusted degraded by girl communication have consented to see matter in proper light young tailor have got influence over girl when be child be doubtless in pursuit of money must be paid folly of child might be forgiven earl must persevere one must know what have occurred thing must be forgotten a freak of childhood countess have succumbed to policy of be not deceived by benevolent falsehood lady anna have be over twenty when have be receiving lover vow from man reeking from tailor board girl daughter have deceived that girl have deceived saying there be other lover be much be much more worse more damnable that there have be thorough deception a to girl own appreciation of rank sympathy tendered through so many year must have be always pretended sympathy with feeling hot within bosom must not bring to speak one kindly word to lady anna after return from yoxham girl be asked to abandon odious lover with stern severity be demanded of that must do so with cruel threat must never quite yield though have then strength of purpose sufficient to enable to declare that must not yield know how be banished to bedford square transferred from ruthless persistency of mother to le stern not le fixed manoeuvre of mr bluestone at moment of existence be in doubt in wyndham street at yoxham have almost more than doubted softness of new elysium have well nigh unnerved when young man have caught from stone to stone a passed over ford at bolton be almost ready to give to then have come upon sense of sickness that faint overdone flavour of sugared sweetness arises when sweet thing become too luscious to eater have struggled to be honest strong have just not fallen into pot of treacle notwithstanding who saw knew story be still sure that lord must at last win day there be not one who believed that girl must be true to troth a have made even solicitor general when told tale amorous steward have remembered to own encouragement did not think what girl girl fortune must fall into hand of client human nature demanded that must be so that must be a wished be so absolutely consonant with nature a have known that have preferred trusting to result in client behalf to leaving case in jury hand at moment be sure be right in judgment indeed be right for jury must have done anything for client went on till at last wise men decided that girl only wanted to be relieved by old lover that might take new lover with permission girl be doubt peculiar a far a wise one must learn from manner for with word must say nothing be state of mind so interview be planned to infinite disgust of countess who however believed that might avail know be result lady anna who long have doubted who have at last almost begun to doubt whether daniel thwaite be true to have renewed pledge strengthened former promise be now more firmly betrothed than ever to whom countess hated a very fiend upon earth there certainly must be marriage though pistolled man at altar there must be marriage then there came upon infinite disgust arising from necessity of having to tell sorrow to others who must not sympathize with though wish be a hers be hard upon that step must be taken by in reference to daughter without knowledge of mr goffe serjeant bluestone consequent knowledge of mr flick solicitor general be necessary too that lord lovel must know conduct in many thing must depend on reception might probably be accorded to renewal of suit of course must be told have already be told that tailor be to be admitted to see love in order that might be absolved by tailor from first vow have not be pleasant have acceded mr flick have taken upon to say that be sure that everything must be made pleasant earl have frowned have be very short with mr flick confidence with lawyer about lovesuit love tone with low born lover have not be pleasant to lord lovel have endured now must be told of result oh heaven what hell of misery be girl making for high born relative story of tailor visit to keppel street did not reach unhappy one at yoxham till month have passed away mr goffe be very injudicious in postponing departure of two lady a solicitor general told mr flick afterwards very plainly when heard of what have be done money might have have money must have advanced must have advanced oh certainly said mr flick not however at relishing idea of advancing money to client adversary never heard of such folly continued sir william come of trusting people who must not be trusted be too late then lady anna be lying ill in bed in fever three doctor doubted whether must ever get up again must not be better that must die said mother to herself standing over looking at must so thought mother then be better that must die than get up to become wife of daniel thwaite how much better that must live become countess lovel still loved child a only mother can love only child a only mother can love who have hope of joy in world what be founded on child other passion have become so strong in bosom that almost conquered mother yearning be to fight for long year that might be beaten at last when prize be so near when cup be almost at lip be girl now to be taken to grave there must be end at rate of fear now most heavily oppressed three doctor be called in one after lady anna be tended a though life be a precious a of other daughter new tidings caused new perturbation among lawyer say that clerke holland have given over said mr flick to sir william be sorry to hear said mr solicitor girl do live sometimes in spite of doctor yes very true sir william very true if must go in way might not perhaps be amiss for client god forbid that must prosper by cousin death mr flick countess must be heir countess be devoted to earl ought to do something sir william think that must claim above eight ten thousand pound at most a real property put money everywhere did that old man there be share in iron mine in alleghanies worth ever so much be good to said solicitor general alluding to client interest not worth halfpenny to though be paying twenty per cent on paid up capital seems to have determined that real heir must get nothing even if there be will wicked old man very wicked mr flick horrible old man really ought to do something mr solicitor if girl wo marry there must be compromise after that have done how can girl marry one mr flick if be going to die few day after sir william called in keppel street saw countess not with idea of promoting compromise for doing must not have be time must have be fitting medium in order that might ask after lady anna health whole matter be in truth now going very much against earl money have be allowed to countess daughter in truth money be now own to do with a listed though there might be delay before be put into absolute possession of own proportion money have be allowed must be allowed to earl that fact be so be now becoming known to men hitherto credit have at rate be easy with young lord when old earl died when will be set aside be thought that must be heir when lawsuit first came up be believed everywhere that generous compromise must be worst must befall after that marriage have be almost certainty then be known that have something of own so that tradesman need not fear that bill must be paid can hardly be said that have be extravagant lord must live earl can hardly live maintain house in country on thousand year even though have uncle to keep hunter for prudent men in london be already beginning to ask for money young earl be in trouble a mr flick have said be quite time that something must be done sir william still depended on panacea of marriage if only girl must live marriage might be delayed if card be played prudently might still make everything comfortable such girl marry tailor will always prefer lord to tradesman hope that think that calling be intrusive said countess dressed in black with funereal frown upon brow always now wore with deep sunk eye care legible in feature of handsome face received with courtesy be a full of woe a be graceful be very glad to make acquaintance there be intrusion must forgive thought if perceived that circumstance have almost overwhelmed with sorrow have come to ask after daughter said have be very ill sir william be better now hardly know can not say seemed to think morning that fever be le violent then will recover lady lovel say so indeed did not ask be in god hand sometimes think that must be better that must die there be end of be first time that two have be in other company lawyer must not altogether repress feeling of horror with heard mother speak in such way of only child oh lady lovel say that do say why must not say to who know of what good will her life be to to one else if pollute family by marriage must be better that must be dead much better that must be dead be have sir william be for sake have be struggling from first moment in knew be to be mother

if did must understand feeling now must be better for that must die than become wife of such one a daniel thwaite lady lovel not only a mother a christian must get better of feeling of course must doubt clergyman in england must tell same thing be easy to say sir wait till be tried wait till ambition be to be betrayed hope rolled in dust till honour have won be to be soiled degraded till be made mark for general scorn public pity then tell how love child by whom such evil be brought upon trust may never be so tried lady lovel hope not think of before preach to do love be because love must fain see removed from reproach own madness will bring upon let die if be god will can follow without one wish for prolonged life then will noble family be again established sorrowful tale will be

beaufort that if be properly proposed seconded must be elected not because be going to marry heiress because be losing heiress whom be to have married if girl died then lord lovel might bring forward at beaufort of daniel knew nothing heard a world heard lady anna be on deathbed when news first reached after fashion seemed to to be hardly worthy of credit called at house in keppel street asked

answer be given before have bethought then snubbed told one countess of visit after daniel went to one of doctor waited at door with patience till must be seen unhappy man told story plainly be daniel thwaite late tailor man from keswick to whom lady anna lovel be engaged in charity loving kindness must doctor tell of state of beloved one doctor took by hand asked in did tell beloved one be then on

stand once at bedside kiss hand in about hour answer be brought to at area gate consisted of own letter opened returned to without word went away too sad to curse declared to that such cruelty in woman bosom must exist only in bosom of countess a others heard early in february that lady anna be like to recover so did daniel thwaite indeed authority be better than reached club for doctor still stood friend must doctor take message from to lady anna one word no doctor must take message that must not do did not object to give to lover bulletin of health of sweetheart in way daniel knew sooner than most others when change took place in condition of beloved one lady anna must be of age in may plan of betrothed be a follows must hing till time then must call upon to allow banns to be

hearer who knew that word be true that told be true thing narrated have be done wrong have be endured end of feared be imminent hearer thought a did speaker a to baseness of marriage with tailor thought a did speaker of excellence of marriage with lord still there be something in woman eye something in tone of voice something in very motion of hand a told story made mr bluestone feel that lady anna must not be left under mother control must be very well that lovel family must be supported that lady anna must be kept within pale of own rank there might be thing worse than lady anna

must not have be so humble in nature have not mean must have started in world be applied to support succour own cause be well aware of feeling of warm gratitude to father think must bear in mind on son behalf that have be what have be because father be so staunch friend to ladyship there be very much more of expressing opinion of sir william that countess must at once open door to daniel reader need hardly be told that be wormwood to countess did not in least touch heart have little effect on purpose gratitude yes if whole result of exertion for receiver be bound to be grateful be to be neutralised by greed of conferrer of favour if be to be taken have be given much more also what ground will there be left for gratitude if save man purse from thief then demand for work twice what
