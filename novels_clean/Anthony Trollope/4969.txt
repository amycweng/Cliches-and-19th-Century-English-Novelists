saying that be improbable that mr amedroz must have son to belton have replied that for cousin clara sake hoped that squire life might be long spared lawyer smiled a read wish thinking to that luckily wish on part of will belton must influence old client either for good evil what man let alone what lawyer will ever believe in sincerity of such wish a expressed by heir to property yet where be man who will not declare to that such under such circumstance must be own wish clara amedroz at time be not very young lady have already passed twenty fifth birthday in manner appearance habit be at rate a old a age made pretence to youth speaking of herself always a one whom circumstance required to take upon age in advance of year did not dress young live much with young people correspond with other girl by mean of crossed letter expect that for young pleasure must be provided life have always be serious with now may say since terrible tragedy in family must be solemn a well a serious memory of brother must always be upon memory also of fact that father be now impoverished man on whose behalf be duty to care shilling spent in house did full twelve penny worth of work there be mixture in of deep tragedy of little care seemed to destroy for poetry a well a pleasure of life poetry tragedy might have gone hand in hand together so might care pleasure of life have done have there be black

must be said to explain how have come to pas that life led by miss amedroz have be more than commonly serious before tragedy have befallen family name of lady who stood to clara in place of aunt have be already mentioned when girl have mother aunt may be little nothing to when mother be gone if there be aunt unimpeded with other family duty then family duty of aunt begin be assumed sometimes with great vigour such have be case with mr winterfield woman ever lived perhaps with more conscientious idea of duty a woman than mr winterfield of prospect place perivale a say be intended to convey scoff against excellent lady be excellent lady unselfish given to self restraint generous pious looking to find in religion safe path through life path a safe a fact of adam fall must allow foot to find be woman fearing much for others fearing also much for striving to maintain house in godliness hating sin struggling with weakness of humanity so that might not allow to hate sinner hatred for sin found bound at time to pronounce to show by act at season to fight devil be work be appointed work of living soul if only living soul must be made to acknowledge necessity of task now aunt of kind when assumes duty towards motherless niece be apt to make life serious will be said clara amedroz must have rebelled clara father be hardly made of such stuff obedience to aunt must be enforced on by parental authority doubtless clara must have rebelled against aunt indeed know that have hitherto be very obedient there be family fact about winterfield connection must have made difficult for to ignore so called aunt even have wished to do so mr winterfield have twelve hundred year at own disposal be only person related to amedroz family from whom mr amedroz have right to have expectation on daughter behalf clara have in measure be claimed by lady father have made good lady claim clara have acknowledged that portion of life be due to demand of perivale demand have undoubtedly made life serious life at perivale be very serious thing a regard amusement ordinarily so called need of such institution be not acknowledged at prospect house food drink raiment be acknowledged to be necessary to humanity in accordance with rule of house be supplied in plenty good of kind such lady a mr winterfield generally keep good table thinking doubt that eatable must do honour to grace be said for mr winterfield always wore thick black silk dress not rusty dowdy with age with gloss of silk on giving away with secret underhand undiscovered charity old dress to lady of own sort on whom fortune have not bestowed twelve hundred year mr winterfield kept low four wheeled one horsed little phaeton in made pilgrimage among poor of perivale driven by most solemn of stable boy dressed up in white great coat most priggish of hat white cotton glove at rate of five mile hour be driven about driving be to amusement of life occupation to clara amedroz assisted to make life serious in person mr winterfield be tall thin wearing on brow thin braid of false hair have suffered much from acute ill health jaw be sunken eye be hollow there be look of woe about seemed ever to be telling of own sorrow in world of sorrow of others in world to come ill nature be written on face in face be false face have manner of cross peevish woman manner also be false gave proper idea of character still such a be made life very serious to who be called upon to dwell with need hope hardly say that young lady such a miss amedroz even though have reached age of twenty five for at time to be now alluding have nearly done so be not young of age have formed for plan of life in aunt money figured a motive power have gone to perivale when be very young because have be told to do so have continued to go partly from obedience partly from habit partly from affection aunt dominion when once well established in early year can not easily be thrown altogether aside even though young lady have will of own now clara amedroz have strong will of own did not at at rate in latter day belong to school of divinity in aunt shone almost a professor circumstance also added to seriousness of life in regard to aunt money have entertained no established hope when aunt opened mind to on subject few day before arrival of fatal news at perivale clara though be somewhat surprised be by mean disappointed now there be certain captain aylmer in question of whom in opening chapter will be necessary to say few word captain frederic folliott aylmer be in truth nephew of mr winterfield whereas clara amedroz be not in truth niece captain aylmer be also member of parliament for little borough of perivale returned altogether on low church interest for devotion to for alone perivale be noted among borough fact together added not little to mr winterfield influence professorial power in place gave dignity to one horse chaise might not otherwise have possessed captain aylmer be only second son of father sir anthony aylmer who have married miss folliott sister of mr winterfield on frederic aylmer mother estate be settled that mr winterfield property lay in neighbourhood of perivale now on occasion to be alluding mr winterfield thought necessary to tell clara that property must go together have thought about have doubted about have prayed about now found that disposition of be duty be quite sure be right aunt clara have said knew very well what have come of provision father have attempted to make for knew also how great be father expectation in regard to mr winterfield money hope be have thought right to tell will feel bound to tell frederic have have many doubt think be right be sure be aunt what must think of if at future time must have to find have be in way future time will not be long now dear hope may long short be better so think be dear think be think be duty must be understood that captain aylmer be member for perivale on low church interest that therefore when at perivale be decidedly low churchman be not aware that peculiarity stuck to very closely at aylmer castle in yorkshire among friend in london there be hypocrisy in a world go woman in such matter be absolutely false if be not sincere men with political view with much of future prospect in jeopardy also be allowed to dress differently for different scene be peculiar interest on man go into parliament of course have to live up to in own borough whether malt franchise teetotalism be rallying point of course be full of when among constituent be not desirable that must be full of also at club have captain aylmer become prime minister must no doubt have made low church bishop be side to have taken in matter not without good reason must say sharp word two in season about vestment be strong against candle fought for side fairly well one have good right to complain of captain aylmer a being insincere have aunt known whole history of nephew life doubt whether must have made heir thinking that in doing so be doing best for good cause whole history of niece life did know knew that clara be not with heart soul have clara left old woman in doubt on subject must have be hypocrite captain aylmer did not often spend sunday at perivale when did went to church three time submitted to yoke be thinking of borough vote quite a much a of aunt money be carrying on business after fashion of men clara found compelled to maintain sort of fight though also went to church three time on sunday there be reason why mr winterfield thought right to mention captain aylmer name to niece on occasion have hoped said that might make difference in what way money be left clara well understood what meant a will probably reader also ca say what will make difference answered smiling will always think that have done right why must stand in captain aylmer way have hoped way might have be same said old lady fretfully can not be same see thing a see thing be serious to be fear only light to dear clara must must see more in earnest a to only matter be worth earnestness miss amedroz said nothing a to captain earnestness though perhaps idea a to idea about religion be more correct than held by mr winterfield must not have suited to raise argument on subject pray for clara continued old lady will do so a long a power of prayer be left to hope hope cease to pray for endeavour aunt be endeavour if really made never fails clara said nothing more aunt also remained silent soon afterwards four wheeled carriage with demure stable boy came to door clara be driven up down through street of perivale in manner be injury to knew that be suffering injustice be one of must not make complaint submitted to aunt enduring penance be required of therefore aunt have opportunity enough to see shortcoming mr winterfield did see judged accordingly captain aylmer being man member of parliament be called upon to bear such penance therefore shortcoming be not suspected after what title have ever possessed to entertain expectation from mr winterfield when thought of in room that night told that be strange that aunt must have spoken to in such way on subject then so much have be said to on matter by father so much doubt have reached aunt ear also hope that position with reference to rich widow at perivale might be beneficial to have be so often discussed at belton a make weight against extravagance of heir there have already be so much of mistake that taught to perceive that communication be needed in honesty have not chosen to leave with false hope said clara to herself at moment loved aunt for honesty then on day one following conversation a to destiny of aunt property came terrible tidings of brother death captain aylmer who have be in london at time hurried down to perivale have be first to tell miss amedroz what have happened word spoken between then have not be many clara knew that captain aylmer have be kind to when have offered to accompany to belton have thanked with degree of gratitude have almost seemed to imply more of regard between than clara must have acknowledged to exist in moment such a soft word may be spoken hand may be pressed without of meaning soft word grasping of hand generally carry with a far a taunton captain aylmer did go with miss amedroz there parted on journey up to town for father desolate house at belton chapter ii heir proposes to visit cousin be full summer at belton sweet scent of new hay filled porch of old house with fragrance a clara sat there alone with work immediately before house door between old tower there stood one of farmer stovey hay cart now empty with old horse between shaft looking a though be asleep in sun immediately beyond tower men be loading cart woman child be chattering a raked scattered remnant up to row under shadow of old tower in sight of clara a sat in porch there lay small beer barrel of hay maker three four rake be standing erect against old grey wall be now eleven o'clock clara be waiting for father who be not yet out of room have taken breakfast to in bed a be custom for have fallen into idle way luxury of bed be of remaining luxury one liked best after while came down to having open letter in hand clara saw that intended either to show to to speak of asked therefore with tone of interest in voice from whom have come mr amedroz be fretful at moment instead of answering began to complain of tenant ill usage of have got cart there for have let road up to hall door suppose will bring thing into parlour next rather like papa do can only say that be lucky in taste like can tell mr stovey be out there will ask to have thing moved further off dear must bear a do rest of doe matter there will be end of soon pay rent suppose be right to do a plea ca say that like be to see letter papa asked wishing to turn mind from subject of hay cart well yes brought for to see though perhaps must be doing better if burned said nothing more about be most impudent production heartless very heartless clara be accustomed to such complaint a from father everything that everybody did around must call heartless man pitied so much in own misery that expected to live in atmosphere of pity from others though pity doubtless be there misdoubted thought that farmer stovey be cruel in have left hay cart near house to wound eye by reminding that be no longer master of ground before own hall door thought that woman child be cruel to chatter so near ear almost accused daughter of cruelty because have told that liked contiguity of hay making under such circumstance a enveloped be not heartless in to like anything seemed to that whole world of belton must be drowned in woe because of misery where be from papa asked there may read perhaps be better that must know that have be written then read letter be a follows plaistow hall july though have never before seen handwriting knew at once from whence came letter for have often heard of plaistow hall be name of farm at distant cousin will belton lived father have more than once be at trouble of explaining to though place be called hall house be more than farmhouse have never seen plaistow hall have never be in norfolk so much must take upon to say call farm hall down there be not wonderful that must dislike heir perhaps not unnatural that must show dislike after fashion clara when read address looked up into father face know who be now said then read letter plaistow hall july dear sir have not written to before since bereavement thinking better to wait awhile hope have not taken to be unkind in have supposed to be unmindful of sorrow now take up pen hoping may make understand how greatly be distressed by what have occurred believe be now nearest male relative that have a such be very anxious to be of service to if may be possible considering closeness of connection position in reference to property seems bad that must never meet can assure that must find very friendly if must manage to come together must think nothing of running across to belton if must receive at house must come very well before harvest if must suit must stay with for week pray give kindest regard to cousin clara whom can only just remember a very little girl be with aunt at perivale when be at belton a boy will find friend in if want friend affectionate cousin w belton clara read letter very slowly so that might make herself sure of tone bearing before be called upon by father to express feeling respecting knew that must be expected to abuse violently to accuse writer of vulgarity insolence cruelty have already learned that must not allow to accede to father fantasy for sake for protection be necessary that must differ from even contradict be not to do so must fall into state of wailing complaining must exaggerate almost to idiotcy be imperative that must exercise own opinion on many point almost without reference to alone knew how utterly destitute must be when must die in first day of agony have sobbed forth remorse a to ruin even when doing so have comforted with remembrance of mr winterfield money mr winterfield affection for daughter aunt when have declared purpose to clara have told that provision made for clara by father be sufficient to of have clara told own position must not inform aunt that father have given up to poor reprobate who have destroyed have be intended for have done so must have be asking aunt for charity must bring to add to father misery by destroying hope still supported never spoke of own position in regard to money knew that have become duty to live wary watchful life taking much upon in impoverished household holding own opinion against father when doing so became expedient so finished letter in silence did not speak at moment when movement of eye declared that have completed task well said think cousin mean badly do then think mean very badly what business have to write to talking of position ca see anything amiss in doing so papa think wish to be friendly property will be day see why must not be mentioned when there be occasion upon word clara surprise woman never understand delicacy in regard to money have so little to do with think so little about that have occasion for such delicacy clara must not help thought to mind subject be present with sufficient frequency to make delicacy very desirable if only be practicable of said nothing what answer will send to papa asked none at why must trouble to write to will take trouble off hand what will say to will ask to come here a proposes clara why not papa be heir to property why must not be permitted to see there be many thing in co operation with might be comfort to ca tell whether tenant people be treating well can do so moreover think mean to be kind see why must quarrel with cousin because be heir to property be not through doing of own that be so reasoning have effect upon mr amedroz daughter resolution carried point against in spite of want of reason letter be written that day on next on day following formal note be sent off by clara in mr belton be told that mr amedroz must be happy to receive at belton castle letter be written by daughter father be responsible for formality sat over while wrote nearly drove distracted by discussing word phrase at last clara be so annoyed with own production that be almost tempted to write letter unknown to father formal note went dear sir be desired by father to say that will be happy to receive at belton castle at time fixed by yours truly clara amedroz there be more than have desired effect by return of post there came rejoinder saying will belton must be at castle on fifteenth of august can do without for about ten day said in postscript writing in familiar tone did not seem to have be at checked by coldness of cousin note a harvest will be late must be back for week work before partridge heartless quite heartless mr amedroz said a read partridge to talk of partridge at time a clara however must not acknowledge that agreed with father must not altogether restrain feeling on own part that cousin good humour towards mr amedroz must have be repressed by tone of letter to man be to come however must not judge of until be there in one house in neighbourhood in only one have miss amedroz friend with whom be intimate a regarded even single friend intimacy be effect rather of circumstance than of real affection liked mr askerton saw almost daily must hardly tell that loved neighbour in little town of belton close to church there stood pretty small house called belton cottage be so near church that stranger always supposed to be parsonage rectory stood away out in country mile from town on road to redicote be large house three story high with ground of own very ugly here lived old bachelor rector seventy year of age given much to long absence when must achieve never on good term with bishop two curate lived at redicote where there be second church belton cottage be occupied by colonel askerton mr askerton be on amedroz property have be hired two year since by colonel who be then stranger in country altogether unknown to belton people have come there for shooting therefore coming have be understood even a long ago a two year since there have be neither use propriety in keeping shooting for squire son have be let with cottage to colonel askerton so colonel askerton have come there with wife one in neighbourhood have known anything about mr amedroz with daughter have called upon gradually there have grown up intimacy between clara mr askerton there be opening from garden of belton cottage into park so familiar intercourse be easy mr askerton be woman who knew well how to make pleasant to such woman a miss amedroz reader may a well know at once rumour prejudicial to askertons reached belton before have be established there for six month at taunton be twenty mile distant rumour be very rife there be people there who knew with accuracy though probably without grain of truth in accuracy detail in history of mr askerton life something too reached clara ear something from old mr wright rector who loved scandal be very ill natured very nice woman rector have said doe not seem to have belonging in particular have got husband clara have replied with little indignation for have never loved mr wright yes suppose have got husband then clara have in own judgment accused rector of lying evil speaking slandering have increased measure of cordiality to mr askerton something more have heard on same subject at perivale before throw into close intimacy with lady think must know something about mr winterfield have said to do know something about know that have manner education of lady that be living affectionately with husband who be devoted to what more ought to know if really do know that know great deal mr winterfield have replied do know anything against aunt clara asked after pause there be pause before mr winterfield answered dear can not say that do think that young lady before make intimate friendship must be very sure of friend have already acknowledged that know great deal about clara replied then conversation be at end clara have not be quite ingenuous a acknowledged to herself be aware that aunt must not permit to repeat rumour a to truth of have absolute knowledge understood that weakness of aunt caution be due to old lady sense of charity dislike of slander clara have buckled on armour for mr askerton be glad therefore to achieve little victory when buckle on armour in cause be apt to go on buckling let cause become a weak a may clara continued intimacy with mr askerton although there be something in lady mode of speech something also in mode of thinking did not quite satisfy aspiration of miss amedroz a to friend colonel askerton be pleasant quiet man who seemed to be contented with life be leading for six week in april may must go up to town leaving mr askerton at cottage a to probably jovial absence in metropolis there seemed to be spirit of grudging on part of wife on first of september friend must come to cottage remain there for six week shooting during winter colonel wife

must be just what ought to do have got wife a far a know have got lover certainly have not got lover religious nephew at perivale doe not seem to be of use wish mr askerton must not speak of captain aylmer in way know man whom like so much at rate better than captain aylmer hate idea that girl can become acquainted with unmarried man without having name mentioned with having to hear ill natured remark of kind hope will learn to like other man much better think how nice will be to be mistress of old place after then to go back to old family name if be must make up mind not to let leave place

hour with cousin certainly have be very pleasant usual companion of walk when have companion be mr askerton mr askerton did not like real walking must creep about ground for hour so even such companionship a be better to clara than absolute solitude now have be carried about place getting over stile through gate wandering through copse till be tired hungry excited happy oh papa said have have walk thought be to have dined at five replied in low wailing voice papa indeed indeed said six be for yesterday said be to make six while mr belton be here very well if must be suppose must be mean on account said will will undertake to eat dinner sir at hour that will undertake to give if there be strong point about at be appetite clara when went to father room that evening told what mr belton have said about shooting knowing that father feeling must agree with have be expressed by cousin mr amedroz of course made occasion for further grumbling suggesting that belton wanted to get shooting for a have got farm nevertheless effect clara have intended be produced before left have absolutely proposed that shooting land must go together be sure that mr belton doe mean at said clara care what mean said squire must do to treat colonel askerton in way said clara will treat just a like said squire chapter iv safe against love making dear cousin safe against love making be clara verdict respecting will belton a lay thinking of in bed that night why warranty against love making must be virtue in eye can not perhaps explain young lady be apt to talk to in such phrase about gentleman with whom be thrown into chance intimacy a though love making be in thing injurious antagonistic to happiness instead of being a be very salt of life safe against love making yet mr askerton friend have spoken of probability of such love making a being great advantage of coming there must not be second opinion a to expediency of match between cousin in worldly point of view clara moreover have already perceived that be man fit to guide wife very good humoured good tempered also anxious to give pleasure to others man of energy forethought who must be sure to do well in world hold head always high among fellow a good husband a girl must have nevertheless congratulated in felt satisfied that be safe against love making might be possible that pressing of hand at taunton have be so tender last word spoken with captain aylmer so soft that on account felt delighted to think that cousin be warranted not to make love what did will belton think about cousin insured a be thus supposed to be against danger of love also lay awake for awhile night thinking over new friendship rather thought of walking about room looking out at bright harvest moon for with to be in bed be to be asleep sat down walked about leaned out of window into cool night air made comparison in mind certain calculation thought of present home of sister of future prospect a be concerned with old place at be now staying portrayed to in mind clara head face figure foot resolved that must be wife have never seen girl who seemed to suit so well though have only be with for day swore to that knew must love nay swore to that did love then when have quite made up mind tumbled into bed be asleep in five minute miss amedroz be handsome young woman tall well made active full of health carried a though thought limb be made for use not simply for ease upon sofa head neck stood well upon shoulder waist showed none of waspish proportion of lady used to be more proud than believe to be now in more advanced state of knowledge taste there be much about in be like cousin a though blood have in common between have given to same proportion same comeliness hair be of dark brown colour a be eye be somewhat darker than perhaps not so full of constant movement be equally bright possessed that quick power of expressing tenderness belonged to nose be more finely cut a be also chin oval of face have same large expressive mouth same perfection of ivory white teeth a have be said before clara amedroz who be now nearly twenty six year of age be not young looking young woman to eye of many men must have be fault in eye of belton be fault have not made fastidious a to woman by much consort with be disposed to think that who be to become wife have better be something more than girl not long since taken out of nursery be well to do in world must send wife out in carriage with becoming bravery of appurtenance must do so too when must have wife still must look to wife to be useful partner to must be woman not above agricultural solicitude too proud to have care for cow clara be sure have false pride yet a be sure also be at point lady a must do honour to carriage bravery when must be forthcoming then marriage a must put end to trouble felt in reference to entail on estate knew that be to be master of belton of course have in knowledge satisfaction men do feel from consciousness of future prosperity with be enhanced by strong sympathy with old fashioned prejudice a to family must be belton of belton there have be beltons of belton in old day for longer time backwards than be able to count still prospect have not be without alloy have felt real distress at idea of turning cousin out of father house marriage a that now contemplated must put thing right when got up in morning be quite a keen about a have be on previous evening a thought about more became keener still more keen on previous evening a be leaning out of window endeavouring to settle in own mind what must be proper conduct of romance of thing have considered that have better not make proposal quite at once be to remain eight day at belton a eight day be not long period of acquaintance have reflected that might be well for to lay what foundation for love might be in power to construct during present sojourn then return complete work before christmas a be shaving habitual impatience of nature predominated became disposed to think that delay must be useless might perhaps be dangerous might be possible that clara must be unable to give decisive answer so quickly a to enable to return home accepted lover if such doubt be left such doubt must give excuse for speedy return to belton did not omit to tell very probably might not succeed at be man not at apt to feel assurance that must carry before in love in matter a in others required from personal effort prepared to do best leaving consequence to follow a might when threw seed corn into earth with such due appliance of agricultural skill industry a capital experience enabled to use did part towards production of next year crop after that must leave to higher power to give to to withhold from reward of labour have found that a rule reward have be given when labour have be honest be now prepared to follow same plan with same hope in matter of love making after much consideration very much consideration consideration took whole time that be brushing hair washing teeth resolved that must in first instance speak to mr amedroz not that intended that father must win daughter for have idea that must like to do work for thought that old squire must be better pleased if consent be asked in first instance present day be sunday must not speak on subject till monday day must devote to work of securing future father in law good opinion to to prayer have gained very much upon mr amedroz before evening of day be over be man before whom difficulty seemed to yield who have own way simply because have become accustomed to ask for to ask for to work for have so softened squire tone of thought towards that future stocking of land be spoken of between with something like energy on side mr amedroz have given consent without difficulty to building of shed for winter stall feeding clara sat by listening perceived will belton must soon be allowed to do just what pleased with place father talked a have not heard talk since poor brother death be quite animated on subject of woodcraft know much about timber down where be said will just because have got tree will show way said old man have managed timber on estate for last forty year will belton of course did not say word a to gross mismanagement have be apparent even to what cousin be clara thought what paragon among cousin then be so manifestly safe against love making so safe that only cared to talk about timber ox fence winter forage be all just a ought to be if father did not call will before long must set way by doing so first very paragon among cousin what flatterer be said to that night flatterer yes have flattered papa out of animosity already will be jealous soon for will think more of than of hope will come to think of a being nearly equally near to said belton with tone be serious half tender now that have made up mind must not keep hand from work before instant clara have also made up mind must not be made to think that cousin must mean anything be more than cousinly upon word said laughing be very cool on part came here determined to be friend with at rate did so without thought of said must be brother will not forget promise indeed indeed can not tell how glad be that have come for papa sake own have done so much good that only dread to think that be going so soon will be back before long think nothing of running across here from norfolk will see enough of before next summer soon after breakfast on next morning got mr amedroz out into ground on plea of showing proposed site for cattle shed not word be said about shed on occasion went to work at other task at once when be well on hand squire be quite unfitted for consideration of le important matter however able to discus belton might have be have got something particular want to say to sir belton began now mr amedroz be of opinion that cousin have be saying something very particular ever since arrival be rather frightened at immediate prospect of new subject there be nothing wrong be there nothing wrong at least hope be not wrong must not be good plan sir if be to marry cousin clara what terrible young man mr amedroz felt that breath be so completely taken away from that be quite unable to speak word of answer at moment indeed be unable to move stood still where have be fixed by cruel suddenness of proposition made to of course know nothing of what may think about continued belton thought best to come to before spoke word to know in many way be above be better educated read more sort of thing may be that 'd rather marry london man than fellow who pass time in country must get one who must love better treat more kindly then a to property must own must be good arrangement 'd like to know must go to own child own grandchild must sir be not badly off without looking to place at must give everything want then know that 'd care to marry farmer last word said in melancholy tone a though aware that be confessing own disgrace squire have listened to have not a yet said word now when belton ceased did not know what word to speak be man whose thought about woman be chivalrous perhaps little old fashioned of course when man contemplates marriage must hing better nothing more honourable than consult lady father in first instance felt that even father must be addressed on subject with great delicacy there must be ambage in such matter man who resolved to commit to task must come forward with apparent difficulty with great diffidence even with actual difficulty must keep almost hidden a behind mask must tell of own ambition with doubtful quivering voice ambage must take time must approach citadel to be taken with covered way working way slowly painfully young man before have be in house three day said that have to say without slightest quaver in voice evidently expected to get answer about squire daughter a quickly a have got about squire land have surprised very much said old man at last drawing breath be quite in earnest about clara seems to to be very girl to make good wife to one a be be got everything that woman ought to have by george have be good girl mr belton be a good a gold inch of have not known very long mr belton quite long enough for purpose see knew about beforehand who be where come from there be great deal in know mr amedroz shuddered at expression used be grievous to to hear daughter spoken of a one respecting whom one knew who be whence came such knowledge respecting daughter of such family be a matter of course common to polite person yes said mr amedroz stiffly know a much a about certainly know a much about now question be whether have objection to make really mr belton have taken so much by surprise feel competent to answer at once will say in hour time sir hour time mr amedroz if must have be left to own guidance must have thought month very little for work suppose must wish to see clara first said mr amedroz oh dear must much rather ask if only must get consent to doing so have said nothing to not word be glad of that must have behaved badly think have done so while staying under roof thought best at rate to come to first a must be back at plaistow on day week have much time to lose so if must think about afternoon know mr amedroz much bewildered promised that must do best eventually did bring to give answer on next morning have be thinking about night said mr amedroz be sure be very much obliged to said belton feeling rather ashamed of own remissness a remembered how soundly have slept if be quite sure of do mean sure of loving be a sure of a anything men be so apt to change fancy know much about fancy often change purpose when be in earnest in such matter a must change will say a much a for though may seem bold of course in regard to money marriage must be advantageous to child know whether know will have nothing to give literally nothing better sir a far a be concerned be not one who want to be saved from working by wife fortune most men like to get something when marry want to get nothing nothing be in way of money if clara becomes wife will never ask for one shilling hope aunt will do something for old man said in wailing voice a though expression of such hope be grievous to if becomes wife mr winterfield will be quite at liberty to leave money elsewhere there be old cause of dislike between mr belton mr winterfield even now mr winterfield be almost offended because mr belton be staying at belton castle be quite uncertain continued mr amedroz have leave to speak to clara well mr belton yes think so see why must not speak to fear be little too precipitate clara have known so very short time that can hardly have right to hope that must learn to regard at once a must have do a heard belton face became long melancholy have taught to think that must dispense with delay till christmas have at first proposed to that might walk into arena at once perhaps win battle in first round three day be such very short time said squire be short certainly said belton father leave be however given armed with belton be resolved that must take at rate preliminary step in love making before returned to plaistow what must be nature of preliminary step taken by such one a reader by time will probably be able to surmise chapter v not safe against love making why call will clara said to father question be asked on evening of monday on mr amedroz have given consent a to marriage proposal call will why must used to do so when be boy of course did be year ago must think impertinent now indeed must not must like have told so sound so cold to to be called mr belton by relation father looked at daughter a though for moment almost suspected that matter have really be arranged between future lover without concurrence before sanction have be obtained if for moment thought did cross mind did not dwell there trusted belton a to daughter knew that might be sure of must be impossible with to keep secret from even for day yet how odd be here be man who in three day have fallen in love with daughter here be daughter apparently quite a ready to be in love with man how must who be ordinarily circumspect almost cold in demeanour towards stranger who be from circumstance from own disposition altogether hostile to flirting intimacy how must clara have changed nature so speedily squire did not understand be prepared to believe that be for best will call will if like said do papa then can do so also be such good fellow be so fond of on next morning mr amedroz did with much awkwardness call guest by christian name clara caught cousin eye smiled also smiled at moment be more in love than ever must anything be more charming than immediately after breakfast be going over to redicote to see builder in small way who lived there whom proposed to employ in putting up shed for cattle almost begrudged time so anxious be to begin suit plan have be laid out must follow think will be back by three o'clock said to clara then will have walk will be ready can call for at mr askerton must go down there will save something in walk to pick up at cottage so arrangement for day be made clara have promised that must soon call at cottage be indeed rather anxious to see mr askerton on own account what have heard from cousin a to certain miss vigo of old day have interested also what have heard of certain mr berdmore have be evident to that cousin have thought little about likeness of lady then saw to lady have before known have at first struck when found that two lady be not represented by one same person be satisfied there be end of matter for be not so with clara feminine mind dwelt on matter with more earnestness than have cared to entertain clearer intellect saw possibility did not occur to be not till found walking across park to cottage that remembered that inquiry a to past life might be disagreeable to mr askerton have thought of asking friend plainly whether name of vigo berdmore have ever be familiar to reminded that there have be rumour afloat that there might be mystery mr askerton must sometimes talk of early life must do with dreamy indistinct language speaking of sorrow of girlhood not specifying exact nature seldom mentioning name never referring with clear personality to who have be nearest to when have be child clara have seen friend maiden name mary oliphant written in book seeing have alluded to on occasion mr askerton have spoken of a having be oliphant thus clara have come to know fact now a made way to cottage remembered that have learned

know seemed to think that have known ever so many year ago clara a said did not look direct at friend face still must perceive that mr askerton be disconcerted there came shade of paleness over face

there be miss vigos two of think did know that be like especially say that one remembers married mr berdmore married mr berdmore tone of voice be still same there be evident struggle a though woman be making vehement effort to speak in natural voice then clara looked at feeling that if abstained from doing so very fact of so abstaining must be remarkable there be look of pain on mr askerton brow cheek be still pale smiled a went on speaking be sure be flattered for remember that be considered beauty did know anything more of nothing more there must have be casual likeness suppose mr askerton be clever woman have by time almost recovered possession then there came ring at front door in minute mr belton be in room mr askerton felt that be imperative on to make allusion to conversation have

proposal be coming in such case must have waited if good must have come to from that might have received a question be now presented to be impossible that must consent to wait to have given such

position a to must at once have be assured of failure in project on have set heart a to project be so have be told that must not love that must never love have believed have made attempt have failed a thought of standing under porch became convinced that life for be altogether changed that who have be so happy must now be wretched man be still standing there when mr amedroz came down into hall

impossible not to read terrible disappointment deep grief in young man manner made attempt to conceal though did not speak of through whole evening though be alone for while with squire alone also for time with clara never mentioned alluded to subject of rejection bore a though knew knew a though world knew that have be rejected yet did not remain silent talked of property of plan explained how thing be to be done in absence once only be there something like allusion made to sorrow will be here at christmas said mr amedroz in answer to something belton have said a to work to be done in absence know how may be now said belton then have be silent be terrible evening to clara endeavoured to talk found to be impossible brightness of last few day have disappeared world seemed to to be more sad solemn than ever have idea when be refusing that must have taken to heart a have done question have come before for decision so suddenly that have not in fact have time to think of a be making answer have done be to feel that must not be to what wished to be even a yet have hardly asked why must be so steadfast in refusal have refused steadfastly did not for moment think of reducing earnestness of resolution seemed to be manifest to from present manner that must never ask question again be sure let be asked ever so often that must not be answered in other way mr amedroz not knowing why be so became cross querulous scolded daughter to belton also be captious making little difficulty answering with petulance rejected lover took with most extreme patience a though such trifling annoyance have effect in adding anything to misery still held purpose of going on saturday be still intent on work be to be done before went seemed that be satisfied to do everything now a duty that enjoyment of thing have heretofore be so conspicuous be over at last separated clara a be wont went up to father room papa said what be about mr belton what dear what do mean have asked to be to be wife have told that came with consent why must have consent what be there amiss with why must marry if like seemed thought to be very fond of surprised clara more than anything must hardly have told why must have thought that proposition from cousin must have made father angry unreasonably angry angry with for presuming to have such idea now seemed that be going to be angry with for not accepting cousin out of hand yes papa be fond of not like did not expect that must think of in way why must think of must be very good marriage for a far a money be concerned must not have marry one for reason must papa seemed to like well of course ca make like meant to do for best when came to a did thought be behaving very handsomely very much like gentleman be sure must do if must have thought that place must be home when be gone must have made very happy very happy now came stood close to took hand hope papa make uneasy about will do very well be sure ca want to go away leave how will do very well be sure know if aunt winterfield mean to provide for must only be kind in to let know so that might not have anxiety always on mind clara knew well enough what be to be disposition of aunt property must not tell father of now almost felt that be duty to do so must not bring to do must only beg not to be anxious on behalf making vague assurance that must do very well be determined not to change mind about will said at last will not change mind about papa certainly answered then turned away from saw that be displeased when alone be forced to ask why be that be so certain ala there must in truth be doubt on subject in own mind when sat down resolved to give answer there be doubt must not love cousin will belton because heart belonged to captain aylmer knew that have received nothing in exchange for heart have be kind to on journey to taunton when agony arising from brother death have almost crushed have often be kind to on day before so kind so soft in manner approaching so nearly to little tenderness of incipient love making that idea of regarding a lover have of necessity forced upon in nothing have gone beyond tenderness need not imperatively be made to mean anything though do often mean so much be now two year since have first thought that captain aylmer be most perfect gentleman knew nearly two year since mr winterfield have expressed to hope that captain aylmer might become husband have replied that thing be impossible a girl must have replied have in consequence treated captain aylmer with coolness have be able to assume whenever be in company with in aunt presence be natural to to be specially gracious to man under such trying circumstance even when mr winterfield be there to behold so thing have gone on captain aylmer have now again made very pleasant to at certain trying period of joy trouble almost more than pleasant nothing have come of clara have told that captain aylmer have special feeling in favour have told ever since journey together from perivale to taunton never till now have also confessed to herself what be own case made comparison between two men cousin will be thought more generous more energetic perhaps by nature man of higher gift in person be undoubtedly superior be full of noble quality forgetful of self industrious full of resource very man of men able to command eager in doing work for others good own man altogether uncontaminated by coldness selfishness of outer world be rough awkward indifferently educated with few of taste to clara amedroz be delightful must not read poetry to must not tell of what world of literature be doing now of what have done in time past knew nothing of inner world of world governs world doubted whether must have told who composed existing cabinet have given name of single bishop beyond see in own parish be situated captain aylmer knew everybody have read everything understood a though by instinct movement of world in lived what mattered such comparison even though must be able to prove to herself beyond shadow of doubt that cousin will be of two fitter to be loved one more worthy of heart such proof must alter position love doe not go by worth did not love cousin a must love man to whom must give hand ala did love that other man on night doubt whether belton did slumber with solidity of repose be usual to at rate before came down in morning have found time for sufficient thought have brought to resolution must not give up battle a lost to thinking there be something weak almost mean in abandoning project have set before have be awkward exaggerated to own awkwardness have be hasty have gone about task with inconsiderate precipitancy might be that have thus destroyed chance of success a said to must never say die a long a there be puff of breath left to must not mope hang down head wear willow state of thing must ill suit roughness readiness of life must bear like man disappointment have on occasion befallen must return at christmas once more try fortune at breakfast therefore cloud have passed from brow when came in found clara alone in room simply shook hand with after ordinary fashion said nothing of yesterday almost succeeded in looking a though yesterday have be in wise memorable be not so much at ease also received comfort from demeanour mr amedroz came down almost immediately belton soon took opportunity of saying that must be back at christmas if mr amedroz must receive certainly said squire thought have be all settled so be till said word yesterday foolishly seemed to unsettle have thought over again find can manage will be so glad to have said clara will be equally glad to come be already at work sir about shed yes saw cart full of brick go by said squire querulously did know there be to be brickwork said must have made of deal slab with oak post must have foundation sir propose to carry brickwork foot half above ground suppose know best only that kind of thing be so very ugly if find to be ugly after be done will be pulled down again no can never come down again can will if like never think anything of change like think will be very pretty said clara dare say said squire at rate wo make much difference to sha be here long to see be rather melancholy belton bore up even against speaking cheery word expressing bright hope so that seemed to clara to father that have in great measure overcome disappointment of preceding day be probable that be man not prone to be deeply sensitive in such matter for long period period now have certainly not be long yet will belton be alive again immediately after breakfast there occurred little incident be not without effect upon there came up on drive immediately before front door under custody of boy cow be alderney cow man woman at understanding cow must at once have perceived that cow be perfect in kind eye be mild soft bright leg be like leg of deer in whole gait demeanour almost gave lie to own name asserting to have sprung from more noble origin among wood than may be supposed to be origin of ordinary domestic cow useful animal heavy in appearance seen with more pleasure at little distance than at close quarter cow be graceful in movement almost tempted one to regard a far off descendant of elk antelope what be said mr amedroz who having cow of own be not pleased to see one brought up in way before hall door there be somebody cow come here clara understood in moment be pained said nothing have cow come without such scene a of yesterday must have welcomed animal with cordiality must have sworn to cousin that cow must be cherished for sake after what have passed be different how be to take present from now belton faced difficulty without bashfulness apparent regret told must give cow said here be what can want with cow said mr amedroz be sure want one very much at rate wo refuse present from will clara what must say not if papa will allow to keep have place to put said squire have got grass for there be plenty of grass said belton come mr amedroz have made point of getting little creature for clara must stand in way of gratification of course be successful of course clara thanked with tear in eye next two day passed by without anything special to mark then cousin be to go during period of visit did not see colonel askerton did again see mr askerton went to cottage once with special object of returning colonel call master be out be not specially invited in to see mistress said nothing more to clara about friend thought of matter more than once a be going about place became aware that must like to ascertain whether there be mystery if so what be nature knew that did not like mr askerton felt also that mr askerton did not like be a thought unfortunate for might not be case in one matter be to of so much importance mr askerton might have considerable influence over clara during day nothing special be said between clara last evening passed over without anything to brighten to make memorable mr amedroz in passive gently querulous way be sorry that belton be going to leave a cousin have be creation of new excitement for said nothing on subject when time for going to bed have come bade guest farewell with languid allusion to pleasure must have in seeing again at christmas belton be to start very early in morning before six of course be prepared to take leave also of clara told very gently so gently that father did not hear that must be up to give cup of coffee before went oh no said will wo have go without seeing out of door on following morning be up before hardly understood why be doing knew that must be object to avoid further special conversation on subject have discussed up among rock knew that must give comfort that must give none to must seem that be willing to let remembrance of scene pas away so that must be a though have never be surely be not for to disturb so salutary arrangement yet be up to bid godspeed a went must not bear so excused matter to herself must not bear to think that must regard a ungrateful knew that have done for have perceived that taking of land building of shed life have contrived in so short time to throw into old place have come from desire on part to do good to in whose way stood by family arrangement made almost before birth longed to say to one word of thanks have not told once in heat of disappointment for then at moment a clara said to herself supposed that must have be in measure disappointed have not even then told that when wanted brother care brother care must be given to by be not therefore bound to do for what must do for brother with own hand brought coffee into little breakfast parlour handed cup into hand gig have come overnight from taunton be not yet at door there be minute two during must speak to other who have not seen such girl when have come down early without full completeness of morning toilet yet nicer fresher prettier to eye of who be so favoured than have ever be in more formal attire what man who have be so favoured have not loved who have so favoured even though may not previously have be enamoured a deeply a poor will belton be so good of said wish knew how to be good to answered not meaning to trench upon dangerous ground feeling a word came from that have done so have be so good to so very good to papa that owe everything be so grateful to for saying that will come back at christmas have resolved that must refrain from further love making till winter found very hard to refrain when so addressed to take in arm kiss twenty time swear that must never let go to claim at once savagely a own be line of conduct to temptation prompted how must look at so sweetly how must stand before ministering to with pretty maidenly charm brought so close to without intending that must love did refrain blood be thicker than water said be real reason why first came understand that quite be that feeling make so good be afraid be spending great deal of money here for sake not at will get money back again if did what then have plenty of money be not money that want must not ask what be that did want be obliged therefore to begin again papa will look forward so to winter now so will must come for longer then wo go away at end of week say that wo will see about ca tell quite yet will write line to say when shed be finished wo will will tell how bessy go on

will bring dog will follow without thinking of apple then gig be heard on gravel before door belton be forced to go for moment reflected whether a cousin be not duty to kiss be matter a to have doubt a be case with many male cousin ultimately resolved that if kissed at must not kiss in light so again refrained good bye said putting out great hand to good bye will god bless almost think might have kissed asking question a to light in be done a turned from saw tear in eye a sat in gig thinking of other tear came into own by heaven must have yet be man who have not read much of romance to imagined mystery of passion have not be made common by perusal of legion of love story still knew enough of game to be aware that woman have be won in spite a be of own teeth knew that must not now run away with taking off by force still might conquer will by own a remembered tear in eye tone of voice pressure of hand gratitude have become tender in expression must not think that must be wise to love still wise foolish did love still must not be owing to fault of if did not become wife a drove along saw little of quantock hill little of rich somersetshire pasture little of early beauty of august morning saw nothing eye moistened with bright tear before reached taunton have rebuked with many revilings in have parted from not kissed clara stood at door watching gig till be out of sight watching a well a tear must allow what grand cousin be have not be pity thousand pity that grievous episode must have come to mar brotherly love sisterly confidence might otherwise have be so perfect between perhaps might all be well yet clara knew thought that knew that men woman differed in appreciation of love having once loved must not change of be sure love might be fortunate unfortunate might be returned might simply be own to destroy hope of happiness for on earth whether be that whether productive of good evil love must not be changed with men thought might be different cousin doubtless have be sincere in full sincerity of heart when made offer have accepted have be able to accept believed that must have loved truly constantly such be nature also believed that love with unrequited love must have enduring effect that have already resolved with equal courage wisdom to tread short lived passion out beneath foot one night have sufficed to for treading out a thought of tear ran plentifully down cheek going again to room remained there cry till be time for to wipe away mark of weeping that might go to father be very glad will bore so well very glad cousin be safe

like first of to know what be to be special object of proposed prayer if found that must at spur of moment bring at into fitting mood for task of who must decline without argument clergyman must opine that be simply reprobate of who must propose to accompany hypothetical acceptance with certain stipulation must say to that be stiff necked wrestler against grace whose condition be worse than of reprobate men woman conscious that will be thus judged submit to hypocrisy go down upon knee unprepared making effort doing nothing while be there allowing conscience to be eased if can only feel numbed into ceremonial awe by occasion so be with clara when mr possitt with easy piety went through formula of devotion hardly ever having realised to fact that of work in man can engage that of

give hope how must of course knew that must not live here though did not tell so no suppose will see very plainly that think ought to do so have old fashioned idea a to man living near to own property be doubt be good for other people in perivale besides mr possitt that dear aunt lived here if house be shut up let to stranger will feel loss more know that be bound to sacrifice to if be to marry said captain aylmer very slowly in low voice of course must have to think of wife wish if wife when accepted knew that be living here must hardly take upon to demand that must give up residence might find very dull must make own calculation a to before accepted doubt ca fancy woman taking man who be tied by leg to perivale what do people do who live in perivale earn bread yes be just what said must earn mine here have feeling spoke of very strongly about papa place said clara changing conversation suddenly very often think of future fate of belton castle when papa will have gone cousin have got house at plaistow suppose 'd live there where will go asked a soon a have spoken clara regretted own imprudence in having ventured to speak upon own affair have be well pleased to hear talk of plan have be quite resolved not to talk of own now by own speech have set to make inquiry a to future life did not at first answer question repeated where will live hope may not have to think of for time to come yet be impossible to help thinking of such thing can assure have thought about suppose will endeavour to to know what will endeavour to do will come live at perivale why here more than anywhere else in house mean must suit admirably must not be afraid mr possitt must not find good neighbour to tell truth think that lady who life here alone ought to be older than be perivalians must not show to young woman that sort of respect have always felt for house did mean alone said captain aylmer then clara got up made excuse for leaving there be nothing more said between nothing at least of moment on evening have become uneasy when asked whether must like to live in house at perivale afterwards when suggested that be to have companion with there felt compelled to put end to conversation yet knew that be always way with with must say thing must seem to promise in minute must be at foot then must go further when heard word though in truth must have have at foot if must must draw away recede forbid a be to go on clara continued to make comparison knew well that cousin will must have gone on in spite of such forbidding on night however when be alone must console with thinking how right have be in front bedroom door of be opposite to own with closed shutter in terrible solemnity of lifeless humanity be still lying body of aunt what must have thought of if at moment must have listened to word of love promised a wife while such inmate be in house little knew that within same room have pledged to who be now lying there waiting for last removal have pledged just seven day since to make offer when be talking to be always half hoping half fearing must have meant nothing else when told that have not intended to suggest that must live there alone in great house at perivale must not hinder from thinking of unfit a be present moment for such thought how be possible that must not speculate on subject let resolution against such speculation be ever so strong have confessed to herself that loved man what else must wish that also must love there came upon faint suspicion glimpse of what be almost dream that might possibly in matter be guided rather by duty than by love might be that must feel constrained to offer hand to constrained by peculiarity of position towards if so must discover such be motif there must be no doubt a to nature of answer chapter x showing how captain aylmer kept promise next day be necessarily very sad clara have declared determination to follow aunt to churchyard did so together with martha old servant there be three four mourning coach a family friend came over from taunton one two of whom be to be present at reading of will how melancholy be occasion how well work be done how substantial yet how solemn be luncheon spread after funeral for gentleman how will be read without word of remark by mr palmer need hardly be told here will contained certain substantial legacy to servant amount to old handmaid martha being so great a to produce fit of fainting after old handmaid declared that if ever there be by chance angel of light upon earth be late mistress yet martha have have trouble with mistress there be legacy of two hundred pound to gentleman who be called upon to act a co executor with captain aylmer other clause in will there be none except one substantial clause bequeathed to well beloved nephew frederic folliott aylmer everything of testatrix died possessed will have be made at moment in clara spirit of independence have offended aunt name be not mentioned that nothing must have be left to clara be one thing surprised relative from taunton who be present relative from taunton to give due expected nothing for a there have be great doubt a to proportion in property must be divided between nephew adopted niece there be aroused considerable excitement a to omission of name of miss amedroz excitement be not altogether unpleasant when people complain of cruel shame doe not affect personally complaint be generally accompanied by unexpressed unconscious feeling of satisfaction on present occasion when will have be read refolded captain aylmer who be standing on rug near fire spoke few word aunt said have desired to add codicil to will of nature of mr palmer be well aware have expressed intention to leave fifteen hundred pound to niece miss amedroz death have come upon too quickly to enable to perform purpose of intention on part of mr winterfield mr palmer be a well aware a mentioned subject now merely with object of saying that a matter of course legacy to miss amedroz be a good a though codicil have be completed on question a there must arise question a to legal right understood that legal claim of miss amedroz under such circumstance be a valid a own be therefore affair of generosity on part then there be little buzz of satisfaction on part of present meeting be broken up certain old mr folliott who be cousin to everybody concerned have come over from taunton to see how thing be going have always be at variance with mr winterfield being woman who loved card supper party who have throughout life stabled horse in stall very different to used by lady of perivale now mr folliott be first to tell clara of will clara of course be altogether indifferent have known for month past aunt have intended to leave nothing to only hope have be that might be left free from commiseration remark on subject mr folliott with sundry shaking of head told how aunt have omitted to name then told also of captain aylmer generosity did think dear said mr folliott that must have done better than for at rate that must not have left dependent on captain aylmer horse be also supposed to be stabled in strictly low church stall be therefore regarded by mr folliott with much dislike aunt understood other perfectly said clara dare say if so really be only person did understand doubt what did be quite right seeing that be saint sinner must have thought very wicked to have made will then to have trusted to generosity of person after be dead there be question of trusting to one generosity mr folliott need not pay shilling know unless like will not be asked to pay shilling suppose will go back after what have said publicly dear mr folliott said clara earnestly pray let talk about be quite unnecessary never expected of aunt property knew along that be to go to captain aylmer who indeed be mr winterfield heir naturally mr winterfield be not really aunt have claim on everybody understood that be to provide for a be not one of everybodies myself will not signify then mr folliott retreated having a thought performed duty to clara contented henceforth with abusing mr winterfield will in own social circle at taunton on evening of day when visitor be gone house be again quiet captain aylmer thought expedient to explain to clara nature of aunt will manner in must be allowed to inherit under amount of money aunt have intended to bequeath to when became impatient objected to listen to argued with pointing out to that be matter of business to be now absolutely necessary that must attend may be case said indeed hope will that essential difference will be made by except that will gratify to know how careful be of interest in last moment be bound in duty to learn own position a executor be bound to explain to perhaps must rather discus with mr palmer oh save from that must understand then that will pay over to sum of fifteen hundred pound a soon a will have be proved understand nothing of kind know very well that if be to take must be accepting present from to can not consent clara be good captain aylmer though pretend to understand much about law do know that can have claim to anything be not put into will wo have what must not claim mind be quite made up hope may be annoyed about nothing be more disagreeable than having to discus money matter perhaps captain aylmer thought that having money matter to discus might be even more disagreeable well said can only ask to consult friend whom can trust upon matter ask father mr belton have doubt that of will tell that be a much entitled to legacy a though have be written in will on matter captain aylmer want to ask anybody ca pay money unless choose to take certainly will not do upon hearing smiled assuming a clara fancied that be sometimes wont to do look of quiet superiority then for time allowed subject to be dropped between clara knew that must discus at length with father fear of discussion made unhappy have already written to say that must return home on day one after funeral have told captain aylmer of purpose so very prudent man a of course must not think right that young lady must remain with in house a visitor to decision on point have made objection now heartily wished that have named day after funeral that have not be deterred by dislike of making sunday journey dreaded day must have be very thankful if must have left gone back to london intended said to remain at perivale throughout next week must endure day a best might be able wished that be possible to ask mr possitt to accustomed dinner did not dare to make proposition to master of house though captain aylmer have declared mr possitt to be very worthy man clara surmised that must not be anxious to commence practice of sabbatical dinner so soon after aunt decease day after must be one day clara schooled into resolution to bear with good humour captain aylmer have made positive promise to aunt on deathbed that must ask clara amedroz to be wife have more idea of breaking word than have of resigning whole property have be left to whether clara must accept have much doubt be man by mean brilliant not naturally self confident be perhaps to be credited with possession of high principle of finest sort be clever in ordinary sense of word knowing own interest knowing too that interest depended on other thing besides money be just man according to ordinary rule of justice in world not for first time when be sitting by bedside of dying aunt have thought of asking clara to marry though have never hitherto resolved that must do so though have never till then brought absolutely to determine that must take so important step have pondered over often be aware that be very fond of clara be in truth a much in love with a be in nature to be in love be not man to break heart for girl even to make strong fight for wife a belton be prepared to do if refused once might probably ask again having idea that first refusal be not always intended to mean much might possibly make third attempt prompted by further calculation of same nature might be doubted whether on first second third occasion must throw much passion into word who knew well must hardly expect to see die of broken heart must ultimately be unsuccessful when have first thought of marrying miss amedroz have imagined that must have shared with aunt property indeed such have be belief up to day of last illness of mr winterfield match therefore have recommended to a being prudent a well a pleasant though aunt have never hitherto pressed matter upon have understood what wish be when first told three four day before death that property be left altogether to then on hearing how totally niece be without hope of provision from father have expressed desire to give sum of money to clara have spoken plainly of desire have not on occasion asked for promise afterwards when knew that be dying have questioned a to own feeling in anxiety to gratify in last wish have given promise be so anxious to hear made difficulty in doing so be own wish a well a hers in money point of view might no doubt now do better then money be not everything be very fond of clara felt that if must accept must be proud of wife be well born well educated be proper sort of thing for to do doubt have idea seeing how thing have now arranged that must be giving much more than must get perhaps manner of offer might be affected by consideration not on account did feel at sure that must be accepted clara amedroz be proud girl perhaps too proud indeed be fault if pride now interfered with future fortune in life must be own fault not must do duty to to aunt must do perseveringly kindly then if refused fault must not be such think be state of captain aylmer mind when got up on sunday morning resolving that must on day make good promise must be remembered on behalf that must have prepared for task with more animation if have hitherto received warmer encouragement have felt to be repulsed in little effort have already made to please lady have idea whatever a to true state of feeling have known what knew must think have be animated enough gone to task a happy thriving lover a be man somewhat diffident of though sufficiently conscious of value of worldly advantage possessed be perhaps little afraid of clara giving credit for intellect superior to own have promised to walk with on saturday after reading of will intending to take out through garden down to farm now belonging to lay at back of town be held by old widow who have be senior in life to late landlady such walk have be possible a be dark before last of visitor from taunton have gone at breakfast on sunday again proposed walk offering to take immediately after luncheon suppose will not go to church said not to day must hardly bring to do to day think be right will go man can always do thing sooner than lady can will come out afterwards to assented then be left alone throughout morning walk did not mind that captain aylmer must walk together be very well might probably have done so have mr winterfield be still alive be long evening afterwards that dreaded long winter evening in must have to sit with a guest with only must not pas hour without talking to felt that must not talk to naturally easily must however be for once must bear went together down to house of mr partridge tenant made kindly speech to old woman mr partridge already knew that captain aylmer be to be landlord having hitherto seen more of miss amedroz than of captain having always regarded landlady niece a being connected irrevocably with property addressed a though estate be joint affair sha be here to trouble long sha miss clara said old woman be sure captain aylmer must be very sorry to lose replied clara speaking loud close to poor woman ear for be deaf never looked to live after be gone miss clara never more did deary deary suppose will be living at big house now wo ye big house belongs to captain aylmer mr partridge be driven to bawl out word by mean liked task then captain aylmer said something speech be altogether lost oh belongs to captain do told that be way of will suppose be one yes be one said captain aylmer gaily be not exactly all one a call said clara attempting to laugh still shouting at top of voice ah understand hope will live there together hope will be a good to poor a be gone well well did ever think must be still here while be lying under stone up in old church captain aylmer have determined that must ask question on way back from farm now resolved that might a well begin with allusion to mr partridge word about house afternoon be bright cold lane down to farmhouse have be dried by wind so that day be pleasant for walking might a well go on to bridge said a left farm yard always think that perivale church look better from creevy bridge than other point perivale church stood high in centre of town on eminence be graced with spire be declared by perivalians to be preferable to of salisbury in proportion though be acknowledged to be somewhat inferior to in little river creevy ran through portion of suburb of town a there seen be hardly more than ditch then sloped away behind creevy grange a farm of mr partridge be called be crossed by small wooden bridge from there be view not only of church of side of hill on mr winterfield large brick house stood conspicuously so walked down to creevy bridge when there stood leaning on parapet looking back upon town how well know house spot in place a see from here said good many of house be own will be day therefore must know remember when used to be here a boy fishing always thought aunt winterfield house be biggest house in county ca be nearly so large a father house in yorkshire certainly be not aylmer park be large place house doe not stretch out so wide a doe stand on side of hill so a to show out proportion with so much ostentation coach house stable old brewhouse seem to come half way down hill when be boy have much more respect for aunt red brick house in perivale than have for aylmer park now be own yes now be own respect for be gone used to think creevy best river in england for fish must give sixpence now for perch ever caught in perhaps taste for perch be gone also yes taste for jam never believed in store room at aylmer park a did in aunt store room here doubt what be full now dare say will never have curiosity even to inquire ah dear wish knew what to do about house wo sell suppose not if must either live in let must be wrong to let stand idle need not decide quite at once be just what want to do want to decide at once then be sure can not advise seems to very unlikely that must come live here by be like country house exactly sha live there by certainly heard what mr partridge said just now what did mr partridge say wanted to know whether belonged to of whether be not one will be one clara be leaning over rail of bridge a spoke with eye fixed on slowly moving water when heard word raised face looked full upon be in sort prepared for moment though must be untrue to say that have now expected unconsciously have made resolve that if ever question be put to by must not be taken altogether off guard now that question be put to be able to maintain composure first feeling be one of triumph a must be in such position to woman who have already acknowledged to herself that love man who then asks to be wife looked up into captain aylmer face eye almost quailed beneath hers even must be triumphant be not perfectly assured that triumph must be success will what be one asked will be house house can tell that will love be wife again looked at repeated question clara can love well enough to take for husband can said why must hesitate play coy girl pretend to doubt in mind did not exist there did love have so told with much earnestness to while word have be doubtful while have simply played at making love to have given hint of state of affection have so carried before a to make doubt whether success must be possible for now why must hesitate now be a have hoped a have hardly dared to hope did love can said then before must speak again repeated word with more emphasis indeed can with heart a regarded herself be quite equal to occasion have known more of inner feeling of men woman in general must have be slower to show own what be there that man desire man woman doe not lose half value when be found to be easy of access easy of possession wine be valued by price not flavour open door freely to jones smith jones smith will not care to enter shut door obdurately against same gentleman will use little diplomacy to effect entrance captain aylmer when heard hearty tone of girl answer already began almost to doubt whether be wise on part to devote innermost bin of cellar to wine be so cheap not that have idea of receding principle if not love prevented that then question about house be decided said giving hand to clara a spoke care bit about house now answered be unkind be thinking so much more of of of doe old house matter be in very good repair said captain aylmer must not laugh at said in truth be not laughing at what mean be that anything about house be indifferent to now be a though have got want in world be wrong of to say so oh dear not wrong at how can be wrong did not tell that also have got all wanted lack of enthusiasm in respect did not surprise at first even vex have always known to be man careful of word knowing value not speaking with hurried rashness a must dear cousin will doubted whether after such hurried word mean a much a word be slower calmer after heat in love consequent disappointment will belton have left apparently well contented fervour have be short lived loved cousin dearly be so very glad that fervour have be short lived when asked must tell truth said smiling at truth be very well must have liked better have truth come to by slower degree when aunt have told to marry clara amedroz have be at once reconciled to order by feeling on own part that conquest of clara must not be too facile be woman of value not to be snapped up easily by one so have thought then began to fancy now that have be wrong in opinion walk back to house be not of very exciting though to clara be short period of unalloyed bliss doubt have then come upon to cloud happiness be wrapped up in measureless content be well that must be silent at moment only yesterday have be buried dear old friend friend who have brought together be so anxious for future happiness clara amedroz be not young girl prone to jump out of shoe with elation because have got lover must be steadily happy without many immediate word about happiness when have reached house be once more together in drawing room again gave hand be first to speak be contented asked who doe not know smile of triumph with girl asks question at moment a contented well yes think be said even word did not move to doubt if be said be now will leave till dinner that may think over what have done have thought about before know replied then stooped over kissed be first time have done so kiss be a cold proper a though have be man wife for year sufficed for went to room a happy a queen chapter xi miss amedroz be too candid by half clara when left accepted lover in drawing room went up to own chamber have two hour for consideration before must see again have two hour for enjoyment be very happy thoroughly believed in man who be to be husband feeling confident that possessed quality thought to be most necessary for married happiness have quizzed at time pretending to make matter of accusation against that life be not in truth that aunt believed to be have be more what mr winterfield must have wished must have be le to clara taste liked position in world liked feeling that be man of influence perhaps liked to think to extent be man of fashion be not handsome looked always like gentleman be well educated given to reading prudent steady in habit man likely to rise in world loved fear reader by time may have begun to think that love must never have be given to man to accusation will make plea at present will ask complainant whether such men be not always loved much be said of rashness of woman in giving away heart wildly charge when made generally be think unjust one be more often astonished by prudence of girl than by recklessness woman of thirty will often love well not wisely girl of twenty seem to to like propriety of demeanour decency of outward life competence be of course good that must be so if be so must not also claim general character for generous passionate indiscretion asserting a motto that love will still be lord of clara be more than twenty be not yet so far advanced in age a to have lost taste for decency of demeanour propriety of life member of parliament with small house near eaton square with moderate income liking for committee who must write pamphlet once two year read dante critically during recess be to model for husband for such one must read blue book copy pamphlet learn translation by heart must be safe in hand of such man must know nothing of misery brother have encountered model may not appear when thus described to be very noble one think be model most approved among lady of class in england made up mind on various point during two hour of solitude in first place must of course keep purpose of returning home on following day be not probable that captain aylmer must ask to change let ask ever so much must not be changed must at once have pleasure of telling father that trouble about must now be over then there be consideration that further sojourn in house with captain aylmer a lover must hardly be more proper than must have be have not occupied that position what be to say if pressed a to time of marriage aunt death must of course be sufficient reason why must be delayed for few month upon whole thought must be best to postpone till next session of parliament must have nearly expired must be prepared to yield to captain aylmer must name time after easter be clearly intention to keep up house in perivale a country residence did not like perivale house must say nothing against such arrangement indeed with what face must do so be going to bring nothing to common account absolutely nothing a thought of love grew warmer hardly knew how sufficiently to testify to herself own gratitude affection became conscious a be preparing for dinner of special attention to toilet be more than ordinarily careful with hair felt to be aware of anxiety to look best have now be for time so accustomed to dress in black that in respect aunt death have made difference to deep mourning have ceased from habit to impress with special feeling of funereal solemnity something about in room at last struck with awe bidding remember how death have of late be busy among who have be dearest nearest friend sat down almost frightened at own heartlessness in be allowing to be happy at time aunt have be carried away to grave only yesterday brother death have occurred under circumstance of peculiar distress within year yet be happy triumphant almost lost in joy of own position remained for while in chair with black dress hanging across lap a argued with a to own state of mind be sign of hard heart within that must be happy at time ought memory of poor brother to have such effect upon a to make joy of spirit impossible to must at present moment be so crushed by aunt demise a to be incapable of congratulating upon own success must have told when asked that question upon bridge that there must be marrying giving in marriage between talking on subject in day so full of sorrow a know that quite succeeded in recognising a truth that sorrow must be allowed to bar out joy that doe not bar out of absolute necessity by own weight without reference to conventional idea sorrow must never under circumstance be nursed into activity a though be thing in divine praiseworthy know that followed out argument till have taught that be love be divine love when outraged by death other severance produce that sorrow man must control if be strong enough can not control by reason of weakness of humanity doubt whether so much a made plain to a sat there before toilet table with sombre dress hanging from hand on to ground something of strength of such reasoning be hers knowing to be full of joy must not struggle to make believe that behoved to be unhappy told that be doing what be good for others a well a for herself what must be very good for father what must be good if might be within power to make so for who be to be husband blackness of cloud of brother death must never altogether pas away from have tended a knew well to make serious grave old in spite of own effort to contrary cloud have be so black with that have nearly lost for prize be now own told that blackness be injury to not benefit that have now become duty to for sake if not for own to dispel shadow rather than encourage must go down to full of joy though not full of mirth must confess to frankly that in receiving assurance of love have received everything have seemed to have value for in world hitherto have be independent have specially be careful to show to resolve to be independent of now must put aside let know that recognised in lord master a well a husband to father have be left strength on must lean have be forced therefore to trust to own strength now must be dependent on who be to be husband a heretofore have rejected offer of assistance almost with disdain so now must accept without scruple looking to to be guide in thing putting from that carping spirit in have be wont to judge of action believing in a wife must believe in husband such be resolution clara made in first hour of solitude came to after engagement must have be wise resolution for flaw that stronger be submitting to weaker greater to le more honest to le honest that be nearly true to be in great part false theory of man wife that special theory in accordance with wife be to bend in loving submission before husband be very beautiful must be good altogether if must only be arranged that husband must be stronger greater of two theory be based upon hypothesis hypothesis sometimes fails of confirmation in ordinary marriage vessel right stronger greater take lead whether clothed in petticoat in coat waistcoat trouser there sometimes come terrible shipwreck when woman before marriage have filled full with idea of submission then find that golden headed god have got iron body foot of clay captain aylmer when be left alone have also something to think about a there be two hour left for such thought before must again meet clara a have nothing else with to occupy during two hour again strolled down to bridge on have made offer strolled down there thinking that be thinking hardly giving much mind to thought allowed to run away with a listed of course be going to be married be thing settled be perfectly satisfied with in that have done nothing in hurry must accuse of folly even if have great cause for triumph have be long thinking that must like to have clara amedroz for wife long thinking that must ask to marry having for month indulged such thought must not take blame to for having made to aunt deathbed promise have exacted at moment in asked question be anxious to do thing desired of how then must have refused having given promise be matter of course with to fulfil be man who must have never respected again must have hated for ever have failed to keep promise from living being must absolve have be right therefore to make promise having made have be right to keep to do thing at once clara be very good very wise sometimes looked very well must never disgrace a be in worldly matter to receive much give nothing must probably be willing to make amenable to arrangement a to future mode of life might propose in respect of matter be probably thinking of lodging for in london during parliamentary session while remained alone in big red house upon eye be fixed at time there be much of convenience in might perhaps atone to for sacrifice be undoubtedly making of have marriage simply be of thing desirable must doubtless have disposed of to better advantage prospect present fortune general position be so favourable that might have dared to lift expectation in regard to wealth rank very high aylmers be considerable people though younger brother have much more than younger brother portion seat in parliament be safe position in society be excellent secure be exactly so placed that marriage with fortune be only thing wanting to put finishing coping stone to edifice perhaps also useful glory of having lady mary lady emily at top of table lady emily aylmer yes must have sounded better there be certain lady emily who might have suited now a slight regret stole upon gently failed to remember that lady emily have not shilling in world yes faint regret did steal upon though went on telling that have acted rightly star be generally very good to have not perhaps on occasion be a good a usual doubt have to certain degree become encumbered with clara amedroz have not direct immediate leap with have come into arm shown somewhat too plainly that one word of mouth tending towards matrimony have be regarded by a being too valuable to be lost fruit fall easily from tree though be ever best be never valued by gardener let have well nigh broken neck in gathering unripe crude from small topmost bough of branching tree pippin will be esteemed by a invaluable on morning a captain aylmer have walked home from church have doubted much what must be clara answer to then pippin be at end of dangerous bough now have fallen to foot did not scruple to tell that be always might have be a matter of course well apple have come of good kind though there might be speck upon though might not be fit for special glory of show pride of place among dessert service still must be garnered used doubt must be very good apple for eating having so concluded captain aylmer returned to house washed hand changed boot went down to drawing room just a dinner be ready came up to almost radiant with joy put hand upon arm martha did not know what be here said told to put dinner on table hope have not kept waiting oh dear what if did lady never care about thing getting cold be gentleman only who have feeling in such matter a know that there be much difference however then be in dining room a servant remained there during dinner there be nothing in conversation worth repeating after dinner still remained down stair seating on two side of fire clara having fully resolved that must not on such evening a leave captain aylmer to drink glass of port wine by suppose may stay with may said oh dear yes be sure be very much obliged be not at wedded to solitude then there be slight pause be lucky said a have made up mind to be wedded in sort of way voice a spoke be very low there be gentle ring of restrained joyousness in ought to have gone at once to heart made supremely blessed for time well yes answered be in for now of be not hope have misgiving about clara who have misgiving indeed have misgiving frederic doubt scruple alloy in happiness with be a must have be ah have understood why have be have seemed to be harsh to when have met have not said be true be true also that must have be well that must be kept in ignorance be minded however to tell everything therefore went on know how to tell yet circumstanced a be now seems ought to tell everything yes certainly think that said aylmer be one of men who consider entitled to see hear know little detail of woman conduct a consequence of circumstance of engagement who consider shorn of privilege if anything be kept back if gentleman have said soft word to clara eight year ago that soft word ought to be repeated to now be afraid that particular gentleman sometimes hear fib often wonder that own early passage in tournays of love warn that must be so when james have sat deliciously through moonlit night with arm round mary waist afterwards see mary led to altar by john doe not occur to that john may have also sat with arm round anna waist that anna whom be leading to altar thing must not be inquired into too curiously curiosity of men on such matter have end for most part woman like telling only choose to be pressed beyond own mode of utterance must like to know have full confidence said have got full confidence replied mean that must tell anything that there be to be told be only have learned to love before thought that love must be returned oh be that said captain aylmer in tone seemed to imply something like disappointment yes fred that be how must under such circumstance trust to be gentle with to look to for assistance how must guess then that know now of course must therefore be driven to be harsh aunt used to speak to about wonder at for be very anxious that must be married clara for moment felt to be uncomfortable a heard word half perceiving that implied instigation on part of mr winterfield must be that captain aylmer offer have be

have be very frank with oh very frank must not take little joke understand little prettiness that be man not prone to joking knew well still went against grain with to find that be so very hard in reply to attempt be not easy for clara to carry on conversation after so proposed that must go up stair into drawing room change even a must throw into different way of talking prevent necessity of further immediate allusion to will belton for clara be aware though hardly knew why that frankness to future husband have hardly be successful regretted that have on occasion mentioned cousin name went up stair again sat in chair over fire for while conversation did not seem to come to freely clara felt that be now captain aylmer turn to begin captain aylmer felt that wished must read newspaper have nothing in particular that desired to say to lady love morning a be shaving have something to say be very particular a to be at moment so nervous that have cut slightly through trembling of hand that have now be said be nervous no longer that have now be said thing settled so easily that wondered at own nervousness did not know that there be anything that required much further immediate speech clara have thought somewhat of time might be proposed for marriage making little resolve with reader be already acquainted idea of kind presented to captain aylmer have asked cousin to be wife thereby making good promise to aunt there must be further necessity for pressing haste sufficient for day be evil thereof be not to be supposed that thriving lover actually spoke to in such language a that confessed to that clara amedroz be evil to rather than blessing feeling be already so far tending in direction that be by mean disposed to make further promise to engage in closer connection with matrimony by mention of special day clara finding that companion must not talk without encouragement from have to begin again asked natural question about family brother sister home habit old house in answer to must be so full of interest to even on subject be dry indisposed to answer with full copiousness of free communication desired at last there came question answer word two on one side then word two on other from clara got wound be very sore to have always pictured to myself said mother a woman who have be very handsome be still handsome woman though be over sixty tall suppose yes tall with something of of what will say dignity about be not grand hope know what call grand not grand in bad sense be sure be not that there be lady who seem to stand so high above level of ordinary female a to make who be ordinary quite afraid of mother be certainly not ordinary said captain aylmer be said clara laughing wonder what will say to rather what will think of then there be moment silence after clara still laughing went on see fred that have not word of encouragement to give about mother be rather particular said captain aylmer then clara drew up ceased to laugh have called ordinary with half insincere depreciation of self be common to of when speak of own attribute by mean intend that who hear will accept a strictly true will re echo a own approved opinion in instance captain aylmer though have not quite done have done almost a bad then suppose have better keep out of way said clara by mean laughing a spoke of course when be married must go see at rate promise very agreeable visit fred dare say will survive after be that be to marry not mother a long a be not majestic to need not care for majesty know what mean by majesty must confess that speak of a of something very terrible say that be particular so be a respect for opinion be equal to affection for person hope that will make great effort to gain esteem never make effort of kind if esteem doe come without effort be worth having there disagree with altogether especially disagree with a be speaking about mother about lady who be to become own mother in law trust that will make such effort that will make successfully lady aylmer be not woman who will give heart at once simply because have become son wife will judge by own quality will not scruple to condemn must see cause then there be longer silence clara heart be almost in rebellion even on first day of engagement quelled high spirit said further word about lady aylmer did speak again till have enabled to smile a spoke well fred said putting hand upon arm will do best woman can do more now will say good night for must pack for to morrow journey before go to bed then kissed with cold chilling kiss left for night chapter xii miss amedroz return home clara be to start by train leaving perivale at eight on following morning therefore there be not much time for conversation before went during night have endeavoured so to school a to banish from breast feeling of anger against lover of regret a regarded herself probably a told have made more of what have said than have intended that must do then be not natural that must think much of mother feel anxious a to way in might receive wife a to that feeling of anger on own part did get quit of regret be not to be so easily removed be not only what captain aylmer have said about mother clung to doing much to quench joy there have be coldness in tone to throughout evening recognised almost unconsciously made heart heavy in spite of joy repeatedly told ought to be own also felt though be not clearly aware that did so that manner towards have become le affectionate le like of lover since honest tale have told of own early love for must have be le honest more discreet bold more like in word to ordinary run of woman have known a be packing last night told that be so a be dressing on last morning at perivale that frankness of hers have not be successful regretted that have not imposed on little reticence even little of coy pretence of indifference be so often used by lady when be wooed have be boldly honest have found honesty to be bad policy thought at least that have found policy to be bad whether in truth may not have be very good have be best policy in world tending to give first true intimation have ever yet received of real character of man who be now so much to be altogether question be clearly duty to make best of present circumstance went down stair with smiling face with pleasant word on tongue when entered breakfast room captain aylmer be there martha be there also pleasant word be received indifferently in presence of servant when old woman be gone captain aylmer assumed grave face began serious little speech have prepared broke down in utterance of be saying thing very different from what have intended before have completed clara began what occurred between yesterday be source of great satisfaction to be glad of frederic said trying to be little le serious than lover of very great satisfaction continued can not think that be justified by circumstance of position in forgetting for time sad solemnity of occasion when remember that be day before yesterday that followed dear old aunt to grave be astonished to think that yesterday must have made offer of marriage what must be good of talking in strain clara too have have own misgiving on same subject little qualm of conscience have come to a remembered old friend in silent watch of night such thought be for silent watch not for open expression in broad daylight have paused must say something one excuse to oneself be that must have wished so exactly must have wished indeed did wish therefore paused in what be saying felt to be on difficult ground eye be full upon waited for moment two a though expecting that must finish word a did not go on finished for therefore sacrificed own feeling heart be becoming sore be unable to restrain utterance of sarcasm just so said rather not exactly that mean that be sacrificed for of course a have just now said nothing a regard can be more satisfactory yesterday must have be solemn day to a be not thought very solemn what mean be that find excuse in remembering be doing what asked to do what asked to do fred what have promised mean what have promised did not hear that before last word be spoken in very low voice went direct to captain aylmer ear have heard declare said that a regard nothing must be more satisfactory fred said listen to for moment engaged ourselves to other yesterday a man wife of course did listen to dear fred in doing that there be nothing in mind unbefitting sadness of day even in death must think of life if be well for that must be together must surely have be foolish ceremony between to have abstained from telling other that must be so because aunt have died last week may be think be case that feeling arising from death have made too precipitate understand how can be have be anxious to keep promise made to without considering sufficiently whether in doing so must secure own happiness know about a regard must be considered to be best judge have be too much in hurry in believing that wished to believe what do mean by clara mean that engagement will be at end not necessarily so for always that a engagement binding will for present cease to exist will be again free choose to be free when think of will find best that must be so have performed promise honestly even though at sacrifice to yourself luckily for for of must say full truth have come out can consider quietly what will be best for to do independently of promise will part therefore a dear friend not a engaged to other a man wife be engaged will not hear of being broken lady word fred be always most potential before marriage must therefore yield to in matter be sure judgment will approve of decision when think of there will be engagement between will consider quite free free to do a please altogether of course will be free also if please of course must be so do please fred yesterday then be to go for nothing not exactly can not go for nothing with told too many of secret for nothing be done said yesterday be to be held a binding upon of made up mind to last night be at rate made up to now come will have to go without breakfast if eat at once will have tea now wait take comfortably when be gone captain aylmer breakfasted with took to station saw off with possible courtesy attention then walked back by to own great house in perivale not word more have be said between clara a to engagement recognised a fact that be no longer bound to a future husband indeed have power of not recognising fact so decided have be language so imperious manner have be of avail that have said that engagement must stand have told that voice be to be more potential have felt that be so well might not be best for that must be so have kept promise to aunt have done lay in power to make clara amedroz wife if chose to rebel against own good fortune simply because spoke to few word seemed to to be fitting might not be well for to take at word such be first thought a day wore on with something more generous in nature came to aid something also be akin to real love now that be no longer own again felt desire to have now that there must be again something to be done in winning be again stirred by man desire to do something ought not to have told of promise be aware that what have said on point have be dropped by accidentally that clara resolution after have not be unnatural must therefore give chance resolved before went to bed night that must allow fortnight to pas away must then write to renewing offer with strongest declaration of affection must be enabled to make clara on way home be not well satisfied with with position have have great joy during few hour of joy have be hers in thinking of comfort news must give to father must be released from further trouble on account by tidings must convey to by tidings have intended to convey to now story must have to tell must by mean be comfortable must have to explain to that aunt have left provision for must be beginning end of story a for conversation about fifteen hundred pound of must say nothing when reflected on what have taken place between herself captain aylmer be more resolved than ever that must not touch portion of money of money must come from must tell father anything of marriage engagement have be made on one day unmade on next why must add to distress by showing what good thing might have be hers have only have wit to keep must tell father simply of will then comfort in affliction a best might a regarded position with captain aylmer more thought of more sure became that everything be over in quarter have indeed told that such need not necessarily be case have done in desire at moment to mitigate apparent authoritativeness of own decision rather than with idea of leaving matter open for further consideration be sure that captain aylmer must be glad of mean of escape that must not again place in jeopardy promise exacted from by aunt have made so nearly fatal to for though still loved man so loved that lay back in corner of carriage weeping behind veil a thought of what have lost still must not take though must again press suit upon with ardour at command indeed man must ever be made to regard a burden imposed upon by extorted promise what let man sacrifice to sense of duty on behalf then repeated odious word to herself till came to think that have fallen from lip not from own in writing to father from perivale have merely told of mr winterfield death of own intended return at taunton station met well known old fly well known old driver be taken home in accustomed manner a drew nearer to belton sense of distress became stronger stronger till at last almost feared to meet father what must say to when must repeat to a must be sure to do lamentation a to future poverty on arriving at house learned that be up stair in bedroom have be ill servant said though be not now in bed have not come down stair so ran up to room finding seated in old arm chair

question pushed away from knee stood up with effort leaning against back of chair dear papa let distress be so be there in truth nothing nothing papa remember that be not really aunt nonsense child nonsense how can talk such trash to a then tell not to distress be to know that will be beggar in year two probably in few month be not to distress have be wicked woman oh papa say that wicked woman

began to find that must in justice to aunt memory tell father something more yet must be very difficult to tell anything must not bring greater affliction upon must not also lead into deeper trouble must come to pas that aunt intention with reference to fifteen hundred pound be mentioned must be subjected to endless persecution a to duty of accepting money from captain aylmer present feeling must have made much prefer to beg bread upon road than accept late lover generosity then again how must explain to father mr winterfield mistake about own position without seeming to accuse father of having robbed nevertheless must say something a mr amedroz continued to apply epithet of heartless to mr winterfield going on with in low droning tone be more injurious to clara ear than first full energy of anger heartless quite heartless shockingly heartless shockingly heartless truth be papa clara said at last that when aunt told about will did not know what have adequate provision from own family oh clara be truth papa for explained whole thing to must not tell that be mistaken thus ask for money knew everything about poor wretched boy now father dropped back into chair buried face in

papa think about at what be use after money be not everything care nothing for money if will only agree to banish subject altogether will be so comfortable how be to be banished at rate need not speak of why must talk on subject be simply uncomfortable can not mend oh dear oh dear oh dear now swayed backwards forward in chair bewailing own condition hers past imprudence while tear ran down cheek still knelt there at foot looking up into face with loving beseeching eye praying to be comforted declaring that must still be well if must only forget subject at rate cease to speak of still went on wailing complaining of lot a child complains refusing consolation yes know said have all be fault how must help be to do papa nobody have said that anything be fault nobody have thought so never spent anything on never never yet yet yet look at with more courage papa after what harm will be if must have to go out earn own bread like other young woman be not afraid at last wept into apathetic

that must not a yet forgive hand have seemed to strike be sorry that must be so bad with will what do mean by bad be not bad with be very well with keep pity for who want then walked off by across broad street before club door leaving friend without word of farewell made way up into st james square choosing a be evident to mr green first street must take out of sight be hit hit hard said lawyer looking after poor fellow might have guessed from what said never knew of caring for woman before then mr green put on glove went away home will now follow will belton into st james square will follow very unhappy gentleman doubtless have hitherto known appreciated fact that miss amedroz have refused offer have often declared to to sister conviction that refusal must never be reversed in spite of expressed conviction have lived on hope till belonged to man might yet be might win at last by perseverance at rate have in power to work towards desired end might find solace even in working misery of loss must not be so great to a found forced to confess to before have completed wandering on night in not having for own a must be in knowing that have given to man have often told that of course must become wife of man have never yet realised to what must be to know that be wife of one specified rival have be sad enough on moonlight night in avenue at plaistow when have leaned against tree striking hand together a thought of great want unhappiness then have be a nothing to agony now now be over knew man who have supplanted how hated with what unchristian spirit did regard that worthy captain a walked across st james square across jermyn street across piccadilly up bond street not knowing whither be going thought with intense regret of law of modern society forbid duelling forgetting altogether that even have old law prevailed conduct of man whom so hated must have afforded casus belli be too far gone in misery animosity to be capable of reason on matter captain aylmer have interfered with dearest wish during now passing hour must willingly have crucified captain aylmer have be within power to do so till have gone beyond oxford street have wandered away into far distance of portman square baker street have not begun to think of interest clara amedroz might have in matter on thought be employed be sojourning at hotel in bond street have gone thitherwards more by habit than by thought have passed door of inn feeling to be impossible to render up to bed in present disturbed mood a be passing house in bond street have be intent on destruction of captain aylmer have almost determined that if captain aylmer must not be made to vanish into eternity must make up mind to go road be out of question that must go down to belton a to that have come to very decided opinion by time that have crossed oxford street go down to see when have treated after fashion indeed wanted brother now have chosen to trust to other man will belton must not interfere further in affair then drew upon imagination for picture of future in portrayed captain aylmer a ruined man who must probably desert wife make generally odious to acquaintance picture a to realisation of be bound to say that captain aylmer antecedent gave probability be looking at self drawn picture first softened artist heart towards victim whom have immolated on imaginary canvas when clara must be ruined by baseness villany general scampishness of man whom be going to marry to whom be about to be weak enough fool enough to trust then must interpose be brother once again broken hearted brother doubt brother efficacious to keep wolf from door of poor woman child then a thus created captain aylmer embryo family of unprovided orphan for after while killed captain making to die death be very disgraceful not very distinct even to own imagination a thought of coming pledge of love be to so bitter stormed about street performing antic of one must have believed capable who have known a thriving mr william belton of plaistow hall among fen of norfolk character of man be not to be judged from picture may draw from antic may play in solitary hour who act generally with most consummate wisdom in affair of world often meditate very silly doings before wiser resolution form beg therefore that mr belton may be regarded criticised in accordance with conduct on following morning when midnight ramble finally took even beyond new road have be followed by few tranquil hour in bond street bedroom for at last did bring to return thither put to bed after usual fashion put to bed in spirit somewhat tranquillised by exercise of night at last wept to sleep like baby be by mean like baby when took early on following morning to paddington station booked manfully for taunton have have time to recognise fact that have ground of quarrel with cousin because have preferred man to have happened to a be recrossing new road about two o'clock be beginning to find that leg be weary under indeed have recognised one two thing before have gone to sleep with tear dripping on to pillow in first place have ill treated joe green have made fool of in friend presence a joe green be sensible kind hearted fellow did not much signify not on account did omit to tell of own fault then discovered that must ill become to break word to mr amedroz to daughter to do so without word of excuse because clara have exercised right be indisputably own have undertaken certain work at belton required presence must go down do work a though nothing have occurred to disturb to remain away because of misfortune must be to show white feather must be unmanly recognised a picture have painted faded away from canvas a to captain aylmer hoped that might never be called upon to meet still hoped that even a be resolutely cramming shirt into portmanteau before began journey cousin clara thought must meet tender to expression of good wish a to future life without giving way under effort to old squire must endeavour to make pleasant speaking of relief from trouble marriage with captain aylmer must afford for now in cooler moment must perceive captain aylmer be not man apt to ruin wife child to captain aylmer must not bring to say pleasant thing to express pleasant wish who be to be captain aylmer wife who loved must of course have told what have occurred up among rock in belton park if be so meeting between will captain aylmer must be death to former thinking of journeyed down to taunton thinking of made way from taunton across to belton park chapter xv evil word clara amedroz have received two letter together that namely from attorney that from captain aylmer result of letter be already known accepted lover renewed offer of marriage acknowledging force of logic putting faith in strength of assurance did without seeking advice from one who be there from whom must seek advice on matter a who at least be there at belton that father must a matter of course bid accept captain aylmer be thought certain knew well that mr askerton must do same asked counsel from one taking two letter up to own room sat down to consider that referred to aunt money together with postscript in captain aylmer letter on same subject must be of least possible moment if must bring to give favourable answer to other proposition must not be able to do must hesitate a to doing so at once then must write to lawyer in very strong term refusing altogether to have anything to do with money in such case a not word must say to father on one subject on other why must not accept offer made to captain aylmer declared that have determined to ask to be wife before have made promise to mr winterfield if be in truth so then very ground on have separated from must be removed why must hesitate in acknowledging to herself that loved man believed to be true so sat down answered letter writing to lawyer first to said that nothing need be done about money interest till must see hear from captain aylmer again then to captain aylmer wrote very shortly very openly with same ill judged candour spoken word to have displayed of course must be without hesitation now that knew that expressed own wish not merely of aunt a to money said must be simply nonsense now for to have talk of money be yours in way have better manage about a please have written ambiguous letter to mr green will simply plague may go see if like then added postscript in said that must now at once tell father a news must remove from mind solicitude a to future position captain aylmer did go to mr green already know know also that told mr green of intended marriage nothing be said by captain aylmer a to proposed period for marriage be only natural be not probable that man must name day till knew whether not be accepted indeed clara on thinking over whole affair be now disposed to find fault rather with than with lover forgetting coldness formality at perivale remembered only fact of offer to assurance now received that have intended to make before scene have taken place between aunt did find fault with telling that have quarrelled with without sufficient cause eager loving candour of letter to be attributable to self accusation papa said after postman have gone away from belton so that there might be possibility of recall of letter have something to tell hope will give pleasure be often that hear anything of kind said think that will give pleasure do indeed be going to be married going to what going to be married papa be if have leave of course offer of kind have accepted be subject to approval have be told nothing about began at perivale must not tell then ask who be to be husband be not will belton poor will be not will be frederic aylmer think must prefer a son in law even to cousin will must why must prefer man whom even know who life in london who will take away so that will never see again dear papa speak of in way thought must be glad to know be to be so so so happy why be to be done way of sudden why did come to will came to very first thing must come way to belton very well particularly a doe not know will came here oh papa make difficulty of course be different be here when first thought of even then did think very much about did that must suppose well yes know how might be clara almost laughed a felt difficulty into be creeping dear will be much better a cousin than a husband see at captain aylmer will not have belton estate plaistow hall surely be well enough off to take care of wife will have whole of perivale estate know know anything about according to idea of what be proper must have spoken to first if must not come might have written doubt idea may be old fashioned be told that captain aylmer be fashionable young man indeed be not papa be hard working member of parliament know that be better for people seem to think that if man be member of parliament may do what plea there be thompson member for minehead who have bought sort of place out by moor never saw so vulgar pig headed fellow in life being in parliament used to be something when be young wo make man gentleman now day seems to that none brewer tallow chandler lawyer go into parliament now will belton must go into parliament if pleased know better than that wo make fool be not comfortable to clara knew father allowed to go on with grumbling must come round by degree must appreciate if must not be induced to acknowledge wisdom of step be about to take when be to be asked nothing of kind have ever be mentioned papa have better be soon if be to have anything to do with now be certainly case that old man be very ill have not be out of house since clara have returned home though be always grumbling about food must hardly be induced to eat anything when morsel for expressed wish be got for of course will be consulted papa before anything be settled want to be in anybody way dear may tell frederic that have given consent what be use of consenting not consenting if have be anxious to oblige must have taken cousin will oh papa how must accept man did love seemed to to be very fond of at first must say thought be ill treated papa papa say such thing a to what be to do tell ca altogether hold tongue then there be pause well dear a for consent of course may have if be worth anything know that ever heard anything bad about captain aylmer have heard nothing bad about captain aylmer clara a left father felt that be very grievous whatever cause might have have for discontent with lover must not be aware that be man whom father might be proud to welcome a suitor for daughter be man a to whom ill tale have ever be told who have never be known to do anything wrong imprudent who have always be more than respectable a to whose worldly position exception must be taken have be entitled to expect father warmest congratulation tidings have be received a though have proposed to give hand to one whose character position only just made not imperative on father to withhold consent be hard feeling to be so went up stair alone cried bitterly a thought of on next day went down to cottage saw mr askerton went there with express purpose of telling friend of engagement desirous of obtaining in quarter sympathy father declined to give have communication to be accepted in different spirit might probably have kept secret from mr askerton till something further have be fixed about marriage be in want of few kind word pined for of encouragement lady in love usually wish to receive at rate from one chosen friend when found alone with mr askerton hardly knew how to tell news at first must not tell at a lady be eager in speaking on subject when do expect cousin mr askerton asked almost a soon a clara be seated day after to morrow be in london now may be dare say be know anything about can tell then that be colonel askerton have heard of being there seem to speak of a though there be offence in be there reason why must not be in london if plea none in least must much rather that must be there than here why so will coming hurt like like at now know truth believe in think to be fine fellow gentleman whereas think to be either mr askerton be strong language know very strong language yes dear truth be clara that living together here sort of hermit life seeing so much of other seeing nothing of anybody else must either be real friend telling other what think must be nothing ca go on with ordinary make belief of society saying little civil speech not going beyond therefore have made up mind to tell in plain language like cousin believe in know what mean by believing in man believe in sometimes have thought that believe in sometimes have feared that think that be good honest true therefore like to see face hear voice though be not often that say very pleasant thing to do say unpleasant thing be not going to quarrel with not if can help what business have mr belton to go about london making inquiry a to what have done to that must honour so far have made inquiry yes have if have be contented with a be if be satisfied why must want to learn more if have question to ask will answer what right can have to be asking question among stranger clara have question to ask yet must not say that be satisfied must have be better satisfied to have known more of mr askerton yet have never condescended to make inquiry about friend curiosity be now greatly raised indeed mr askerton manner be so strange vehemence so unusual eagerness to rush into dangerous subject so unlike usual tranquillity in conversation that clara did not know how to answer know nothing of questioning said be sure have thought did much a love valuable a society be to down in desert must never speak to again remember if want to ask question will ask of of will answer will not be angry want to ask question may day then can remember what say be to understand that be determined to quarrel with cousin will quarrel with suppose that will see after what have said be not probable that will bring here servant will have order to say that be not at home if must call luckily colonel askerton did not meet when be here before be most strange thing ever heard in life will understand better dear when make communication to what communication will find that will have communication to make have be so diligent so sharp that will have great deal to tell doubt only remember clara that if anything that tell make difference in feeling towards will expect to come to say so openly if make statement let make mine have right to ask for after what have promised may be sure will want nothing more have distrust in none in least tell that believe in if will do will keep mr william belton out of way during visit to part will be satisfied for time past mr askerton have be walking about room a now finished speaking sat down a though subject be fully discussed completed for minute two made effort to resume usual tranquillity of manner in doing so attempted to smile a though ridiculing own energy knew must make fool of when came said now have done think have be fool at may have be mistaken very well dear will see be very odd what dislike took to man first time saw be so fond of yes have cozened a have father be only glad that did not succeed in cozening further than did ought to have known better than to suppose must give heart of heart to one who be abuse more who be so very unlike sort of people with whom have lived may at rate say that know have lived much with one yet except papa aunt know gentleman when see come mr askerton will not stand thought have done with subject now begin again have come here on purpose to tell something of real importance be to must go away without telling unless will give over abusing cousin will not say word more about not at present feel so sure that be mistaken know very well feel sure that be mistaken will leave so go to matter of importance clara felt to be very difficult to tell tidings after conversation a have just occurred when have entered room mind have be tuned to subject must have found fitting word without much difficulty to herself now thought have be scattered feeling hurt did not know how to bring back to subject of engagement paused therefore sat with doubtful hesitating look meditating mode of escape be ear said mr askerton clara thought that discovered something of ridicule of sarcasm in tone of friend voice believe will put off till day said why so think that anything really important to will not be important to also be sure of somehow mean to say have ruffled well perhaps little then be unruffled again like own dear honest clara have be ruffled too will be a tranquil now a drawing room cat then mr askerton got up from chair seated by clara side on sofa come ca go till have told if hesitate will think that mean to quarrel with will come to to morrow will tell to day to morrow will be preparing for cousin what nonsense else will come prepared to vindicate then sha get on further

if captain aylmer have be elder brother instead of younger have aylmer estate instead of perivale property know must not accept if did not like hope not be sure must not when girl with nothing year have managed to love man with two three thousand year have managed to be loved by in return instead of going through same process with curate village doctor be success friend will always think so when girl marries gentleman member of parliament instead of well be not going to say anything personal friend will congratulate upon position may be very wicked mercenary be way of world hate hearing about

word spoke slowly a be custom without of violence of expression wife have used on very account there be more if possible of meaning in word than in hers william belton be cousin speech a colonel askerton have made spoken with deliberation unaccompanied by previous explanation seemed to almost to amount to insult a did not know how to answer at spur of moment remained silent then continued may be sure miss amedroz must not make so strange request to if have not good reason for making think very strange request nothing strong conviction of propriety on part must have induced to make if want to see cousin why can not avoid without saying anything to on subject because must not then have understood a thoroughly a wish to do why kept out of way for wife sake for yours if will allow to say so wish to come to open quarrel with if met quarrel must think be inevitable mary have probably explained to nature of offence against mr askerton have told something a to be quite sure that be mistaken will say nothing about that a have wish at to set against cousin will bid good night now a be close at home then turned round left clara a thought of must not call to mind cousin remembrance about miss vigo mr berdmore what if made inquiry a to correctness of old recollection nothing thought must be more natural then reflected that in ordinary way of world person feel none of violent objection to asking of question about antecedent be now evinced by colonel mr askerton of one thing felt quite assured that cousin will belton must make inquiry ought not to make must make improper use of information might obtain chapter xvi heir second visit to belton clara began to doubt whether possible arrangement of circumstance of life must be regarded a fortunate be very fond in different

mistake of wanting to marry must have done so a matter of course have supposed to cherish intention of renewing that mistake must have felt bound to tell so that might save from unnecessary pain gave credit for such intention yet must not remember that scene among rock then be be not to say anything to about askertons with also difficulty be a great did not in truth believe that tidings have heard from friend lawyer required corroboration yet be necessary that must know from that have disposed of hand be necessary also that must say word to a to future standing friendship must be very anxious

over be think ought to go up to father again on following day belton mr amedroz discussed same subject conversation went off very quietly will be determined not to exhibit weakness before father a have done before daughter when squire with maundering voice drawled out expression of regret that daughter choice have not fallen in place will be able to say that bygone must be bygone regretted also be now over when squire endeavoured to say few ill natured word about captain aylmer will stopped at once by asserting that captain be that ought to be must have made so happy to think that daughter child must come to live in grandfather old house murmured mr amedroz there be knowing that may do so yet said will thing be so doubtful that man be wrong to fix happiness upon after that went out to ramble about place before third day be over clara be able to perceive that in spite of what have said be a busy about cattle a though bread depended on nothing have be said a yet about askertons clara have resolved that name must not first be mentioned by mr askerton have prophesied that will must have communication to make about clara must at rate see whether cousin must of own accord introduce subject three day passed by have made allusion to cottage inhabitant in be singular a askertons be only local friend whom clara knew a belton have become personally acquainted with mr askerton such be case when mr amedroz once said something about mr askerton in presence of clara belton of shrank from subject in manner made clara understand that conversation about askertons be to be avoided on fourth day clara saw mr askerton then will belton name be not mentioned there be therefore among sense of mystery made uncomfortable seemed to admit of solution clara be more sure than ever that cousin have made inquiry that must not have made that must put information that might have to improper use of such certainty on part must say nothing three week passed by seemed a though belton visit be to come to end without further open trouble now then something be said about captain aylmer be very little belton made further reference to own feeling have come to be understood that visit be to be limited to month to clara month wore away slowly of having much pleasure in society of other old squire came down stair once for hour two spent whole time in bitter complaint everything be wrong everybody be ill treating even with will quarrelled did best to quarrel in regard to everything about place though at same time did not cease to grumble at visitor for going away leaving belton bore so well that grumbling quarrelling did not lead to much required good humour broad common sense to prevent serious trouble misunderstanding during period of cousin visit at belton clara received two letter from captain aylmer who be spending christmas holiday with father mother on day previous to of cousin departure there came third in of letter be there much said about sir anthony be very full of lady aylmer in first wrote with something of personal enthusiasm of lover therefore clara hardly felt little drawback to happiness be contained in certain innuendo respecting lady aylmer idea lady aylmer hope lady aylmer fear clara be not going to marry lady aylmer did not fear that must hold own against mother in law in world when once must be brought face to face a long a captain aylmer seemed to take part rather than of mother be very well second letter be more trying to temper a contained one two small morsel of advice a to conduct have evidently originated with ladyship now there be nothing take so irritating to engaged young lady a counsel from intended husband mamma engaged young lady if be really in love will take almost anything from lover a long a be sure that come altogether from may take what liberty plea with dress may prescribe high church low church if be not a be generally case in condition to accept rather than to give prescription on subject may order almost course of reading providing that supply book may even interfere with style of dancing recommend prohibit partner may not thrust mother down future wife throat in answer to second letter clara did not say much to show sense of objection indeed said nothing in saying nothing showed objection captain aylmer understood then came third letter a contained matter touching upon story will be given entire hope may be taken by gentleman about to marry a fair specimen of sort of letter ought not to write to girl of heart aylmer castle th january dearest clara got letter of th yesterday be sorry

belton castle seemed to think that mr belton visit must not be prolonged when told that be nearest relative remarked that cousin be same a other people indeed be know that clara will not suppose that mean more by than word convey indeed mean le not having advantage of mother of own will not be sorry to know what be mother opinion on matter so nearly concern now come to subject a to what will say will surprise very much know think that aunt winterfield have conversation about neighbour askertons will remember that aunt whose idea on such matter be always correct be little afraid that father have not made sufficient inquiry respecting before allowed to settle near a tenant now turn out that be very far indeed from what ought to be mother at first thought of writing to about be little fatigued at last resolved that under circumstance might be a well that must tell seems that mr askerton be married before to certain captain berdmore that left first husband during lifetime under protection of colonel askerton believe colonel mr askerton have be since married captain berdmore died about four year ago in india be probable that marriage have taken place under circumstance a lady aylmer say will at once perceive that acquaintance between lady must be brought to end indeed own sense of what be becoming to either a unmarried girl a future wife indeed a woman at will at once make feel that must be so think if be must tell whole to mr amedroz will leave to own discretion can assure that lady aylmer have full proof a to truth of what tell go up to london in february suppose may

truth then remembered mr askerton promise if want to ask question will ask of will answer communication a to mr askerton have prophesied have now be made have be made not by will belton whom mr askerton have reviled by captain aylmer whose praise mr askerton have so loudly sung a clara thought of must not analyse own feeling be not devoid of certain triumph have known that belton must not

have be very averse there have be many serious letter belinda aylmer daughter of house have have bad time in pleading brother cause very harsh word have be uttered ultimately matter have be arranged a be usual in such contest mother have yielded to son captain aylmer have therefore gone down few day before christmas with righteous feeling that owed much to mother for condescension almost prepared to make very disagreeable to clara by way of atoning to family for folly in desiring to marry lady aylmer be very plain spoken on subject of clara shortcoming very plain spoken very inquisitive will never have one shilling suppose said yes ma'be captain aylmer always called mother ma'be will have fifteen hundred pound told of be to say will have back money have given fred suppose be english of then lady aylmer raised eyebrow looked very wise just so ma'be ca call that having anything of own in point of fact be penniless be good harping on said captain aylmer somewhat sharply not in least dear good at of course have looked in face will be poor man instead of rich man will have enough to live on be if doe have large family of course will will do very well ma'be might do pretty well dare say if must live privately at perivale keeping up old family house there having expense will find even that close enough with seat in parliament necessity there be that must be year in london of course wo go to london ca expect have better be made quite clear at once hence have come letter about house at perivale containing lady aylmer advice on subject a to clara made reply lady aylmer though have given in assent be still not altogether without hope might be possible that two young people must be brought to see folly error of way before must be too late lady aylmer by judicious course of constant advice might be instrumental in opening eye if not of lady at rate of gentleman have great reliance on own power knew well that falling drop will hollow stone son manifested hot eagerness to complete folly in hurry to cut throat of prospect out of hand time therefore must be allowed to be woman who must use time with patience having through son despatched advice about house at perivale simply amounted to clara must expressly state willingness to live there alone whenever might suit husband to be in london elsewhere went to work on other point connected with amedroz family eventually succeeded in learning something very much like truth a to poor mr askerton trouble at first be so comfortably horror stricken by iniquity have unravelled so delightfully shocked astounded a to believe that fact a then stood must suffice to annul match tell said to belinda frederic wife will have be friend of such woman a lady aylmer sitting up stair with household book before put up great fat hand great fat arm shook head front in most satisfactory dismay suppose clara did not know belinda have considered to be act of charity to call miss amedroz clara since family consent have be given did know have be living in sort of way that must have be confidante in everything besides always hold that woman be responsible for female friend think if consent to drop at once be absolutely to make promise that will never speak to again frederic ought to take that a sufficient that be of course mamma unless have have anything to do with after know how be to trust indeed seems to that have be so artful throughout have be regular case of catching suppose of course that have be anxious to marry frederic perhaps be natural anxious look at going there just when have to meet constituent how young woman can do such thing pass how be that men see when be going on just under nose ca understand then getting poor dear sister to speak to when be dying did think aunt must have be so weak will be thus seen that there be entire confidence on subject between lady aylmer daughter know be step taken with reference to discovery how family be waiting for clara reply lady aylmer though in word attributed so much mean cunning to miss amedroz still be disposed to believe that lady must show rather high spirit on occasion trusted to high spirit a mean for making breach still hoped to accomplish have be intended rather desired that captain aylmer letter must have be much sharper authoritative than have really made mother must not write letter herself have felt that to write in own name must not have served to create anger on clara part against betrothed have quite succeeded in inspiring son with feeling of horror against iniquity of askertons be prepared to be indignantly moral perhaps perhaps misguided clara might be silly enough to say word for lost friend such being present position of affair there be certainly ground for hope now be waiting for clara answer lady aylmer have well calculated course of post knew that letter might reach by wednesday morning of course will not write on sunday have said to son have right to expect that not day must go by captain aylmer who felt that be putting clara on trial shook head impatiently made immediate answer lady aylmer triumphantly feeling that have culprit on hip did not care to notice be doing best must for happiness a have done for health when in day gone by have administered to infantine rhubarb early senna a have never then expected to like dos did now expect that must be well pleased at remedial measure to be to be subjected letter came on wednesday did come on thursday then be thought by lady at park that time have come for speaking word two belinda at mother instance began attack

answer must have be here on wednesday morning indeed must have have tuesday evening a mamma sent over to whitby for day mail letter poor belinda be bad lieutenant displayed too much of senior officer tactic in thus showing how much calculation how much solicitude there have be a to expected letter if be contented suppose may be said brother doe seem to to be so very important if have got letter know must be so necessary that must write again so that contamination must be stopped a soon a possible captain aylmer shook head walked away be doubt prepared to be morally indignant morally very indignant at askerton iniquity did not like word contamination a applied to future wife frederic said mother later on same day when hardly used groom have returned from futile afternoon inquiry at neighbouring post town think must do something in affair do what ma'be go off to belton certainly must not do in first place must be very inconvenient to in next place must not be fair upon did not mean that at think that something must be done must be made to understand may be sure ma'be that understands a well a anybody dare say be clever enough at kind of thing kind of thing bite nose off frederic because be anxious about wife what be that wish to do have written to can only wait for answer may be that feel delicacy in writing to on subject though own however to make long story short if like will write to see that must do good must only give offence give offence frederic to receive letter from future mother in law from only think frederic what be saying if thought be being bullied about must turn rusty at once turn rusty what be to think of young lady who be prepared to turn rusty at once too because be cautioned by mother of man professes to love against improper acquaintance against acquaintance so very improper lady aylmer eloquence must have be heard to be appreciated be tame to say that raised fat arm fat hand wagged front front be more formidable a be old one somewhat rough dishevelled be wont to wear in morning emphasis of word must have be heard fitting solemnity of action must have be seen if there be doubt continued to say there be doubt there be damning proof there be certain word usually confined to vocabulary of men woman such a lady aylmer delight to use on special occasion when strong circumstance demand strong language a said put hand below table pressing apparently against own august person be in truth indicating position of certain valuable correspondence be locked up in drawer of writing table can write if like of course think ought to wait few more day very well frederic then will wait will wait till sunday wish to take step of approve if have not heard by sunday morning then will write to on monday on saturday afternoon life be becoming inexpressibly disagreeable to captain aylmer began to meditate escape from park in spite of agreement between mother understood to signify that nothing more be to be said a to clara wickedness at rate till sunday after post hour lady aylmer have twice attacked on saturday have expressed opinion that affair be in very frightful position belinda went about house in melancholy guise with eye rarely lifted off ground a though be prophetically weeping utter ruin of brother respectability even sir anthony have raised eye shaken head when on opening post bag at breakfast table operation be always performed by lady aylmer in person ladyship have exclaimed again letter then captain aylmer thought that must fly resolved that in event of such flight must give special order a to re direction of own letter from post office at whitby that evening after dinner a soon a mother sister have left room began subject with father think will go up to town on monday sir said so soon a

well go into drawing room if be settled suppose be settled really seems to that mother be trying to do best can for really doe captain aylmer did not say anything to mother night a to going a thought of prospect in solitude of bedroom felt really grateful to father for solicitude sir anthony have displayed on behalf be not often that received paternal counsel now that have come acknowledged value that clara amedroz be self willed woman thought that be aware be reliant at rate by mean ready to succumb with pretty feminine docility must like to have seen evince certainly must not wish to be nagged by wife indeed knew well enough to assure that must not stand for day in own house must be master if there came tempest must rule must at least promise that a mother have be strong so have father be weak have a felt thankful in knowing inherited mother strength rather than father weakness for why have tempest to rule at even though man do rule domestic tempest can not have very quiet house with then again remembered how very easily clara have be won wished to be just to men woman to clara among number desired even to be generous to with moderate generosity above thing desired not to be duped what if clara have in truth instigated aunt to deathbed scene a mother have more than once suggested did not believe be sure that have not be so what if be so desire to be generous trusting be moderate desire not to be cheated not to be deceived be immoderate upon whole might not be well for to wait little longer ascertain how clara really intended to behave in emergency of askertons perhaps after mother might be right on sunday expected letter came before content be made known will be well that must go back to belton see what be done by clara in reference to tidings lover have sent chapter xviii mr askerton story when clara received letter from captain aylmer on so much be supposed to hang made up mind to say nothing of to one not to think of if must avoid thinking of till cousin must have left must not mention to for though there be one from whom must sooner have asked advice than from even on so delicate matter a must not do so in present case a informant be cousin successful rival when therefore mr askerton on leaving church have spoken customary word to clara begging to come to cottage on following day clara have be unable to answer not having a yet made up mind whether must must not go to cottage again of course idea of consulting father occurred to rather idea of telling such telling must lead to advice from must find difficult to obey to must be unable to trust moreover why must repeat evil story against neighbour have long morning by herself after will have started then endeavoured to arrange thought lay down for line of conduct presuming story to be true to what did amount certainly amounted to very much if in truth woman have left own husband gone away to live with man have by doing so at rate while be doing so fallen in such way a to make unfit for society of unmarried young woman who meant to keep name unblemished before world clara must not attempt further unravelling of case even in own mind on point must not allow to have doubt without condemning unhappy victim understood well that must owe to who held dear if not to herself to eschew close intimacy with one in position rule of world be too plainly written to allow to guide by special judgment of own in such matter if friend of hers having be thus unfortunate have since redeemed in part redeemed position by second marriage must be then imperative upon to remember past for ever to declare that stain be indelible clara felt that with previous knowledge of such story must probably have avoided intimacy with mr askerton must then have be justified in choosing whether such intimacy must must not exist must so have chosen out of deference to world opinion now be too late for mr askerton have for year be friend clara have to ask question be now needful did own feminine purity demand that must throw friend over because in past year life have be tainted by misconduct be clear enough at rate that be expected from nay imperatively demanded by who be to be lord by to whom future obedience must be due might be immediate decision must have right to call upon to be guided by judgment a soon a must become wife indeed felt that have such right now unless must decide that such right must be now ever be still within power to say that must not submit to such rule a having received command must do obey then declared to not following matter out logically urged to decision by sudden impulse at rate must not obey lady aylmer must have nothing to do in such matter with lady aylmer lady aylmer must be god to question about house at perivale have be very painful to felt that must have endured dreary solitude at perivale without complaint if after marriage husband circumstance have made mode of living expedient to have be asked to pledge consent to life before marriage to feel that be bargaining for privilege of being rid of to know that aylmer people be arranging that if must marry must be a little troubled with wife a possible have be very grievous to have tried to console by conviction that lady aylmer not frederic have be sinner even in consolation there have be terrible flaw that word have come to written by frederic hand must will belton have written letter to future wife in present emergency must be guided by own judgment own instinct not by edict from aylmer park if in what might do must encounter condemnation of captain aylmer must answer must be driven to answer by counter condemnation of mother let be so anything must be better than mean truckling subservience to imperious mistress of aylmer park what must do a regarded mr askerton that story be true be beginning to believe that there be such history be made certain to by promise mr askerton have given if want to ask question will ask of will answer promise must not have be volunteered unless there be something special to be told must be best perhaps to demand from mr askerton fulfilment of promise then in doing so must own from whence information have come mr askerton have told that communication must be made by cousin will cousin will have gone away without word of mr askerton now communication have come from captain aylmer monday tuesday be rainy day rain be excuse for not going to cottage on wednesday father be ill illness made further excuse for remaining at home on wednesday evening there came note to from mr askerton naughty girl why do not come to colonel askerton have be away since yesterday morning be forgetting sound of own voice did not trouble when divine cousin be here for reason unless come to now will think that divinity have prevailed colonel askerton be in ireland about property will not be back till next week clara sent back promise by messenger on following morning put on hat shawl started on dreaded task when left house have not even yet quite made up mind what must do at first put lover letter into pocket so that might have for reference on second thought replaced in desk dreading lest might be persuaded into showing reading part of there have come sharp frost after rain ground be hard dry in order that might gain further last moment for thinking walked round up among rock instead of going straight to cottage for moment though air be sharp with frost sat upon stone where have be seated when cousin will blurted out misfortune of heart sat there on purpose that might think of recall figure tone of voice look of eye gesture of face what man be so tender yet so strong so thoughtful of others yet so self sufficient have unconsciously imputed to one fault that have loved then forgotten love unconsciously for have tried to think that be virtue rather than fault now with full knowledge of what be doing without intention of doing acquitted of one fault now that must acquit owned that must have be fault to have loved so soon to have forgotten no have loved truly ala be one who must not be made to forget then went on to cottage exercising thought rather on contrast between two men than on subject to must have applied so have come at last said mr askerton till got message thought there be to be dreadful misfortune what misfortune something dreadful one often anticipates something very bad without exactly knowing what at least do be always expecting catastrophe when be alone be then be so often alone simply mean low spirit suppose be more than dear not much more take once when be in india lived close to powder magazine be always expecting to be blown up never lived near powder magazine never unless there be one at belton must have thought be exciting then there be gentleman who always have sword hanging over by horse hair what do mean mr askerton look so innocent clara know what mean be result at last of cousin diligence a detective officer mr askerton wrong cousin greatly never once mentioned name while be with did not make single allusion to to colonel askerton to cottage did not never once then beg pardon not le have be busy making inquiry why must say that there be powder magazine sword hanging over head ah why here be subject ready opened to hand yet clara did not know how to go on with seemed to now that must have be easier for to commence if mr askerton have made commencement a be knew not how to introduce subject of captain aylmer letter be almost inclined to wait thinking that mr askerton might tell own story without such introduction nothing of kind be forthcoming mr askerton began to talk of frost then went on to abuse ireland complaining of hardship husband endured in being forced to go thither in winter to look after tenant what did mean said clara at last by sword hanging over head think told what meant pretty plainly if did not understand can not tell more plainly be odd that must say so much not wish to say more ah be making inquiry now in place must not do so too how can help when talked of sword of course make ask what sword be be bound to satisfy curiosity told just before cousin came here that if asked question must answer be to understand that be asking question now yes if will not offend what if will offend offend greatly who like to be inquired into courted such inquiry from clara did not do will tell did gave to understand that if be needful that must hear about antecedent certain matter a to mr belton have be inquiring into in manner thought to be most unjustifiable must tell that story do so without being angry with for asking meant of course must not make ground for quarrelling with if wished to tell must do so without inquiry have sometimes thought that did wish to tell sometimes have almost have such wish now ca understand may well be that one so much alone a be living here without female friend even acquaintance except must often feel longing for comfort full confidence between must give then why not stop moment ca understand may feel yet entertain greatest horror against inquiry like to tell own sorrow who like to be inquired into many woman burn to make full confession who must be a mute a death before policeman be policeman be determined to ask policeman question to clara made immediate reply felt that be acting almost falsely in going on with such question while be in fact aware of circumstance mr askerton must tell did not know how to declare knowledge to explain sincerely wished that mr askerton must be made acquainted with truth have fallen into line of conversation did not make own task easy idea of own hypocrisy be distressing to rushed at difficulty with hurried eager word resolving that at rate there must be no longer doubt between mr askerton said know there be nothing for to tell know what sword be what be that know that be married long ago to mr berdmore then mr belton did do honour of talking about when be here a said rose from chair stood before clara with flashing eye not word never mentioned name name of one belonging to have heard from from what other know that signifies have learned well what next know what next a so much have be told a have said that might ask have come to will believe own story more thoroughly from yourself than from other teller suppose refuse to answer then can say nothing further what will do ah know be harsh to while be longing to be kind to can not see that have be forced upon partly by other part who have forced that upon who be informant if mean to be generous be generous altogether be man woman have taken trouble to rip up old sorrow that name may be blackened what matter there be married to captain berdmore left went away with present husband for three year be man mistress not wife when poor creature died be married then came here now know though doubtless informant have made better story of after perhaps have be very wicked to sully air breathe by presence why do say that to know one can ever know one can ever know how suffered before be driven to escape how good to have be who who who then turned back upon clara walking off to window stood there hiding tear clouded eye concealing sob choked utterance for moment for space seemed long to of clara kept seat in silence hardly dared to speak though longed to show sympathy knew not what to say at last too rose followed other to window uttered word however gently putting arm around mr askerton waist stood there close to looking out upon cold wintry flower bed not venturing to turn eye upon companion motion of arm be at first very gentle after while pressed closer thus by degree drew friend to with eager warm enduring pressure mr askerton made little effort towards repelling faint motion of resistance a embrace became warmer poor woman yielded to allowed face to fall upon clara shoulder so stood speaking word making attempt to rid of tear be blinding eye gazing out through moisture on bleak wintry scene before clara mind be more active at moment for be resolving that in episode of life must accept lesson whatever from lady aylmer teaching no lesson from teaching of aylmer in existence a for world rule must fit to a best must such fitting must drive to unwomanly cruelty of deserting woman whom have known loved whom now loved with fervour have never before felt towards have heard now said mr askerton at last be not better so ah know how must know do not know a spoke clara pressed arm still closer do not know yet then turning half round clasped

obtain confidence so be impossible to stop in midst of effusion mr askerton told history of life of first foolish engagement belief half belief in man reformation of misery resulted from vice of escape shame of welcome widowhood of second marriage a told paused at point to insist on goodness of who be now husband will tell said at last a do everything then will know have in truth got friend

mingled sorrow anger there be one else near said captain aylmer apologetically be there clergyman in parish life long way off message have to be sent at once be there servant in house look look be last person in world to form harsh judgment of young woman at moment a what did say in letter fred captain aylmer have devoted two hour of consideration to letter before telegram have come to relieve mind by fresh subject in two hour have not be able to extract much of comfort out of document be a felt stubborn stiff necked disobedient almost rebellious letter contained manifest defiance of mother exhibited doctrine of most questionable morality have become to matter of doubt whether must possibly marry woman who must entertain such idea write such letter if doubt be to be decided in own mind against clara have better show letter at once to mother allow ladyship to fight battle for task a well knew ladyship must not be slow to undertake have not succeeded in answering question satisfactorily to when telegram arrived diverted thought now that mr amedroz be dead whole thing might be different clara must come away from belton mr askerton begin life a be afresh seemed a though in such emergency ought to have chance therefore did not hasten to pronounce judgment lady aylmer also felt something of forbore to press question when be not answered will have to leave belton now suppose said sir anthony property will belong to distant cousin mr william belton where will go said lady aylmer suppose have place that can call home must not be good thing to ask here said belinda such question a be very rash on part of miss aylmer in first place selection of guest for aylmer park be rarely left to in special case must have understood that proposal must have be fully considered by lady aylmer before reached frederic ear think must be very good plan said captain aylmer generously lady aylmer shook head must like much to know what have said about unfortunate connection before offer to take by hand be sure fred will feel that ought to do so fred retreated from room without showing letter retreated from room betook to solitude that might again endeavour to make up mind a to what must do put on hat great coat glove went off without luncheon that might consider clara amedroz have now home indeed very little mean of providing one if intended that must be wife must furnish with home at once seemed to that three house might possibly be open to of one only one under such circumstance must be proper be aylmer park other two be plaistow hall mr askerton cottage at belton a to latter must ever take shelter there everything must be over between on point there must be doubt must not bring to marry wife out of mr askerton drawing room must expect mother to receive young woman brought into family under such circumstance plaistow hall be almost a bad be a bad to though must perhaps be le objectionable in eye of lady aylmer must clara go to plaistow hall there must be end to everything of also taught to be quite certain then took out clara letter read again acknowledged story about woman to be true such story a be too yet refused to quarrel with woman have absolutely promised woman not to quarrel with then read re read passage in clara claimed right of forming own opinion in such matter nothing must be more indelicate nothing more unfit for wife began to think that have better show letter to mother acknowledge that match must be broken off that softening of heart have followed upon receipt of telegraphic message departed from a dwelt upon stubborn stiff necked unfeminine obstinacy of letter then remembered that nothing have a yet be done towards putting aunt fifteen hundred pound absolutely into clara hand remembered also that might at present moment be in great want william belton might not improbably assist in want idea be wormwood to in spite of almost formed resolution to give up own claim calculated that income arising from fifteen hundred pound must be very small wished that have counselled aunt to double legacy thought very much about amount of money way in might be best expended be after cold fashion really solicitous a to clara welfare if must have fashioned future life own too in accordance with own now existing wish think must have arranged that of must marry at that to must be assigned duty care of being clara protector with full permission to tell mind a often a pleased on subject of mr askerton then went in wrote note to mr green lawyer desiring that interest of fifteen hundred pound for one year might be at once remitted to miss amedroz knew that ought to write to immediately without loss of post how be to write while thing be in present position be now to condole with on father death without reference to great askerton iniquity must thereby be condoning be past acknowledging truth propriety of argument must be doing even worse than that must be cutting ground absolutely from beneath own foot a regarded that escape from engagement be contemplating what cold hearted ungenerous wretch must have be will be verdict against verdict will be untrue cold hearted ungenerous be be wretch a men woman be now day called wretch be chilly hearted yet quite capable of enough love to make good son good husband good father too though be ungenerous from nature of temperament be not close fisted over covetous be just man desirous of obtaining nothing be not fairly own in truth artist have be so much in habit of painting for friend face without of flaw blotch with work high living be apt to disfigure that turn in disgust from portrait in roughness pimple be made apparent be essential that must now do something before sat down to dinner did show clara letter to mother mother said a sat down in little room up stair knew well by tone of voice by mode of address that there be to be solemn occasion serious deliberative council on present existing family difficulty mother of course have intended to let know what be nature of clara answer to letter be glad there be to be secret between frederic know how dislike secret in family a said took letter out of son hand with eagerness be almost greedy a read stood over watching eye a made way down first page on to second across to third so gradually on till whole reading be accomplished what clara have written about cousin will lady aylmer did not quite understand on point now be so little anxious that passed over portion of letter readily when came to mr askerton allusion to herself took care to comprehend meaning weight of word divide word mine why must want to divide not agree with about mr askerton how be possible that decent young woman must not agree with be matter in there be room for doubt true story true of course be true doe not know that must not have reached from aylmer park if be not true provocation badly treated went away married to colonel askerton a soon a captain berdmore died why frederic can not have be taught to understand first principle of moral in life be so much with poor sister well well reader must understand that late mr winterfield lady aylmer have never be able to agree with other on religious subject remember that be married why must remember anything of kind doe not make atom of difference to woman character repented how can clara say whether have repented not have nothing to do with not quarrel with a call not give up then frederic of course must be over a far a be concerned when have finished reading returned letter still open to son shaking head almost triumphantly a far a be judge of young woman character can only give one counsel said lady aylmer solemnly think that must have chance said captain aylmer what other chance can give seems to that be obstinately bent on own destruction might ask to come here a belinda suggested belinda be very foolish to suggest anything of kind without more consideration suppose that future wife must be made welcome here yes frederic certainly know who must be more welcome be to be wife be engaged doe not that letter break engagement be there not enough in to make such marriage quite out of question what do think about frederic think that must have chance what must clara have thought of herself if must have heard conversation between lady aylmer betrothed husband have known that lover be proposing to give chance be lucky for that seldom know what best friend say on behalf when discus fault behind back what chance frederic can have know about horrid woman yet refuse to give up what chance can have after think that might have here talk to lady aylmer in answer to simply shook head think be right in supposing that such shaking of head be sufficient reply to son proposition what talking must possibly be of service to one a miss amedroz why must throw pearl before swine must either ask to come here else must go to said captain aylmer see that at frederic think must be so a be situated at present have got home think must be very horrid that must be driven into woman house simply because have other shelter for head suppose can remain where be for present be alone know must be very gloomy cousin can turn out at moment notice must not entitle to come here unless quite understand that can not wonder must feel hardship of position who be to be blamed if be hard see frederic take standing upon letter own letter how be to ask young woman into house who declares openly that opinion on matter go for nothing with how be to do be what ask how be to do be very well for belinda to suggest how be to do be what want to know at last lady aylmer managed to answer question for herself did do be not done on sunday afternoon on monday on tuesday question be closely debated at last anxious mother perceived that giving of invitation must be more safe than withholding captain aylmer at last expressed determination to go to belton unless invitation be given then must do that there might be danger that must never be again seen at aylmer park till brought clara amedroz with a wife position be one of great difficulty interest at stake be so immense that something must be risked might be that clara must not come when invited in case obstinacy must be great point gained if did come well lady aylmer admitted to herself that game must be difficult difficult very troublesome might be played perhaps won lady aylmer be woman who have great confidence in not so utterly have victory in such contest deserted hand that need fear to break lance with miss amedroz beneath own roof when occasion be so pressing invitation be therefore sent in note written by be enclosed in letter from son after much consultation many doubt on subject be at last agreed that nothing further must now be urged about mr askerton will have chance said lady aylmer over over again repeating son word will have chance lady aylmer therefore in note confined strictly to giving of invitation to suggestion that a clara have now no settled home of own temporary sojourn at aylmer park might be expedient captain aylmer in letter hardly said much more knew a wrote word that be cold comfortless that ought on occasion to have written word must have be warm at rate even though might not have contained comfort to have written with affection must have written at once have postponed letter from sunday till wednesday have be absolutely necessary that important question a to invitation must be answered before must write at when be settled went up to london there be understanding between mother that must return to aylmer park with

always have doubt qualm qualm of feeling rather than of conscience have also always entertained strong family ambition people ever so far back have be beltons of belton told that family must be traced back to very early day before plantagenet a believed though on point of subject be very hazy in information liked idea of being man by whom family must be reconstructed in glory worldly circumstance have be so kind to that must take up belton estate with more of prestige of wealth than have belonged to of owner of place for many year past must come to pas that living there must be desirable must rebuild old house make new garden fit out with pleasant bravery of well to do english squire there need be pinching scraping question whether carriage must be possible doubt a to prudence of

with wretched death of clara brother must bring to take with pleasure seeing that came to by so sad chance by catastrophe so deplorable when must think of mind must revolt from own desire must declare to that inheritance must come to with stain of blood upon indeed must have be guiltless how must take pleasure in shade of belton without thinking of tragedy have given property such have be thought desire mixed in nature militating against other have induced to offer first visit to cousin house know be effect of visit by what pleasant scheme have endeavoured to overcome difficulty so to become master of belton that clara amedroz must also be mistress there have be way after two day intimacy with clara seemed to promise comfort happiness on side have come too late way be closed against now

service to have accepted man have power of making change even if must wish still there be to something of gratification in idea that must be made to feel that belton be more instant in affection more urgent in good office more anxious to befriend in difficulty than man whom have consented to take for husband aylmer must probably go down to belton will be very anxious to be first on ground very anxious though doing so must be of use be wrong on part knew that be wrong abused for own selfishness such self abuse gave aid in escaping from own wickedness must if possible be at belton before

saw captain aylmer in green chamber seventy five pound indeed be prepared to give whole estate to if must take even though must not marry even though be going to throw away upon fish then felt somewhat a hamlet did when jumped upon laertes at grave of ophelia send seventy five pound indeed while be ready to drink up esil for to make over to whole belton estate thus abandon idea for ever of

egg bacon for morning breakfast went up stair to miserable little bedroom to dress after night journey chapter xxi mr askerton generosity death of old man at belton castle have be very sudden at three o'clock in morning clara have be called into room at five o'clock be alone in world having father mother brother without home without shilling that must call own with hope a to future life if a have so much reason to suppose captain aylmer must have chosen to accept last letter a ground for permanent separation at moment on saddest morning did not care much for chance seemed to be almost indifferent to question of lady aylmer anger more that be absolutely in need of external friendship more disposed be to reject to declare to herself that be prepared to stand alone in world for last week have understood from doctor that father be in truth sinking that might hardly hope ever to see again convalescent have therefore in sort prepared for loneliness anticipated misery of position a soon a be known to woman in room that life have left old man one of have taken her by hand led back to own chamber now miss clara have better lie down on bed again have indeed can hing sitting up took old woman advice allowed to do with a must be true that there be longer work by must make useful in house in house a far a must see in other yes must go to bed lying there must feel how convenient

read captain aylmer letter over over again since have answered have read nearly a often copy of own reply have told a read that of course must not forgive might perhaps pardon if must submit to in everything that must not submit to command respecting mr askerton be fully resolved therefore there must be hope then when remembered how lately dear father spirit have fled hated for having allowed mind to dwell on anything beyond loss of be still in bedroom having fallen into half waking slumber numbness of sorrow so often produce when word be brought to that mr askerton be in house be first time mr askerton have ever crossed door remembrance that be so came upon at once during father lifetime have seemed to be understood that neighbour must have admittance there now now that father be gone barrier be to be overthrown why not why must not mr askerton come to why if mr askerton chose to be kind to must not altogether throw into friend arm of course doing so must give mortal offence to everybody at aylmer park why need stop to think of have already made up mind that must not obey order from aylmer park on subject have not seen mr askerton since interview between be described few chapter back then everything have be told between so that there be longer mystery either on one side on other then clara have assured friend of loving friendship in spite of edict to contrary might come from aylmer park after what must be more natural than mr askerton must come to in sorrow say will come up to if will let said servant clara declined proposition in few minute went down to small parlour in have lately lived where found visitor poor dear have be very sudden said mr askerton very sudden very sudden yet now that have gone know that expected of course came to a soon a heard of because knew be alone if there have be one else must not have come be very good of colonel askerton thought perhaps have better come told of said to other other day thought at first that must be better must not see be very good of to come said clara again a spoke put out hand took mr askerton continuing to hold for awhile very good indeed told must not go down to that thought must not understand if stayed away at rate be good of to come to believe said mr askerton that what people call consolation be ever of use be terrible thing to lose father very terrible ah dear have hardly yet found out how sad be a yet have only be thinking of wishing must be with nay clara how can help be to do where be to go of what use be life to one a for who must dare to wish back again when people have fallen gone down in world be bad for to go on living everything be trouble there be nothing vexation think have suffered dear have have somebody to care for somebody whom must trust have not no one what do mean clara mean what say have one be use asking question not now at time a did not mean to complain complaining be weak foolish have often told must bear anything so will when can bring to think of have lost in father will be better even though will be more sorrowful a be hate for being so selfish will let come stay with to day will not dear not to day why not to day clara will be better alone have so many thing to think of know well that must be better that must not be alone much better will not press can not insist with a woman must be wrong there quite wrong must be led by sooner than by woman living what other woman be there to whom must listen for moment a said even in depth of sorrow thought of lady aylmer strengthened in resolution to rebel against lover mother then continued wish knew cousin mary mary belton have never seen be nice so will tell know what say must be true even about sister will will be always thinking of cousin will if be really so good will show now how can show can do doe not inherit property of course doe what of when say have friend be not thinking of poverty if have that regard for pretend can do much to assist why must not come here at once god forbid why why do say so be nearest relative if understand can not explain have be told what have happened mr askerton asked colonel askerton sent message to believe to captain aylmer also yes to captain aylmer be colonel askerton who sent then will come of course think not why must come did not even know poor papa dear clara have not known will see that will not come tell beforehand that will be right to stay away indeed know how must come want here can not understand clara suppose not can not very well understand must not be at surprised if lady aylmer be to come oh heaven how little can know of lady aylmer position character if be to be mother in law even if be idea of lady aylmer coming away from aylmer park way from yorkshire to house a if told that queen be coming must hardly disconcert more dear there be danger of at least know what may have passed between unless there have be quarrel will come be will do so if be at like men whom have known will not come then mr askerton made half whispered offer of service to be rendered by colonel askerton soon afterwards took leave having first asked permission to come again in afternoon when be declined having promised to return on following morning a walked back to cottage must not think more of clara engagement to captain aylmer than did of squire death a regarded herself of course must not grieve for mr amedroz a regarded clara clara father have for time past be apparently so insignificant even in own house that be difficult to acknowledge fact that death of one a might leave great blank in world what have clara meant by declaring so emphatically that captain aylmer must not visit belton by speaking of a one who have position friend in world if there have be quarrel indeed then be sufficiently intelligible if there be such quarrel from what source must have arisen mr askerton felt blood rise to cheek a thought of told that there must be one such source mr askerton knew that clara have received order from aylmer castle to discontinue acquaintance with herself therefore there must be no doubt a to cause of quarrel have come to then that clara be to lose husband because be true to friend rather because must not consent to cast additional stone at one who for year past have become mark for many stone be not prepared to say that mr askerton be high minded woman misfortune have come upon in life of sort be too apt to quench high nobility of mind in woman there be calamity by natural tendency elevate character of woman add strength to growth of feminine virtue then again there be other calamity few woman can bear without degradation without injury to delicacy tenderness be essentially necessary to make woman charming a woman in think world be harder to woman than to men that woman often loses much by chance of adverse circumstance man only loses by own misconduct that there be woman whom calamity can degrade be true enough so be true that there be men who be hero such be exception among men woman not one have mr askerton be calamity have come upon partly indeed by own fault though might have be pardoned weight of misfortune have be too great for strength have become in degree hardened by what have endured if not unfeminine still be feminine in inferior degree with womanly feeling of lower order have learned to intrigue not being desirous of gaining aught by dishonest intriguing believing that must only hold own by carrying on battle after fashion in be speaking of general character of woman be not alluding to one sin have committed thus when have first become acquainted with miss amedroz conscience have not rebuked in be deceiving new friend when asked casually in conversation a to maiden name have not blushed a answered question with falsehood when unfortunately name of first husband have in way made known to clara have be ready again with prepared fib when have recognised william belton have thought that danger to herself of having one near who might know quite justified in endeavouring to create ill will between clara cousin self preservation be first law of nature must have said must have failed to remember a did always fail to remember nature doe not require by of law that self preservation must be aided by falsehood though be not high minded so also be not ungenerous now a began to understand clara be sacrificing because of promise have be given when two have stood together at window in cottage drawing room be capable of feeling more for friend than for herself be capable even of telling that be cruel on part even to wish for continuance of clara acquaintance have made bed must lie upon said to herself then resolved that instead of going up to house on following day must write to clara put end to intimacy existed between world be hard harsh unjust said still speaking to herself be not fault will not injure because have be injured colonel askerton be up at house on same day did not ask for miss amedroz did see nobody else came to house then on following morning on afternoon though clara did not fail to tell captain aylmer might have be there if have chosen to take journey to leave home a soon a have received message made same calculation a to cousin will though in calculation a know be wrong two day have be very desolate with have begun to look forward to mr askerton coming when instead of that there came messenger with letter from cottage can do a like dear colonel askerton have said on previous evening to wife have listened to have be saying without taking eye from off newspaper though have spoken with much eagerness be not enough must say more to than now think be unreasonable for care how matter go do care one straw what tongue may say can not reach excepting so far a may reach through must advise always do copiously when think that know better than in matter feel so sure that know better than wish to suggest anything then went on with newspaper sat for while looking at a though expected that something more must be said nothing more be said be left entirely to own guidance since day in trouble have come upon mr askerton clara amedroz be first female friend who have come near to comfort be very loth to abandon such comfort there have too be something more than comfort something almost approaching to triumph when found that clara have clung to with affection after hearing whole story of life though conscience have not pricked while be exercising little planned deceit have not taken much pleasure in how must one take pleasure in such work many of daily deceive friend be so far gone in deceit that deceit alone be hardly painful to need of deceiving friend be always painful treachery be easy to be treacherous to love be never easy never easy even though be so common there have be double delight to poor woman in near neighbourhood of clara amedroz since there have ceased to be necessity for falsehood on part now almost before joy have commenced almost before have realised sweetness of triumph have come upon task of doing clara in generosity have refused to do have made bed must lie upon said then instead of going down to house a have promised wrote following letter to miss cottage monday dearest clara need not tell write a do now with bleeding heart few day since must have laughed at woman who used phrase of herself declared to be affected fool now know how true such word may be heart be bleeding feel to be overcome by disgrace told that did not understand yesterday of course understood of course know how be why spoke a did of captain aylmer have chosen to think that must not know without pollution have determined that must give up though have judged be not going to judge world be on side perhaps be right know nothing of trial difficulty why must blame for demanding that future wife will not be intimate with woman who be supposed to have lost fitness for society of woman at rate dearest must obey will see other more be quite sure must be very wicked be to allow to injure position in life on account at rate love must be happy with a be engaged to have just ground for resenting interference will understand now a well a though be to fill sheet sheet of paper with what must say on subject simple fact be that must forget other simply remember one a past friend will know in day two what plan be if remain here will go away if go away will remain here be if cousin will keep a tenant of course know what may have written to captain aylmer since interview up here beg that will write to now make understand that need have fear in respect of may send letter if will oh dear if must know what suffer a write feel that owe apology for harassing on subject at time know ought not to lose day in telling that be to see nothing more of friend who have loved mary askerton clara first impulse on receiving letter be to go off at once to cottage insist on privilege of choosing own friend if preferred mr askerton to captain aylmer be one business own must have done so have not be afraid of meeting with colonel askerton to must not have known how to speak on subject must have known how to conduct at cottage without speaking of then after while felt that be to do so must now deliberately determine to throw into mr askerton arm must at same time give up idea of becoming captain aylmer wife a thought of asked various question concerning did not find easy to answer did wish to be wife must assure that if be married must make other happy did love be still able to declare to herself that answer to last question must be affirmative nevertheless thought that must give up without great unhappiness when began to think of lady aylmer to remember that frederic aylmer imperative demand upon obedience have in probability be dictated by mother be again anxious to go at once to cottage declare that must not submit to interference with own judgment on next morning postman brought to letter be of much moment to brought to also tidings moved more even than letter letter be from lawyer enclosed cheque for seventy five pound have be instructed to pay to a interest of money left to by aunt what must be answer to letter knew very well instantly wrote sending back cheque to mr green postman news more important than letter told that william belton be at inn at redicote chapter xxii passionate pleading clara wrote letter to lawyer returning cheque before must allow moment to dwell upon news of cousin arrival felt that be necessary to do before must even see cousin thus providing against difficulty might arise from adverse advice on part a soon a letter be written sent to post office in village must do almost anything will might tell to do captain aylmer money must not take even though will might so direct

hotel of great northern railway station met captain aylmer room have be taken there because be to start by early train on line in morning captain aylmer have undertaken to order dinner there be nothing particular in meeting to make unpleasant to friend will fortunate rival must do more in hall of inn than give hand to affianced bride a might do to other lady then suggest to that must go up stair see room when have done also offered hand to belton will though must almost sooner have cut off own be obliged to take in few minute two men be standing alone together in sitting room suppose found cold coming up said captain not particularly said will be rather long journey from belton not very long said will not for perhaps miss amedroz must be tired belton be angry at having cousin called miss amedroz feeling that reserve of name be intended to keep at distance must have be equally angry have aylmer called clara cousin said will stoutly be able to bear slight fatigue of kind without suffering did suppose suffered journey be always tedious especially where there be so much road work believe be twenty mile from station belton castle be something over twenty mile from taunton be seven from station at aylmer park think that great deal be more than at plaistow said will oh indeed plaistow be in norfolk believe yes plaistow be in norfolk suppose will leave now go into somersetshire suggested captain aylmer certainly not why must leave thought perhaps a belton castle be now own plaistow hall be more own than belton castle if signifies anything doe said in angry tone a became conscious of tried to rectify have deal of stock sort of thing at plaistow must very well leave even if wished said have pretty good shooting too suppose said aylmer a far a partridge go will back against most property of same extent in county be too busy man said captain to do much at partridge think more of pheasant down with dare say norfolk man like be of course keen about bird be obliged to put up with what have got know not what believe there be better general head of game in norfolk than in other county in england be what make hunting rather poor hunting poor why do say be poor so many of be against preserving fox will tell what captain aylmer know what pack hunt with will bet five pound note that killed more fox last year than did be taking three day week nine twenty brace half in short season call poor at captain aylmer saw that man be waxing angry made further allusion to glory deficiency of norfolk a must think of other subject on to speak at spur of moment sat down took up paper belton took up so remained till clara made appearance that captain aylmer read paper be probable enough be not man easily disconcerted there be nothing in present position to disconcert feel sure will belton did not read word be angry with rival whom hated be angry with for showing anger must have wished to appear to best advantage before man rather before clara in man presence knew that in clara absence be making such fool of that must be unable to recover prestige have serious thought within own breast whether must not be a well for to get up from seat give captain aylmer thoroughly good thrashing drop into punch head a must have expressed for moment such exercise must give immense gratification final result must doubt be disastrous then future result a far a must see be laden with disaster be still thinking of eyeing man from under newspaper telling that feat must probably be too easy to afford much enjoyment when clara re entered room then got up acting on spur of moment got up quickly suddenly began to bid adieu be going to dine here will said think not promised must told have nothing to do to night then turned to captain aylmer expect cousin to dine with to day ordered dinner for three said captain aylmer oh very well be same thing to said will to said captain aylmer be not at same thing to said clara know when may see cousin again must think very bad of will if went away evening will go out just for hour said be back to dinner dine at seven said captain then belton took hat left two lover together cousin seems to be rather surly sort of gentleman be first word captain aylmer spoke when be alone with lady of love be demonstrative of affection by of usual sign of regard be permitted to accepted lover did not offer to kiss did attempt to take hand with warmer pressure now that be alone with probably might have gone through such ceremony have first met clara in position propitious to such purpose a be have be little ruffled by will belton want of good breeding have probably forgotten that such privilege might have be wonder whether remembrance flashed across clara mind at moment of cousin will great iniquity in sitting room at belton castle thought of very often may possibly have thought of now believe that be surly frederic said may perhaps be out of humour why must be out of humour with only suggested to that might suit to live at belton instead of at farm of down in norfolk be very fond of plaistow fancy be reason why must be cross with envy taste be if ca understand that with name ought to live on family property belongs to be likely that anything can say will open eye upon subject truth be frederic have romantic notion about belton estate what romantic notion think must not be at whose then who doe think must have of course there can be nothing in know of course be nonsense what be idea who doe think must be owner mean that must be mine of course frederic be nonsense know that did not seem to be quite clear at moment that frederic have altogether made up mind upon subject a heard tidings from clara there came across face puzzled dubious look a though did not quite understand proposition have be suggested to a though consideration be wanted before must take idea home to digest so a to enable to express opinion upon there might be something in show of reason did not make clear to clara feminine mind have never known what be precise nature of father marriage settlement said then clara began to explain with exceeding eagerness that there be question a to accuracy of settlement legality of entail indeed there be question a to anything cousin will be romantic be end of of course quite a matter of course romance must lead to nothing have only mentioned subject now to show that cousin mind might possibly be disturbed when question of future residence be raised quite feel with said that will be much nicer that must live at old family place just at present speak about if be thinking of not claiming belton be quite thing said aylmer be without claiming said clara ah well will all be settled before long said aylmer be settled already said clara at seven three met again when dinner be on table there be little trouble a to helping of fish of two men must take lead on occasion clara decided question by asking cousin to make useful there can be little doubt captain aylmer must have distributed mutton chop with much more grace have carved roast fowl with much more skill suited clara will must have employment will did work captain aylmer throughout dinner endeavoured to be complaisant clara exerted to talk a though matter around be easy will too made effort now then speaking word restraining from snapping at rival restraint be in evident there be symptom throughout dinner that untamed man be longing to fly at throat of man be tamed be supposed that ought to go away for little while said clara a soon a have drank own glass of wine oh dear said captain will have cup of coffee be if mr belton like be same to said will wo have more wine clara asked more for said captain aylmer perhaps mr belton who want more wine said will then be silent be very hard upon clara after while coffee came even be felt to be comfort though there be pouring out to be done actual employment enacted still manoeuvring of cup created diversion if of like to smoke said sha mind in least of must smoke at what hour will get to aylmer park to morrow clara asked at past four said captain oh indeed so early a what be to say next will who have not touched coffee who be sitting stiffly at table a though be bound in duty not to move be becoming more more grim moment almost repented that have asked to remain with certainly there be comfort in company to to how long will remain in town will before go down to plaistow asked one day replied give kind love very kindest love to mary wish knew wish must think that might soon know will never know said belton tone of voice be actually savage a spoke so much so that aylmer turned in chair to look at clara did not dare to answer now that have be made to speak seemed that be determined to persevere how must ever know nothing will ever bring into norfolk nothing will ever take out of quite see why of assertion must be made nevertheless be true have ever meant to come to norfolk must have come now have not even asked to come having arranged with sister that in existing circumstance such asking must not be kindness yet rebuked now for not coming mother be very anxious that miss amedroz must pay visit at aylmer park said captain be going to aylmer park so mother anxiety need not disturb longer come will be out of temper with said clara be last night together who be so dear to other ought not to quarrel be not quarrelling with said can hardly suppose that mr belton want to quarrel with said captain aylmer smiling be sure doe not said clara belton sat silent with eye fixed upon table with dark frown upon brow did long to quarrel with captain aylmer be still anxious if might be possible to save from what knew must be transgression to use phrase common with down in yorkshire said aylmer must say that mr belton have got out of bed wrong side morning what d doe matter to sir what side got out of bed said will clenching fist oh if might only have be allowed to have round of five minute with aylmer must have be restored to good temper for night let subsequent result have be what might moved foot impatiently on floor a though be longing to kick something then pushed coffee cup away from upsetting content upon table knocking down wine glass be broken will will said clara looking at with imploring eye then must talk to about getting out of bed on wrong side did say anything to be unkind of will to quarrel with captain aylmer because be friend want to quarrel with rather a wo quarrel with because wish will go away ca do more than did want to dine with here there be cousin clara captain aylmer love better than world besides love seems to that there be nothing else in world for to love 'd give heart for minute have in world be hers oh love believe that be in to know what mean

suppose not said can forgive said captain aylmer d forgiveness said will belton then clara dropped hand started back door be shut will belton be gone cousin seems to be nice sort of young man said aylmer can not understand frederic pardon can pardon easily enough one doe like men who be given to threatening be not sort of man took to be upon word think be a nearly perfect a man can be then like men to swear at to swagger like bobadils to misbehave so that one have to blush for if servant chance to hear do really think that have conducted to day like gentleman know that be gentleman said clara must confess have reason for supposing to be so assurance hope be sufficient frederic captain aylmer did not answer at once sat for awhile silent considering what must say clara who understood mood knew that did not mean to drop subject resolved that must defend cousin let captain aylmer attack a must upon word hardly know what to say about said aylmer suppose then that say nothing more will not that be best clara can not now let matter pas by in way have asked whether think mr belton to be gentleman must say that doubt pray hear out before answer want to be harder upon than can help must have borne did bear from great deal in silence said that to can not allow to pas without notice have bad taste to speak to of regard for can not see what harm did by except to believe that be understood among gentleman one man never speaks to man about lady other man mean to marry unless be very intimate friend indeed what mean be that if mr belton have understood how gentleman live together must never have said anything to about affection for must at rate have supposed to be ignorant of there be something in very idea of doing so be in highest degree indelicate wonder clara that see think be indiscreet indiscreet indiscreet be not word for such conduct must say that a far a opinion go be ungentlemanlike believe that there be nobler minded gentleman in london than cousin will perhaps gratified to hear from assurance of love said captain aylmer if be wish to insult frederic will leave be wish to make understand that judgment have be wrong be simply matter of opinion a wish to argue with about have better go at rate be very tired good night frederic then told what arrangement have made for morrow at what hour must be called when must have breakfast after that let go

nothing further of gentleman woman be so good kind that whom love love almost more when commit offence because of offence so committed will belton have be guilty of great offence of offence for clara

aylmer park carriage have be sent to meet at station be drawn up at sir anthony aylmer door have made up mind that must not bow down to lady aylmer yet be afraid of woman a got out of carriage looked up expecting to see in hall lady aylmer be too accurately acquainted with weight measure of society for such movement a have son brought lady emily to house a future bride lady aylmer must probably have be in hall when arrival took place have clara possessed ten thousand pound of own must probably have be met at drawing room door a have money title a in fact brought with advantage of sort lady aylmer be found stitching bit of worsted a though have expected no one to come to belinda aylmer be stitching also by special order from mother reader will remember that lady aylmer be not without strong hope that engagement might even yet be broken off snubbing thought might probably be efficacious to purpose so clara be to be snubbed clara who have just promised to do best to gain lady aylmer opinion who desired to be in way true to promise though thoroughly believed that labour must be in vain put on pleasantest smile a entered room belinda under pressure of circumstance forgetting somewhat of mother injunction hurried to door to welcome stranger lady aylmer kept chair even maintained stitch till clara be half across room then got up with great mastery over voice made little speech be delighted to see miss amedroz said putting out hand of clara however felt more than finger quite delighted said belinda yielding fuller grasp then there be affectionate greeting between frederic mother frederic sister during clara stood by ill at ease captain aylmer said not word a to footing on future wife have come to father house did not ask mother to receive a daughter sister to take clara to heart a sister there have be no word spoken of recognised intimacy clara knew that aylmers be cold people have learned a much a from captain aylmer word to herself from own manner have

take bullock now be said by lady aylmer be skilfully arranged by to put stop to anything like enthusiasm on part of sir anthony clara amedroz have be invited to aylmer park be to be entertained there must not be expedient that must be made to think that anybody be particularly glad to see that family be at proud of proposed connection within five minute after be up in room have received from belinda tender of assistance a to lady maid mother daughter have be anxious to learn whether clara must bring own maid lady aylmer thinking that must do so have already blamed for extravagance of course fred will have to pay for journey rest of have said a soon a have perceived that clara have come without servant have perceived that young woman who travelled in way must be unfit to be mated with son clara whose intelligence in such matter be sharp enough assured belinda that wanted assistance dare say think very odd said really can dress when maid did come to unpack thing clara must have sent away at once have be able maid who be not young woman be obdurate oh miss lady must be pleased if please miss will do so thing be unpacked clara be told that dined at half past seven remained alone in room till dinner time although have not yet struck five when have gone up stair maid have brought cup of tea seated at fire turning over in mind different member of household in found must never do told over over again that must never come to pas that woman must be mother in law that other woman must be sister be manifest to that be distasteful to have not lost moment in assuring that be distasteful to what purpose must answer that must strive not to like for such strife be possible to appear to like whole place everything about be antipathetic to must not be simply honest to captain aylmer that must tell so at once go away then remembered that frederic have not spoken to single word since have be under father roof what sort of welcome must have be accorded to have chosen to go down to plaistow hall at half past seven made way by down stair in there be difficulty a remembered nothing of room below must not at first find servant man at last did come to in hall by be shown into drawing room here be alone for few minute a looked about thought that room have ever seen have le of comfort of habitation be not here that have met lady aylmer before dinner there have at rate be in other room work thing look of life life give to room here there be life furniture be in place everything be cold grand comfortless be making company of at aylmer park clara be intelligent in such matter understood thoroughly lady aylmer be first person to come to hope maid have be with said to clara muttered something intended for thanks will find richards very clever woman quite proper person at doubt that have be here good many year have perhaps little way of own mean to be obliging will give very little trouble lady aylmer be used to dress be afraid be not exactly true a to clara past habit must dress intended to do so in future in way justified assertion to herself have better let richards come to dear while be here said lady aylmer with slight smile on countenance outraged clara more even than word like to see young lady nicely dressed here to be told that be to be nicely dressed because be at aylmer park whole heart be already up in rebellion do best to please lady aylmer must be utterly impossible to to make attempt whatever in direction there be something in ladyship eye certain mixture of cunning power hardness in slight smile must gather round mouth by clara be revolted already understood much of lady aylmer in one thing be mistaken thought that saw simply natural woman did in truth see woman specially armed with intention of being disagreeable made up to give offence prepared to create dislike enmity at present moment nothing further be said a captain aylmer entered room mother immediately began to talk to in whisper two first day of clara sojourn at aylmer park passed by without occurrence of anything be remarkable that most surprised annoyed a regarded own position be coldness of people around a connected with actual fact of engagement sir anthony be very courteous to have never a yet once alluded to fact that be to become one of family a daughter in law lady aylmer called miss amedroz using name with peculiar emphasis a though determined to show that miss amedroz be to be miss amedroz a far a one at aylmer park be concerned treated almost a though presence in house be intrusive belinda be a cold a mother in mother presence when alone with clara must thaw little in difficulty studiously avoided calling new comer by name at a to captain aylmer be manifest to clara that be suffering almost more than suffered position be so painful that absolutely pitied for misery to be subjected by own mother still called other frederic clara be only sign of special friendship manifested between clara though pitied must not learn to despise have hitherto given credit at rate for will of own have believed to be man able to act in accordance with dictate of own conscience now perceived to be so subject to mother that did not dare to call heart own what be to be end of if there must only be one end must not be well that end must be reached at once so that might escape from purgatory on afternoon of third day there seemed to have come change over lady aylmer at lunch be especially civil civil to extent of picking out for clara with own fork breast of hashed fowl from dish be before did with considerable care may say with show of care then though did not absolutely call clara by christian name did call dear clara saw felt that usual placidity of afternoon must be broken by special event at three o'clock when carriage a usual came to door belinda be out of way clara be made to understand that lady aylmer be to be driven out without other companion belinda be little busy dear so if mind will go alone clara of course assented got into carriage with conviction now must hear fate be rather inclined to think that lady aylmer be about to tell that have failed in obtaining approbation of aylmer park that must be returned a good of description inferior to order given if such be case breast of chicken have doubt be administered a consolation clara have endeavoured since have be at aylmer park to investigate own feeling in reference to captain aylmer have failed knew that have failed wished to think that loved a must not endure thought of having accepted man whom did not love told that have done nothing to forfeit love woman who really love will hardly allow that love must be forfeited by fault true love breed forgiveness for fault after of what fault have captain aylmer be guilty have preached to out of mother mouth have be have first accepted then rejected then accepted again now must fain be firm if firmness be only possible to nevertheless if be told that be to be returned a inferior must hold up head under such disgrace a best might must not let tidings break heart dear said lady aylmer a soon a trotting horse rolling wheel made noise enough to prevent word from reaching servant on box want to say few word to think that will be good opportunity very good opportunity said clara of course dear be aware that have heard of something going on between son frederic now that lady aylmer have taught to call clara dear seemed that must hardly call so often enough of course know that captain aylmer have told of engagement for must not be here know how might be said lady aylmer at rate dear have told that since day of sister death there have be in point of fact sort of engagement think captain aylmer have spoken of in way in what way of course have not said word be not nice lover like sort of thing believe must have done anything in world that aunt have told a to lady aylmer said clara feeling that voice be almost trembling with anger be sure can not intend to be unkind to certainly not to insult insult dear must not use such strong word dear indeed must not nothing of kind be near thought if disapprove of marrying son tell so at once will know what to do depends dear depends on circumstance be just why want to speak to then tell circumstance though indeed think must have be better if must have be told to by captain aylmer there dear must allow to judge a mother of course be anxious for son now frederic be poor man considering kind of society in have to live position must maintain a member of parliament be very poor man be argument clara certainly have not expected that of aylmer family must condescend to use have always regarded captain aylmer a rich man since have inherited mr winterfield property knowing previously to that have be able to live in london a rich men usually do live be said may seem odd to lady aylmer think that word have ever passed between son a to amount of income not odd at dear young lady be always thoughtless about thing when be looking to be married think that money will come out of sky if mean have be looking to be married well expecting suppose have be expecting then paused a clara said nothing went on of course frederic have got sister moiety of perivale property about eight hundred year something of sort when deduction be made will have other moiety when die if can be satisfied to wait for event may not perhaps be very long then there be pause indicative of melancholy natural to suggestion during clara looked at lady aylmer made up mind that ladyship must live for next twenty five year at least if can wait for continued may be very well though will be poor people in frederic rank of life will be able to live will be so far fortunate said clara will have to wait said lady aylmer turning upon companion almost fiercely be certainly will have to do so if be to depend upon frederic income alone have nothing of own a know absolutely nothing doe not seem to be quite so clear said lady aylmer speaking now very cautiously rather with purpose of great caution think that be quite so clear frederic have be telling that there seems to be sort of doubt about settlement of belton estate there be sort of doubt whatsoever shadow of doubt be quite mistaken be in such hurry dear be not likely that must be very good lawyer lady aylmer must be in hurry lest there must be mistake about there be question here for lawyer frederic must have be misled by word two said to with quite purpose everybody concerned know that belton estate go to cousin will poor father be quite aware of be very well pray remember dear that need not attack in way be endeavouring if possible to arrange accomplishment of own wish seems that mr belton doe not claim property there be question of claiming because be man more generous than other person in world romantically generous have offered to give property be father for lifetime suppose that must wish captain aylmer must wish must accept offer a there be tone in voice a said glance in eye a turned face full upon companion almost prevailed against lady aylmer force of character really know dear said lady aylmer be so violent certainly be eager about consideration on earth must induce to take cousin property from always seemed to that entail be most unfair proceeding what must signify even if be be not papa got certain advantage on condition what can matter belongs to will belton then there be pause clara thought that subject be over between lady aylmer have not a yet completed purpose will tell dear what think ought to do certainly lady aylmer if wish can at rate tell what must become young lady to do under such circumstance suppose will give credit for knowing a much a young lady placed a be must be recommended by friend if have friend able fit to give advice to put whole matter into hand of natural friend lawyer together hear out dear if please at least can do for a be taking great deal of trouble on behalf must let frederic see mr green understand mr green be father lawyer then mr green can see mr belton so matter can be arranged seems to from what hear that in way in way only something can be done a to proposed marriage in other way can anything be done then lady aylmer have finished argument throwing back into carriage seemed to intimate that desired reply have believed did believe that guest be so intent upon marrying son that struggle must be regarded a too great for achievement of object such belief be natural on part mother always so think of girl engaged to son so think especially when girl be penniless son be well to do in world such belief though be natural be sometimes wrong be altogether wrong in instance then said clara speaking very plainly nothing can be done very well dear after there be not word said between till carriage be once more within park then lady aylmer spoke again presume see dear that under circumstance thought of marriage between son must be quite out of question at rate for great many year will speak to captain aylmer about lady aylmer very well dear so do of course be own master be son a well can not see sacrificed without effort to save when clara came down to dinner on day be again miss amedroz must perceive from belinda manner quite a plainly a from that of ladyship that be to have more tit bit of hashed chicken specially picked out for by lady aylmer own fork that evening two next day passed just a have passed two first day everything be dull cold uncomfortable twice have walked out with frederic on occasion have thought that must refer to what mother have said did not venture to touch upon subject clara more than once thought that must do so when moment came found that be impossible must not bring to say anything must have appearance of desire on part to hurry on marriage must not say to if be too poor to be married even if mean to put forward pretence say so at once still called clara still asked to walk with still talked when be alone together in distant cold way of event of future combined life must live at perivale must be necessary to refurnish house must keep of land on own hand be interesting subject of discussion between engaged man girl to whom be engaged man if wish to make thoroughly pleasant to lady must throw something of urgency of determined immediate purpose into discussion something must be said a to actual destination of room day must be fixed for choosing furnishing gentleman must declare that will at once buy cow for farm with frederic aylmer discussion seemed to point to cold distant future to clara might look forward a did to joy of heaven will belton must have bought ring long since bespoken priest arranged detail of honeymoon tour very probably must have stood looking into cradle shop with longing eye at last there came absolute necessity for plain speaking captain aylmer declared intention of returning to london that might resume parliamentary duty have purposed to remain till after easter be found to be impossible find must go up to morrow said at breakfast be going to make stand about poor rate must be in house in evening clara felt to be very cold uncomfortable a thing be at present arranged be to be left at aylmer park without friend how long be to remain there definite ending have be proposed for visit something must be said something settled

woman in world be sure be bound to say so have temper know think ought to give way to altogether there be carriage wo do good if be found together talking over will then baronet hobbled off lady aylmer when entered room found clara sitting alone whether be that wife be clever enough to extract from husband something of conversation have passed between clara whether have other source of information whether conduct might proceed from other ground need not inquire from afternoon lady aylmer manner word to clara became much le courteous than have be before must always speak a though great iniquity be being committed went about house with portentous frown a though terrible measure must soon be taken with object of putting end to present extremely improper state of thing be so manifest to clara that said to sir anthony one day that must no longer bear look of lady aylmer displeasure that must be forced to leave aylmer park before frederic return unless evil be mitigated have by time told sir anthony that much doubted whether marriage must be possible that really believed that must be best for party that idea must be abandoned sir anthony when heard must only shake head hobble away trouble be too deep for to cure clara still held on now there wanted two day to captain aylmer return when suddenly there arose terrible storm at aylmer park then came direct positive quarrel between lady aylmer clara quarrel direct positive on part of lady very violent nothing have hitherto be said at aylmer park about mr askerton nothing be since clara arrival clara have be thankful for silence letter captain aylmer have written to about mr askerton will perhaps be remembered clara answer to letter aylmer park opinion a to poor woman a to clara future conduct towards poor woman have be expressed very strongly clara have a strongly resolved that must not be guided by aylmer park opinion in matter have anticipated much be disagreeable on subject have therefore congratulated not little on absence of allusion to lady aylmer have in truth kept mr askerton in reserve a battery to be used against miss amedroz if other mode of attack must fail a weapon must be powerful when other weapon have be powerless for awhile have thought possible that clara might be owner of belton estate then have be worth careful mother while to be prepared to accept daughter in law so dowered have seen how question of such ownership have enabled to put forward plea of poverty have used on son behalf since frederic have declared intention of marrying young woman in spite of poverty clara seemed to be equally determined have be fool enough to speak word be determined to keep to said lady aylmer to daughter therefore askerton battery be brought to bear not altogether unsuccessfully three lady be sitting together in drawing room have be a mute a fish for hour in sitting be generally very silent speaking only in short little sentence will drive with to day miss amedroz not to day think lady aylmer a be reading perhaps wo mind leaving pray put to inconvenience for miss aylmer such such like be conversation on sudden after full half hour positive silence lady aylmer asked question altogether of kind think miss amedroz son wrote to about certain mr askerton clara put down work sat for moment almost astonished be not only that lady aylmer have asked so very disagreeable question that have asked with so peculiar voice voice a be command in manner be evidently intended to be taken a serious with look of authority in eye a though be resolved that battery of hers must knock enemy absolutely in dust belinda gave little spring in chair looked intently at work went on stitching faster than before yes did said clara finding that answer be imperatively demanded from be quite necessary that must write believe to be undoubted fact that mr askerton be be be not at what ought to be of be what ought to be said clara miss amedroz on subject be not at inclined to joke be not true that mr askerton must excuse lady aylmer what know of mr askerton know altogether in confidence so can not speak to of past life miss amedroz pray excuse if say must speak of when remember position in do honour of being visitor here how can help speaking of belinda be stitching very hard must not even raise eye clara who still held needle in hand resumed work for moment two made further answer lady aylmer have by mean completed task miss amedroz said must allow to judge for in matter subject be one on feel obliged to speak to have got nothing to say about have believe admitted truth of allegation made by a to woman clara be becoming very angry red spot showed on cheek frown settled upon brow did not a yet know what must say how must conduct be striving to consider how best might assert own independence be fully determined that in matter must not bend inch to lady aylmer believe may take that a admitted said ladyship be not aware have admitted anything to lady aylmer said anything can justify in questioning on subject justify in questioning young woman who tell that be to be future daughter in law have not told so have never told anything of kind then on what footing miss amedroz do do honour of being with here at aylmer park on very foolish footing on foolish footing what doe that mean mean have be foolish in coming to house in be subjected to such questioning belinda did ever hear anything like miss amedroz must persevere however much may dislike story of woman life whether be mr askerton not know be mr askerton said clara a to profess to know dare say that be wiser than what have be do know here lady aylmer raised voice continued to speak with eloquence assumed indignation must give what have be do know ask a duty owe to son whether have put end to acquaintance with so very disreputable person person whom even to have known be disgrace know stop one minute if please question be have put end to acquaintance be ready to give promise that will never be resumed have not put end to acquaintance rather that affectionate friendship a must call be ready to promise that will be maintained with heart belinda do hear yes mamma belinda slowly shook head be now bowed lower than ever over lap be resolution yes lady aylmer be resolution think that becoming to a young woman just so think that becoming to a young woman then let tell miss amedroz differ from altogether altogether lady aylmer a repeated last word raised folded hand a though be calling upon heaven to witness how thoroughly differed from young woman see how be to help lady aylmer dare say may differ on many subject dare say do dare say do need not point out to how very little must be matter of regret to for hold have upon unfortunate son hold upon lady aylmer how dare insult by such language hereupon belinda again jumped in chair lady aylmer looked a though enjoyed storm undoubtedly have hold upon miss amedroz think that be great misfortune of course when hears what conduct be with reference to person will release from entanglement can release from entanglement whenever chooses said clara rising from chair indeed be released will let captain aylmer know engagement must be at end unless will promise that will never in future be subjected to unwarrantable insolence of mother then walked off to door not regarding indeed not hearing parting shot be fired at now what be to be done clara went up to own room making strong even comfortable with inward assurance that nothing must ever induce even to sit down to table again with lady aylmer must not willingly enter same room with lady aylmer have speech with what must at once do must not very well leave aylmer park without settling whither must go must in way manage to leave house on afternoon almost resolved that must go to mr askerton everything be of course over between captain aylmer therefore there be longer hindrance to doing so on score what must be cousin will wish now be only friend to whom must trust for good council what must be advice must write ask must not do that must not bring to write to telling that aylmer entanglement be at end be to do so with temperament must take such letter a meaning much more than be intended to mean must write letter to captain aylmer thought that must do at once began got a far a dear captain aylmer then found that letter be one must not be written very easily remembered a greatness of difficulty of writing letter became plain to that must not now be sent so a to reach captain aylmer before must leave london if written at must be addressed to at aylmer park task might be done to morrow a well a to day so task be given up for present did write letter to mr askerton letter must send not on morrow according to state of mind a might then be in declared purpose of leaving aylmer park on day after captain aylmer arrival asked to be taken in at cottage answer be to be sent to addressed to great northern railway hotel richards maid came up to before dinner with offer of assistance for dressing offer made in tone left doubt on clara mind that richards knew about quarrel clara declined to be dressed sent down message saying that must remain in room begging to be supplied with tea must not even condescend to say that be troubled with headache then belinda came up to just before dinner be announced with fluttered gravity advised miss amedroz to come down stair mamma think will be much better that must show let final result be what may have not slightest desire to show there be servant know miss aylmer care straw for servant really not straw papa will feel so will be sorry if sir anthony be annoyed can not help have not be doing mamma say that brother must of course wish after what mother

will permit till morning after captain aylmer arrival then will go where to miss amedroz have already written to friend asking to receive miss aylmer paused moment before asked next question did ask showing by tone manner that have be driven to summon up courage to enable to do so to what friend miss amedroz mamma will be glad to know be question lady aylmer can have right to ask said clara oh very well of course if like to tell there be more to be said like to tell miss aylmer clara have tea in room that evening lived there whole of next day family down stair be not comfortable sir anthony must not be made to understand why guest kept room be not odd a lady aylmer be very sparing in information gave belinda found to be impossible to sit at table to say few word to father mother without

with message from must miss amedroz see miss amedroz must see made condition of doing so that must not be required to meet lady aylmer need not be afraid said lady aylmer unless sends full apology with promise that will have further intercourse with woman will never willingly see again meeting be therefore arranged between captain aylmer miss amedroz in sitting room up stair what be clara said captain aylmer at once simply that mother have insulted most wantonly say that be who have be uncourteous to be so can of course believe whichever please be desirable doubt that must prefer to believe mother wish there to be quarrel there be quarrel captain aylmer must leave father house can not stay here after what have taken place mother told can not tell what told made against just accusation knew must be hardest for to bear be sure have mistaken have not mistaken where do propose to go to mr askerton oh clara have written to mr askerton to ask to receive for awhile indeed may almost say that have other choice if go there clara there will be end to everything there must be end of what call everything captain aylmer said smiling can not be for good to bring into family wife of whom mother must think so badly a think of there be great deal said captain aylmer walked very often up down room endeavouring to make arrangement might seem in sort to appease mother must clara only allow telegram to be sent to mr askerton to explain that have changed mind clara must allow such telegram to be sent on evening packed up thing captain aylmer saw again again sending belinda backwards forward making different appointment up to midnight be to purpose on next morning took departure alone in aylmer park carriage for railway station captain aylmer have proposed to go with have so stoutly declined company that be obliged to abandon intention saw of lady on morning sir anthony came out to say word of farewell to in hall be very sorry for said be pity said clara can not be helped good bye sir anthony hope may meet again under pleasanter circumstance said baronet to clara made reply be then handed into carriage by captain aylmer be so bewildered said can not now say anything

xxvii once more back to belton when carriage be driven away sir anthony captain aylmer be left standing alone at hall door of house servant have slunk off father son looking at other felt that also

house during last few day be afraid thing be not going quite comfortable said seems to sir said son that thing very seldom do go quite comfortable fred what be about mother say that miss amedroz be behaving very badly miss amedroz say that mother be behaving very badly of course be only natural what do say say nothing sir le said soonest mended be very well seems to that in position must say something long short of be be to be wife upon word sir know be still standing out under portico a sir anthony did not for minute two ask further question captain aylmer turned a though be going into house father have still word two to say stop moment fred often trouble with advice be sure be always glad to hear when offer know very well that in most thing opinion be better than mine have have advantage never have have have more experience than dear boy stand to reason that in thing must have have more experience than there be tone of melancholy in father voice a said quite touched son brought two closer together out in porch take word for continued sir anthony that be much better off a be than must be with wife do mean to say that man must marry mean to say that eldest son ought to marry so that property may have heir poor men must marry suppose a want wife to do for sometimes doubt man must marry when have got to be very fond of girl have compromised kind of thing must never advise man to sully honour a sir anthony said raised little with two stick spoke out in bolder voice voice however sank again a descended from realm of honour to of prudence none of case be yours fred to be sure will have perivale property be not family estate will be much better off by turning into money in way of comfort can be great deal more comfortable without wife than can with one do want wife for then a to miss amedroz for must say that like uncommonly have be very pleasant in way with somehow think be so much in love with what can do without hereupon paused looked son full in face fred have also be thinking of matter in own way asking same question whether be in truth so much in love with clara that must not live without of course know continued sir anthony what have taken place just now between what between mother suppose whole thing might fall through without further trouble to without anything unhandsome on part captain aylmer still said nothing whole thing might doubt fall through wished to be neither unjust ungenerous specially wished to avoid anything unhandsome after further pause of few minute sir anthony went on again pouring forth word of experience of course marriage be very well married rather early in life have always found mother to be most excellent woman better woman doe breathe be a sure of a be of anything god bless of course can see ca call anything own be tied down here ca move have never got shilling to spend while lazy hound about place be eating up there be clerk with hundred year in london be better off than be a regard ready money what comfort have in big house end of garden place like what pleasure do get out of come of marrying keeping up one name in county respectably what do care for county d county often wish that 'd be younger son a be captain aylmer have answer to make to be doubt fact that age good living have made sir anthony altogether incapable of enjoying kind of life desiderated that must probably have eaten drunk into grave long since have that kind of life be within reach however son must not explain to father in fitting a endeavoured to do father word to own case captain aylmer did perceive that bachelor life might perhaps be most suitable to own peculiar case only must hing unhandsome a to that be quite resolved of course clara must show to be in degree amenable to reason to ordinary rule of world be aware that mother be hot tempered generously made up mind that must give miss amedroz even yet chance at hotel in london clara found short note from mr askerton in be warmly assured that everything must be done to make comfortable at cottage a long a must wish to stay there very warmth of affection thus expressed made almost shrink from what be about to do mr askerton be doubt anxious for coming must cousin will belton approve of visit what must cousin mary say about if be being driven into step against own approval by insolence of lady aylmer if be doing thing simply because lady aylmer have desired not to do be doing in opposition to wish of man have promised to marry a well a to own judgment there must not be cause for shrinking yet believed that be right if must only have have one to tell one in whom must trust implicitly to direct have hitherto be very much prone to rebel against authority against aunt have rebelled against father against lover now wished with heart that there might be one to whom must submit with perfect faith if must only know what cousin will must think in thought must have trusted with perfect faith if only must have be brother to be too late now for doubting on next day found getting out of old redicote fly at colonel askerton door came out to meet greeting be very friendly hitherto there have be no great intimacy between owing rather to manner of life adopted by than to cause of mutual dislike between mr askerton have shown desirous of social intercourse since have be at belton with colonel askerton there have be nothing of have come

room clara be almost surprised to find how completely be at home on next day mr askerton together went up to house roamed through room clara seated in accustomed chair on sofa just in spot to belton have thrown found key of cellar took up in hand thinking that must give to servant again put back upon sofa be key have left there if ever there came occasion must remind where have put then went out

a sacred a cow that ever be worshipped among cow worshipper said mr askerton suppose milk sell butter otherwise be not regarded a ordinary cow at poor bessy said clara wish have never come here what be to be done with done with will stay here till dy natural death then romantic pair of mourner will follow to grave mixing sympathetic tear comfortably a talk of old day in future year bessy will grow to be divinity of past never to be mentioned without tenderest reminiscence have not slightest difficulty in prophesying a to bessy future life posthumous honour roamed about place whole morning through garden round farm building in out of house at turn something be said about will belton clara must not go up to rock although mr askerton more than once attempted to turn in direction have said that never must go there again except under certain circumstance knew that circumstance must never come to pas yet must go there must never go there till cousin be married then if in day must ever be present at belton castle must creep up to spot alone allow to think of old day on following morning there came to letter bearing downham post mark at first glance knew that be not from cousin will will wrote with bold round hand be extremely plain caligraphic when allowed time for work in hand a did with commencement of epistle must become confused altogether anti caligraphic when fell into hurry towards end of performance a be wont address of letter be written in pretty small female hand very careful in perfection of letter very neat in stroke be from mary belton between whom clara there have never hitherto be occasion for correspondence letter be a follows plaistow hall april dear cousin clara william have heard from friend at belton who be tenant on estate a to whom there seems to be question whether be to remain have written saying believe that there need be difficulty if wish to stay there learn also from mr askerton letter that be expected at cottage therefore will address to belton supposing that may find there have never yet known other have be grief to grief hope may be cured day before long a know be poor creature can not go about world to see friend a other people do at least not very well therefore write to with object of asking to come see here be interesting old house in way though must not conceal from that life here be very very quiet must do best to make day pas pleasantly with have heard that be gone to aylmer park indeed william told of taking up to london now seems have left yorkshire suppose will not return there very soon if be so will not be well that must come to for short time william feel just for present for little time must perhaps prefer to be alone with must go to london for awhile then on to belton to settle affair intends to be absent for six week if must not be afraid of dullness of house for so long time pray come to pleasure to must be very great hope that have of feeling with be so strong that ought not to be longer personally stranger to other must then make up mind a to what must choose to do afterwards think that by end of time be when william return uncle aunt from sleaford will be with be clergyman know if then like to remain will be delighted to make acquaintance seems to be long journey for young lady to make alone from belton to plaistow travelling be so easy now day young lady seem to be so independent that may be able to manage hoping to see soon remain affectionate cousin mary belton letter received before breakfast be therefore able to read in solitude to keep receipt from knowledge of mr askerton if must be so minded understood at once that intended to convey hint plaistow hall must be better resting place for than mr askerton cottage assurance that if must go to plaistow hall for convenience advantage must be taken of presence there by owner of house for convenience a sat thinking of offer have be made to fancied that must see hear cousin will a discussed matter with sister with half assumption of surliness declared own intention of going away captain aylmer after interview in london have spoken of belton conduct a being unpardonable clara have not only pardoned have in own mind pronounced virtue to be so much greater than vice a to make almost perfect will not drive out of own house said what doe matter where go colonel askerton have have letter from cousin said mr askerton a soon a two lady be alone together what doe say not word about so much better have given trouble enough be glad to think that must be free of for awhile be colonel askerton to stay at cottage now clara be hypocrite know that be hypocrite very likely know why must accuse just now yes do have not heard from norfolk also yes have be sure of knew must never have written in way in answer to letter ignoring visit here altogether unless have written to also have not written to letter be from sister there be whereupon handed letter to mr askerton waited patiently while be being read friend returned to without word clara be first to speak again be nice letter be not never saw know so say be not kind letter suppose be meant for kindness be not very complimentary to presumes that one a may be treated without slightest consideration so may be only fit must be so treated if ask advice advise to go at once at once have not asked advice dear do intend to ask must not have shown if have not intended to go how unreasonable be told just now be hypocrite for not telling of letter now be angry with because have shown be not angry think have be quite right to show know how else must have acted upon mean to act upon will not go to plaistow there be two reason against sufficient will not leave just yet unless send away will not cause cousin to be turned out of own house why must be turned out why must not go to love a for be more in love than man ever knew go to plaistow hall everything will run smooth dear will not do that then be foolish be bound to tell so a have inveigled here thought have invited asked to come when asked knew be wrong though meant to be kind knew be unkind saw that husband disapproved though have not heart to tell so wish have wish have mr askerton can not tell how much wrong how wrong also be more than contented to be here must not be contented to be here be just that in learning to love rather perhaps to pity lower do think that see know of course be bad to be alone have right not to be alone there be nothing for clara to do to draw once again close to poor woman to embrace with protestation of fair honest equal regard friendship

such circumstance entail in be cruelty operation of on poor brother death be additionally cruel be cruel that one must be poor argued clara doe not take away right of rich man to property there be much more of sort said between till clara be at rate convinced that colonel askerton believed that ought to be owner of property then at last ventured upon argument soon drove clara out of room there

allowance out of coming to from brotherly love of cousin moderate stipend sufficient for livelihood thought must accept from seemed to that be destiny to be dependent on charity to eat bread given to from benevolence of friend thought that must endure benevolence better than of other benevolence from aylmer park from perivale must be altogether unendurable why must not be a colonel askerton have proposed that cousin of hers loved with heart with constancy for have at first given credit be well aware a regarded loved better than world beside have at last become conscious that must not now marry captain aylmer without sin without false vow fatal injury to herself to prospect of marriage a future fate end must be put at rate end if have already taken place be not to be regarded a end enough yet have be engaged to captain aylmer be engaged to even now when last cousin have mentioned to captain aylmer name have declared that loved still how then must turn round now so soon accept love of man how must bring to let cousin assume to place of lover when be other day that have rebuked for expressing faintest hope in direction yet yet a for going to plaistow be quite out of question so be to be heiress after said mr askerton to night in bedroom be not to be heiress after said clara rising against friend impetuously will have to be lady of belton in one way other at rate said mr askerton chapter xxviii miss amedroz be pursued suppose now dear may be considered that everything be settled about young lady said lady aylmer to son on same day that miss amedroz left aylmer park nothing be settled ma'be said captain mean to tell that after what have passed intend to follow up further will certainly endeavour to see again then frederic must tell that be very wrong indeed almost worse than wrong must say wicked only feel sure that will think better of can not mean to tell that must marry after what have taken place question be whether must marry be nonsense frederic wonder that who be generally so clear sighted can not see more plainly than be scheming artful young woman who be playing regular game to catch husband if be so must have be more humble to ma'be not bit fred be just have be cleverness tried that on at first found that must not get round allow to be deceived by pray then there be knowing how may be bound up with horrid people so that can not throw over even if must think understand ma'be oh very well understand have better understand too that will never again enter house of be mistress can ever enter house in be received if choose to make wife after have done lady aylmer have not done nearly done need hear more of threat entreaty son left aylmer park immediately after easter sunday a went mother nodding head declared to daughter that marriage must never come off let clara amedroz be ever so sly ever so clever think of what have said to fred said sir anthony a took leave of son yes sir will ca be better off than be ca indeed with word in ear captain aylmer started for london intending to follow clara down to belton hardly knew own mind on matter of purposed marriage be almost inclined to agree with father that be very well off a be be almost inclined to agree with mother in condemnation of clara conduct be almost inclined to think that have done enough towards keeping promise made to aunt on deathbed still be not quite contented with desired to be honest true a far a idea went of honesty truth conscience told that clara have be treated with cruelty by mother be inclined to think that lady aylmer in spite of high experience character for wisdom have not fought battle altogether well man like to be talked out of marriage by mother especially not so when talking take shape of threat when told that under circumstance must again know clara amedroz be driven by spirit of manhood to declare to that menace from must not have slightest influence on word two father said be more effective after might be better for in peculiar position to have wife at did begin to believe that have need for wife have never before thought so much of father example a did now clara be manifestly hot tempered woman very hot tempered woman indeed now mother be also hot tempered woman must see result in present condition of father life resolved that must follow clara to belton so final settlement might be made between in coming to resolution acknowledged to must decide against must not break heart however must have chance undoubtedly be only right that must have chance difficulty of circumstance in be placed be so great that be almost impossible for to make up mind fixedly to purpose in reference to clara a passed through london on way to belton called at mr green chamber with reference to sum of fifteen hundred pound be now absolutely necessary that must make over to miss amedroz from mr green learned that william belton have given positive instruction a to destination of belton estate must not inherit have anything to do with under entail from effect of desired to be made entirely free mr green who knew that captain aylmer be engaged to marry client who knew nothing of interruption to agreement felt hesitation in explaining to captain aylmer suppose have heard of before said mr green captain aylmer certainly have heard of have be very much struck by idea up to moment have not quite believed in coming simply from william belton to clara amedroz such offer might be no more than strong argument used in love making take back property take with of course captain aylmer thought might have be correct translation of mr william belton romance be forced to look at matter differently when found that have be put into lawyer hand yes said have heard of mr belton mentioned to be not strictly true clara have mentioned to belton have come into room immediately afterwards captain aylmer might probably have be mistaken be quite in earnest said mr green of course can say nothing mr green a be so nearly interested in matter be great question doubt how far such entail a must be allowed to operate think must stand a matter of course think belton be wrong said mr green of course can give opinion said other will tell what can do captain aylmer can suggest to miss amedroz that there must be compromise let divide be client of mine in way will do duty to let divide have money enough to buy up other moiety in way must still be belton of belton captain aylmer have not slightest objection to plan indeed regarded a in respect wise salutary arrangement moiety of belton estate might probably be worth twenty five thousand pound addition of such sum a to existing mean must make difference in world a to expediency of marriage father argument must fall to ground if twenty five thousand pound be to be obtained in way have little doubt that change in affair must go far to mitigate mother wrath be by mean mercenary in view so at least assured clara must have chance with without belton estate with without half of be by mean mercenary have not made offer to repeated almost with obstinacy when have prospect of fortune must always remember that of at least remembering that now must take delight in bright money prospect without having to accuse in slightest degree of mercenary motif fortune be godsend must take with clean hand if only must ultimately be able to take lady who possessed fortune from london wrote to clara telling that proposed to visit at belton letter be written before have seen mr green be not very fervent in expression nevertheless be fair letter written with intention of giving fair chance have seen with great sorrow with heartfelt grief quarrel between mother own clara thinking a felt obliged to think about mr askerton must not feel that mother have cause for anger be unprejudiced be ready anxious also word anxious be underscored to carry out engagement few word between might probably set everything right therefore proposed to meet at belton castle house at hour on such day must run down to perivale on journey perhaps clara must let have line addressed to there such be letter what do think of said clara showing to mr askerton on afternoon of day on have received what do think of said mr askerton can only hope that will not come within reach of hand be not angry with for showing to why must be angry with of course knew without

letter to mr askerton have made such promise a mind have be quite made up certainly will not talk over said to herself a walked across park must not see way so clearly out of further difficulty with regard to cousin might be that must be able to rid herself of one lover with comparative ease must not bring to entertain idea of accepting other be true that man longed for desired to call own with wearing anxious painful desire made heart grievously heavy heavy a though with lead hanging to string be true that clara knew that be so be true also that spirit have mastered spirit that persistence have conquered resistance resistance be of feeling there remained with feminine shame made seem to to be impossible that must now reject captain aylmer a consequence of rejection accept will belton

resolute in desire to follow up to hold by engagement be not employed now in giving chance a have proposed to to do be using what eloquence have to obtain chance for lady aylmer have almost made believe that clara must be suppliant now be suppliant in anxiety to keep be willing even to pas over terrible iniquity in regard to mr askerton that great sin have led to trouble have once written to about mr askerton using very strong language threatening with mother full displeasure at time mr askerton have simply be friend there have be question then of taking refuge under woman roof now have repelled lady aylmer counsel with scorn be living a guest in mr askerton house yet be willing to pas over askerton difficulty without word be willing not only to condone past offence to wink at existing iniquity who be sinner must not permit of dragged up mr askerton name seemed to glory in own shame have not intended said to speak of friend only mention to show how impossible be that must ever agree upon subject a to husband wife must always be of one mind knew from moment in got letter only be coward must have said so then mean to quarrel with altogether why must quarrel why indeed said wish to be settled quite settled a from nature of thing must be that there will be attempt at renewal of engagement after what have passed how must enter mother house need not enter now in emergency be willing to give up anything everything have be prepared to talk over into reconciliation with mother to admit that there have be fault on side to come down from high pedestal discus matter a though clara mother stood upon same footing having recognised spirit of lady love have told that so much indignity a must be endured now have be carried so far beyond that be willing in sudden vehemence of love to throw mother over altogether to accede to term clara might propose to of course must wish to be friend said using now tone of suppliant if found that must not be so do think must divide from mother there need be question a to ah there be wrong there must be such question must have thought of sooner clara be more to than mother ten time more a said came up knelt down beside be everything to will not throw over be suppliant indeed such supplication be very potent with woman men succeed often by simple earnestness of prayer woman can not refuse to give be asked for with so much of vehemence of true desire clara have promised to be wife have twice promised can have right to go back because be displeased with what mother may have said be not responsible for mother clara say that will be wife a spoke strove to take hand voice sounded a though there be in truth something of passion in heart chapter xxix there be nothing to tell captain aylmer have never before knelt to clara amedroz such kneeling on part of lover used to be fashion because lover in day held in higher value than do now that asked lady to give because pretended to do so form at least of supplication be used whereas in wiser day augustus simply suggests to caroline that two might a well make fool of together so thing be settled without need of much prayer captain aylmer engagement have be originally made somewhat after fashion have not indeed spoken of thing contemplated a folly not being man given to little waggery of nature have be calm unenthusiastic reasonable have not attempted to evince passion must have be quite content that clara must believe that married a much from obedience to aunt a from love for herself have not found that clara must not take at under conviction though have declined to come to after fashion though something more than have be needed still have be won easily therefore lightly prized fear that be so with everything that value with horse house wine above with woman where be man who have heart soul big enough to love woman with increased force of passion because have at once recognised in that have desired captain aylmer having won spur easily have taken care in buckling now found to surprise that be like to lose have told that must only be too glad to shuffle foot free of bondage now that be going from began to find that be very necessary for road that be to travel clara said kneeling by side be more to than mother ten time more be new to hitherto though have never desired that must assume such attitude a have constantly be unconsciously wounded by coldness by cold propriety unbending possession cold propriety unbending possession be gone now be there at foot such argument used at aylmer park must have conquered must have won at once in spite of herself now be minded to be resolute have sworn to herself that must not peril by joining to man with whom have so little sympathy who apparently have none with in what way be to answer prayer a be now made to man who addressed be entitled to use warmth of accepted lover only asked for have already be given to captain aylmer began why be to be captain aylmer what have done that must use in way be not who who made unhappy at aylmer park will not go back to that be of use pray get up shock to see in way tell then that be once more right between say that will be happier than ever be before yes than ever be before know how much love now how sore must be to lose have be wrong have not thought enough of will think of now found that task before be very difficult so difficult that almost broke down in performing must have be so easy for moment so pleasant to have yielded have hand upon arm having attempted to take hand in preventing that have succeeded must not altogether make free from without rising for moment have paused paused a though be about to yield for moment a looked into eye have thought that must again be victorious perhaps there be something in glance too visible return of triumph to eye warned of danger said getting up walking away from what doe ' mean clara then also rose stood leaning on table doe mean that will be forsworn mean will not come between mother will not be taken into family in be scorned will not go to aylmer park be mean of preventing from going there there need be question of aylmer park there will be none so much being allowed will be wife captain aylmer can not be wife press further must know that on subject must think much before answered have thought much know be right promised word be to go for nothing if will comfort to say so may say if perceive that mistake made between have be a much mistake a mine have injured more than have injured will not remind of will never remind of after there have be mistake there will be injury ah captain aylmer understand can not understand must not for world reproach do think suffered nothing from mother must pay for sin there will be paying punishment reproach there will be none at least from think that speak in anger in pride will not marry into lady aylmer family be too bad too bad after be past be too bad what can say must advise to do must make wretched must not make wretched must make happy must satisfy altogether can not be captain aylmer can not be when speak to in way will not let be final paused moment before spoke again then turned sharp upon tell clara do love have ever loved did not answer stood there listening quietly to accusation have never loved yet have allowed to say that did be not that true still did not answer ask whether be not true though asked paused for answer looking while full into face yet did not speak now suppose will become cousin wife said will suit to change to say that love then at last spoke did not think that must have treated in way captain aylmer did not expect that must insult have not insulted manner to make task easier than must have hoped to be asked whether ever loved once thought that did so so thinking told without reserve feeling when came to find have be mistaken conceived bound by engagement to rectify own error a best must resolved wrongly a now think very wrongly must learn a wife to love then came circumstance showed that release must be good for of justified in accepting girl must be bound by engagement to man who looked on saw treated in own home by own mother a saw treated at aylmer park claim to be released know that release be a good for a be for be best judge of for at rate will judge for have decided now have answered question asked a to love for to other question have thought fit to put to about cousin refuse to give answer whatsoever then having said so much walked out of room closing door behind left standing there alone need not follow a went up almost mechanically into own room room used to be own then shut in waiting till must be assured first by sound in house then by silence that be gone that fell away greatly from majesty of demeanour when be thus alone descended to ordinary way of troubled female may be quite sure to there be further difficulty work for day be done in due time must take to cottage must be well at rate comfortable with what be to do how be to get out of house take back to london while have be in pursuit of when be leaving vehicle at public house in village of belton like other invading general have failed to provide adequately for retreat when be alone took turn two about room half thinking that clara must return to must hardly leave alone in strange house who a have twice told have come way from yorkshire to see did not return gradually came to understand that must provide for own retreat without assistance be hardly aware even now how greatly have transcended usual mode of speech action in energy of supplication in violence of rebuke have be lifted for awhile out of by excitement of position now that be subsiding into quiescence be unconscious that have almost mounted into passion that have spoken of love very nearly with eloquence did recognise a fact that clara be not to be wife that have better get back from belton to london a quickly a possible must be well for to teach to look back on result of aunt dying request a episode in life satisfactorily concluded mother have undoubtedly be right clara must now see must have led devil of life even have come to possessed of moiety of property supposition a to have very strong doubt still might have be dear at money real feeling said to a walked about room none then so deficient in delicacy still be discontented because have be rejected therefore tried to make believe that must still have if chose to persevere said a continued to pace room have done everything more than everything that honour demand will not ask again be own fault be imperious woman mother read character aright did not occur to a thus consoled for what have lost that mother accusation against clara have be altogether of different nature when console by own argument be not apt to examine accuracy with much strictness whether be consoled not be necessary that must go in going felt to be ill treated left room a went down stair be disturbed tormented by

without letting be known that be doing so scolded declared how vain be for to make useless effort for unattainable end mr askerton always managed to slip out of reproach asserting to be right owning to be wrong must answer letter said of course will do wish knew what said sha show if mean that same wish knew what said clara of course did answer letter wrote answer to mary sending however one little scrap to mary brother wrote to mary at great length striving to explain with long laborious argument that be quite impossible that must accept belton estate from cousin that subject however manner of future life must discus with dear cousin mary when mary must have arrived then clara said how must go to taunton to meet cousin how must prepare william house for reception of william sister how must love cousin when must come to know of be exceedingly proper pretty then there be little postscript give enclosed to william be note to william dear william did not say that must be brother be brother always will accept from hand that brother must do when arrangement be quite fixed will love a much a mary love trust a completely will be obedient a younger sister must be loving sister c be good said william belton a crunched note in hand might a well shoot get out of way there will injured groom scudded across farm yard knowing that there be something wrong with master chapter xxx mary belton be about middle of pleasant month of may when clara amedroz again made that often repeated journey to taunton with object of meeting mary belton have transferred own peculiar belonging back from cottage to house have again established there so that might welcome new friend be not satisfied with simply receiving guest at belton therefore made journey to taunton settled for night at inn be careful to get bedroom for invalid lady close to sitting room before went down to station saw that cloth be laid for tea that tea parlour have be made to look a pleasant a be possible with inn parlour be very nervous a stood upon platform waiting for new comer to show knew that mary be cripple did not know how far cousin be disfigured by infirmity when saw pale faced little woman somewhat melancholy yet pretty withal with soft clear eye only so much appearance of stoop a to soften heart of who saw clara be agreeably surprised felt to be suddenly relieved of unpleasant weight must talk to woman saw there a to other woman without painful necessity of treating always a invalid think be miss belton said holding out hand likeness between mary brother be too great to allow of clara being mistaken be clara amedroz be so good of to come to meet thought must be dull in strange town by will be much nicer to have with then went together up to inn when have taken bonnet off mary belton kissed cousin be very nearly what fancied said mary be hope fancied to be something that must like something must love very dearly be little taller than what will said then gentleman be never judge of lady height said be thin be not very fat not very fat be thin of course know have thought great deal about seems a though have come to be so very near to blood be thicker than water be not if cousin be not friend who can be in course of evening became very confidential together clara thought that must love mary belton better than woman that have ever known of course be talking about william clara be at first in constant fear lest word must be said on lover behalf word must drive to declare that must not admit a lover mary abstained from subject with marvellous care tact though be talking through whole evening of brother so spoke of a almost to make clara believe that must not have heard of episode in life mr askerton must have dashed at subject at once then a clara told mary belton be better than mr askerton few word be said about estate originated in clara declaration that mary must have to be regarded a mistress of house to be going can not agree to said mary house be william be know said clara say not of course must be nonsense mary be very evident that know nothing of plaistow way must not say that anything coming from william be nonsense be accustomed to regard word a law when say that thing be to be so always be so then be tyrant at home beneficent despot despot know always be beneficent wo have way in thing will leave to fight about dear be so completely under thumb always obey in everything must not therefore expect to range on side next day be at belton castle in very few hour clara felt that be quite at home with cousin on second day mr askerton came up called according to arrangement to effect made between clara will stay away if like mr askerton have said clara have urged to come arguing with that be foolish to be thinking always of own misfortune of course be always thinking of have replied always thinking that other people be thinking of cousin miss belton know history of course what matter believe must be better that everybody must know suppose be very straight laced prim be not prim at said clara well will come said mr askerton will not be bit surprised if hear that go back to norfolk next day so mr askerton came miss belton did not go back to norfolk indeed at end of visit mr askerton have almost taught to believe that william belton have kept secret even from sister be dear little woman mr askerton afterwards said to clara be not so thoroughly like lady yes think be lady princess among lady what pretty little conscious way have of asserting when have opinion mean to stick to never saw woman who got more strength out of weakness who must dare to contradict then know everything so well said clara how like brother be yes there be great family likeness in character too be sure 'd find if be to try that have personal firmness though ca show a doe by kicking out foot clenching fist be glad like said clara do like very much be so odd way have changed used to speak of a though be merely clod of farmer of a stupid old maid now nothing be too good to say of exactly dear if understand why be not so clever a take to be life went on very pleasantly with at belton for two three week with drawback a regarded clara that have mean of knowing be to be course of future life during week twice received letter from cousin will answered of letter referred to matter of business entailed contradiction to certain detail of money due to estate before old squire death to vexed question of aunt winterfield legacy have by time drifted into belton hand a to be inclined to act in accordance with cousin wish though be assured by mr green that legacy be a good legacy a have ever be left by old woman think said in last letter that will be able to throw over in spite of mr green clara a read must not remember that man to be thrown over be man to whom have be engaged must not remember also circumstance of intended legacy of aunt death of scene have immediately followed death be so odd that william belton must now be discussing with mean of evading aunt intention that must be doing so not a accepted lover have indeed called brother be in truth rejected lover from time to time during week mr askerton must ask whether mr belton be coming to belton clara must answer with perfect truth that did not believe that have such intention must come soon mr askerton must say when clara must answer that knew nothing about mr askerton must ask further question about mary belton cousin must know whether brother be coming to look after property miss belton though heard constantly from brother gave such intimation if have intention of coming did not speak of during day have not a yet said word of brother love though name be daily in mouth latterly be frequently mentioned by clara there have be allusion to still enduring hope of will belton must not speak when have opportunity of speaking at continued till at last clara be driven to suppose that mary belton knew nothing of brother hope at last there came change change to clara be a great a have affected when first found that delightful cousin be not safe against love making have made up mind that sister did not intend to plead for brother that sister probably knew nothing of brother necessity for pleading that brother probably have further need for pleading when remembered last passionate word must not accuse of hypocrisy when allowed place in thought to latter supposition have be so intently earnest nature of man be so eager true yet in spite of have be said of fire in eye life in word energy in action have at last seen that aspiration be foolish desire vain must not otherwise be that mary must pas hour in such calm repose without allusion to disturbing subject after fashion with such meditation a have passed by last week then at last there came change have have letter from william morning said mary so have not said clara yet expect to hear from mean to be here soon said mary oh indeed speaks of being here next week for moment two clara have yielded to agitation caused by cousin tidings with little gush recovered presence of mind be able to speak with hypothetical propriety of female be glad to hear said be only right that must come have asked to say word to a to purport of journey then again clara courage hypocrisy be so far subdued that be not able to maintain in position adequate to occasion well said laughing what be word hope be not that be to pack up bag baggage take elsewhere cousin william be one of person who be willing to do everything except what be wanted to do will go on talking about belton estate when want to know whether may really look for a much a twelve shilling week to live upon want to speak to about about earnest love bear for oh dear mary must not suppose to be said be old trouble need not be repeated said mary can not suppose to be said clara looking up a heard voice be astonished by fire in woman eye by force of tone will not think so meanly of a to believe that such word from such man can be passed by a meaning nothing will not say that ought to be able to love in can not control heart if can not love want of such love ought to make suffer to suffer much be very sad can not agree to mary be life nothing then do know what love mean with love bear to do understand that be everything to that from first moment in acknowledged to that heart be set upon must not bring to set upon other thing for moment perhaps have never understood have never perceived that be so much in earnest that to be more than money land health more than life that so love that must willingly give everything that have for love have known clara must not answer question for while what if have known be therefore bound to sacrifice must be duty of woman to give to man simply because man wanted be argument a be put forward now by mary belton dear dearest clara said mary belton stretching forward from chair putting out thin almost transparent hand think that have thought enough of perhaps have not known love for be a say to be everything pervades hour of day corner in life know nothing of anything else while be in present state be very good more than good be very good see that of course know how disinterested be disinterested be poor word insinuates that in such matter there must be question of what people call interest know too how much honour honour be cold word be not honour love downright true honest love hope doe honour believe to be honest true woman a know well probably doe honour be speaking of love again clara be silent knew what must be argument if be determined to oppose cousin pleading knew also thought knew that did intend to oppose there be coldness in argument to be averse can not be insensible to such love a said mary going on with cause have in hand say that be fond of fond of have not used such trifling expression a that love know love have ever doubted word that have spoken to on subject believe speaks truly know speaks truly be very soul of truth mary well clara remember answer lightly play with man heart because have in power wrong must never do like tell that love what if love love will not be constrained be to say that love because believe that love be argument clara found driven to use not so much from special applicability to a on account of general fitness whether did did not apply to herself have time to ask at moment felt that man must have right to claim woman hand on strength of own love unless have be able to win love be arguing on behalf of woman in general rather than on own behalf if mean to tell that can not love of course must give over said mary not caring at for men woman in general full of anxiety for brother do mean to say that can never love almost seemed from face that be determined utterly to quarrel with new found cousin to quarrel to go at once away if got answer must not please dear mary press so hard want to press hard be not right that must lose life in longing hoping will not lose life mary hope not not if can help trust that will be strong enough to get rid of trouble to put down trample under foot clara a heard began to ask what be be to be trampled under will foot think will be man enough to overcome passion then perhaps may regret what have lost now be unkind to well what must have say do not know that be offering best gift that can give did not begin by swearing to that loved with passion of love can not be flattering to if be to be love in vain to be great misfortune yet when say that hope that will recover tell that be unkind not for may tell to come plead for again clara be silent not knowing how to answer last question when did answer answered thoughtlessly of course know that can do that say that have be forbidden oh mary what be to say to know wonder that can continue to question in way know what have be engaged to captain aylmer be not engaged to now be not there can be renewal there suppose oh not even for brother must say word if thought no there be nothing of if can not understand think that can explain seemed to clara that cousin in anxiety for brother did not conceive that woman even if must suddenly transfer affection from one man to must not bring to say that have done so must write to to day said mary must give answer will tell that have better not come here till be gone will perhaps be best said clara then will never come at can go can go at once will go at once will never have to say that presence prevented coming to own house ought not to be here know now will go away may tell be gone dear will not go yes must go fancied thing might be otherwise because once told that must be brother to said must hold to that not only because want brother so badly because love so dearly can not be like think that will ever desert will go away so that may come to own house ought not to be here of course ought not to be at belton in house in other tell will be gone before can come tell also will not be too proud to accept from what may be fit that must give have one one one then burst into tear throwing back head covered face with hand miss belton upon rose slowly from chair on be sitting making way painfully across to clara stood leaning on weeping girl chair will not go while be here said must go can not come till be gone think of once again clara may not tell to come that while be coming will see if can not soften heart towards soften heart oh if must only harden must wait if must only bid wait must be so happy in waiting yes till to morrow morning know hold out little finger to have whole hand arm in moment want to say that will try to love clara be in truth trying not to love be ashamed of herself because did love one man when few week since have confessed that loved have mistaken herself own feeling not in reference to cousin in supposing that must really have sympathised with man a captain aylmer be necessary to self respect that must be punished because of mistake must not save from condemnation must not grant respite because by doing so must make person happy have captain aylmer never crossed path must have given whole heart to cousin nay have so given have done so although captain aylmer have crossed path come in way be matter of shame to to find that have be possible must not bring to confess shame conversation at last ended a such conversation always do end without positive decision mary wrote of course to brother clara be not told of content of letter however may know may understand nature without learning above two line of letter if can be content to wait awhile will succeed said mary when be ever content to wait for anything if there be anything hate be waiting said will when received letter nevertheless letter made happy went about farm with sanguine heart a arranged matter for absence away long said in answer to question asked by head man how on earth can say how long will be away can go on well enough without by time must think will have to learn for there be knowing how often may be away for how long when mary said that letter have be written clara again spoke about going where will go said mary will take lodging in taunton must only follow there there must be more trouble must be must act a guardian in capacity at rate must submit to clara therefore consented to remain at belton before will arrived returned from house to cottage of course understand about said mr askerton let tell that if be not settled within week from coming here will think that be without heart be to be knocked about cuffed kept from work made to run up down between here norfolk because can not bring to confess that have be fool have never said have not be fool said clara have made mistake a young woman will do sometimes even when be a prudent circumspect a be now quite like task of putting right be true clara knew that be true putting right of mistake be never pleasant in case be so unpleasant that must not bring to acknowledge that must be done yet think that by time be aware of necessity chapter xxxi taking possession want to have said william belton to mr green lawyer when came to discus necessary arrangement for property must be absurd never mind be what wish suppose man may do what like with own wo take said lawyer must take if manage matter properly said will suppose will make much difference said lawyer now that captain aylmer be out of running know nothing about of course be very glad that must be out of running a call be bad sort of fellow did want to have property have have nothing to do with be not doing because think be ever to be wife from reader will understand that belton be still fidgeting lawyer about estate when passed through london matter in dispute however be so important that be induced to seek advice of others besides mr green at last be brought to conclusion that be paramount duty to become belton of belton there seemed in mind of councillor to be imperative almost imperious requirement that acre must go back to man of name now a there be one else of family who must stand in way have alternative to become belton of belton must however sell estate in norfolk raise money for endowing clara with commensurate rich such be own plan having fallen among counsellor must not exactly follow own plan at last submitted to arrangement in accordance with annuity of eight hundred pound year be to be settled upon clara be to lie a charge upon estate in norfolk seems to to be very shabby said william belton seems to to be very extravagant said leader among counsellor be not entitled to sixpence at last arrangement a above described be one to assented when belton reached house be now own found one there sister clara be at cottage a have be told that be to return there have reason to be annoyed nevertheless be annoyed rather discontented have not be quarter of hour about place before declared intention to go seek do such thing will pray said sister why not because will be better that must wait will only injure by being impetuous be absolutely necessary that must know own position must be cruelty to keep in ignorance though for matter of will be ashamed to tell yes will be ashamed to look in face what will think of after have assured that must have whole must not have taken will have done so must have be very wrong now will be comfortable wish must be comfortable said if will only wait hate waiting see what good will do besides mean to say anything about not to day at least indeed a for being here not seeing be out of question of course must think that have quarrelled with meant to take everything to myself now have power wo suspect of wishing to quarrel with will must in place be out of question must be here not go to must be monstrous will wait till have done lunch then will go up be at last decided that must walk up to cottage call upon colonel askerton ask to see clara in colonel presence be thought that must make statement about money better before third person who must be regarded a clara friend than must possibly be done between did therefore walk across to cottage be shown into colonel askerton study there be mr askerton said a soon a heard sound of bell knew that must come at once during whole morning mr askerton have be insisting that belton must make appearance on very day day of arrival at belton clara have be asserting that must not do so why must come clara have said simply to take to own house like other of good chattel be not good chattel soon will be why must accept lot quietly be belton of belton everything here belongs to belong to what nonsense when man have command of situation a have can do just what plea if be to come carry off by violence have doubt beltonians must assist say that be right of course must forgive belton of belton may do anything be nonsense if please indeed if have of decent feeling of feminine inferiority ought to belong to woman must have found sitting on door step of house waiting for have be said early in morning when first knew that have arrived have be talking about ever since talking about under pressure from mr askerton till clara have be driven to long that might be spared if chooses to come will come said of course will come mr askerton have answered then heard ring of bell there be must swear to sound of foot doe step a though be belton of belton conscious that everything belonged to then there be pause have be shown in to colonel askerton what on earth must want with have called to tell something about cottage said clara endeavouring to speak a though be calm through cottage fiddlestick idea of man coming to look after trumpery cottage on first day of showing a lord of own property perhaps be demanding that will be delivered up to if doe will vote for obeying for disobeying will vote very strongly too suspense be yet prolonged for ten minute at end of time servant came in asked if miss amedroz must be good enough to go into master room mr belton be there fanny asked mr askerton girl confessed that mr belton be there then clara without word got up left room have much to do in assuming look of composure before opened door made effort be not unsuccessful in second found hand in cousin bright eye be fixed upon with eager friendly glance made face so pleasant to whom loved cousin have be telling of arrangement have be making for with lawyer said colonel askerton can only say that wish lady have cousin so liberal so able to be liberal thought must see colonel askerton first a be staying at house a for liberality there be nothing of kind must understand clara that fellow ca do what like with own in country have found so bullied by lawyer sort of people have be obliged to yield to wanted that must have old place to do just what pleased with be out of question will of course be said colonel askerton then a belton did not proceed to telling of own story colonel told for explained what be income clara be to receive be a much out of question said a other can not rob in way can not will not why must what do want with income something ought to have if only for credit of family that be willing to take from kindness be settled now clara think that can lessen weight of obligation miss amedroz after what have be done up in london said colonel if have said hundred year have be allowed to say nothing said belton people have said eight so be settled when be coming over to see mary to question got definite answer a went away immediately afterwards hardly seemed to expect one did not even ask for mr askerton a lady remarked behaved altogether like bear what munificent bear said fancy eight hundred year of own one begin to doubt whether be worth one while to marry at with income a to do what one like with however mean nothing will all be own again before have even touched must not say anything more about said clara gravely why must not because will hear nothing more of there be end of a there ought to be why end see end there will be end till belton of belton have got eight hundred year a well a everything else will find that doe not mean anything more said clara think not be sure of then there be little sound in throat a though be in danger of being choked soon recovered be able to express clearly have only one favour to ask now mr askerton be that will never say anything more about have changed mind of course have must not come here like have gone away without saying word not word man give eight hundred year be not saying word not word except about money of course be right know that be right after what have passed must be very wrong to to think about more joke about being belton of belton doe make difference doe doe have made difference see feel now will never hear ask that question more if did hear what answer must make know be just woman be so cross grained that be wonder to that men must ever have anything to do with have about madness of phantasy dignify with name of feminine pride under cloak of believe to be justified in tormenting lover life out only consolation be that torment a much can anything be more cross grained than be at moment be resolved just now that must be most unbecoming thing in world if spoke word more about love for next twelve month mr askerton said nothing about twelve month now be broken hearted because did not blurt out before colonel askerton in business interview be very properly have at once in have have exceeding good taste to confine altogether to one subject be not complaining be good taste though if have not be bear might have asked after who be fighting battle for night day what will do next eat dinner must think a be now nearly five o'clock father used always to dine at five ca go to see mary said till come here again will be here fast enough must wonder if be to come here to night did come again that night when belton interview be over in colonel study left house without even asking after mistress a mistress have taken care to find out went off rambling about estate be now own be beautiful place be not insensible to gratification of being owner there be much in glory of ownership of ownership of land house of beef woolly flock of wide field thick growing wood even when ownership be of late date when conveys to owner nothing realisation of property on soil there be much more in when contains memory of old year when glory be glory of race a well a glory of power property there have be beltons of belton living there for many century now be belton of day standing on own ground descendant representative of beltons of old belton of belton without flaw in pedigree felt to be proud of position prouder than must have be of other might have be vouchsafed to yet amidst be somewhat ashamed of pride man who can do for be real man after said have got by fluke by such sad chance too then wandered on thinking of circumstance under property have fallen into hand remembering how when where first idea have occurred to of making clara amedroz wife have then felt that if must only do that must reconcile to heirship idea have grown upon instantly have become passion by eagerness with have welcomed from day to have continued to tell that must not enjoy good fortune unless must enjoy with there have come to be horrid impediment in way barrier have seemed to have be placed there by evil fortune to compensate gift given to by good fortune that barrier have be captain aylmer have not in fact seen much of rival have seen enough to make matter of wonder to that clara must be attached to man have thoroughly despised captain aylmer have longed to show contempt of man by kicking out of hotel at london railway station at moment world have seemed to to be wrong wretched now seemed that world might so easily be made right again impediment have got removed belton did not even yet altogether comprehend by what mean clara have escaped from mesh of aylmer park people did know that have escaped eye have be opened before be too late be free woman to be compassed if only man might compass while have be engaged to captain aylmer will have felt that be not assailable though have not be quite able to restrain a on that fatal occasion when have taken in arm kissed still have known that a be engaged woman must not without insulting press own suit upon now be over let say what liked on head must have proper plea for anger be assailable a be so why mischief must not set about work at once sister bade to wait why must wait when one fortunate word might do wait must not wait how be to bid starving man to wait when put down at well covered board here be walking about belton park just where used to walk with there be at belton cottage within hour of at moment if be to go quickly yet mary be telling to wait must not wait there must be reason for waiting wait indeed other captain aylmer must come in way give more trouble so wandered on resolving that must see cousin again very day such interview a have just taken place between two such dear friend be not natural be not to be endured what might not clara think of to meet for first time after escape from aylmer park to speak to only on matter concerning money must certainly go to again on afternoon in walking came to bottom of rising ground on top of stood rock on clara have twice sat turned away must not go up to hoped that might go up to very soon except under certain circumstance must never go up to again be going across to cottage immediately after dinner said to sister have appointment have appointment suppose man doe want appointment to go see own cousin down

aylmer at rate have never succumbed in dealing with have fought upon equal footing have never be compelled to own mastered now be being led out that might confess own submission acknowledge that hitherto have not known what be good for knew that must have to yield must have known how happy be to have opportunity of yielding yet yet have there be room for choice thought must have refrained from walking with cousin that evening have wept that afternoon because have thought that must not come again now that have come at first moment be possible for be almost tempted to wish once more away
