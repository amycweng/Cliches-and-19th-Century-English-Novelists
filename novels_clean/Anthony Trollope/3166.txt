thousand pound in contest must not recover position high tory with great whig interest to back be never popular person in england one can trust though there may be who be willing to place untrusted in high position such be case with mr gresham there be many who be willing for family consideration to keep in parliament one thought that be fit to be there consequence be that bitter expensive contest ensued frank gresham when twitted with being whig foreswore de courcy family then when ridiculed a having be thrown over by tory foreswore father old friend so between two stool fell to ground a politician never again rose to foot never again rose to foot twice again made violent effort to do so election in east barsetshire from various cause came quick upon other in day before be eight

higher mettle have married man with fine place fine fortune have nevertheless married commoner have in so far derogated from high birth felt that husband must be by right member of house of lord if not that be at least essential that must have seat in lower chamber must by degree sink into nothing if allowed to sit down mere wife of mere country squire thus instigated mr gresham repeated useless

more people winter at greshamsbury park than house must hold now changed tune worried because selina coughed because helena be hectic because poor sophy spine be weak matilda appetite be gone worrying from such cause be pardonable will be said so be manner be hardly pardonable selina cough be certainly not fairly attributable to old fashioned furniture in portman square must sophy spine have be materially benefited by father having seat in parliament yet to have heard lady arabella discussing matter in family conclave one must have thought that must have expected such result a be poor weak darling be carried about from london to brighton from brighton to german bath from german bath back to torquay thence a regarded four have named to bourne from whence further journey must be made

not race nurtured by venus apollo be tall thin with high cheek bone high forehead large dignified cold eye de courcy girl have good hair a also possessed easy manner power of talking managed to pas in world for beauty till be absorbed in matrimonial market world at large cared no longer whether be beauty not miss gresham be made in de courcy mould be not on account le dear to mother two eldest augusta beatrice lived be apparently likely to live four next faded died one after in same sad year be laid in neat new cemetery at torquay then came pair born at one birth weak delicate frail little flower with dark hair dark eye thin long pale face with long bony hand long bony foot whom men looked on a fated to follow sister with quick step hitherto however have not followed have suffered a sister have suffered people at greshamsbury attributed to fact that change have be made in family medical practitioner then came youngest of flock whose birth have said be not heralded with loud joy for when came into world four others with pale temple wan worn cheek skeleton white arm be awaiting permission to leave such be family when in year eldest son came of age have be educated at harrow be now still at cambridge of course on such day a be at home that coming of age must be delightful time to young man born to inherit broad acre wide wealth full mouthed congratulation warm prayer with manhood be welcomed by grey haired senior of county affectionate motherly caress of neighbouring mother who have seen grow up from cradle of mother who have daughter perhaps fair enough good enough sweet enough even for soft spoken half bashful tender greeting of girl who now perhaps for first time call by stern family name instructed by instinct rather than precept that time have come when familiar charles familiar john must by be laid aside lucky dog hint of silver spoon be poured into ear a young compeer slap back bid live thousand year then never die shouting of tenantry good wish of old farmer who come up to wring hand kiss get from farmer wife kiss give to farmer daughter thing must make twenty first birthday pleasant enough to young heir to youth however who feel that be now liable to arrest that inherits other privilege pleasure may very possibly not be quite so keen case with young frank gresham may be supposed to much nearer former than latter yet ceremony of coming of age be by mean like fate have accorded to father mr gresham be now embarrassed man though world did not know at rate did not know that be deeply embarrassed have not heart to throw open mansion receive county with free hand a though thing be going well with nothing be going well with lady arabella must allow nothing near around to be well everything with now turned to vexation be no longer joyous happy man people of east barsetshire did not look for gala doings on grand scale when young gresham came of age gala doings to certain extent there be there be in july table be spread under oak for tenant table be spread meat beer wine be there frank a walked round shook guest by hand expressed hope that relation with other might be long close mutually advantageous must say few word now about place greshamsbury park be fine old english gentleman seat be be can assert more easily in past tense a be speaking of with reference to past time have spoken of greshamsbury park there be park so called mansion be generally known a greshamsbury house did not stand in park may perhaps best describe by saying that village of greshamsbury consisted of one long straggling street mile in length in centre turned sharp round so one half of street lay directly at right angle to other in angle stood greshamsbury house garden ground around filled up space so made there be entrance with large gate at end of village gate be guarded by effigy of two huge pagan with club such being crest borne by family from entrance broad road quite straight running through to majestic avenue of lime led up to house be built in richest perhaps must rather say in purest style of tudor architecture so much so that though greshamsbury be le complete than longleat magnificent than hatfield may in sense be said to be finest specimen of tudor architecture of country can boast stand amid multitude of trim garden stone built terrace divided one from to eye be not so attractive a broad expanse of lawn by country house be generally surrounded garden of greshamsbury have be celebrated for two century gresham who must have altered must have be considered to have destroyed one of well known landmark of family greshamsbury park properly so called spread far away on other side of village opposite to two great gate leading up to mansion be two smaller gate one opening on to stable kennel farm yard other to deer park latter be principal entrance to demesne grand picturesque entrance be avenue of lime on one side stretched up to house be on other extended for quarter of mile then appeared to be terminated only by abrupt rise in ground at entrance there be four savage four club two to portal what with massive iron gate surmounted by stone wall on stood family arm supported by two other club bearer stone built lodge doric ivy covered column surrounded circle four grim savage extent of space through high road ran just abutted on village spot be sufficiently significant of old family greatness who examined more closely might see that under arm be scroll bearing gresham motto that word be repeated in smaller letter under of savage gardez gresham have be chosen in day of motto choosing probably by herald at arm a appropriate legend for signifying peculiar attribute of family now however unfortunately men be not of one mind a to exact idea signified declared with much heraldic warmth that be address to savage calling on to take care of patron while others with whom be inclined to agree averred with equal certainty that be advice to people at large especially to inclined to rebel against aristocracy of county that must beware gresham latter signification must betoken strength so said holder of doctrine former weakness now gresham be ever strong people never addicted to false humility will not pretend to decide question ala construction be now equally unsuited to family fortune such change have taken place in england since gresham have founded that savage must longer in way protect must protect like common folk live unprotected now be necessary that neighbour must shake in shoe when gresham frowned must have be to be wished that present gresham must have be a indifferent to frown of of neighbour old symbol remained may such symbol long remain among be still lovely fit to be loved tell of true manly feeling of other time to who can read aright explain more fully more truly than written history can do how englishman have become what be be not yet commercial country in sense in epithet be used for let still hope that will not soon become so might surely a well be called feudal england chivalrous england if in western civilised europe there doe exist nation among whom there be high signor with whom owner of land be true aristocracy aristocracy be trusted a being best fittest to rule nation be english choose out ten leading men of great european people choose in france in austria sardinia prussia russia sweden denmark spain then select ten in england whose name be best known a of leading statesman result will show in country there still exists closest attachment to sincerest trust in old feudal now so called landed interest england commercial country yes a venice be may excel other nation in commerce yet be not that in most pride in most excels merchant a such be not first men among though perhaps be open barely open to merchant to become one of buying selling be good necessary be very necessary may possibly be very good can not be noblest work of man let hope that may not in time be esteemed noblest work of englishman greshamsbury park be very large lay on outside of angle formed by village street stretched away on two side without apparent limit boundary visible from village road house indeed ground on side be so broken up into abrupt hill conical shaped oak covered excrescence be seen peeping up through over other that true extent of park be much magnified to eye be very possible for stranger to get into to find difficulty in getting out again by of known gate such be beauty of landscape that lover of scenery must be tempted thus to lose have said that on one side lay kennel will give opportunity of describing here one especial episode long episode in life of existing squire have once represented county in parliament when ceased to do so still felt ambition to be connected in peculiar way with county greatness still desired that gresham of greshamsbury must be something more in east barsetshire than jackson of grange baker of mill hill bateson of annesgrove be friend very respectable country gentleman mr gresham of greshamsbury must be more than even have enough of ambition to be aware of such longing therefore when opportunity occurred took to hunting county for employment be in way well suited unless be in matter of finance though have in very earliest manly year given such great offence by indifference to family politics have in certain degree fostered ill feeling by contesting county in opposition to wish of brother squire nevertheless bore loved popular name men regretted that must not have be what wished to be that must not have be such a be old squire when found that such be case that must not be great among a politician be still willing that must be great in other way if there be county greatness for be suited now be known a excellent horseman a thorough sportsman a one knowing in dog tender hearted a sucking mother to litter of young fox have ridden in county since be fifteen have fine voice for view hallo knew hound by name must wind horn with sufficient music for hunting purpose moreover have come to property a be well known through barsetshire with clear income of fourteen thousand year thus when old worn out master of hound be run to ground about year after mr gresham last contest for county seemed to party to be pleasant rational arrangement that hound must go to greshamsbury pleasant indeed to except lady arabella rational perhaps to except squire time be already considerably encumbered have spent much more than must have done so indeed have wife in two splendid year in have figured a great among great one of earth fourteen thousand year ought to have be enough to allow member of parliament with young wife two three child to live in london keep up country family mansion then de courcys be very great people lady arabella chose to live a have be accustomed to do a sister in law countess lived now lord de courcy have much more than fourteen thousand year then came three election with vast attendant cost then costly expedient to gentleman be forced to have recourse who have lived beyond income find impossible so to reduce establishment a to live much below thus when hound came to greshamsbury mr gresham be already poor man lady arabella said much to oppose coming lady arabella though must hardly be said of that be under husband rule certainly be not entitled to boast that have under hers then made first grand attack a to furniture in portman square be then for first time specially informed that furniture there be not matter of much importance a must not in future be required to move family to residence during london season sort of conversation grew from such commencement may be imagined have lady arabella worried lord might perhaps have considered with more coolness folly of encountering so prodigious increase to expense of establishment have not spent so much money in pursuit wife did not enjoy might perhaps have be more sparing in rebuke a to indifference to london pleasure a be hound came to greshamsbury lady arabella did go to london for period in year family expense be by mean lessened kennel however be now again empty two year previous to time at story begin hound have be carried off to seat of richer sportsman be more felt by mr gresham than other misfortune have yet incurred have be master of hound for ten year work have at rate done well popularity among neighbour have lost a politician have regained a sportsman must fain have remained autocratic in hunt have be possible so remained much longer than must have done at last went away not without sign sound of visible joy on part of lady arabella have kept greshamsbury tenantry waiting under oak tree by far too long yes when young frank came of age there be still enough left at greshamsbury still mean enough at squire disposal to light one bonfire to roast whole in skin one bullock frank virility came on not quite unmarked a of parson son might do son of neighbouring attorney must still be reported in barsetshire conservative standard that beard wagged at greshamsbury now a have done for many century on similar festival yes be so reported like so many other such report have shadow of truth in poured liquor in certainly who be there beard did not wag a have be wont to wag in former year beard wo wag for telling squire be at wit end for money tenant one have so heard rent have be raised on timber have fallen fast lawyer on estate be growing rich tradesman in barchester nay in greshamsbury be beginning to mutter squire must not be merry under such circumstance throat of tenantry will still swallow beard will not wag mind well said farmer oaklerath to neighbour when squoire hisself comed of age lord love there be fun going day there be more yale drank then than be brewed at big house two year t'old squoire be one'er mind when squoire be borned mind well said old farmer sitting opposite be day that long ago squoire a'nt come o ' fifty yet nigh though look thing be altered at greemsbury such be rural pronunciation altered sadly neebor oaklerath well well will soon be gone will so use talking arter paying one pound fifteen for acre for more fifty year did think 'd ever be axed for forty shilling such be style of conversation went on at various table have certainly be of very different tone when squire be born when came of age when just two year subsequently son have be born on of event similar rural fete have be given squire have on occasion be frequent among guest on first have be carried round by father whole train of lady nurse following on second have mixed in sport gayest of gay tenant have squeezed way up to lawn to get sight of lady arabella who a be already known be to come from courcy castle to greshamsbury to be mistress be little of cared now for lady arabella on third have borne child in arm a father have before borne be then in zenith of pride though tenantry whispered that be somewhat le familiar with than of yore that have put on somewhat too much of de courcy air still be squire master rich man in whose hand lay old squire be then gone be proud of young member lady bride in spite of little hauteur none of be proud of now walked once round among guest spoke few word of welcome at table a did so tenant got up bowed wished health to old squire happiness to young one prosperity to greshamsbury nevertheless be tame affair there be also other visitor of gentle sort to do honour to occasion not such swarm not crowd at mansion at house of neighbouring gentry a have always be collected on former gala doings indeed party at greshamsbury be not large one consisted chiefly of lady de courcy suite lady arabella still kept up a far a be able close connexion with courcy castle be there a much a possible to mr gresham never objected took daughter there whenever must though a regarded two elder girl be interfered with by mr gresham not unfrequently by girl lady arabella have pride in son though be by mean favourite child be however heir of greshamsbury of fact be disposed to make most be also fine gainly open hearted young man who must not be dear to mother lady arabella did love dearly though felt sort of disappointment in regard to seeing that be not so much like de courcy a must have be did love dearly therefore when came of age got sister in law lady amelia rosina etc to come to greshamsbury also with difficulty persuaded honourable george honourable john to be equally condescending lord de courcy be in attendance at court said that be lord porlock eldest son simply told aunt when be invited that never bored with sort of thing then there be baker batesons jackson who lived near returned home at night there be reverend caleb oriel high church rector with beautiful sister patience oriel there be mr yates umbleby attorney agent there be dr thorne doctor modest quiet looking little niece miss mary chapter ii long long ago a dr thorne be hero must rather say hero privilege of selecting for in respect being left to reader a miss mary thorne be to be heroine point on choice whatsoever be left to one be necessary that will be introduced explained described in proper formal manner quite feel that apology be due for beginning novel with two long dull chapter full of description be perfectly aware of danger of such course in so doing sin against golden rule requires to put best foot foremost wisdom of be fully recognised by novelist among number can hardly be expected that one will consent to go through with fiction offer so little of allurement in first page twist a will can not do otherwise find can not make poor mr gresham hem haw turn uneasily in arm chair in natural manner till have said why be uneasy can not bring in doctor speaking mind freely among bigwig have explained that be in accordance with usual character to do so be unartistic on part show want of imagination a well a want of skill whether not can atone for fault by straightforward simple plain story telling that indeed be very doubtful dr thorne belonged to family in one sense a good at rate a old a of mr gresham much older be apt to boast than of de courcys trait in character be mentioned first a be weakness for be most conspicuous be second cousin to mr thorne of ullathorne barsetshire squire living in neighbourhood of barchester who boasted that estate have remained in family descending from thorne to thorne longer than have be case with other estate other family in county dr thorne be only second cousin therefore though be entitled to talk of blood a belonging to extent to have right to lay claim to position in county other than such a might win for if chose to locate in be fact of one be more fully aware than doctor father who have be first cousin of former squire thorne have be clerical dignitary in barchester have be dead now many year have have two son one have educated a medical man other younger whom have intended for bar have not betaken in satisfactory way to calling son have be first rusticated from oxford then expelled thence returning to barchester have be cause to father brother of much suffering old dr thorne clergyman died when two brother be yet young men left behind nothing household other property of value of about two thousand pound bequeathed to thomas elder son much more than having be spent in liquidating debt contracted by younger up to time there have be close harmony between ullathorne family that of clergyman month two before doctor death period of be speaking be about two twenty year before commencement of story then mr thorne of ullathorne have made understood that must no longer receive at house cousin henry whom regarded a disgrace to family father be apt to be more lenient to son than uncle to nephew cousin to other dr thorne still hoped to reclaim black sheep thought that head of family showed unnecessary harshness in putting obstacle in way of doing so if father be warm in support of profligate son young medical aspirant be warmer in support of profligate brother dr thorne junior be roue perhaps a young man have not sufficient abhorrence of brother vice at rate stuck to manfully when be signified in close that henry company be not considered desirable at ullathorne dr thomas thorne sent word to squire under such circumstance visit there must also cease be not very prudent a young galen have elected to establish in barchester very mainly in expectation of help ullathorne connexion must give however in anger failed to consider be never known either in early in middle life to consider in anger point be probably best worth consideration perhaps be of le moment a anger be of unenduring kind evaporating frequently with more celerity than must get angry word out of mouth with ullathorne people however did establish quarrel sufficiently permanent to be of vital injury to medical prospect then father died two brother be left living together with very little mean between at time there be living in barchester people of name of scatcherd of family a then existing have only to do with two brother sister be in low rank of life one being journeyman stone mason other apprentice to straw bonnet maker be nevertheless in sort remarkable people sister be reputed in barchester to be model of female beauty of strong robuster cast have also better reputation a being girl of good character honest womanly conduct of beauty of reputation brother be exceedingly proud be more so when learnt that have be asked in marriage by decent master tradesman in city roger scatcherd have also reputation not for beauty propriety of conduct be known for best stone mason in four county a man who must on occasion drink most alcohol in given time in same locality a workman indeed have higher reputate even than be not only good very quick stone mason have also capacity for turning other men into good stone mason have gift of knowing what man must must do by degree taught what five ten twenty latterly what thousand two thousand men might accomplish among also did with very little aid from pen paper with be not never became very conversant have also other gift other propensity must talk in manner dangerous to others must persuade without knowing that did so being extreme demagogue in noisy time just prior to reform bill created hubbub in barchester of have have no previous conception henry thorne among other bad quality have one friend regarded a worse than others perhaps justified ullathorne people in severity loved to consort with low people not only drank that might have be forgiven drank in tap room with vulgar drinker so said friend so said enemy denied charge a being made in plural number declared that only low co reveller be roger scatcherd with roger scatcherd at rate associated became a democratic a roger be now thornes of ullathorne be of very highest order of tory excellence whether not mary scatcherd at once accepted offer of respectable tradesman can not say after occurrence of certain event must here shortly be told declared that never have done so brother averred that most positively have respectable tradesman refused to speak on subject be certain however that scatcherd who have hitherto be silent enough about sister in social hour passed with gentleman friend boasted of engagement when be a said made then boasted also of girl beauty scatcherd in spite of occasional intemperance looked up in world coming marriage of sister be thought suitable to own ambition for family henry thorne have already heard of already seen mary scatcherd hitherto have not fallen in way of wickedness now however when heard that be to be decently married devil tempted to tempt boot not to tell tale came out clearly enough when be told that made most distinct promise of marriage even gave such in writing having in way obtained from company during of little holiday sunday summer evening seduced scatcherd accused openly of having intoxicated with drug thomas thorne who took up case ultimately believed charge became known in barchester that be with child that seducer be henry thorne roger scatcherd when news first reached filled with drink then swore that must kill with manly wrath however set forth first against man that with manly weapon took nothing with fist big stick a went in search of henry thorne two brother be then lodging together at farm house close abutting on town be not eligible abode for medical practitioner young doctor have not be able to settle eligibly since father death wishing to put what constraint must upon brother have so located to farm house came roger scatcherd one sultry summer evening anger gleaming from bloodshot eye rage heightened to madness by rapid pace at have run from city by ardent spirit be fermenting within at very gate of farm yard standing placidly with cigar in mouth encountered henry thorne have thought of searching for through whole premise of demanding victim with loud exclamation making way to through obstacle in lieu of there stood man before well roger what be in wind said henry thorne be last word ever spoke be answered by blow from blackthorn contest ensued ended in scatcherd keeping word at rate a regarded worst offender how fatal blow on temple be struck be never exactly determined one medical man said might have be done in fight with heavy headed stick thought that stone have be used third suggested stone mason hammer seemed however to be proved subsequently that hammer be taken out scatcherd persisted in declaring that have taken in hand weapon stick scatcherd however be drunk even though intended to tell truth may have be mistaken there be however fact thorne be dead that scatcherd have sworn to kill about hour previously that have without delay accomplished threat be arrested tried for murder distressing circumstance of case came out on trial be found guilty of manslaughter sentenced to be imprisoned for six month reader will probably think that punishment be too severe thomas thorne farmer be on spot soon after henry thorne have fallen brother be at first furious for vengeance against brother murderer a fact came out a learnt what have be provocation given have be feeling of scatcherd when left city determined to punish who have ruined sister heart be changed be trying day for behoved to do what in lay to cover brother memory from obloquy deserved behoved also to save to assist to save from undue punishment unfortunate man who have shed brother blood behoved also at least so thought to look after poor fallen one whose misfortune be le merited than of brother of hers be not man to get through thing lightly with a much ease a perhaps might conscientiously have done must pay for defence of prisoner must pay for defence of brother memory must pay for poor girl comfort must do must allow one to help stood alone in world insisted on so standing old mr thorne of ullathorne offered again to open arm to have conceived foolish idea that cousin severity have driven brother on to bad career must consequently accept kindness from ullathorne miss thorne old squire daughter cousin considerably older than to whom have at one time be much attached sent money returned to under blank cover have still enough for unhappy purpose have in hand a to what might happen afterwards be then mainly indifferent affair made much noise in county be inquired into closely by many of county magistrate by none more closely than by john newbold gresham who be then alive mr gresham be greatly taken with energy justice shown by dr thorne on occasion when trial be over invited to greshamsbury visit ended in doctor establishing in village must return for moment to mary scatcherd be saved from necessity of encountering brother wrath for brother be under arrest for murder before must get at immediate lot however be cruel one deep a be cause for anger against man who have so inhumanly used still be natural that must turn to with love rather than with aversion to whom else must in such plight look for love when therefore heard that be slain heart sank within turned face to wall laid down to die to die double death for herself fatherless babe be now quick within in fact life have still much to offer to to child for be still destined that must in distant land be worthy wife of good husband

fortune doctor took with charge to new country in be to live there found for fitting home till must be old enough to sit at table live in bachelor house one old mr gresham knew who be whence have come then roger scatcherd having completed six month confinement came out of prison roger scatcherd though hand be now red with blood be to be pitied short time before day of henry thorne death have married young wife in own class of life have made many resolve henceforward conduct must be such a might become married man might not disgrace respectable brother in law be about to have given such be

became mother immediately after liberation when child be born be in direst want for scatcherd be again drinking resolve be blown to wind doctor be then living at greshamsbury have gone over there before day on undertook charge of poor mary baby soon found settled a greshamsbury doctor occurred very soon after birth of young heir predecessor in career have bettered endeavoured to do so by seeking practice of large town lady arabella at very critical time be absolutely left with other advice than of stranger picked up a declared to lady de courcy somewhere about barchester jail barchester court house did not know of course lady arabella must not suckle young heir lady arabella never can be gifted with power of being mother not nursing mother nature give bosom for show not for use so lady arabella have wet nurse at end of six month new doctor found master frank be not doing quite so well a must do after little trouble be discovered that very excellent young woman who have be sent express from courcy castle to greshamsbury supply being kept up on lord demesne for family use be fond of brandy be at once sent back to castle of course a lady de courcy be too much in dudgeon to send dr thorne be allowed to procure one thought of misery of roger scatcherd wife thought also of health strength active habit thus mr scatcherd became foster mother to young frank gresham one other episode must tell of past time previous to father death dr thorne be in love have altogether sighed pleaded in vain though have not quite come to that that young lady friend even young lady have actually accepted suit at time name stood well in barchester father be prebendary cousin best friend be thornes of ullathorne lady who will be nameless be not thought to be injudicious in listening to young doctor when henry thorne went so far astray when old doctor died when young doctor quarrelled with ullathorne when brother be killed in disgraceful quarrel turned out that physician have nothing profession settled locality in to exercise then indeed young lady friend thought that be injudicious young lady have not spirit enough love enough to be disobedient in stormy day of trial told dr thorne that perhaps must be wise that must not see other more dr thorne so counselled at moment so informed then when most required comfort from love at once swore loudly that agreed with rushed forth with bursting heart said to that world be bad bad saw lady more if be rightly informed never again made matrimonial overture to one chapter iii dr thorne thus dr thorne became settled for life in little village of greshamsbury a be then wont with many country practitioner a must be wont with if consulted own dignity little le comfort of customer somewhat more added business of dispensing apothecary to of physician in doing so be of course much reviled many people around declared that must not truly be doctor at rate doctor to be so called brother in art living around though knew that diploma degree certificate be en regle rather countenanced report there be much about new comer did not endear to own profession in first place be new comer a such be of course to be regarded by other doctor a being de trop greshamsbury be only fifteen mile from barchester where there be regular depot of medical skill eight from silverbridge where properly established physician have be in residence for last forty year dr thorne predecessor at greshamsbury have be humble minded general practitioner gifted with due respect for physician of county though have be allowed to physic servant sometimes child of greshamsbury have never have presumption to put on par with better then also dr thorne though graduated physician though entitled beyond dispute to call doctor according to law of college made known to east barsetshire world very soon after have seated at greshamsbury that rate of pay be to be seven sixpence visit within circuit of five mile with proportionally increased charge at proportionally increased distance now there be something low mean unprofessional democratic in so at least said child of aesculapius gathered together in conclave at barchester in first place showed that thorne be always thinking of money like apothecary a be whereas must have behoved a physician have have feeling of physician under hat to have regarded own pursuit in purely philosophical spirit to have taken gain might have accrued a accidental adjunct to station in life physician must take fee without letting left hand know what right hand be doing must be taken without thought without look without move of facial muscle true physician must hardly be aware that last friendly grasp of hand have be made more precious by touch of gold whereas fellow thorne must lug out crown from breech pocket give in change for ten shilling piece then be clear that man have appreciation of dignity of learned profession might constantly be seen compounding medicine in shop at left hand of front door not making experiment philosophically in materia medica for benefit of coming age if did must have done in seclusion of study far from profane eye positively putting together common powder for rural bowel spreading vulgar ointment for agricultural ailment man of sort be not fit society for dr fillgrave of barchester must be admitted yet have be found to be fit society for old squire of greshamsbury whose shoe ribbon dr fillgrave must not have objected to tie so high did old squire stand in county just previous to death spirit of lady arabella be known by medical profession of barsetshire when good man died be felt that thorne short tenure of greshamsbury favour be already over barsetshire regular be however doomed to disappointment doctor have already contrived to endear to heir though there be not even then much personal love between lady arabella kept place at great house unmoved not only in nursery in bedroom also at squire dining table now there be in must be admitted quite enough to make unpopular with brother feeling be soon shown in marked dignified manner dr fillgrave who have certainly most respectable professional connexion in county who have reputation to maintain who be accustomed to meet on almost equal term great medical baronet from metropolis at house of nobility dr fillgrave declined to meet dr thorne in consultation exceedingly regretted said most exceedingly necessity felt of doing so have never before have to perform so painful duty a duty owed to profession must perform with feeling of respect for lady sick guest at greshamsbury for mr gresham must decline to attend in conjunction with dr thorne if service must be made available under other circumstance must go to greshamsbury a fast a post horse must carry then indeed there be war in barsetshire if there be on dr thorne cranium one bump more developed than be that of combativeness not that doctor be bully even pugnacious in usual sense of word have disposition to provoke fight propense love of quarrelling there be that in must allow to yield to attack neither in argument in contest must ever allow to be wrong never at least to one to on behalf of special hobby be ready to meet world at large will therefore be understood that when gauntlet be thus thrown in very teeth by dr fillgrave be not slow to take up addressed letter to barsetshire conservative standard in attacked dr fillgrave with considerable acerbity dr fillgrave responded in four line saying that on mature consideration have made up mind not to notice remark might be made on by dr thorne in public press greshamsbury doctor then wrote letter more witty much more severe than last a be copied into bristol exeter gloucester paper dr fillgrave found very difficult to maintain magnanimity of reticence be sometimes becoming enough for man to wrap in dignified toga of silence proclaim indifferent to public attack be sort of dignity be very difficult to maintain a well might man when stung to madness by wasp endeavour to sit in chair without moving muscle a endure with patience without reply courtesy of newspaper opponent dr thorne wrote third letter be too much for medical flesh blood to bear dr fillgrave answered not indeed in own name in of brother doctor then war raged merrily be hardly too much to say that dr fillgrave never knew happy hour have dreamed of what material be made that young compounder of dos at greshamsbury must have met in consultation morning noon night without objection having begun war be constrained to go on with brother must allow alternative thus be continually being brought up to fight a prize fighter may be seen to be who be carried up round after round without hope on own part who in round drop to ground before very wind of opponent blow dr fillgrave though thus weak be backed in practice in countenance by nearly brother in county guinea fee principle of giving advice of selling medicine great resolve to keep distinct barrier between physician apothecary above hatred of contamination of bill be strong in medical mind of barsetshire dr thorne have provincial medical world against so appealed to metropolis lancet took matter up in favour journal of medical science be against weekly chirurgeon noted for medical democracy upheld a medical prophet scalping knife monthly periodical got up in dead opposition to lancet showed mercy so war went on doctor to certain extent became noted character have moreover other difficulty to encounter in professional career be something in favour that understood business something that be willing to labour at with energy resolved to labour at conscientiously have also other gift such a conversational brilliancy aptitude for true good fellowship firmness in friendship general honesty of disposition stood in stead a advanced in life at first starting much that belonged to personally be against let enter what house must entered with conviction often expressed to that be equal a man to proprietor equal a human being to proprietress to age must allow deference to special recognised talent at least so said to rank also must pay that respect be clear recognised prerogative must let lord walk out of room before if did not happen to forget in speaking to duke must address a grace must in way assume familiarity with bigger men than allowing to bigger man privilege of making first advance beyond must admit that man must walk earth with head higher than own did not talk of thing much offended rank by boast of own equality did not absolutely tell earl de courcy in word that privilege of dining at courcy castle be to no greater than privilege of dining at courcy parsonage there be that in manner that told feeling in be perhaps good be certainly much justified by manner in bore to below in rank there be folly in resolution to run counter to world recognised rule on such matter much absurdity in mode of doing so seeing that at heart be thorough conservative be hardly too much to say that naturally hated lord at first sight nevertheless must have expended mean blood spirit in fighting for upper house of parliament such disposition until be thoroughly understood did not tend to ingratiate with wife of country gentleman among whom have to look for practice then also there be not much in individual manner to recommend to favour of lady be brusque authoritative given to contradiction rough though never dirty in personal belonging inclined to indulge in sort of quiet raillery sometimes be not thoroughly understood people did not always know whether be laughing at with people be perhaps inclined to think that doctor must not laugh at when called in to act doctorially when be known indeed when core of fruit have be reached when huge proportion of loving trusting heart have be learned understood appreciated when honesty have be recognised that manly almost womanly tenderness have be felt then indeed doctor be acknowledged to be adequate in profession to trifling ailment be too often brusque seeing that accepted money for cure of such must may say have cured without offensive manner so far be without defence to real suffering one found brusque patient lying painfully on bed of sickness ever thought rough misfortune be that be bachelor lady think for one think that lady be quite right in so thinking that doctor must be married men world feel that man when married acquires of attribute of old woman becomes to certain extent motherly sort of being acquires conversance with woman way woman want loses wilder offensive spark of virility must be easier to talk to one about matilda stomach growing pain in fanny leg than to young bachelor impediment also stood much in dr thorne way during first year at greshamsbury want be not at first great though ambition be perhaps high be not of impatient nature world be oyster circumstanced a be knew that be not for to open with lancet at once have bread to earn must earn wearily have character to make must come slowly satisfied soul that in addition to immortal hope have possible future in world to must look forward with clear eye advance with heart must know fainting on first arrival at greshamsbury have be put by squire into house still occupied when squire grandson came of age there be two decent commodious private house in village always excepting rectory stood grandly in own ground therefore be considered a ranking above village residence of two dr thorne have smaller stood exactly at angle before described on outer side of at right angle to other possessed good stable ample garden may be a well to specify mr umbleby agent lawyer to estate occupied larger one here dr thorne lived for eleven twelve year alone then for ten eleven more with niece mary thorne mary be thirteen when came to take up permanent abode a mistress of establishment at rate to act a only mistress establishment possessed advent greatly changed tenor of doctor way have be before pure bachelor not room in house have be comfortably furnished at first commenced in makeshift sort of way because have not at command mean of commencing otherwise have gone on in same fashion because exact time have never come at be imperative in to set house in order have have fixed hour for meal fixed place for book fixed wardrobe for clothes have few bottle of good wine in cellar occasionally asked brother bachelor to take chop with beyond have touched very little on care of housekeeping slop bowl full of strong tea together with bread butter egg be produced for in morning expected that at hour might arrive in evening food must be presented to wherewith to satisfy craving of nature if in addition to have slop bowl of tea in evening got that ever required at least that ever demanded when mary came rather when be about to come thing be altogether changed at doctor people have hitherto wondered especially mr umbleby how gentleman like dr thorne must continue to live in so slovenly manner how people again wondered again especially mr umbleby how doctor must possibly think necessary to put lot of furniture into house because little chit of girl of twelve year of age be coming to live with mr umbleby have great scope for wonder doctor made thorough revolution in household furnished house from ground to roof completely painted for first time since commencement of tenancy papered carpeted curtained mirrored linened blanketed a though mr thorne with good fortune be coming home to morrow for girl of twelve year old how said mr umbleby to friend miss gushing how did find out what to buy a though doctor have be brought up like wild beast ignorant of nature of table chair with more developed idea of drawing room drapery than hippopotamus to utter amazement of mr umbleby miss gushing doctor did very well said nothing about to one never did say much about such thing furnished house well discreetly when mary thorne came home from school at bath to have be taken six year previously found called upon to be presiding genius of perfect paradise have be said that doctor have managed to endear to new squire before old squire death that therefore change at greshamsbury have have professional ill effect upon such be case at time nevertheless did not go smoothly in greshamsbury medical department there be six seven year difference in age between mr gresham doctor moreover mr gresham be young for age doctor old nevertheless there be very close attachment between early in life be never thoroughly sundered backed by doctor did maintain for year before fire of lady arabella artillery drop falling if fall constantly will bore through stone dr thorne pretension mixed with subversive professional democratic tendency seven sixpenny visit added to utter disregard of lady arabella air be too much for spirit brought frank through first trouble at first ingratiated be equally successful with early dietary of augusta beatrice a success be obtained in direct opposition to courcy castle nursery principle hardly did much in favour when third daughter be born at once declared that be very weakly flower sternly forbade mother to go to london mother loving babe obeyed did not le hate doctor for order firmly believed be given at instance express dictation of mr gresham then little girl came into world doctor be more imperative than ever a to nursery rule excellence of country air quarrel be thus engendered lady arabella be taught to believe that doctor of husband be after solomon in husband absence sent for dr fillgrave giving very express intimation that must not have to wound either eye dignity by encountering enemy found dr fillgrave great comfort to then dr thorne gave mr gresham to understand under such circumstance must not visit professionally at greshamsbury longer poor squire saw there be help for though still maintained friendly connexion with neighbour seven sixpenny visit be at end dr fillgrave from barchester gentleman at silverbridge divided responsibility between nursery principle of courcy castle be again in vogue at greshamsbury so thing went on for year year be year of sorrow must not ascribe to doctor enemy suffering sickness death occurred four frail little one died must probably have be taken have lady arabella be more tolerant of dr thorne fact be that did die that mother heart then got better of woman pride lady arabella humbled before dr thorne humbled must have done so have doctor permitted with eye full of tear stopped utterance of apology took two hand in pressed warmly assured that joy in returning must be great for love that bore to belonged to greshamsbury so seven sixpenny visit be recommenced great triumph of dr fillgrave came to end great be joy in greshamsbury nursery when second change took place among doctor attribute not hitherto mentioned be aptitude for society of child delighted to talk to child to play with must carry on back three four at time roll with on ground race with in garden invent game for contrive amusement in circumstance seemed quite adverse to manner of delight above physic be not nearly so nasty a came from silverbridge have great theory a to happiness of child though be not disposed altogether to throw over precept of solomon always bargaining that must under circumstance be executioner argued that principal duty parent owed to child be to make happy not only be man to be made happy future man if might be possible existing boy be to be treated with equal favour happiness so said doctor be of much easier attainment why struggle after future advantage at expense of present pain seeing that result be so very doubtful many opponent of doctor have thought to catch on hip when so singular doctrine be broached be not always successful what said sensible enemy be johnny not to be taught to read because doe not like johnny must read by mean must doctor answer be necessary that must not like if preceptor have in may not johnny learn not only to read to like to learn to read must say enemy child must be controlled so must men also must say doctor must not steal peach make love to wife libel character much a might wish through natural depravity to indulge in such vice be debarred from without pain may almost say without unhappiness so argument went on party convincing other in meantime child of neighbourhood became very fond of dr thorne dr thorne squire be still fast friend circumstance have occurred spreading now over period of many year almost made poor squire uneasy in doctor company mr gresham owed large sum of money have already sold portion of property unfortunately have be pride of gresham acre have descended from one to without entail so that possessor of greshamsbury have have full power to dispose of property a pleased doubt a to going to male heir have never hitherto be felt have occasionally be encumbered by charge for younger child charge have be liquidated property have come down without burden to present squire now portion of have be sold have be sold to certain degree through agency of dr thorne made squire unhappy man man loved family name honour old family blazon standing more thoroughly than did be whit gresham at heart spirit have be weaker than of forefather in day for first time gresham be to go to wall ten year before beginning of story have be necessary to raise large sum of money to meet pay off pressing liability be found that must be done with more material advantage by selling portion of property than in other way portion of about third of whole in value be accordingly sold boxall hill lay half way between greshamsbury barchester be known a having best partridge shooting in county a having on also celebrated fox cover boxall gorse held in very high repute by barsetshire sportsman there be residence on immediate estate be altogether divided from remainder of greshamsbury property with many inward outward groan mr gresham permitted to be sold be sold sold well by private contract to native of barchester who having risen from world rank have made for great wealth somewhat of man character must hereafter be told will suffice to say that relied for advice in money matter upon dr thorne at dr thorne suggestion have purchased boxall hill partridge shooting gorse cover included have not only bought boxall hill have subsequently lent squire large sum of money on mortgage in transaction doctor have taken part have therefore come to pas mr gresham be not unfrequently called upon to discus money affair with dr thorne occasionally to submit to lecture advice might perhaps a well have be omitted so much for dr thorne few word must still be said about miss mary before rush into story crust will then have be broken pie will be open to guest little miss mary be kept at farm house till be six be then sent to school at bath transplanted to doctor newly furnished house little more than six year after that must not be supposed that have lost sight of charge during earlier year be much too well aware of nature of promise have made to departing mother to do that have constantly visited little niece long before first twelve year of life be over have lost consciousness of promise of duty to mother in stronger tie of downright personal love for only creature belonged to when mary came home doctor be like child in glee prepared surprise for with a much forethought trouble a though be contriving mine to blow up enemy took first into shop then into kitchen thence to dining room after to bedroom so on till came to full glory of new drawing room enhancing pleasure by little joke telling that must never dare to come into last paradise without permission not then till have taken off boot child a be understood joke carried on like little queen so soon became firmest of friend though mary be queen be still necessary that must be educated be earlier day in lady arabella have humbled to show humility invited mary to share music lesson of augusta beatrice at great house music master from barchester came over three time week remained for three hour if doctor chose to send girl over must pick up what be going on without doing harm so said lady arabella doctor with many thanks with hesitation accepted offer merely adding that have perhaps better settle separately with signor cantabili music master be very much obliged to lady arabella for giving little girl permission to join lesson to of miss gresham need hardly be said that lady arabella be on fire at once settle with signor cantabili indeed must do that there must be expense incurred in such arrangement on miss thorne account here a in most thing doctor carried point being time of lady humility must not make a good fight a must otherwise have done thus found to great disgust mary thorne be learning music in schoolroom on equal term a regarded payment with own daughter arrangement having be made must not be broken especially a young lady in nowise made disagreeable more especially a miss gresham be very fond of so mary thorne learnt music at greshamsbury with music learnt other thing also how to behave among girl of own age how to speak talk a other young lady do how to dress how to move walk being quick to learn learnt without trouble at great house something also learnt of french seeing that greshamsbury french governess be always in room then few year later there came rector rector sister with latter mary studied german french also from doctor learnt much choice namely of english book for own reading habit of thought somewhat akin to own though modified by feminine softness of individual mind so mary thorne grew up be educated of personal appearance certainly be business a author to say something be heroine a such must necessarily be very beautiful in truth mind inner quality be more clearly distinct to brain than outward form feature know that be far from being tall far from being showy that foot hand be small delicate that eye be bright when looked at not brilliant so a to make brilliancy palpably visible to around hair be dark brown worn very plainly brushed from forehead lip be thin mouth perhaps in general inexpressive when be eager in conversation must show to be animated with curve of wondrous energy quiet a be in manner sober demure a be usual settled appearance must talk when fit came on with energy in truth surprised who did not know aye sometimes who did energy nay be occasionally concentration of passion left for moment perfectly unconscious of other care solicitude for subject might then be advocating friend including doctor have at time be made unhappy by vehemence of character yet be to very vehemence that owed that friend so loved have once nearly banished in early year from greshamsbury schoolroom yet ended in making claim to remain there so strong that lady arabella must no longer oppose even when have wish to do so new french governess have lately come to greshamsbury be be to be great pet with lady arabella having great gift with governess can be endowed being also protegee from castle castle in greshamsbury parlance always meant that of courcy soon after valued little locket belonging to augusta gresham be missing french governess have objected to being worn in schoolroom have be sent up to bedroom by young servant girl daughter of small farmer on estate locket be missing after while considerable noise in matter having be made be found by diligence of governess somewhere among belonging of english servant great be anger of lady arabella loud be protestation of girl mute woe of father piteous tear of mother inexorable judgment of greshamsbury world something occurred matter now not what to separate mary thorne in opinion from world at large out then spoke to face accused governess of robbery for two day mary be in disgrace almost a deep a of farmer daughter be quiet dumb in disgrace when lady arabella must not hear went to mr gresham forced uncle to move in matter gained over to side one by one potentate of parish ended by bringing mambeelle larron down on knee with confession of fact from time mary thorne be dear to tenantry of greshamsbury specially dear at one small household where rough spoken father of family be often heard to declare that for miss mary thorne 'd face man magistrate duke devil so mary thorne grew up under doctor eye at beginning of tale be one of guest assembled at greshamsbury on coming of age of heir having then arrived at same period of life chapter iv lesson from courcy castle be first of july young frank gresham birthday london season be not yet over nevertheless lady de courcy have managed to get down into country to grace coming of age of heir bringing with lady amelia rosina margaretta alexandrina together with such of honourable john george a must be collected for occasion lady arabella have contrived year to spend ten week in town

seven hundred pound have of course have carriage horse girl of course have gone out have be positively necessary to have few friend in portman square altogether ten week have not be unpleasant not inexpensive for few confidential minute before dinner lady de courcy sister in law sat together in latter dressing room discussing unreasonableness of squire who have expressed with more than ordinary bitterness a to folly have probably used stronger word of london proceeding heaven said countess with much eager animation what can man expect what doe wish to do must like to sell house in london bury here for ever mind be there only for ten week barely time for girl to get teeth properly looked at arabella what doe say lady de courcy be very anxious to learn exact truth of matter ascertain if must whether mr gresham be really a poor a pretended to be why said yesterday that must have more going to town at that be barely able to pay claim made on keep up house here that must not must not what asked countess why said that must not utterly ruin poor frank ruin frank be what said surely arabella be not so bad a what possible reason can there be for to be in debt be always talking of election dear boxall hill paid off of course frank will not have such income a there be when married into family know that whom will have to thank father boxall hill paid debt why must there be difficulty now be nasty dog rosina said lady arabella almost in tear well for one never approved of hound coming to greshamsbury when man have once involved property must not incur expense be not absolutely necessary be golden rule mr gresham ought to have remembered indeed put to nearly in very word mr gresham never did never will receive with common civility anything come from know rosina never did yet where must have be for de courcys so exclaimed in gratitude lady arabella to speak truth however for de courcys mr gresham might have be at moment on top of boxall hill monarch of

a have subscription say subscription be little nothing be nonsense dear now arabella what doe do with money be question doe gamble well said lady arabella very slowly think doe if squire did gamble must have done very slyly for rarely went away from greshamsbury certainly very few men looking like gambler be in habit of coming thither a guest think doe gamble lady arabella put emphasis on word

have never known anything like at courcy castle surely umbleby know about doe not so much a doctor said lady arabella countess shook head slowly idea of mr gresham country gentleman of good estate like making confidant of country doctor be too great shock for nerve for while be constrained to sit silent before must recover one thing at rate be certain arabella said countess a soon a found again sufficiently composed to offer counsel in properly dictatorial manner one thing at rate be certain if mr gresham be involved so deeply a say frank have one duty before must marry money heir of fourteen thousand year may indulge in looking for blood a mr gresham did dear must be understood that there be very little compliment in a lady arabella have always conceived to be beauty for beauty a men do continued countess thinking of choice that present earl de courcy have made frank must marry money hope will understand early do make understand before make fool of when man thoroughly understands when know what circumstance require why matter becomes easy to hope that frank understands that have alternative in position must marry money ala ala frank gresham have already made fool

gratification in near connexion have with earl countess when wanted to support family greatness must sometimes weakly fall back upon grandeur of courcy castle be only when talking to wife that invariably snubbed pretension of noble relative two men after remained silent for while then doctor renewing subject for have be summoned into book room remarked that a scatcherd be now in country did not say be now at boxall hill a did not wish to wound squire ear perhaps have better go see ascertain in what way affair of money might be arranged there be doubt said that scatcherd must supply sum required at lower rate of interest than at must be procured through umbleby mean very well said squire will leave in hand then think ten thousand pound will do now will dress for dinner then doctor left perhaps reader will suppose after that doctor have pecuniary interest of own in arranging squire loan at rate will think that squire must have so thought not in least neither have such interest did squire think that have what dr thorne did in matter squire well knew be done for love squire of greshamsbury be great man at greshamsbury behoved to maintain greatness of squirehood when discussing affair with village doctor so much have at rate learnt from contact with de courcys doctor proud arrogant contradictory headstrong a be why did bear to be thus snubbed because knew that squire of greshamsbury when struggling with debt poverty required indulgence for weakness have mr gresham be in easy circumstance doctor must by mean have stood so placidly with hand in pocket have have mr umbleby thus thrown in teeth doctor loved squire loved a own oldest friend loved ten time better a being in adversity than must ever have done have thing gone well at greshamsbury in time while be going on downstairs mary be sitting upstairs with beatrice gresham in schoolroom old schoolroom so called be now sitting room devoted to use of grown up young lady of family whereas one of old nursery be now modern schoolroom mary well knew way to sanctum without asking question walked up to when uncle went to squire on entering room found that augusta lady alexandrina be also there hesitated for moment at door come in mary said beatrice know cousin alexandrina mary came in having shaken hand with two friend be bowing to lady when lady condescended put out noble hand touched miss thorne finger beatrice be mary friend many heart burning much mental solicitude did that young lady give to mother by indulging in such friendship beatrice with fault be true at heart persisted in loving mary thorne in spite of hint mother so frequently gave a to impropriety of such affection have augusta objection to society of miss thorne augusta be strong minded girl with much of de courcy arrogance quite a well inclined to show in opposition to mother a in other form to alone in house did lady arabella show much deference be now going to make suitable match with man of large fortune who have be procured for a eligible parti by aunt countess did not pretend have never pretended that loved mr moffat knew said that in present state of father affair match be expedient mr moffat be young man of very large fortune in parliament inclined to business in way recommendable be not man of birth to be sure be to be lamented in confessing that mr moffat be not man of birth augusta did not go so far a to admit that be son of tailor such however be rigid truth in matter be not man of birth be to be lamented in present state of affair at greshamsbury understood well that be duty to postpone own feeling in respect mr moffat must bring fortune must bring blood connexion a so said bosom glowed with strong pride to think that must be able to contribute so much more towards proposed future partnership than husband must do 't be thus that miss gresham spoke of match to dear friend cousin de courcys for instance to miss oriel sister beatrice even to mary thorne have enthusiasm admitted thought have good judgment thought have shown good judgment in accepting mr moffat offer though did not pretend to romance of affection having so said went to work with considerable mental satisfaction choosing furniture carriage clothes not extravagantly a mother must have done not in deference to sterner dictate of latest fashion a aunt must have done with none of girlish glee in new purchase beatrice must have felt with sound judgment bought thing be rich for husband be to be rich meant to avail herself of wealth bought thing be fashionable for meant to live in fashionable world bought what be good strong lasting worth money augusta gresham have perceived early in life that must not obtain success a heiress a beauty must shine a wit therefore fell back on such quality a have determined to win world a strong minded useful woman have of own be blood having that must in way do what in lay to enhance value have not possessed must to mind have be vainest of pretence when mary came in wedding preparation be being discussed number name of bridesmaid be being settled dress be on tapis invitation to be given be talked over sensible a augusta be be not above such feminine care be indeed rather anxious that wedding must go off well be little ashamed of tailor son therefore anxious that thing must be a brilliant a possible bridesmaid name have just be written on card a mary entered room there be lady amelia rosina margaretta alexandrina of course at head of then came beatrice twin then miss oriel who though only parson sister be person of note birth fortune after there have be here great discussion whether not there must be more if there be to be one more there must be two now miss moffat have expressed direct wish augusta though must much rather have done without hardly knew how to refuse alexandrina hope may be allowed to drop lady for sake of brevity for present scene only be dead against unreasonable request none of know know must not be comfortable beatrice strongly advocated future sister in law acceptance into bevy have own reason be pained that mary thorne must not be among number if miss moffat be accepted perhaps mary might be brought in a colleague if have miss moffat said alexandrina must have dear pussy too really think that pussy be too young will be troublesome pussy be youngest miss gresham who be now only eight year old whose real name be nina augusta said beatrice speaking with slight hesitation soupcon of doubt before high authority of noble cousin if do have miss moffat must mind asking mary thorne to join think mary must like because see patience oriel be to be one have known mary much longer than have known patience then out spake lady alexandrina beatrice dear if think of what be asking be sure will see that must not do must not do at miss thorne be very nice girl be sure indeed what little have seen of highly approve after who be mamma know think that aunt arabella have be wrong to let be here so much beatrice became rather red in face in spite of dignity of cousin be preparing to defend friend mind be not saying word against miss thorne if be married before will be one of bridesmaid said beatrice will probably depend on circumstance said lady alexandrina find can not bring courteous pen to drop title augusta be very peculiarly situated mr moffat be see not of very highest birth therefore must take care that on side one about be well born then can not have miss moffat said beatrice must not if must help said cousin thornes be a good family a gresham said beatrice have not quite courage to say a good a de courcys dare say be if be miss thorne of ullathorne augusta probably must not object to can tell who miss mary thorne be be dr thorne niece mean that be called so do know who father be who mother be for one must own mamma believe doe at moment door opened gently mary thorne entered room may easily be conceived that while mary be making salutation three other young lady be little cast aback lady alexandrina however quickly recovered by inimitable presence of mind facile grace of manner soon put matter on proper footing be discussing miss gresham marriage said be sure may mention to acquaintance of so long standing a miss thorne that first of september have be now fixed for wedding miss gresham acquaintance of so long standing why mary augusta gresham have for year will hardly say now for how many passed morning together in same schoolroom have quarrelled squabbled caressed kissed be a sister to other acquaintance indeed beatrice felt that ear be tingling even augusta be little ashamed mary however knew that cold word have come from de courcy not from gresham did not therefore resent so be settled augusta be said first of september wish joy with heart coming round put arm over augusta shoulder kissed lady alexandrina must not think that doctor niece uttered congratulation very much a though be speaking to equal very much a though have father mother of own will have delicious weather continued mary september beginning of october be nicest time of year if be going honeymooning be just time of year must choose wish be mary said beatrice so dear till have found decent sort of body to honeymoon along with wo stir out of greshamsbury till have sent off before at rate where will go augusta have not settled that said augusta mr moffat talk of paris who ever heard of going to paris in september said lady alexandrina who ever heard of gentleman having anything to say on matter said doctor niece of course mr moffat will go wherever be pleased to take lady alexandrina be not pleased to find how completely doctor niece took upon to talk sit act at greshamsbury a though be on par with young lady of family that beatrice must have allowed must not have surprised be to be expected that augusta must have shown better judgment thing require tact in management delicacy when high interest be at stake said agree with miss thorne in thinking that in ordinary circumstance with ordinary people perhaps lady must have way rank however have drawback miss thorne a well a privilege must not object to drawback said doctor niece presuming to be of use fear might fail in getting on so well with privilege lady alexandrina looked at a though not fully aware whether intended to be pert in truth lady alexandrina be rather in dark on subject be almost impossible be incredible that fatherless motherless doctor niece must be pert to earl daughter at greshamsbury seeing that earl daughter be cousin of miss gresham yet lady alexandrina hardly knew what other construction to put on word have just heard be at rate clear to that be not becoming that must just then stay longer in room whether intended to be pert not miss mary thorne be to say least very free de courcy lady knew what be due to lady better therefore lady alexandrina made up mind at once to go to own bedroom augusta said rising slowly from chair with much stately composure be nearly time to dress will come with have great deal to settle know so swam out of room augusta telling mary that must see again at dinner swam tried to swim after miss gresham have have great advantage have not be absolutely brought up at courcy castle must not a yet quite assume courcy style of swimming there said mary a door closed behind rustling muslin of lady there have made enemy for ever perhaps two satisfactory why have done mary when be fighting battle behind back why do come upset by making whole family of de courcys dislike in matter a will go together be sure will said mary whether must be equally unanimous in case of love charity that indeed be question why must try to make cousin angry ought to have so much sense remember what be saying other day of absurdity of combatting pretence world sanction do trichy do scold now be so much easier to preach than to practise do so wish be clergyman have done so much harm mary have said mary kneeling down on ground at friend foot if humble very low if kneel through whole evening in corner if put neck down let cousin trample on then aunt must not that make atonement must not object to wearing sackcloth 'd eat little ash at rate 'd try know be clever mary still think be fool do indeed be fool trichy do confess be not bit clever scold see how humble be not only humble umble look upon to be comparative indeed superlative degree perhaps there be four degree humble umble stumble tumble then when one be absolutely in dirt at foot perhaps big people wo wish one to stoop further oh mary oh trichy mean to say may speak out before there perhaps 'd like to put foot on neck then put head down to footstool kissed beatrice foot 'd like if dared to put hand on cheek give good slap for being such goose do do trichy will tread on slap kiss whichever like ca tell how vexed be said beatrice wanted to arrange something arrange something what arrange what love arranging fancy qualified to be arranger general in female matter mean pot pan such like of course allude to extraordinary people extraordinary circumstance require tact delicacy drawback sort of thing very well mary be not very well be very bad if look like well pet there wo wo allude to noble blood of noble relative in joke in earnest what be want to arrange trichy want to be one of augusta bridesmaid good heaven beatrice be mad what put even for morning into same category of finery a noble blood from courcy castle patience be to be one be reason why impatience must be must be very impatient under such honour trichy joking apart think of even if augusta wished must refuse must be obliged to refuse too suffer from pride pride quite a unpardonable a of others must not stand with four lady cousin behind sister at altar in such galaxy must be star why mary world know that be prettier than of be world very humble servant trichy must not object if be a ugly a veiled prophet a beautiful a zuleika glory of galaxy will be held to depend not on beauty on birth know how must look at how must scorn there in church at altar with be solemn round must not return scorn a might do elsewhere in room be not bit afraid of mary be again allowing to be absorbed by feeling of indomitable pride of antagonism to pride of others in cooler moment be first to blame often say mary that sort of arrogance must be despised passed over without notice so must trichy tell that a clergyman tell to hate rich though clergyman tell so be not le anxious to be rich particularly wish to be one of augusta bridesmaid particularly wish to decline honour honour have not be will not be offered to trichy will not be augusta bridesmaid what dearest trichy when one else be married when new wing have be built to house that know of now mary hold tongue know will make angry do so like to see angry when time come when wedding doe take place then will be bridesmaid trichy yes even though be not invited yes though de courcys in barsetshire must tread upon obliterate though must be a dust among star though must creep up in calico among satin lace will nevertheless be there close close to bride to hold something for to touch dress to feel that be near to to to to threw arm round companion kissed over over again trichy wo be augusta bridesmaid will bide time for bridesmaiding what protestation beatrice made against probability of such event a foreshadowed in friend

brought together to do honour to young frank perhaps be called on to take more prominent part in proceeding to be made more of hero than must have be case have county be there in case importance of guest must have be so great that frank must have got off with half muttered speech two now have to make separate oration to one very weary work found batesons baker jackson be very civil doubt more so from unconscious feeling on part that a squire be known to be little out at elbow a regard money deficiency on part might be considered a owing to present state of affair at greshamsbury fourteen thousand year will receive honour in case there be doubt man absolutely possessing be not apt to be suspicious a to treatment may receive ghost of fourteen thousand year be not always so self assured mr baker with moderate income be very much richer man than squire therefore be peculiarly forward in congratulating frank on brilliancy of prospect poor frank have hardly anticipated what there must be to do before dinner be announced be very tired of have warmer feeling for of grand cousin than very ordinary cousinly love have resolved forgetful of birth blood gigantic consideration now that manhood have come upon be bound always to bear in mind have resolved to sneak out to dinner comfortably with mary thorne if possible if not with mary then with other love patience oriel great therefore be consternation at finding after being kept continually in foreground for hour before dinner have to walk out to dining room with aunt countess take father place for day at bottom of table will now depend altogether upon frank whether maintain lose high position in county have be held by gresham for so many year said countess a walked through spacious hall resolving to lose time in

gresham of greshamsbury have held head up in county by having high blood plenty of money blood have come naturally to young man behoved to look for money in great measure lady de courcy must doubtless help might probably be able to fit with wife who must bring money onto birth reading be matter in must in way assist whether taste might lead to prefer book picture dog horse turnip in drill old

last word in sort of tone that parish clergyman must use in warning young farmer son that must not put on equal footing with ploughboy be at last decided that countess must herself convey to frank special invitation to courcy castle that when got there must do lay in power to prevent return to cambridge to further dunstable marriage did think of miss dunstable for porlock once said naively when found that be much over two hundred thousand why idea fell to ground term on de courcy blood might be allowed to dilute be must be presumed very high indeed augusta be sent off to find brother to send to countess in small drawing room here countess be to have tea apart from outer common world here without interruption be to teach great lesson to nephew augusta did find brother found in worst of bad society so at least stern de courcys must have thought old mr bateson governess mr everbeery cook diluted blood way paved for revolution presented to augusta mind when found brother walking with other company than mary thorne walking with too in much too close proximity how have contrived to be off with old love so soon on with new rather to be off with new love again on with old will not stop to inquire have lady arabella in truth known son doings in way must have guessed how very nigh have approached iniquity of old mr bateson to folly of young mr everbeery must in truth have be in hurry to send off to courcy castle miss dunstable day before commencement of story young frank have sworn in sober earnest in what intended for most sober earnest most earnest sobriety that loved mary thorne with love for word must find sufficient expression with love must never die never grow dim never become le opposition on part of others must extinguish opposition on part must repel that might must must must have for wife that if told did love must oh oh mary do love love wo love say will oh mary dearest mary will wo do come now have right to give fellow answer with such eloquence have heir of greshamsbury when not yet twenty one year of age attempted to posse of affection of doctor niece yet three day afterwards be quite ready to flirt with miss oriel if such thing be done in green wood what will be done in dry what have mary said when fervent protestation of undying love have be thrown at foot mary must be remembered be very nearly of same age a frank a others have so often said before woman grow on sunny side of wall though frank be only boy behoved mary to be something more than girl frank might be allowed without laying open to much just reproach to throw of what believed to be heart into protestation of what believed to be love mary be in duty bound to be more thoughtful more reticent more aware of fact of position more careful of own feeling more careful also of yet must not put down a young lady might put down young gentleman be very seldom that young man unless be tipsy assumes unwelcome familiarity in early acquaintance with girl when acquaintance have be long intimate familiarity must follow a matter of course frank mary have be so much together in holiday have so constantly consorted together a boy girl that a regarded have not that innate fear of woman represses young man tongue be so used to good humour fun high jovial spirit be withal so fond of that be very difficult for to mark with accurate feeling stop with reserved brow shade of change from boy liking to man love beatrice too have done harm in matter with spirit painfully unequal to of grand relative have quizzed mary frank about early flirtation have done have instinctively avoided doing so before mother sister have thus made secret of a be between mary brother have given currency a be to idea that there might be something serious between two not that beatrice have ever wished to promote marriage between have even thought of such thing be girlish thoughtless imprudent inartistic very unlike de courcy very unlike de courcy be in nevertheless have de courcy veneration for blood more than that have gresham feeling joined to of de courcys lady amelia must not for world have have de courcy blood defiled gold thought must not defile now beatrice be ashamed of sister marriage have often declared within own heart that nothing must have made marry mr moffat have said so also to mary mary have told that be right mary also be proud of blood be proud of uncle blood two girl talked together in warmth of girlish confidence of great glory of family tradition family honour beatrice have talked in utter ignorance a to friend birth mary poor mary have talked being a ignorant not without strong suspicion at future time day of sorrow must tell fearful truth on one point mary mind be strongly made up wealth no mere worldly advantage must make one superior if be born gentlewoman then be fit to match with gentleman let most wealthy man in europe pour wealth at foot must if so inclined give back at rate more than that offered at foot knew must never tempt to yield up fortress of heart guardianship of soul possession of mind not that alone that even a possible slightest fraction of make weight if be born gentlewoman then came to mind curious question what make gentleman make gentlewoman be inner reality spiritualised quintessence of privilege in world men call rank force thousand hundred of thousand to bow down before few elect what give can give must give answered question absolute intrinsic acknowledged individual merit must give to possessor let be whom what whence might so far spirit of democracy be strong with beyond must be have by inheritance received a be second hand twenty second hand so far spirit of aristocracy be strong within have a may be imagined learnt in early year from uncle be at great pain to teach beatrice gresham chosen of heart when frank declared that mary have right to give answer meant that have right to expect one mary acknowledged right gave to mr gresham said oh mary mr gresham yes mr gresham must be mr gresham after moreover must be miss thorne a well will be shot if will mary well ca say that will be shot if be not so if be not so if agree that will be so will be turned out of greshamsbury what mean mother said frank indeed mean such thing said mary with flash from eye that made frank almost start mean such thing mean not mother be not in least afraid of lady arabella be afraid of afraid of mary miss thorne pray pray remember must be miss thorne turn out of greshamsbury separate from beatrice be will drive out one else must stand ground against mother feel must can not stand against if treat otherwise than than otherwise than what want to treat a girl have chosen from world a wife be sorry must so soon have found necessary to make choice mr gresham must not joke about at present be sure must not willingly injure if speak to of again in way will injure injure so much that will be forced to leave greshamsbury in own defence know be too generous to drive to so interview have ended frank of course went upstairs to see if new pocket pistol be ready properly cleaned loaded capped must find after few day experience that prolonged existence be unendurable however managed to live through subsequent period doubtless with view of preventing disappointment to father guest chapter vii doctor garden mary have contrived to quiet lover with considerable propriety of demeanour then came on somewhat harder task of quieting young lady on whole be perhaps quite a susceptible of softer feeling a young gentleman be now frank gresham be handsome amiable by mean fool in intellect excellent in heart be moreover gentleman being son of mr gresham of greshamsbury mary have be a be brought up to love have aught good happened to must have cried a for brother must not therefore be supposed that when frank gresham told that loved have heard altogether unconcerned have not perhaps made declaration with propriety of language in such scene be generally described a being carried on lady may perhaps think that mary must have be deterred by very boyishness of manner from thinking at seriously on subject will wo do doe not sound like poetic rapture of highly inspired lover nevertheless there have be warmth reality in not in repulsive mary anger anger not anger objection to declaration be probably not based on absurdity of lover language be inclined to think that matter be not always discussed by mortal lover in poetically passionate phraseology be generally thought to be appropriate for description man can not well describe have never seen heard absolute word act of one such scene did once come to author knowledge couple be by mean plebeian below proper standard of high bearing high breeding be handsome pair living among educated people sufficiently given to mental pursuit in way what pair of polite lover ought to be important conversation passed in wise site of passionate scene be sea shore on be walking in autumn gentleman well miss long short of be here be can take leave lady scratching gutter on sand with parasol so a to allow little salt water to run out of one hole into of course know be nonsense gentleman nonsense by jove be nonsense at come jane here be come at rate can say something lady yes suppose can say something gentleman well be to be take leave lady very slowly with voice perhaps hardly articulate carrying on at same time engineering work on wider scale well exactly want to leave so matter be settled settled with much propriety satisfaction lady gentleman must have thought have ever thought about matter at that sweetest moment of life have be graced by poetry by such moment ought to be hallowed when mary have a thought properly subdued young frank offer of whose love at rate knew be at such period of life utter absurdity then found necessary to subdue happiness on earth must be greater than possession of such love have true possession be justly honestly within reach what man must be more lovable than man a must grow from such boy then did not love love already without waiting for change did not feel that there be that about about about too might so well fit for other must be so sweet to be sister of beatrice daughter of squire to belong to greshamsbury a part parcel of though must not restrain thought never for moment occurred to to take frank offer in earnest though be grown woman be still boy must have to see world before settled in must change mind about woman score of time before married then too though did not like lady arabella felt that owed something if not to kindness at least to forbearance knew felt inwardly certain that must be doing wrong that world must say be doing wrong that uncle must think wrong if endeavoured to take advantage of what have passed have not for instant doubted not for moment have contemplated a possible that must ever become mr gresham because frank have offered to make so nevertheless must not help thinking of what have occurred of thinking of most probably much more than frank did day two afterwards on evening before frank birthday be alone with uncle walking in garden behind house then essayed to question with object of learning if be fitted by birth to be wife of such one a frank gresham be in habit of walking there together when happened to be at home of summer evening be not often case for hour of labour extended much beyond usual to upper working world hour namely between breakfast dinner minute that did thus pas together doctor regarded a perhaps pleasantest of life uncle said after while what do think of marriage of miss gresham well minnie such be name of endearment for ca say have thought much about suppose anybody else have must think about of course so must suppose be not so sure of folk must never get married if have to trouble with thinking about suppose that be why never got married uncle that thinking of too much one be a bad a other mary have not contrived to get at near point a yet so have to draw off after while begin again well have be thinking about at rate uncle be very good of will save trouble perhaps save miss gresham too if have thought over thoroughly will do for believe mr moffat be man of family will mend in point doubt when have got wife uncle be goose what be worse very provoking goose niece be gander what be worse very silly gander what be mr moffat family to mr have that rank above family honour be very rich man yes said mary know be rich rich man suppose can buy anything except woman be worth having rich man can buy anything said doctor not meant to say that mr moffat have bought miss gresham have doubt that will suit other very well added with air of decisive authority a though have finished subject niece be determined not to let pas so now uncle said know be pretending to great deal of worldly wisdom after be not wisdom at in eye be know be a for impropriety of discussing miss gresham marriage did not say be improper oh yes did of course such thing must be discussed how be one to have opinion if one doe not get by looking at thing happen around now be going to be blown up said dr thorne dear uncle do be serious with well then seriously hope miss gresham will be very happy a mr moffat of course do so do hope a much a can hope what at see ground for expecting people constantly hope without such ground well then will hope in case uncle well dear want opinion truly really if be girl be perfectly unable to give opinion founded on so strange hypothesis well if be marrying man hypothesis be quite a much out of way uncle be girl perhaps may marry at rate think of marrying day latter alternative be certainly possible enough therefore in seeing friend taking such step can not speculate on matter a though be in place if be miss gresham must be right minnie be not miss gresham be mary thorne be very different thing know suppose might marry one without degrading be almost ill natured of to say have not meant to say in sense sound seemed to bear have failed in being able to bring uncle to point wished by road have planned in seeking road have abruptly fallen into unpleasant place must be very sorry that niece must think so said be sorry too that must say so mary to tell truth hardly know at what be driving be think not so clear minded certainly not so clear worded a be usual with will tell uncle instead of looking up into face turned eye down on green lawn beneath foot well minnie what be took hand in think that miss gresham must not marry mr moffat think so because family be high noble because be low ignoble when one have opinion on such matter one can not apply to thing people around one having applied opinion to next step naturally be to apply to myself be miss gresham must not marry mr moffat though rolled in gold know where to rank miss gresham what want to know be where ought to rank have be standing when commenced last speech a finished doctor moved on again moved with walked on slowly without answering out of full mind pursued aloud tenor of thought if woman feel that must not lower herself by marrying in rank beneath ought also to feel that must not lower man that might love by allowing to marry into rank beneath own be to marry doe not follow said doctor quickly man raise woman to own standard woman must take that of man marries again be silent again walked on mary holding uncle arm with hand be determined however to come to point after considering for while how best might do ceased to beat longer about bush asked plain question thornes be a good family a gresham be not in absolute genealogy be dear be when choose to be old fool talk of such matter in sense different from in be spoken of by world at large may say that thornes be a good perhaps better than gresham must be sorry to say so seriously to one gresham now stand much higher in county than thornes do be of same class yes yes wilfred thorne of ullathorne friend squire here be of same class uncle augusta gresham be of same class well minnie must hardly have boast that be same class with squire poor country doctor be not answering fairly dear uncle dearest uncle do not know that be not answering fairly know what mean have right to call thornes of ullathorne cousin mary mary mary said after minute pause still allowing arm to hang loose that might hold with hand mary mary mary must that have spared must not have spared to for ever uncle must that must have done so must that must be over now uncle be told now will grieve more dear dear dearest must love more than ever now must must must if be possible what must be for what must have be for threw on breast clinging with arm round neck kissed forehead cheek lip there be nothing more said then on subject between mary asked further question did doctor volunteer further information must have be most anxious to ask about mother history have dared to do so did not dare to ask must not bear to be told that mother have be perhaps be worthless woman that be truly daughter of brother of doctor that did know little a have heard of relative in early youth few a have be word have fallen from uncle in hearing a to parentage did know that be daughter of henry thorne brother of doctor son of old prebendary trifling little thing have occurred accident must not be prevented have told not word have ever passed one lip a to mother doctor when speaking of youth have spoken of father one have spoken of mother have long known that be child of thorne now knew also that be cousin of thornes of ullathorne cousin at least in world ordinary language niece indeed of uncle unless by special permission that must be so when interview be over went up alone to drawing room there sat thinking have not be there long before uncle came up to did not sit down even take off hat still wore coming close to still standing spoke thus mary after what have passed must be very unjust very cruel to not to tell one thing more than have now learned mother be unfortunate in much not in everything world be very often stern in such matter never judged to have disgraced tell child in order that may respect memory so saying again left without giving time to speak word what then told have told in mercy felt what must be feeling when reflected that have to blush for mother that not only must not speak of mother that might hardly think of with innocence to mitigate such sorrow a also to do justice to woman whom brother have so wronged have forced to reveal so much a be stated above then walked slowly by backwards forward through garden thinking of what have done with reference to girl doubting whether have done wisely well have resolved when first little infant be given over to charge that nothing must be known of by a to mother be willing to devote to orphan child of brother last seedling of father house be not willing so to do a to bring in manner into familiar contact with scatcherds have boasted to that at rate be gentleman that if be to live in house sit at table share hearth must be lady must tell lie about must not to one make out to be aught other aught better than be people must talk about her of course only let not talk to conceived of conception be not without due ground must do so have that within must silence must never claim for little creature thus brought into world without legitimate position in to stand must never claim for station must not properly be own must make for station a best must a might sink swim so must so have resolved thing have arranged a often do rather than be arranged by during ten twelve year one have heard of mary thorne memory of henry thorne tragic death have passed away knowledge that infant have be born whose birth be connected with tragedy knowledge never widely spread have faded down into utter ignorance at end of twelve year dr thorne have announced that young niece child of brother long since dead be coming to live with a have contemplated spoke to people did doubt talk among whether not exact truth be surmised by matter not to say with absolute exactness probably not with great approach to probably yes by one person at rate guess be made thought relative to dr thorne niece ever troubled idea that mary scatcherd have left child in england ever occurred to that person be roger scatcherd mary brother to one friend only one did doctor tell whole truth be to old squire have told said doctor partly that may know that child have right to mix with child if think much of such thing do however see to must rather that one else must be told one else have be told squire have seen to by accustoming to look at mary thorne running about house with own child a though be of same brood indeed squire have always be fond of mary have personally noticed in affair of mambeelle larron have declared that must have placed at once on bench of magistrate much to disgust of lady arabella so thing have gone on on have not be thought of with much downright thinking till now when be one twenty year of age niece came to asking a to position inquiring in what rank of life be to look for husband so doctor walked backwards forward through garden slowly thinking now with earnestness what if after have be wrong about niece what if by endeavouring to place in position of lady have falsely so placed robbed of legitimate position what if there be rank of life to must now properly attach then how have answered that plan of of keeping to dr thorne be still poor man gift of saving money have not be have ever have comfortable house for to live in in spite of doctor fillgrave century rerechild others have made from profession income sufficient for joint want have not done a others do have three four thousand pound in three per cent on mary might live in comfort when must die late in life have insured life for eight hundred pound to that only have to trust for mary future maintenance how have answered then plan of letting be unknown to undreamed of by who be a near to on mother side a be on father on side though there have be utter poverty there be now absolute wealth when took to have not rescued from very depth of lowest misery from degradation of workhouse from scorn of honest born charity child from lowest of world low condition be not now apple of eye one great sovereign comfort pride happiness glory be to make over to make portion of over to others if by doing so might be able to share wealth a well a coarse manner uncouth society of at present unknown connexion who have never worshipped wealth on own behalf who have scorned idol of gold have ever be teaching to scorn be now to show that philosophy have be false a soon a temptation to do so be put in way yet what man must marry bastard child without sixpence bring not only poverty ill blood also on own child might be very well for dr thorne for whose career be made whose name at rate be own for who have fixed standing ground in world might be well for to indulge in large view of philosophy antagonistic to world practice have right to do for niece what man must marry girl so placed for among whom might have legitimately found level education have now utterly unfitted then well knew that must never put out hand in token of love to one without telling knew surmised a to own birth question of evening have not be instigated by appeal to heart be there not already within breast cause for disquietude have made so pertinacious why else have told then for first time that did not know where to rank if appeal have be made to must have come from young frank gresham what in such case must behove to do must pack up lancet case pestle mortar seek anew fresh ground in new world leaving behind huge triumph to learned enemy of fillgrave century rerechild better than remain at greshamsbury at cost of child heart pride so walked slowly backwards forward through garden meditating thing painfully enough chapter viii matrimonial prospect will of course be remembered that mary interview with other girl at greshamsbury took place two three day subsequently to frank generous offer of hand heart mary have quite made up mind that whole thing be to be regarded a folly that be not to be spoken of to one yet heart be sore enough be full of pride yet knew must bow neck to pride of others being a be nameless must not feel stern unflinching antagonism antagonism of democrat to pretension of others who be blessed with of have be deprived have feeling yet of thing that coveted most coveted that for glorying in be determined to heap scorn on others said to herself proudly that god handiwork be inner man inner woman naked creature animated by living soul that other adjunct be man clothing for creature others whether stitched by tailor contrived by king be not within capacity to do a nobly to love a truly to worship god in heaven with a perfect faith god on earth with a leal troth a though blood have descended to purely through score of purely born progenitor so to herself spoke yet a said knew that be man man a heir of greshamsbury must be nothing must tempt to sully child blood by mating with one be base born felt that be augusta gresham mr moffat let wealth be what might must win hand unless too must tell of family honour line of ancestor so with mind at war with came forth armed to do battle against world prejudice prejudice loved so well be to give up old affection feminine love because found that be cousin to nobody be no longer to pour out heart to beatrice gresham with girlish volubility of equal be to be severed from patience oriel banished rather be to banish from free place have maintained in various youthful female conclave held within parish of greshamsbury hitherto what mary thorne must say what miss thorne suggested in such such matter be quite a frequently asked a opinion from augusta gresham quite a frequently unless when chanced that of de courcy girl be at house be to be given up feeling have grown up among since be child have not hitherto be questioned among now be questioned by mary thorne be in fact to find that position have be false one must be changed such have be feeling when protested that must not be augusta gresham bridesmaid offered to put neck beneath beatrice foot when drove lady margaretta out of room gave own opinion a to proper grammatical construction of word humble such also have be feeling when kept hand so rigidly to while frank held dining room door open for to

countess have specially forewarned mother augusta be a well knew doing duty by family by marrying tailor son for whom did not care chip seeing tailor son be possessed of untold wealth now when one member of household be making struggle for family be painful to see benefit of struggle negatived by folly of member future mr moffat did feel aggrieved by fatuity of young heir consequently took upon to look a much like aunt de courcy a must do well what be said frank looking rather disgusted what make stick chin up look in way frank have hitherto be rather despot among sister forgot that eldest

proud a queen have lady de courcy met at moment must almost have felt forced to shrink out of pathway not say word of repeated to herself still out loud word need be left unsaid on account none none augusta followed dumfounded at indignation frank also followed not in silence when first surprise at mary great anger be over felt called upon to say word might tend to exonerate lady love word also of protestation a to own purpose there be nothing to be told nothing at least of mary said speaking to sister of may tell if choose to disoblige brother that love mary thorne with heart will never love one else by time have reached lawn mary be able to turn away from path led up to house a left said in voice now low enough can not prevent from talking nonsense augusta will bear witness that

frank be use now said looking back to can not be cured first commoner in barsetshire must hold position will not of course say equal to of peer oh dear of course not said frank bystander might have thought that there be touch of satire in tone not equal to of peer still of very paramount importance of course first ambition be bound up in porlock of course said frank thinking how very weak be staff on aunt ambition rested for lord porlock youthful career have not be such a to give unmitigated satisfaction to parent be bound up in porlock then countess plumed mother sighed next to porlock frank anxiety be about upon honour aunt be very much obliged will be right will see greshamsbury dear boy be not now what used to be be asked frank frank by mean wish to say word against father may

will be equal to boxall hill frank opened eye wide stared at aunt a though doubting much whether be in right mind pay off family debt buy up property of four thousand pound year remained however quite quiet waiting elucidation of mystery frank of course understand frank be obliged to declare just at present moment did not find aunt so clear a usual have one line of conduct left frank position a heir to greshamsbury be good one father have unfortunately so hampered with regard to money that unless set matter right can never enjoy position of course must marry money marry money said considering for first time that in probability mary thorne fortune must not be extensive marry money yes frank know man whose position so imperatively demand luckily for man can have more facility for doing so in first place be very handsome frank blushed like girl of sixteen then a matter be made plain to at so early age be not of course hampered by indiscreet tie by absurd engagement frank blushed again then saying to how much old girl know about felt little proud of passion for mary thorne of declaration have made to connexion with courcy castle continued countess now carrying up list of frank advantage to great climax will make matter so easy for really will hardly have difficulty frank must not say how much obliged felt to courcy castle inmate of course must not wish to interfere

much moment be thirty asked frank who looked upon unmarried woman of age a quite old maid dare say may be about age said countess who regarded subject from very different point of view thirty said frank out loud speaking nevertheless a though to be matter of moment said aunt almost angrily when subject be of such vital importance objection of real weight must not be brought into view if wish to hold up head in country if wish to represent county in parliament a have be done by father grandfather great grandfather if wish to keep house over head to leave greshamsbury to son after must marry money what doe signify whether miss dunstable be twenty eight thirty have got money if marry may then consider that position in life be made frank be astonished at aunt eloquence in spite of eloquence made up mind that must not marry miss dunstable how must indeed seeing that troth be already plighted to mary thorne in presence of sister circumstance however did not choose to plead to aunt so recapitulated other objection presented to mind in first place be so anxious about degree that must not think of marrying at present then suggested that might be better to postpone question till season hunting must be over declared that must not visit courcy castle till got new suit of clothes home from tailor ultimately remembered that have particular engagement to go fly fishing with mr oriel on day week none however of valid reason be sufficiently potent to turn countess from point nonsense frank said wonder that can talk of fly fishing when property of greshamsbury be at stake will

scatcherd have be man to do there have be extremely necessary bit of railway to be made in time that such work must properly demand speculation to be incurred requiring great mean courage a well roger scatcherd have be found to be man for time be then elevated for moment to dizzy pinnacle of newspaper hero became one of whom king delighteth to honour went up one day to kiss majesty hand come down

told that have taken over three gallon of brandy then felt sure that none scatcherd must be called upon to construct dock make railway be a may be true false that sir roger be most efficacious when in cup there can be doubt that must not wallow for week in brandy six seven time year without in great measure injuring permanently injuring outward man immediate effect such symposium might have on inner mind symposium indeed be not posiums will call if may be allowed for in latter life when drank heavily drank alone however little for evil however much for good working of brain might be affected body suffered greatly be not that became feeble emaciated old looking inactive that hand shook that eye be watery that in moment of intemperance life be often not worth day purchase frame god have given to be powerful beyond power of ordinary men powerful to act in spite of violent perturbation powerful to repress conquer qualm headache inward sickness to votary of bacchus be ordinarily

ordinary acceptance of word ate with drank with even frequently talked with pursuit in life be wide asunder taste be different society in moved very seldom came together scatcherd have nothing in unison with solitary friend trusted trusted other living creature on god earth trusted man even did not trust thoroughly not at least a one friend must trust believed that man must not rob must probably not lie to must not endeavour to make money of must not count up speculate on make out balance of profit loss therefore determined to use put trust whatever in friend counsel in mode of thought none in theory none in practice disliked friend counsel in fact disliked society for friend be somewhat apt to speak to in manner approaching to severity now roger scatcherd have done many thing in world made much money whereas friend have done few thing made money be not to be endured that practical efficient man must be taken to task by man who proved to be neither practical efficient not to be endured certainly by roger scatcherd who looked on men of own class a men of day on a by mean least among friend be friend dr thorne doctor first acquaintance with scatcherd have be already explained be necessarily thrown into communication with man at time of trial scatcherd then have not only sufficient sense sufficient feeling also to know that doctor behaved very well communication have in different way be kept up between soon after trial scatcherd have begun to rise first saving have be entrusted to doctor care have be beginning of pecuniary connexion have never wholly ceased have led to purchase of boxall hill to loan of large sum of money to squire in way also there have be close alliance between one not always of very pleasant description doctor be long have be sir roger medical attendant in unceasing attempt to rescue drunkard from fate be so much to be dreaded not unfrequently be driven into quarrel with patient one thing further must be told of sir roger in politics be a violent radical a ever be very anxious to obtain position in must bring violence to bear with view be about to contest native borough of barchester in hope of being returned in opposition to de courcy candidate with object have now come down to boxall hill be claim to sit for barchester such a must be despised if money be to be of avail have plenty of be prepared to spend whereas rumour said that mr moffat be equally determined to hing so foolish then again sir roger have sort of rough eloquence be able to address men of barchester in language must come home to heart in word must endear to one party while made offensively odious to other mr moffat must make friend enemy by eloquence barchester rough called dumb dog must not bark sometimes sarcastically added that must bite de courcy interest however be at back have also advantage of possession sir roger therefore knew that battle be not to be won without struggle dr thorne got safely back from silverbridge that evening found mary waiting to give tea have be called there to consultation with dr century that amiable old gentleman having so far fallen away from high fillgrave tenet a to consent to occasional endurance of such degradation next morning breakfasted early having mounted strong iron grey cob started for boxall hill not only have there to negotiate squire further loan also to exercise medical skill sir roger having be declared contractor for cutting canal from sea to sea through isthmus of panama have be making week of result be that lady scatcherd have written rather peremptorily to husband medical friend doctor consequently trotted off to boxall hill on iron grey cob among other merit be that of being good horseman did much of work on fact that occasionally took day with east barsetshires when did so thoroughly enjoyed have probably not failed to add something to strength of squire friendship well lady how be not much matter hope said doctor a shook hand with titled mistress of boxall hill in small breakfast parlour in rear of house show room of boxall hill be furnished most magnificently be set apart for company a company never came seeing that be never invited grand room grand furniture be not of much material use to lady scatcherd indeed then doctor be just bad enough said ladyship not in very happy tone of voice just bad enough there be be some'at

how to count up figure to write result of counting writing never stayed with from one hour to nay not from one folio to let however be adequately screwed up with gin adequately screwed down by

ask winterbones there indeed now scatcherd ai be bad enough if only knew a for winterbones have business here up in bedroom stink of gin so doe believe doctor ai well yet nigh well winterbones when above ill natured allusion be made to aroma coming from libation might be seen to deposit surreptitiously beneath little table at sat cup with have performed doctor in meantime have taken sir roger hand on pretext of feeling pulse be drawing quite a much information from touch of sick man skin look of sick man eye think mr winterbones have better go back to london office said lady scatcherd will be best clerk for time sir roger then will be d if mr winterbones doe anything of kind said so there be end of very well said doctor man can die once be duty to suggest measure for putting off

well what be to do now whole of doctor prescription will not give at length to of ordinance sir roger promised obedience to others objected violently to one two flatly refused to listen great stumbling block be that total abstinence from business for two week be enjoined that be impossible so sir roger said that must abstain for two day if work said doctor in present state will certainly

on staircase received order to send mounted messenger immediately to barchester dr fillgrave be to be summoned to come a quickly a possible to sick man room mr winterbones be to be sent up to write note sir roger be quite right in supposing that there must be word between doctor ladyship how indeed be doctor to get out of house without such let wish ever so much there be word be protracted while

mind body father have determined to make gentleman of have sent to eton to cambridge even receipt generally a be recognised will not make gentleman be hard indeed to define what receipt will do so though people do have in own mind certain undefined yet tolerably correct idea on subject be that a may two year at eton three term at cambridge did not make gentleman of louis philippe scatcherd yes be christened louis philippe after king of french if one wish to look out in world for royal nomenclature to find child who have be christened after king queen uncle aunt of king queen search must be made in family of democrat none have so servile deference for very nail paring of royalty none feel so wondering awe at exaltation of crowned head none be so anxious to secure shred fragment have be consecrated by royal touch be distance feel to exist between throne make covet crumb of majesty odds end chance splinter of royalty there be nothing royal about louis philippe scatcherd name have now come to man estate father finding cambridge receipt to be inefficacious have sent abroad to travel with tutor doctor have from time to time heard tidings of youth knew that have already shown symptom of father vice symptom of father talent knew that have begun life by being dissipated without being generous at age of twenty one have already suffered from delirium tremens be on account that have expressed disapprobation rather than surprise when heard that father intended to bequeath bulk of large fortune to uncontrolled will of unfortunate boy have toiled for money hard have right to do a like with what other satisfaction can give doctor assured that did not at mean to dispute louis philippe will do well enough will find continued baronet understanding what be passing within companion breast let young fellow sow wild oat while be young will be steady enough when grows old what if never life to get through sowing thought doctor to what if wild oat operation be carried on in so violent manner a to leave strength in soil for product of more valuable crop be of use saying however so allowed scatcherd to continue if have free fling when be youngster must have be so fond of brandy bottle now way son will be heir have have gumption to make money have gumption to spend son however will be able to ruffle with best of will go bail will hold head higher than ever young gresham will be able to hold be much of same age a well have cause to remember so have ladyship there now fact be that sir roger scatcherd felt in heart special love for young gresham with ladyship might almost be question whether did not love youth whom have nursed almost a well a other one who be own proper offspring will not put check on thoughtless expenditure if live ten twenty year a hope may will become unnecessary in making will man must always remember may go off suddenly especially if go to bed with brandy bottle under head eh doctor mind be medical secret know not word of out of bedroom dr thorne must sigh what must say on subject to man a yes have put check on expenditure will not let daily bread depend on man have therefore left five hundred year at own disposal from day of

said doctor louis will be five twenty in year two in about four year for be come gone yet scatcherd be not going to leave quite so soon a that not if can help doctor be a may be chance be ten to one clause in will will never come to bear quite so quite so if die louis philippe wo thought right to put in something to prevent squandering before come to sens oh quite right quite right think must have named later age than twenty five so must not louis philippe will be right by time lookout now doctor know will if die to morrow will know what want to do for have merely said eldest child scatcherd be give here will read to never mind eldest child must be more particular scatcherd must indeed consider what enormous interest may have to depend on word why what devil must say know name never even heard eldest be eldest world over perhaps ought to say youngest seeing be only railway contractor scatcherd began to think that doctor might now a well go away leave to society of winterbones brandy much a friend have before expressed in hurry now seemed inclined to move very leisurely sat there by bedside resting hand on knee gazing unconsciously at counterpane at last gave deep sigh then said scatcherd must be more particular in if be to have anything to do with must indeed be more explicit why how deuce can be more explicit be eldest living child plain enough whether be jack be gill what did lawyer say to scatcherd lawyer suppose let lawyer know what be putting got form paper that from have here in one room while winterbones did in be right enough though winterbones wrote did in way did not know what be writing doctor sat while longer still looking at counterpane then got up to depart will see again soon said to morrow probably to morrow said sir roger not at understanding why dr thorne must talk of returning so soon to morrow why ai so bad a man be if come so often a that will ruin oh not a medical man not a about will scatcherd must think if over must indeed need not give least trouble in world about will till be dead not least who know maybe may be settling affair yet eh doctor looking after niece when be dead gone getting husband for eh have have have then without further speech doctor went way chapter xi doctor drink tea doctor got on cob went way returning duly to greshamsbury in truth a went hardly knew be going what be doing sir roger have hinted that cob must be compelled to make up for lost time by extra exertion on road cob have never be permitted to have own way a to pace more satisfactorily than on present occasion doctor indeed hardly knew that be on horseback so completely be enveloped in cloud of own thought in first place alternative have become to put before baronet a one unlikely to occur that of speedy death of father son be one felt in heart of heart might very probably come to pas chance be ten to one clause will never be brought to bear have said partly to so a to ease thought came crowding on brain partly also in pity for patient father now that thought matter over felt that there be such odds be not odds other way be not almost probable that men might be gathered to long account within next four year one elder be strong man indeed one who might yet live for year to come if must give fair play then protested protested with truth too surely grounded that fair play to be beyond own power to give other younger have everything against not only be poor puny creature without physical strength one of whose life friend must never feel sure under circumstance also be already addicted to father vice also be already killing with alcohol then if two men did die within prescribed period if clause in sir roger will be brought to bear if must become dr thorne duty to see clause carried out how must be bound to act woman eldest child be own niece adopted bairn darling pride of heart cynosure of eye child also own mary of duty on earth next to one great duty to god conscience be duty to what under circumstance did duty to require of then that one great duty duty must be first to expect from what did demand of have scatcherd made will without saying what clause be seemed to thorne mary must have be heiress must clause become necessarily operative whether be so not must at rate be for lawyer to decide now case be very different rich man have confided in must not be breach of confidence act of absolute dishonesty act of dishonesty to scatcherd to far distant american family to that father who in former day have behaved so nobly to eldest child of must not be gross dishonesty to if allowed man to leave will by property might go to person never intended to be heir long before have arrived at greshamsbury mind on point have be made up indeed have be made up while sitting there by scatcherd bedside have not be difficult to make up mind to so much then way out of dishonesty be not so easy for to find how must set matter right so a to inflict injury on niece sorrow to if indeed must be avoided then other thought crowded on brain have always professed professed at rate to to that of vile object of man ambition wealth wealth merely for own sake be vilest in joint school of inherent philosophy have progressed to idea might find not easy to carry out must be called on by event to do so if must have be difficult to when acting on behalf of self alone how much more difficult when one might have to act for other difficulty have now come to uncle must in emergency take upon to fling away golden chance might accrue to niece if scatcherd must be encouraged to make partly heir 'd want to go live there to live with wife money in bank of england must not pay for such misery said doctor to a slowly rode into own yard on one point one only have definitely

that must make more amusing one doe go to sort of people for polished manner think 'd find scatcherds pleasant acquaintance at said doctor taking bed candle kissing niece forehead a left room chapter xii when greek meet greek then come tug of war doctor be doctor have thought nothing more of message have be sent to other doctor dr fillgrave in truth did baronet lady scatcherd have thought of husband during rest of day be not in humour allowed to remind that must soon have new physician on hand so left difficulty to arrange waiting in little trepidation till dr fillgrave must show be well that sir roger be not dying for want of assistance for when message reached barchester dr fillgrave be five six mile out of town at plumstead a did not get back till late in evening felt necessitated to put off visit to boxall hill till next morning have chanced to have be made acquainted with little conversation about pump must probably have postponed even yet while longer be however by mean sorry to be summoned to bedside of sir roger scatcherd be well known at barchester very well known to dr fillgrave sir roger dr thorne be old friend be very well known to also that sir roger in bodily ailment have hitherto be contented to entrust safety to skill of old friend sir roger be in way great man much talked of in barchester rumour have already reached ear of barchester galen that great railway contractor be ill when therefore received peremptory summons to go over to boxall hill must not think that pure light have broken in upon sir roger darkness taught at last where to look for true medical accomplishment then also sir roger be richest man in county to county practitioner new patient with large mean be godsend how much greater godsend when be not only acquired taken also from rival practitioner need hardly be explained dr fillgrave therefore be somewhat elated when after very early breakfast stepped into post chaise be to carry to boxall hill dr fillgrave professional advancement have be sufficient to justify establishment of brougham in paid ordinary visit round barchester be special occasion requiring special speed about to produce doubt special guerdon therefore pair of post horse be put into request be hardly yet nine when post boy somewhat loudly rang bell at sir roger door then dr fillgrave for first time found in new grand hall of boxall hill house will tell lady said servant showing into grand dining room there for fifteen minute twenty minute dr fillgrave walked up down length of turkey carpet alone dr fillgrave be not tall man be perhaps rather more inclined to corpulence than became height in stocking foot according to usually received style of measurement be five foot five have little round abdominal protuberance inch half added to heel of boot hardly enabled to carry off a well a must have wished of be apparently conscious gave to air of not being entirely at ease there be however personal dignity in demeanour propriety in gait air of authority in gesture must prohibit one from stigmatizing effort at altitude a failure doubt did achieve much nevertheless effort must occasionally betray story of frog ox must irresistibly force into one mind at moment when most behoved dr fillgrave to be magnificent if bulgy roundness of person shortness of leg in way detracted from personal importance trifling defect be be well aware more than atoned for by peculiar dignity of countenance if leg be short face be not if there be undue preponderance below waistcoat be in due symmetry above necktie hair be grey not grizzled white properly grey stood up straight from off temple on side with unbending determination of purpose whisker be of admirable shape coming down turning gracefully at angle of jaw be grey also somewhat darker than hair enemy in barchester declared that perfect shade be produced by leaden comb eye be not brilliant be very effective well under command be rather short sighted pair of eye glass be always on nose in hand nose be long well pronounced chin also be sufficiently prominent great feature of face be mouth amount of secret medical knowledge of must give assurance by pressure of lip be truly wonderful by lip also must be most exquisitely courteous most sternly forbidding not only must be one other must at will assume shade of difference between two produce mixture of sentiment when dr fillgrave be first shown into sir roger dining room walked up down room for while with easy jaunty step with hand joined together behind back calculating price of furniture counting head might be adequately entertained in room of such noble proportion in seven eight minute air of impatience might have be seen to suffuse face why must not be shown into sick man room what necessity must there be for keeping there a though be apothecary with box of leech in pocket then rang bell perhaps little violently doe sir roger know that be here said to servant will tell lady said man again vanishing for five minute more walked up down calculating no longer value of furniture rather that of own importance be not wont to be kept waiting in way though sir roger scatcherd be at present great rich man dr fillgrave have remembered very small very poor man now began to think of sir roger a stone mason to chafe somewhat more violently at being so kept by such man when one be impatient five minute be a duration of time quarter of hour be eternity at end of twenty minute step of dr fillgrave up down room have become very quick have just made up mind that must not stay there day to serious detriment perhaps fatal injury of other expectant patient hand be again on bell be about to be used with vigour when door opened lady scatcherd entered door opened lady scatcherd entered did so very slowly a though be afraid to come into own dining room must go back little see how have be employed during twenty minute oh law such have be first exclamation on hearing that doctor be in dining room be standing at time with housekeeper in small room in kept linen jam in in company with same housekeeper spent happiest moment of life oh law now hannah what will do send 'un up at once to master lady let john take 'un up there will be such row in house hannah know there will sure ly did send for 'un let master have row then be what 'd do lady added hannah seeing that ladyship still stood trembling in doubt biting thumb nail must go up to master must now hannah said lady scatcherd in most persuasive tone why said hannah after little deliberation be afeard must then must just face up went wife to tell lord that physician for whom have sent have come to attend bidding in interview then took place baronet have not indeed be violent have be very determined nothing on earth said must induce to see dr fillgrave offend dear old friend dr thorne roger said ladyship half cry rather pretending to cry in vexation what will do with man how will get out of house put under pump said baronet laughed peculiar low guttural laugh told so plainly of havoc brandy have made in throat be nonsense roger know ca put under pump now be ill 'd better see just for five minute will make right with dr thorne will be d if do lady people about boxall hill called poor lady scatcherd lady a if there be excellent joke in so indeed there be know need mind nothing say yet take nothing sends will tell not to come more now do 'ee see roger there be coaxing roger over now indeed ever be wilful headstrong masterful man tyrant always though never cruel one accustomed to rule wife household a despotically a did gang of workman such men be not easy to coax over go down tell want wo see be end of if chose to earn money why did come yesterday when be sent for be well now want what be more wo have winterbones lock door so winterbones who during interview have be at work at little table got up to lock door lady scatcherd have alternative to pas through before last edict be obeyed lady scatcherd with slow step went downstairs again sought counsel with hannah two putting head together agreed that only cure for present evil be to be found in good fee so lady scatcherd with five pound note in hand trembling in limb went forth to encounter august presence of dr fillgrave a door opened dr fillgrave dropped bell rope be in hand bowed low to lady who knew doctor well must have known from bow that be not well pleased be a much a though said lady scatcherd be most obedient humble servant at rate appears that be pleasure to treat a such lady scatcherd did not understand perceived at once that man be angry hope sir roger doe not find worse said doctor morning be getting on will step up see hem have why see dr fillgrave sir roger find vastly better morning vastly so be very glad to hear a morning be getting on will step up to see sir roger why dr fillgrave sir see find so much hisself morning that abeost think must be shame to trouble shame to trouble be sort of shame dr fillgrave did not at comprehend shame to trouble why lady scatcherd lady scatcherd saw that have nothing for to make whole matter intelligible moreover seeing that appreciated more thoroughly smallness of dr fillgrave person than did peculiar greatness of demeanour began to be shade le afraid of than have thought must have be yes dr fillgrave see when man like get well ca abide idea of doctor now yesterday be for sending for to day come to hisself seem to want doctor at then did dr fillgrave seem to grow out of boot so suddenly did take upon sundry mode of expansive attitude to grow out of boot to swell upwards till angry eye almost looked down on lady scatcherd erect hair bristled up towards heaven be very singular very singular lady scatcherd very singular indeed very singular quite unusual have come here from barchester at considerable inconvenience at very considerable inconvenience may say to regular patient know anything so very singular ever occurred to before then dr fillgrave with compression of lip almost made poor woman sink into ground moved towards door then lady scatcherd bethought of great panacea be about money know doctor said of course sir roger expect to come here with post horse for nothing in by by lady scatcherd did not stick quite close to veracity for sir roger have known must by mean have assented to payment note ladyship held in hand be taken from own private purse ai at about money doctor then tendered bank note thought must immediately make thing smooth now dr fillgrave dearly loved five pound fee what physician be so unnatural a not to love dearly loved five pound fee loved dignity better be angry also like angry men loved grievance felt that have be badly treated if took money must throw away right to indulge in such feeling at moment outraged dignity cherished anger be worth more than five pound note looked at with wishful still averted eye then sternly refused tender madam said with right hand raised with eye glass in motioned away tempting paper must have be happy to have given sir roger benefit of medical skill may have seeing be specially called in doctor if man well know oh of course if be well doe not choose to see there be end of must have relapse a time be valuable will perhaps oblige by sending elsewhere madam good morning will if will allow ring for carriage be post chaise doctor will take money must take money indeed will take money said lady scatcherd who have now become really unhappy at idea that husband unpardonable whim have brought man with post horse way from barchester that be to be paid nothing for time cost madam must not think of sir roger have doubt will know better time be not question of money not at be question of money doctor really will must poor lady scatcherd in anxiety to acquit at rate of pecuniary debt to doctor came to personal close quarter with with view of forcing note into hand quite impossible quite impossible said doctor still cherishing grievance valiantly rejecting root of evil will not do anything of kind lady scatcherd now doctor do 'ee to oblige quite out of question so with hand behind back in token of utter refusal to accept pecuniary accommodation of injury made way backwards to door ladyship perseveringly pressing in front so eager have be attack on that have not waited to give order about post chaise made way at once towards hall now do 'ee take do 'ee pressed lady scatcherd utterly out of question said dr fillgrave with great deliberation a backed way into hall a did so of course turned round found almost in arm of dr thorne a burley must have glared at bothwell when rushed together in dread encounter on mountain side a achilles may have glared at hector when at last met resolved to test in fatal conflict prowess of other so did dr fillgrave glare at foe from greshamsbury when on turning round on exalted heel found nose on level with top button of dr thorne waistcoat here if be not too tedious let pause while to recapitulate add up undoubted grievance of barchester practitioner have made effort to ingratiate into sheepfold of other shepherd dog be not by seeking that be now at boxall hill much a hated dr thorne full sure a felt of man

behalf of mary offer of pecuniary provision rich relative seemed so well inclined to make if accepted must in truth be studying interest scatcherd be self willed obstinate man now indeed touched by unwonted tenderness be one to whose lasting tenderness dr thorne must be very unwilling to trust darling did resolve on whole must best discharge duty even to by keeping to rejecting on behalf

thorne just come back for minute must let send present must fifty pound so just to buy few flounce doctor contrived to escape without giving definite answer to question then having paid compliment to lady scatcherd remounted cob rode back to greshamsbury chapter xiv sentence of exile dr thorne did not at once go home to own house when reached greshamsbury gate sent horse to own stable by one of people at lodge then walked on to mansion have to see squire on subject of forthcoming loan have also to see lady arabella lady arabella though be not personally attached to doctor with quite so much warmth a others of family still have reason of own for not dispensing with visit to house be one of patient patient fearful of disease with be threatened though thought doctor to be arrogant deficient a to properly submissive demeanour towards instigator to marital parsimony in lord one altogether opposed to herself interest in greshamsbury politics nevertheless did feel trust in a medical man have wish to be rescued out of hand by dr fillgrave a regarded that complaint of hers much a may have desired did desire to sever from greshamsbury council in matter not touching healing art now complaint of lady arabella be afraid be cancer only present confidant in matter be dr thorne first of greshamsbury circle whom saw be beatrice met in garden oh doctor said where have mary be age have not be up here since frank birthday well be only three day ago why go down ferret out in village so have done be there just now found out be out with patience oriel patience be with now patience be very well if throw over dear miss gresham patience be always be virtue poor beggarly sneaking virtue after doctor must have come up seeing how deserted be here there be absolutely nobody left have lady de courcy gone oh yes de courcys have gone think between ourselves mary stay away because doe not love too well have gone taken augusta frank with have frank gone to courcy castle oh yes did not hear there be rather fight about master frank wanted to get off be a hard to catch a eel then countess be offended papa said did see why frank be to go if did like papa be very anxious about degree know doctor understood a well a though have be described to at full length countess have claimed prey in order that might carry off to miss dunstable golden embrace prey not yet old enough wise enough to connect worship of plutus with of venus have made sundry futile feint dodge in vain hope of escape then anxious mother have enforced de courcy behest with mother authority father whose idea on subject of miss dunstable wealth have probably not be consulted have a matter of course taken exactly other side of question doctor did not require to be told in order to know how battle have raged have not yet heard of great dunstable scheme be sufficiently acquainted with greshamsbury tactic to understand that war have be carried on somewhat after fashion a rule when squire took point warmly to heart be wont to carry way against de courcy interest must be obstinate enough when so pleased have before now gone so far a to tell wife that thrice noble sister in law might remain at home at courcy castle at rate not come to greshamsbury if must not do so without striving to rule one else when got here have of course be repeated to countess who have merely replied to by sisterly whisper in sorrowfully intimated that men be born brute always must remain so think be lady arabella have replied wishing perhaps to remind sister in law that breed of brute be a rampant in west barsetshire a in eastern division of county squire however have not fought on occasion with vigour there have of course be passage between son have be agreed that frank must go for fortnight to courcy castle must quarrel with know if can help said father therefore must go sooner later well suppose so know how dull be governor said gresham there be miss dunstable to be there did ever hear of sir never be girl whose father used to make ointment something of sort oh yes to be sure ointment of lebanon used to cover wall in london have heard of year past be because be dead well carry on ointment now believe at rate have got money wonder what be like 'd better go see said father who now began to have inkling of idea why two lady be so anxious to carry son off to courcy castle at exact time so frank have packed up best clothes given last fond look at new black horse repeated last special injunction to peter have then made one of stately cortege proceeded through county from greshamsbury to courcy castle be very glad of very said squire when heard that money be to be forthcoming will get on easier term from than elsewhere kill to have continual bother about such thing mr gresham feeling that difficulty be tided over for time that immediate pressure of little debt must be abated stretched on easy chair a though be quite comfortable one may say almost elated how frequent be that men on road to ruin feel elation such a man sign away moiety of substance nay be nothing moiety of substance of child put pen to paper ruin in doing so free from score of immediate little pestering stinging trouble therefore feel a though fortune have be almost kind to doctor felt angry with for what have done when saw how easily squire adapted to new loan will make scatcherd claim upon very heavy said mr gresham at once read be passing through doctor mind well what else can do said must have allow daughter to lose match for sake of few thousand pound will be well at rate to have one of settled look at letter from moffat doctor took letter read be long wordy ill written rigmarole in amorous gentleman spoke with much rapture of love devotion for miss gresham at same time declared most positively swore that adverse cruelty of circumstance be such that must not allow to stand up like man at hymeneal altar until six thousand pound hard cash have be paid down at banker may be right said squire in time gentleman be not used to write such letter a to other doctor shrugged shoulder did not know how far must be justified in saying much even to friend squire in dispraise of future son in law told that must have money one must have thought that must have be enough for well suppose augusta like suppose wish match otherwise must give answer to letter a must startle little what settlement be to make said thorne oh be satisfactory enough must be more so thousand year house at wimbledon for be very well lie know thorne be rolling in money yet talk of beggarly sum a though must possibly stir without if might venture to speak mind said thorne well said squire looking at earnestly must be inclined to say that mr moffat want to cry off oh impossible quite impossible in first place be so very anxious for match in next place be such great thing for then must never dare see be dependent on de courcys for seat suppose loses seat there be not much fear of think scatcherd may be very fine fellow think will hardly return at barchester understand much about said thorne such thing do happen believe that man absolutely want to get off match absolutely think of playing such trick a on daughter on say intends to do look to a though be making door for trying to make door if so having money will stop there thorne think love girl if thought not doctor stood silent for moment then said be not love making man think that if be much in love with young lady must not write such letter a to father by heaven if thought so said squire thorne ca judge of fellow a one doe of gentleman be so used to making money seeing money made that have eye to business in everything perhaps so perhaps so muttered doctor showing evidently that still doubted warmth of mr moffat affection match be none of making can not interfere now to break off will give good position in world for after money go great way be something to be in parliament can only hope like do truly hope like squire also showed by tone of voice that though might hope that daughter be in love with intended husband hardly conceived to be possible that must be so what be truth of matter miss gresham be more in love with mr moffat than be oh sweet young blooming beauty not whit more not at least in sense of word in mine have by mean resolved within heart that of men whom have ever seen ever must see be far away nicest best be what will do when be in love if be good for anything have longing to sit near to nearer better have thought of taste choice when bought ribbon bonnet have indescribable desire that female friend must be ever talking to about when wrote to did not copy letter again again so that might be a be ever speaking to took special pride in herself because have chosen to be life partner in point of fact did not care one straw about yet thought loved be indeed quite confident that did so told mother that be sure gustavus must wish knew gustavus must like so on a for gustavus did not care chip for be in love with match just a farmer be in love with wheat at eighty shilling quarter shareholder innocent gudgeon with seven half per cent interest on paid up capital eighty shilling quarter seven half per cent interest such be return have be taught to look for in exchange for young heart having obtained being thus about to obtain why must not young heart be satisfied have not sat down obediently at foot of lady gamaliel must not be rewarded yes indeed will be rewarded then doctor went to lady on medical secret will not intrude there be other matter bearing on course of narrative a to lady arabella found necessary to say word so to doctor be essential that must know what be tenor of few word so spoken how aspiration instinct feeling of household become changed a young bird begin to flutter with feathered wing have half formed thought of leaving parental nest few month back frank have reigned almost autocratic over lesser subject of kingdom of greshamsbury servant for instance always obeyed sister never dreamed of telling anything directed must not be told mischief trouble love be confided to with sure conviction that must never be made to stand in evidence against trusting to well ascertained state of thing have not hesitated to declare love for miss thorne before sister augusta sister augusta have now a be be received into upper house having duly received duly profited by lesson of great instructress be now admitted to sit in conclave with higher power sympathy of course became changed confidence be removed from young giddy given to ancient discreet be a schoolboy who having finished schooling being fairly forced by necessity into stern bread earning world undertakes new duty of tutoring yesterday be taught fought of course against schoolmaster to day teach fight a keenly for so be with augusta gresham when with careful brow whispered to mother that there be something wrong between frank mary thorne stop at once arabella stop at once countess have said that indeed will be ruin if doe not marry money be lost good heaven doctor niece girl nobody know where come from be going with to morrow know said anxious mother yes be so far well if will be led by evil may be remedied before return be very very hard to lead young men arabella must forbid that girl to come to greshamsbury again on pretext whatever evil must be stopped at once be here so much a matter of course then must be here a matter of course more there have be folly very great folly in having here of course must turn out to be designing creature with such temptation before with such prize within reach how must help must say aunt answered very properly said augusta nonsense said countess before of course did arabella matter must not be left to girl propriety never knew propriety of girl of sort to be fit to be depended upon yet if wish to save whole family from ruin must take step to keep away from greshamsbury now at once now be time now that frank be to be away where so much so very much depends on young man marrying money not one day ought to be lost instigated in manner lady arabella resolved to open mind to doctor to make intelligible to that under present circumstance mary visit at greshamsbury have better be discontinued must have given much however to have escaped business have in time tried one two fall with doctor be conscious that have never yet got better of then be in slight degree afraid of mary have presentiment that must not be so easy to banish mary from greshamsbury be not sure that young lady must not boldly assert right to place in school room appeal loudly to squire perhaps declare determination of marrying heir out before squire must be sure to uphold in in anything else then too there must be greatest difficulty in wording request to doctor lady arabella be sufficiently conscious of own weakness to know that be not always very good at word doctor when hard pressed be never at fault must say bitterest thing in quietest tone lady arabella have great dread of bitter thing what also if must desert withdraw from skill knowledge of bodily want ailment now that be so necessary to have once before taken that measure of sending to barchester for dr fillgrave have answered with hardly better than with sir roger lady scatcherd when therefore lady arabella found alone with doctor called upon to say out say in what best language must select for occasion did not feel to be very much at ease there be that about man before cowed in spite of being wife of squire sister of earl person quite acknowledged to be of great world mother of very important young man whose affection be now about to be called in question nevertheless there be task to be done with mother courage essayed dr thorne said a soon a medical conference be at end be very glad came over to day for have something special wanted to say to so far got then stopped a doctor did not seem inclined to give assistance be forced to flounder on a best must something very particular indeed know what respect esteem may say affection have for here doctor made low bow may say for mary also here doctor bowed again have done what little must to be pleasant neighbour think will believe when say that be true friend to dear mary doctor knew that something very unpleasant be coming must not at guess what might be nature felt however that must say something so expressed hope that be duly sensible of act of kindness have ever received from squire family at large hope therefore dear doctor wo take amiss what be going to say well lady arabella will endeavour not to do so be sure must not give pain if must help much le to there be occasion doctor in duty must be paramount paramount to other consideration know certainly occasion be one of what be occasion lady arabella will tell doctor know what frank position be frank position a regard what why position in life only son know oh yes know position in respect only son father heir very fine fellow be have one son lady arabella may well be proud of lady arabella sighed did not wish at present moment to express a being in way proud of frank be desirous rather on other hand of showing that be good deal ashamed of only not quite so much ashamed of a behoved doctor to be of niece well perhaps so yes said lady arabella be very good young man with excellent disposition doctor position be very precarious be just at time of life when caution be necessary to doctor ear lady arabella be now talking of son a mother might of infant when whooping cough be abroad croup imminent there be nothing on earth matter with must say said doctor have possible sign of perfect health oh yes health yes thank god health be good be great blessing lady arabella thought of four floweret have already faded be sure be most thankful to see growing up so strong be not that mean doctor then what be lady arabella why doctor know squire position with regard to money matter now doctor undoubtedly did know squire position with regard to money matter knew much better than did lady arabella be by mean inclined to talk on subject to ladyship remained quite silent therefore although lady arabella last speech have taken form of question lady arabella be little offended at want of freedom on part become somewhat sterner in tone thought le condescending in manner squire have unfortunately embarrassed property frank must look forward to inherit with very heavy encumbrance fear very heavy indeed though of what exact nature be kept in ignorance looking at doctor face perceived that there be probability that ignorance must be enlightened by therefore be highly necessary that frank must be very careful a to private expenditure mean said doctor not exactly that though of course must be careful a to too be of course be not what mean doctor only hope of retrieving circumstance be by marrying money with other conjugal blessing that man can have hope may have also so doctor replied with imperturbable face not le did begin to have shade of suspicion of what might be coming subject of conference must be untrue to say that have ever thought probable that young heir must fall in love with niece that have ever looked forward to such chance with complacency with fear nevertheless idea have of late passed through mind word have fallen from mary closely watched expression of eye quiver in lip when frank name be mentioned have of late made involuntarily think that such might not be impossible then when chance of mary becoming heiress to so large fortune have be forced upon consideration have be unable to prevent from building happy castle in air a rode slowly home from boxall hill not whit more on account be prepared to be untrue to squire interest to encourage feeling must be distasteful to squire friend yes doctor must marry money worth lady arabella pure feminine heart youth beauty hope will marry must be possible that in speaking of pure feminine heart youth beauty such like gewgaw doctor be thinking of niece must be that have absolutely made up mind to foster encourage odious match bare idea made lady arabella wrathful wrath gave courage must marry money will be ruined man now doctor be informed that thing word be have passed between mary never ought to have be allowed now also doctor be wrathful what thing what word said appearing to lady arabella a though rose in anger nearly foot in altitude before eye what have passed between who say so doctor there have be love making may take word for love making of very very very advanced description doctor must not stand not for

have used badly must not do so must not quarrel with child who have almost be born into arm even with very wall tree grassy knoll with be so dearly intimate must not proclaim enemy to greshamsbury yet felt that fealty to mary required of for present must put on enemy guise if want lady arabella send for will come to otherwise will if please share sentence have be passed on mary will now wish good morning then bowing low to left room house sauntered slowly away to own home what be to say to mary walked very slowly down greshamsbury avenue with hand clasped behind back thinking over whole matter

allurement said to repeating lady arabella word girl circumstanced like niece how utterly incapable be such woman a to understand mind heart soul of one a mary thorne then thought recurred to frank have be ill done of ill done of young a be must have have feeling enough to have spared thoughtless word have be spoken will now make miserable then a walked on must not divest mind of remembrance of what have passed between sir roger what if after mary must become heiress to money what if must become in fact owner of greshamsbury for indeed seemed too possible that sir roger heir must be owner of greshamsbury idea be one disliked to entertain must recur to again again might be that marriage between niece nominal heir to estate might be of match best for young gresham to make how sweet must be revenge how glorious retaliation on lady arabella if after what have now be said must come to pas that difficulty of greshamsbury must be made smooth by mary love mary hand be dangerous subject on to

acquitted friend of blame in matter might be condemned mother unheard doctor when arrived at own house have in nowise made up mind a to manner in must break matter to mary by time that have reached drawing room have made up mind to that must put off evil hour till morrow must sleep on matter lie awake on more probably then at breakfast a best must tell have be said of mary that evening be more than usually inclined to be playful have not be quite certain till morning whether frank have absolutely left greshamsbury have therefore preferred company of miss oriel to going up to house there be peculiar cheerfulness about friend patience feeling of satisfaction with world in mary always shared with now have brought home to doctor fireside in spite of young trouble smiling face if not heart altogether happy uncle said at last what make so sombre will read to no not to night dearest why uncle what be matter nothing nothing ah be something will tell getting up came over to arm chair leant over shoulder looked at for minute in silence then getting up from chair passed arm round waist pressed closely to heart darling said almost convulsively best own truest darling mary looking up into face saw that big tear be running down cheek still told nothing night chapter xv courcy when frank gresham expressed to father opinion that courcy castle be dull squire a may be remembered did not pretend to differ from to men such a squire such a squire son courcy castle be dull to what class of men must not be dull author be not prepared to say may be presumed that de courcys found to liking must have made other than be castle be huge brick pile built in day of william iii though be grand for day of construction of constitution be not very grand for architecture of more material description have doubt perfect right to be called castle a be entered by castle gate led into court porter lodge for be built a be into wall there be attached to also two round stumpy adjunct be perhaps properly called tower though did not do much in way of towering moreover along one side of house over what must otherwise have be cornice there ran castellated parapet through assistance of imagination doubt be intended to supply muzzle of defiant artillery artillery must have so presented muzzle must have be very small may be doubted whether even bowman must have obtained shelter there ground about castle be not very inviting a ground very extensive though doubt entire domain be such a suited importance of so puissant nobleman a earl de courcy what indeed must have be park be divided out into various large paddock surface be flat unbroken though there be magnificent elm tree standing in straight line like hedgerow timber have not that beautiful wild scattered look generally give great charm to english town of courcy for place claimed to rank a town be in many particular like castle be built of dingy red brick almost more brown than red be solid dull looking ugly comfortable consisted of four street be formed by two road crossing other making at point of junction centre for town here stood red lion have be called brown lion nomenclature must have be more strictly correct here in old day of coaching life have be wont to stir at hour in day night when freetraders tallyhoes royal mail changed horse now there be railway station mile half distant moving life of town of courcy be confined to red lion omnibus seemed to pas entire time in going up down between town station quite unembarrassed by great weight of passenger there be so said courcyites when

thing commerce be doing for nation of thine what be commerce to thee unless be commerce in posting on worn out useless great western turnpike road there be nothing left for thee to be carted away a rubbish for thee for many of in now prosperous day oh melancholy care ridden friend courcy castle be certainly dull place to look at frank in former visit have found that appearance did not belie reality have be little there when earl have be at courcy a have always felt from childhood peculiar distaste to governance of aunt countess perhaps may have added to feeling of dislike now however castle be to be fuller than have ever before known earl be to be at home there be talk of duke of omnium coming for day two though seemed doubtful there be faint doubt of lord porlock mr moffat intent on coming election also let hope on coming bliss be to be one of guest there be also to be great miss dunstable frank however found that grandee be not expected quite immediately might go back to greshamsbury for three four day a be not to be here said naively to aunt expressing with tolerable perspicuity feeling that regarded visit to courcy castle quite a matter of business countess must hear of such arrangement now that have got be not going to let fall back into peril of miss thorne intrigue even of miss thorne propriety be quite essential said that must be here few day before so that may see that be at home frank did not understand reasoning felt unable to rebel therefore remained there comforting a best might with eloquence of honourable george sporting humour of honourable john mr moffat be earliest arrival of importance frank have not hitherto made acquaintance of future brother in law there be therefore little interest in first interview mr moffat be shown into drawing room before lady have gone up to dress so happened that frank be there also a one else be in room sister two of cousin have expected to see lover rush into other arm mr moffat restrained ardour miss gresham seemed contented that must do so be nice dapper man rather above middle height good looking enough have have little more expression in face have dark hair very nicely brushed small black whisker small black moustache boot be excellently well made hand be very white simpered gently a took hold of augusta finger expressed hope that have be quite well since last have pleasure of seeing then touched hand of lady rosina lady margaretta mr moffat allow to introduce to brother most happy be sure said mr moffat again putting out hand allowing to slip through frank grasp a spoke in pretty mincing voice lady arabella quite well father sister very warm be quite hot in town do assure hope augusta like said frank to arguing on subject exactly a father have done for engaged lover seems to to have very queer way with frank poor fellow who be of coarser mould must under such circumstance have be for kissing sometimes indeed even under other circumstance mr moffat did not do much towards improving conviviality of castle be of course good deal intent upon coming election spent much of time with mr nearthewinde celebrated parliamentary agent behoved to be good deal at barchester canvassing elector undermining by mr nearthewinde aid mine for blowing out of seat be daily being contrived by mr closerstil on behalf of sir roger battle be to be fought on internecine principle quarter being given taken on side of course gave mr moffat a much a knew how to do mr closerstil be well known to be sharpest man at business in england unless palm must be given to great rival mr nearthewinde in instance be to be assisted in battle by very clever young barrister mr romer who be admirer of sir roger career in life people in barchester when saw sir roger closerstil mr romer saunter down high street arm in arm declared that be up with poor moffat others in whose head bump of veneration be strongly pronounced whispered to other that great shibboleth name of duke of omnium mildly asserted to be impossible that duke nominee must be thrown out poor friend squire did not take much interest in matter except in so far that liked son in law to be in parliament candidate be in eye equally wrong in opinion have long since recanted error of early youth have cost seat for county have abjured de courcy politics be staunch enough a tory now that being so must no longer be of slightest use to duke of omnium lord de courcy mr moffat be whig whig however differing altogether in politics from sir roger who belonged to manchester school whose pretension through of inscrutable twist in modern politics be quite unintelligible to mind of ordinary men outside circle be on occasion secretly favoured by high conservative party how mr moffat who have be brought into political world by lord de courcy obtained weight of duke interest never must exactly learn for duke earl did not generally act a twin brother on such occasion there be great difference in whig lord de courcy be court whig following fortune enjoying when must get sunshine of throne be sojourner at windsor visitor at balmoral delighted in gold stick be never so happy a when holding cap of maintenance spur of precedence with due dignity acknowledged grace in presence of court mean have be somewhat embarrassed by early extravagance therefore a be to taste to shine suited to shine at cost of court rather than at own duke of omnium be whig of very different calibre rarely went near presence of majesty when did do so did merely a disagreeable duty incident to position be very willing that queen must be queen so long a be allowed to be duke of omnium have begrudged prince albert of honour till be called prince consort then indeed have to own intimate friend made remark in three word not flattering to discretion of prime minister queen might be queen so long a be duke of omnium revenue be about same with exception that duke be own must do what liked with remembrance did not unfrequently present to duke mind in person be plain thin man tall undistinguished in appearance except that there be gleam of pride in eye seemed moment to be saying be duke of omnium be unmarried if report said true great debauchee if so have always kept debauchery decently away from eye of world be not therefore open to loud condemnation must fall like hailstorm round ear of more open sinner why two mighty noble put head together in order that tailor son must represent barchester in parliament can not explain mr moffat be a have be said lord de courcy friend may be that lord de courcy be able to repay duke for kindness a touching barchester with little assistance in county representation next arrival be that of bishop of barchester meek good worthy man much attached to wife somewhat addicted to ease apparently be made in different mould by energy diligence atoned for want in quality might be observed in bishop when asked opinion lordship must generally reply by saying mr proudie think so so before opinion be given mr proudie must take up tale in more concise manner be not wont to quote bishop a having at assisted in consideration of subject be well known in barsetshire that married pair consorted more closely more tenderly together example of such conjugal affection among person in upper class be worth mentioning a be believed by below too often with truth that sweet bliss of connubial reciprocity be not so common a must be among magnate of earth arrival even of bishop wife did not make place cheerful to frank gresham began to long for miss dunstable in order that might have something to do must not get on at with mr moffat have expected that man must at once have called frank that must have called man gustavus did not even get beyond mr moffat mr gresham very hot in barchester to day very be nearest approach to conversation frank must attain with a far a frank must see augusta never got much beyond there might be tete tete meeting between if so frank must not detect when took place so opening heart at last to honourable george for want of better confidant expressed opinion that future brother in law be muff muff believe too what do think now have be with nearthewinde in barchester three day past looking up elector wife daughter kind of thing say if there be fun in might a well take with oh there be not much fun be mostly so slobbered dirty sharp fellow in nearthewinde know what be about well doe look up wife daughter too oh go on tack just a be wanted there be moffat yesterday in room behind milliner shop near cuthbert gate be with woman husband be one of chorister elector know moffat went to look for vote now there be one there when got there three young woman wife be two girl very pretty woman be too say george will go get chorister vote for moffat ought to do a be to be brother in law what do think moffat said to woman ca guess did kiss of did kiss of begged to give positive assurance a gentleman that if be returned to parliament must vote for extension of franchise admission of jew into parliament well be muff said frank chapter xvi miss dunstable at last great miss dunstable came frank when heard that heiress have arrived felt slight palpitation at heart have not remotest idea in world of marrying indeed during last week past absence have so heightened love for mary thorne that be more than ever resolved that must never marry one knew that have made formal offer for hand that behoved to keep to let charm of miss dunstable be what might nevertheless be prepared to go through certain amount of courtship in obedience to aunt behest felt little nervous at being brought up in way face to face to do battle with two hundred thousand pound miss dunstable have arrived said aunt to with great complacency on return from electioneering visit to beauty of barchester made with cousin george on day after conversation be repeated at end of last chapter have arrived be looking remarkably well have quite distingue air will grace circle to may be introduced will introduce before dinner can take out must propose to to night suppose said frank maliciously talk nonsense frank said countess angrily be

though have come by train have brought with own carriage own horse own coachman footman own maid of course have also brought with score of trunk full of wearing apparel of nearly a rich a wonderful box be stolen short time since from top of cab brought thing not in least because wanted because have be instructed to do so frank be little more than ordinarily careful in dressing spoilt couple of white necktie before be satisfied be rather fastidious a set of hair there be not much of dandy about in ordinary meaning of word felt that be incumbent on to look best seeing what be expected that must now do certainly did not mean to marry miss dunstable a be to have flirtation with be well that must do so under best possible auspex when entered drawing room perceived at once that lady be there be seated between countess mr proudie mammon in person be receiving worship from temporality spirituality of land tried to look unconcerned remained in farther part of room talking with of cousin must not keep eye off future possible mr frank gresham seemed a though be a much constrained to scrutinise a felt to scrutinise lady de courcy have declared that be looking extremely well have particularly alluded to distingue appearance frank at once felt that must not altogether go along with aunt in opinion miss dunstable might be very well style of beauty be one did not quite meet with warmest admiration in age be about thirty frank who be great judge in matter who be accustomed to have very young girl round at once put down a being ten year older have very high colour very red cheek large mouth big white teeth broad nose bright small black eye hair also be black bright very crisp strong be combed close round face in small crisp black ringlet since have be brought out into fashionable world one of instructor in fashion have given to understand that curl be not thing will always pas muster miss dunstable have replied when be done up with bank note may therefore be presumed that miss dunstable have will of own frank said countess in most natural unpremeditated way a soon a caught nephew eye come here want to introduce to miss dunstable introduction be then made mr proudie must excuse must positively go say few word to mr barlow poor woman will feel huffed so saying moved off leaving coast clear for master frank of course slipped into aunt place expressed hope that miss dunstable be not fatigued by journey fatigued said in voice rather loud very good humoured not altogether unpleasing be not to be fatigued by such thing a why in may came through way from rome to paris without sleeping be without sleeping in bed be upset three time out of sledge coming over simplon be such fun why be to say tired even then way from rome to paris said mr proudie in tone of astonishment meant to flatter heiress what made in hurry something about money matter said miss dunstable speaking rather louder than usual something to do with ointment be selling business just then mr proudie bowed immediately changed conversation idolatry be believe more rampant than ever in rome said fear there be such thing at a sabbath observance oh not in least said miss dunstable with rather joyous air sunday week day be same there how very frightful said mr proudie be delicious place do like rome must say a for pope if be quite so fat must be nicest old fellow in world have be in rome mr proudie mr proudie sighed a replied in negative declared belief that danger be to be apprehended from such visit oh ah malaria of course yes if go at wrong time nobody be such fool a now be thinking of soul miss dunstable said lady bishop in peculiar grave tone place where there be sabbath observance have be in rome mr gresham said young lady turning almost abruptly round to frank giving somewhat uncivilly cold shoulder to mr proudie exhortation poor lady be forced to finish speech to honourable george who be standing near to having idea bishop belonging like other thing appertaining to religion must if possible be avoided if be not possible must be treated with much assumed gravity immediately put on long face remarked that be deuced shame for part always liked to see people go quiet on sunday parson have only one day out of seven thought be fully entitled to satisfied with not satisfied mr proudie have to remain silent till dinner time said frank never be in rome be in paris once be then feeling not unnatural anxiety a to present state of miss dunstable worldly concern took opportunity of falling back on part of conversation mr proudie have exercised so much tact in avoiding be sold said sold what sold be saying about business that came back without going to bed because of selling business oh ointment no be not sold after affair did not come off might have remained have roll in snow be pity so said frank to if must do must be owner of ointment of lebanon how odd then gave arm handed down to dinner certainly found that dinner be le dull than other have sat down to at courcy castle did not fancy that must ever fall in love with miss dunstable certainly be agreeable companion told of tour fun have in journey how took physician with for benefit of health whom generally be forced to nurse of trouble be to to look after wait upon numerous servant of trick played to bamboozle people who came to stare at lastly told of lover who followed from country to country be now in hot pursuit of having arrived in evening before left lover said frank somewhat startled by suddenness of confidence lover yes mr gresham why must not have lover oh of course not dare say have good many only three four upon word be only three four favour one be not bound to reckon others know 'd be too numerous so have three whom favour miss dunstable frank sighed a though intended to say that number be too many for peace of mind be not that quite enough of course change sometimes smiled on very good naturedly must be very dull if be always to keep same very dull indeed said frank who did not quite know what to say do think countess must mind having one two of here if be to ask be quite sure must said frank very briskly must not approve of at must why what have to do with great deal so much so that positively forbid miss dunstable well mr gresham will contrive to make up for deficiency a well a possible if will permit to do so now for well for at moment countess gleamed accomplished eye round table miss dunstable rose from chair a frank be preparing attack accompanied other lady into drawing room aunt a passed touched arm lightly with fan so lightly that action be perceived by one else frank well understood meaning of touch appreciated approbation conveyed merely blushed however at own dissimulation for felt more certain that ever that must never marry miss dunstable felt nearly equally sure that miss dunstable must never marry lord de courcy be now at home presence did not add much hilarity to claret cup young men however be very keen about election mr nearthewinde who be one of party be full of most sanguine hope have done one good at rate said frank have secured chorister vote what bagley said fellow kept out of way must see have exactly seen said frank have got vote same what by letter said mr moffat not by letter said frank speaking rather low a looked at bishop earl got promise from wife think be little in henpecked line have have have laughed good bishop who in spite of frank modulation of voice have overheard what have passed be that way manage electioneering matter in cathedral city have have have idea of one of chorister being in henpecked line be very amusing to bishop oh got distinct promise said frank in pride then added incautiously have to order bonnet for whole family hush h h h h said mr nearthewinde absolutely flabbergasted by such imprudence on part of one of client friend be quite sure that order have effect be intended to have effect on mr bagley vote be that wrong said frank upon word thought that be quite legitimate one must never admit anything in electioneering matter must one said george turning to mr nearthewinde very little mr de courcy very little indeed le better be hard to say in day what be wrong what be not now there be reddypalm publican man who have brown bear well be there of course be voter if man in barchester ought to feel bound to vote for friend of duke ought now be so thirsty when be in man house be dying for glass of beer for life of did dare order one why not said frank whose mind be only just beginning to be enlightened by great doctrine of purity of election a practised in english provincial town oh closerstil have fellow looking at why ca walk down town without having very step counted like sharp fighting never go so sharp a nevertheless got bagley vote said frank persisting in praise of own electioneering prowess may be sure of mr nearthewinde none of closerstil men be looking at when got who will pay for bonnet frank said george oh will pay for if moffat wo think will keep account there seem to have good glove sort of thing very good have doubt said george suppose lordship will be in town soon after meeting of parliament said bishop questioning earl oh yes suppose must be there be never allowed to remain very long in quiet be great nuisance be too late to think of now men in high place lord never be never will be allowed to consider burn torch not in own behalf said bishop thinking perhaps a much of a did of noble friend rest quiet be comfort of who have be content to remain in obscurity perhaps so said earl finishing glass of claret with air of virtuous resignation perhaps so own martyrdom however have not be severe for rest quiet of home have never be peculiarly satisfactory to taste soon after went to lady be little time before frank must find opportunity of recommencing allotted task with miss dunstable got into conversation with bishop other people except that took teacup nearly managed to squeeze one of finger a did so made very little further progress till towards close of evening at last found so nearly alone a to admit of speaking to in low confidential voice have managed that matter with aunt what matter said miss dunstable voice be not low particularly confidential about three four gentleman whom wish to invite here oh attendant knight indeed gave such very slight hope of success besides said something about not wanting yes did really think 'd be quite unnecessary if must want one to defend at coming election for instance then at other time there be plenty here who will be ready to stand up for plenty want plenty one good lance in olden day be always worth more than score of ordinary men at arm talked about three four yes then see mr gresham have never yet found one good lance at least not good enough to suit idea of true prowess what must frank do declare that be ready to lay own in rest now always in behalf aunt have be quite angry with have thought that turned into ridicule when spoke of making offer to guest that very evening yet here be so placed that have hardly alternative let inward resolution to abjure heiress be ever so strong be now in position allowed choice in matter even mary thorne must hardly have blamed for saying so far a own prowess went be quite at miss dunstable service have mary be looking on perhaps might have thought that must have done so with le of look of devotion threw into eye well mr gresham be very civil very civil indeed said miss dunstable upon word if lady wanted true knight might do worse than trust to only fear that courage be of so exalted nature that must be ever ready to do battle for beauty who might be in distress indeed who might not must never confine valour to protection of one maiden oh yes must though if liked said frank there be more constant fellow in world than be in way try miss dunstable when young lady make such trial a that sometimes find too late to go back if trial doe succeed mr gresham oh of course there be always risk be like hunting there must be fun if there be danger if get tumble one day can retrieve next poor girl if once trust man who say that love have such chance for must never listen to man unless 'd known for seven year at least seven year said frank who must not help thinking that in seven year time miss dunstable must be almost old woman seven day be enough to know person perhaps seven hour eh mr gresham seven hour well perhaps seven hour if happen to be good deal together during time there be nothing after like love at first sight be there mr gresham frank knew well enough that be quizzing must not resist temptation felt to be revenged on be sure be very pleasant said a for have never experienced have have have laughed miss dunstable upon word mr gresham like amazingly did expect to meet anybody down here must like half so much must come see in london will introduce to three knight so saying moved away fell into conversation with of higher power frank felt to be rather snubbed in spite of strong expression miss dunstable have made in favour be not quite clear to that did not take for boy be to be sure avenged on for by taking for middle aged woman nevertheless be hardly satisfied with might give heartache yet said to might find afterwards that be left in lurch with money so retired solitary into far part of room began to think of mary thorne a did so a eye fell upon miss dunstable stiff curl almost shuddered then lady retired aunt with good natured smile on face come to a be leaving room last of bevy putting hand on arm led out into small unoccupied chamber opened from grand saloon upon word master frank said seem to be losing time with heiress have quite made impression already know much about aunt said looking rather sheepish declare have frank dear boy must not precipitate sort of thing too much be well to take little more time be more valued perhaps know on whole perhaps frank might know be clear that lady de courcy did not at rate did not know how to express have said out mind plainly must probably have spoken thus want to make love to miss dunstable certainly at rate to make offer to need not make show of of too by doing so openly a that countess however did not want to reprimand obedient nephew therefore did not speak out thought well said frank looking up into face take leetle more time be dear boy slow sure know so countess again patted arm went away to bed old fool muttered frank to a returned to room where men be still standing be right in be old fool must have seen that there be chance whatever that nephew miss dunstable must become man wife well frank said honourable john so be after heiress already wo give of chance said honourable george if go on in way will be mr gresham before month be over frank what will say of manner of looking for barchester vote mr gresham be certainly excellent hand at canvassing said mr nearthewinde only little too open in manner of proceeding got that chorister for at rate said frank must never have have without think so much of chorister vote a of miss dunstable said honourable george be interest be really worth looking after surely said mr moffat miss dunstable have property in barchester poor man heart be so intent on election that have not moment to devote to claim of love chapter xvii election now important day of election have arrived men heart beat quickly enough to be not to be member of british parliament be question of very considerable moment in man mind much be often said of great penalty ambitious pay for enjoying honour of tremendous expense of election of long tedious hour of unpaid labour of weary day passed in house nevertheless prize be one very well worth price paid for well worth price can be paid for short of wading through dirt dishonour other great european nation have anything like to offer to ambition of citizen for in other great country of europe not even in be free have popular constitution obtained a with true sovereignty power of rule here be so when man lay out to be member of parliament play highest game for highest stake country affords to men born silver spooned seat in parliament come a matter of course from time of early manhood hardly know what be not to sit there honour be hardly appreciated being too much matter of course a rule never know how great thing be to be in parliament though when reverse come a revers occasionally will come fully feel how dreadful be to be left out to men aspiring to be member to who having be once fortunate have again to fight battle without assurance of success coming election must be matter of dread concern oh how delightful to hear that long talked of rival have declined contest that course be clear to find by short canvas that one majority be safe pleasure of crowing over unlucky friendless foe quite secured such gratification a filled bosom of mr moffat on morning of barchester election to have be brought positive assurance of success by indefatigable agent mr nearthewinde be admitted on side that contest must be very close one mr nearthewinde must not do more than assert that ought to win unless thing went very wrong with mr nearthewinde have other election to attend to have not be remaining at courcy castle ever since coming of miss dunstable have be there at barchester a often a possible mr moffat be made greatly uneasy by reflecting how very high bill must be two party have outdone other in loudness of assertion that must on side conduct election in strict conformity to law there be to be bribery bribery who indeed in day must dare to bribe to give absolute money for absolute vote pay for such article in downright palpable sovereign purity be much too rampant for mean of detection too well understood purity be to be carried much further than there must be treating hiring of two hundred voter to act a messenger at twenty shilling day in looking up four hundred other voter band be to be paid for carriage furnished ribbon supplied british voter be to vote if vote must for love respect bore to chosen candidate if so actuated must not vote might stay away other inducement must be offered so much be said loudly very loudly by party nevertheless mr moffat early in election day began to have misgiving about bill proclaimed arrangement have be one exactly suitable to taste for mr moffat loved money be man in whose breast ambition of being great in world of joining to aristocratic people be continually at war with great cost such taste occasioned last election have not be cheap triumph in one way money have be dragged from for purpose have be to mind unintelligible when about middle of first session have with much grumbling settled demand have questioned with whether whistle be worth cost be therefore great stickler for purity of election although have considered matter must have known that with money be only passport into elysium in have now lived for two year probably did not consider for when in canvassing day immediately preceding election have seen that beer house be open population be drunk have asked mr nearthewinde whether violation of treaty be taking place only on part of opponent whether in such case must not be duly noticed with view to possible future petition mr nearthewinde assured triumphantly that half at least of wallowing swine be own especial friend that somewhat more than half of publican of town be eagerly engaged in fighting mr moffat battle mr moffat groaned must have expostulated have mr nearthewinde be willing to hear that gentleman service have be put into requisition by lord de courcy rather than by candidate for candidate cared little to pay bill must be enough for mr nearthewinde be doing business a well knew how to do be not likely that must submit to be lectured by such a mr moffat on trumpery score of expense certainly did appear on morning of election a though great change have be made in resolution of candidate to be very pure from early hour rough band of music be to be heard in part of usually quiet town cart gig omnibus fly old carriage from inn yard vehicle of description must be pressed into service be in motion if horse post boy be not to be paid for by candidate voter be certainly very liberal in mode of bringing to poll election district of city of barchester extended for mile on side of city so that omnibus

shop must have be emptied of article a far a scarlet yellow be concerned scarlet be sir roger colour while friend of mr moffat be decked with yellow seeing what did see mr moffat might well ask whether there have not be violation of treaty of purity at time of election there be question whether england must go to war with energy whether must not be better for to save breath to cool porridge not meddle more than must be helped with foreign quarrel last view of matter be advocated by sir roger motto of course proclaimed merit of domestic peace quiet peace abroad big loaf at home be consequently displayed on four five huge scarlet banner carried waving over head of people mr moffat be staunch supporter of government who be already inclined to be belligerent england honour be therefore legend under selected to do battle may however be doubted whether there be in barchester one inhabitant let alone one elector so fatuous a to suppose england honour be in special manner dear to mr moffat that must be whit more sure of big loaf than be now must sir roger happily become member of legislature then fine art be resorted to seeing language fell short in telling be found necessary to be told poor sir roger failing a regard bottle be too well known be also known that in acquiring title have not quite laid aside rough mode of speech have used in early year there be consequently great daub painted up on sundry wall on navvy with pimply bloated face be to be seen standing on railway bank leaning on spade holding bottle in one hand while invited comrade to drink

greeted two candidate who be desirous of honour of serving in parliament polling went on briskly merrily there be somewhat above nine hundred registered voter of whom greater portion recorded vote early in day at two o'clock according to sir roger committee number be a follows scatcherd moffat whereas by light afforded by mr moffat people stood in slightly different ratio to other being written thus moffat scatcherd naturally heightened excitement gave additional delight to proceeding at past two be agreed by side that mr moffat be ahead moffatites claiming majority of twelve scatcherdites allowing majority of one by three o'clock sundry good men true belonging to railway interest have made way to booth in spite of effort of band of rough from courcy sir roger be again leading by ten dozen according to own showing one little transaction took place in earlier part of day deserves to be recorded there be in barchester honest publican honest a world of publican go who not only be possessed of vote possessed also of son who be voter be one reddypalm in former day before have learned to appreciate full value of englishman franchise have be declared liberal early friend of roger scatcherd in latter day have governed political feeling with more decorum have not allowed to be carried away by such foolish fervour a have evinced in youth on special occasion however line of conduct be so mysterious a for while to baffle even who knew best house be apparently open in sir roger interest beer at rate be flowing there a elsewhere scarlet ribbon going in not perhaps in state of perfect steadiness came out more unsteady than before still have mr reddypalm be deaf to voice of charmer closerstil though have charmed with wisdom mr reddypalm have stated first unwillingness to vote at have said given over politics be not inclined to trouble mind again with subject then have spoken of great devotion to duke of omnium under whose grandfather grandfather have be bred mr nearthewinde have a said be with proved to beyond shadow of doubt that must show deepest ingratitude on part to vote against duke candidate mr closerstil thought understood sent more still more men to drink beer even caused taking infinite trouble to secure secrecy in matter three gallon of british brandy to be ordered paid for a best french nevertheless mr reddypalm made sign to show that considered that right thing have be done on evening before election told one of mr closerstil confidential men that have thought good deal about that believed must be constrained by conscience to vote for mr moffat have said that mr closerstil be accompanied by learned friend of one mr romer barrister who be greatly interested in sir roger who being strong liberal be assisting in canvas with much energy hearing how matter be likely to go with conscientious publican feeling peculiarly capable of dealing with such delicate scruple undertook to look into case in hand early therefore on morning of election sauntered down cross street in hung out sign of brown bear a expected found mr reddypalm near own door now be quite understood thing that there be to be bribery be understood by one better than by mr romer who have in truth drawn up many of published assurance to effect to give due be fully minded to act in accordance with assurance object of party be to make worth voter while to give vote to do so without bribery mr romer have repeatedly declared that must have nothing to do with illegal practising have also declared that a long a be done according to law be ready to lend best effort to assist sir roger how assisted sir roger adhered to law will now be seen oh mr romer mr romer be not case with thee thou wouldst not play false yet wouldst wrongly win not in electioneering mr romer more than in other pursuit can man touch pitch not be defiled a thou innocent a thou art wilt soon learn to thy terrible cost well reddypalm said mr romer shaking hand with mr romer have not be equally cautious a nearthewinde have already drunk sundry glass of ale at brown bear in hope of softening stern bear warden how be to be to day be to be man if one know that mr romer must be man poor numbskull like know nothing of matter how must look to mr romer be selling trifle of drink now then selling getting paid for know mr romer yes be important doubt come reddypalm old friend of sir roger a be man speaks of a one of intimate friend wonder how can hesitate about now with man must think that wanted to be paid for voting oh mr romer fie fie fie know be not case with must be insult to offer money even if money be going must not mention only a money be not going neither on side on other harm can be done mr romer if speak of thing will hurt know value of englishman franchise too well to wish to sell must not demean so low not though five twenty pound vote be going a there be in good old time be not so long ago be sure must reddypalm be sure must honest man like must stick to old friend now tell putting arm through reddypalm walked with into passage of own house now tell be there anything wrong be between friend know be there anything wrong must sell vote for untold gold said reddypalm who be perhaps aware that untold gold must hardly be offered to for be sure must not said mr romer said reddypalm man like to be paid little bill surely surely said barrister did say two year since when friend mr closerstil brought friend of down to stand here be sir roger then when brought friend of down when drew two three hogshead of ale on side when bill be questioned only half settled did say must interfere with election no more more will mr romer unless be to give quiet vote for nobleman under whom mine always lived respectable oh said mr romer man do like to have bill paid know mr romer mr romer must not acknowledge that be natural feeling on part of ordinary mortal publican go agin grain with man not to have little bill paid specially at election time again urged mr reddypalm mr romer have not much time to think about knew well that matter be so nearly balanced that vote of mr reddypalm son be of inestimable value if be only about bill said mr romer will see to have settled will speak to closerstil about right said reddypalm seizing young barrister hand shaking warmly right late in afternoon when vote two became matter of intense interest mr reddypalm son came up to hustings boldly tendered theirs for old friend sir roger there be great deal of eloquence heard in barchester on day sir roger have by time so far recovered a to be able to go through dreadfully hard work of canvassing addressing elector from eight in morning till near sunset very perfect recovery most men will say yes perfect recovery a regarded temporary use of faculty physical mental though may be doubted whether there can be permanent recovery from such disease a what amount of brandy consumed to enable to perform election work what lurking evil effect excitement might have on of matter record be kept in history of proceeding sir roger eloquence be of rough kind not perhaps le operative on for whom be intended aristocracy of barchester consisted chiefly of clerical dignitary bishop dean prebendary such like on theirs be not probable that anything said by sir roger must have much effect men must either abstain from voting vote for railway hero with view of keeping out de courcy candidate then came shopkeeper who might also be regarded a stiff necked generation impervious to electioneering eloquence must generally support mr moffat there be inferior

of eloquence at dragon of wantly at white horse meanwhile friend of de courcy interest be treated perhaps to sounder political view though not expressed in period so intelligibly fluent a of sir roger mr moffat be young man there be knowing to what proficiency in parliamentary gift of public talking might yet attain hitherto proficiency be not great have however endeavoured to make up by study for want of readiness of speech have come to barchester daily for last four day fortified with very pretty harangue have prepared for in solitude of chamber on three previous day matter have be allowed to progress with tolerable smoothness have be permitted to deliver of elaborate eloquence with few other interruption than occasioned by own want of practice on day of day barchesterian rough be not so complaisant appeared to mr moffat when essayed to speak that be surrounded by enemy rather than friend in heart gave great blame to mr nearthewinde for not managing matter better for men of barchester began in voice be now then preternaturally loud at fourth fifth word gave way from want of power descended to natural weak tone men of barchester elector non elector be hall elector hall on young

looked round to friend for little support honourable george who stood close behind suggested that have gone through like brick went through like brick said mr moffat with gravest possible face taking up in utter confusion word be put into mouth hurray so did be real brick well done snip go again with wax thread be thorough paced reformer continued mr moffat somewhat reassured by effect of opportune word friend have whispered into ear thorough paced reformer thorough paced reformer go on snip know what mean thorough paced reformer never mind pace man get on tell something new be reformer be poor mr moffat be little thrown back be so easy to tell gentleman anything new harnessed a be at moment so looked back at honourable supporter for further hint say something about daughter

paced reformer oh drat reform be dumb dog go back to goose snippy never be made for work go to courcy castle reform mr moffat grieved in soul be becoming inextricably bewildered by such facetiae a when egg may be feared not fresh egg flung with unerring precision struck on open part of well plaited shirt reduced to speechless despair egg be mean of delightful support when properly administered be not calculated to add much spirit to man eloquence to ensure power of endurance when supplied in manner above described men there be doubtless whose tongue must not be stopped even by such argument a mr moffat be not one of a insidious fluid trickled down beneath waistcoat felt that further power of coaxing elector out of vote by word flowing from tongue sweeter than honey be for occasion denied to must not be self confident energetic witty good humoured with rotten egg drying through clothes be forced therefore to give way with sadly disconcerted air retired from open window at have be standing be in vain that honourable george mr nearthewinde frank endeavoured again to bring to charge be like beaten prize fighter whose pluck have be cowed out of who if stand up only stand up to fall mr moffat got sulky also when be pressed said that barchester people in might be d with heart said mr nearthewinde must have effect on vote in truth mattered very little whether mr moffat spoke whether did speak four o'clock be hour for closing poll be now fast coming tremendous exertion have be made about half past three by safe emissary sent from nearthewinde to prove to mr reddypalm that manner of contingent advantage must accrue to brown bear if must turn out that mr moffat must take seat for barchester bribe be of course offered even hinted at purity of barchester be not contaminated during day by one such curse a man publican must be required to do great deed in public line to open colossal tap to draw beer for million one must be so fit a mr reddypalm if only might turn out that mr moffat must in coming february take seat a member for barchester mr reddypalm be man of humble desire whose ambition soared higher than that little bill must be duly settled be wonderful what love innkeeper have for bill in entirety account with respectable total of five six pound be brought to complain of one article fire in bedroom be never lighted that second glass of brandy water be never called for desire to have shilling expunged host pleasure in whole transaction be destroyed oh friend pay for brandy water though never drank suffer fire to pas though never warmed why make good man miserable for trifle became notified to reddypalm with sufficient clearness that bill for past election must be paid without further question therefore at five o'clock mayor of barchester proclaimed result of contest in following figure scatcherd moffat mr reddypalm two vote have decided question mr nearthewinde immediately went up to town dinner party at courcy castle that evening be not particularly pleasant meal much however have be absolutely decided before yellow committee concluded labour at white horse there must be petition mr nearthewinde have not be asleep already knew something of manner in mr reddypalm mind have be quieted chapter xviii rival intimacy between frank miss dunstable grew prospered be to say prospered a intimacy though perhaps hardly a love affair there be continued succession of joke between one else in castle understood very fact of there being such good understanding between rather stood in way of than assisted that consummation countess desired people when be in love with other even when pretend to be generally show by loud laughter be frequently case that wife with two hundred thousand pound can be won without little preliminary despair now there be despair at about frank gresham lady de courcy who thoroughly understood portion of world in lived saw that thing be not going quite a must do gave much repeated advice to frank on subject be more eager in doing because imagined frank have done what must to obey first precept have not turned up nose at miss dunstable curl found fault with loud voice have not objected to a ugly even shown dislike to age young man who have be so amenable to reason be worthy of further assistance so lady de courcy did what must to assist frank dear boy must say be little too noisy think mean for know mind miss dunstable must like better if be little more quiet with must aunt said frank looking demurely up into countess face rather think like fun noise that sort of thing know be not very quiet ah frank there be time know when sort of thing must be laid aside fun a call be very well in place indeed one like better than do be not way to show admiration young lady like to be admired if will be little more soft mannered with miss dunstable be sure will find will answer better so old bird taught young bird how to fly very needlessly for in matter of flying nature give own lesson thoroughly duckling will take water even though maternal hen warn against perfidious element never so loudly soon after lady de courcy began to be not very well pleased in matter took into head that miss dunstable be sometimes almost inclined to laugh at on one two occasion almost seemed a though frank be joining miss dunstable in doing so fact indeed be that miss dunstable be fond of fun endowed a be with privilege two hundred thousand pound may be supposed to give to young lady did not very much care at whom laughed be able to make tolerably correct guess at lady de courcy plan towards did not for moment think that frank have intention of furthering aunt view be therefore not at ill inclined to have revenge on countess how very fond aunt be of said to one wet morning a be sauntering through house now laughing almost romping with then teasing sister about mr moffat then bothering lady cousin out of propriety oh very said frank be dear good woman be aunt de courcy declare take more notice of doings than of of cousin wonder ai jealous oh be such good people bless 'd never be jealous be so much younger than be that suppose think want more of care yes that be see be fond of having baby to nurse tell mr gresham what be be saying to last night know have be misbehaving dreadfully be fault must make laugh so be just what said to be talking about then how on earth must talk of one else a long a be here know that world be talking about be dear how kind care straw about world just at present lady de courcy world what did say said be very beautiful did how good of forgot be that said that said what be said said that after beauty be skin deep that valued for virtue prudence rather than good look virtue prudence said be prudent virtuous yes talked of beauty be so kind of did either of say anything about other matter what other matter oh know only people be sometimes valued rather for what have got than for good quality belonging to intrinsically that can never be case with miss dunstable especially not at courcy castle said frank bowing easily from corner of sofa over be leaning of course not said miss dunstable frank at once perceived that spoke in tone of voice differing much from that half bantering half good humoured manner be customary with of course not such idea must be quite out of question with lady de courcy paused for moment then added in tone different again unlike that have yet heard from be at rate out of question with mr frank gresham of be quite sure frank ought to have understood have appreciated good opinion intended to convey did not entirely do so be hardly honest towards must not at first perceive that intended to say that thought so knew very well that be alluding to own huge fortune be alluding also to fact that people of fashion sought because of did not know that intended to express true acquittal a regarded of such baseness did deserve to be acquitted yes upon whole did to be acquitted of special sin desire to make miss dunstable temporarily subject to sway arose not from hankering after fortune from ambition to get better of contest in other men around seemed to be failing for must not be imagined that with prize to be struggled for others stood aloof allowed to have own way with heiress undisputed chance of wife with two hundred thousand pound be godsend come in man life too seldom to be neglected let chance be never so remote frank be heir to large embarrassed property therefore head of family putting wisdom together have thought most meet that daughter of plutus must if possible fall to lot not so thought honourable george not so thought gentleman who be at time inmate of courcy castle suitor perhaps somewhat despised young rival effort may be that have sufficient worldly wisdom to know so important crisis of life be not settled among quip joke frank be too much in jest to be in earnest be that a may love making did not stand in way of love making hope if have in way of hope honourable george have discussed matter with honourable john in properly fraternal manner may be that john have also eye to heiress if so have ceded view to brother superior claim for came about that understood other very well john favoured george with salutary advice on occasion if be to be done at must be done very sharp said john a sharp a like said george be not fellow to be studying three month in what attitude will fall at girl foot when be there must take three month more to study how will get up again if do at must do sharp repeated john putting great stress on advice have said few soft word to already did seem to take badly said george be chicken know remarked john with woman like beating about bush never doe good chance be wo have be of course plum like fall into man mouth merely for shaking tree be possible may if will be a likely to take to day a day six month if be 'd write letter write letter eh said george who did not altogether dislike advice for seemed to take from shoulder burden of preparing spoken address though be so glib in speaking about farmer daughter felt that must have little difficulty in making known passion to miss dunstable by word of mouth yes write letter if will take at will take way match going be made up by writing letter write letter get put on dressing table george said that must so did george spoke quite truly when hinted that have said few soft thing to miss dunstable miss dunstable however be accustomed to hear soft thing have be carried much about in society among fashionable people since on settlement of father will have be pronounced heiress to ointment of lebanon many men have made calculation respecting similar to be now animating brain of honourable george de courcy be already quite accustomed to being target at spendthrift needy rich might shoot arrow accustomed to being shot at tolerably accustomed to protect without making scene in world rejecting advantageous establishment offered to with loud expression of disdain honourable george therefore have be permitted to say soft thing very much a matter of course very little more outward fracas arose from correspondence followed than have arisen from soft thing so said george wrote letter have duly conveyed to miss dunstable bed chamber miss dunstable duly received have answer conveyed back discreetly to george hand correspondence ran a follows courcy castle aug dearest miss dunstable can not flatter that must have perceived from manner that be not indifferent to indeed indeed be not may truly say swear last strong word have be put in by special counsel of honourable john that if ever man loved woman truly truly love may think very odd that must say in letter instead of speaking out before face power of raillery be so great touch up about wit have be advice of honourable john be afraid to encounter dearest dearest martha oh blame for so addressing if will trust happiness to will never find that have be deceived ambition will be to make shine in circle be so well qualified to adorn to see firmly fixed in sphere of fashion for taste adapt may safely assert do assert with hand on heart that be actuated by mercenary motif far be from to marry woman not princess on account of money marriage can be happy without mutual affection do fully trust not trust hope that there may be such between dearest miss dunstable settlement might propose must accede to be sweet person love not money for need not remind that be second son of father that a such hold inconsiderable station in world intention be to get into parliament to make name for if can among who shine in house of common elder brother lord porlock be be aware unmarried fear that family honour be not likely to be perpetuated by a have manner of troublesome liaison will probably prevent settling in life there be nothing at of kind in way will indeed be delight to place coronet on head of lovely martha coronet can give fresh grace to will be so much adorned by wearing dearest miss dunstable will wait with utmost impatience for answer now burning with hope that may not be altogether unfavourable to love beg permission to sign own most devoted george de courcy ardent lover have not to wait long for answer from mistress found letter on toilet table one night a went to bed next morning came down to breakfast met swain with most unconcerned air in world so much so that began to think a munched toast with rather shamefaced look that letter on so much be to depend have not yet come safely to hand suspense be not of prolonged duration after breakfast a be wont went out to stable with brother frank gresham while there miss dunstable man coming up to touched hat put letter into hand frank who knew man glanced at letter looked at cousin said nothing be however little jealous felt that injury be done to by correspondence between miss dunstable cousin george miss dunstable reply be a follows may be remarked that be written in very clear well penned hand one certainly did not betray much emotion of heart dear mr de courcy be sorry to say have not perceived from manner that entertained peculiar feeling towards a have done so must at once have endeavoured to put end to be much flattered by way in speak of be in too humble position to return affection can therefore only express hope that may be soon able to eradicate from bosom letter be very good way of making offer a such think at odd certainly did not expect such honour last night a to raillery trust have never yet hurt can assure never will hope will soon have worthier ambition than to allude for be well aware that attempt will ever make shine anywhere be quite sure have have mercenary motif such motif in marriage be very base quite below name lineage little fortune may have must be matter of indifference to one who look forward a do to put coronet on wife brow nevertheless for sake of family trust lord porlock in spite of obstacle may live to do same for wife of own of day be glad to hear that there be nothing to interfere with own prospect of domestic felicity sincerely hoping that may be perfectly successful in proud ambition to shine in parliament regretting extremely that can not share that ambition with beg to subscribe with very great respect sincere well wisher martha dunstable honourable george with modesty so well became accepted miss dunstable reply a final answer to little proposition troubled with further courtship a said to brother john harm have be done might have better luck next time there be inmate of courcy castle who be somewhat more pertinacious in search after love wealth be other than mr moffat gentleman whose ambition be not satisfied by care of barchester contest possession of one affianced bride mr moffat be a have said man of wealth know from lesson of early youth how love of money increase gain strength by own success be man of so mean spirit a to be satisfied with mere wealth desired also place station gracious countenance among great one of earth hence have come adherence to de courcys hence seat in parliament hence also perhaps ill considered match with miss gresham there be doubt that privilege of matrimony offer opportunity to money loving young men ought not to be lightly abused too many young men marry without giving consideration to matter whatever be not that be indifferent to money that recklessly miscalculate own value omit to look around see how much be done by who be more careful man can be young once except in case of special interposition of providence can marry once chance once thrown away may be said to be irrevocable how in after life do men toil turmoil through long year to attain prospect of doubtful advancement half trouble half care tithe of circumspection must in early youth have probably secured to enduring comfort of wife wealth will see men labouring night day to become bank director even bank direction may only be road to ruin others will spend year in degrading subserviency to obtain niche in will niche when at last obtained enjoyed be sorry payment for have be endured others again struggle harder still go through even deeper water make will for forge stock share fight with unremitting painful labour to appear to be thing that be not now in many of case might have be spared have men made adequate use of opportunity youth youthful charm afford once once only there be road to wealth so easy respectable a of matrimony be of course provided that aspirant decline slow course of honest work then can so seldom put old head on young shoulder in case of mr moffat may perhaps say that specimen be produced of bird so rare in land shoulder be certainly young seeing that be not yet six twenty head have ever be old from moment when be first put forth to go alone at age of twenty one life have be one calculation how must make most of have allowed to be betrayed into folly by unguarded heart youthful indiscretion have marred prospect have made most of without wit depth mental gift without honesty of purpose industry for good work have be for two year sitting member for barchester be guest of lord de courcy be engaged to eldest daughter of one of best commoner family in england be when first began to think of miss dunstable sanguine that re election to parliament be secure when however at period began to calculate what position in world really be occurred to that be doing ill judged thing in marrying miss gresham why marry penniless girl for augusta trifle of fortune be not penny in estimation while there be miss dunstable in world to be won own six seven thousand year quite unembarrassed a be be certainly great thing what might not do if to that must add almost fabulous wealth of great heiress be not here put absolutely in path must not be wilful throwing away of chance not to avail of must to be sure lose de courcy friendship if must then have secured barchester seat for usual term of parliamentary session might be able to spare that must also perhaps encounter gresham enmity be point on did think more than once what will not man encounter for sake of two hundred thousand pound be thus that mr moffat argued with with much prudence brought to resolve that must at rate become candidate for great prize also therefore began to say soft thing must be admitted that said with more considerate propriety than have honourable george mr moffat have idea miss dunstable be not fool that in order to catch must do more than endeavour to lay salt on tail in guise of flattery be evident to that be bird of cunning not to be caught by ordinary gin such a commonly in use with honourable george of society seemed to mr moffat that though miss dunstable be so sprightly so full of fun so ready to chatter on subject well knew value of own money of position a dependent on perceived that never flattered countess seemed to be whit absorbed by titled grandeur of host family gave credit therefore for independent spirit independent spirit in estimation be one placed sole dependence on respectable balance at banker working on idea mr moffat commenced operation in such manner that overture to heiress must not if unsuccessful interfere with greshamsbury engagement began by making common cause with miss dunstable position in world said to be closely similar have risen from lower class by strength of honest industry be now wealthy have hitherto made such use of wealth a to induce highest aristocracy of england to admit into circle yes mr moffat have miss dunstable remarked if hear be true to admit into very family at mr moffat slightly demurred must not affect said to misunderstand what miss dunstable meant there have be something said on probability of such event begged miss dunstable not to believe that heard on such subject believe much said certainly did think that might be credited mr moffat then went on to show how behoved in holding out hand way to meet aristocratic overture be made to not to allow to be made use of aristocracy according to mr moffat be people of very nice sort best acquaintance in world portion of mankind to be noticed by whom must be one of first object in life of dunstables moffats dunstables moffats must be very careful to give little nothing in return much very much in return must be looked for aristocracy said mr moffat be not people to allow light of countenance to shine forth without looking for quid pro quo for compensating value in intercourse with dunstables moffats must expect payment be for dunstables moffats to see at rate did not pay more for article got than market value way in miss dunstable mr moffat must be required to pay must be by taking of poor scion of aristocracy in marriage thus expending hard earned wealth in procuring high priced pleasure for well born pauper against peculiar caution be to be used of course further induction to be shown be people so circumstanced must marry among dunstables moffats with other not tumble into pitfall prepared for whether great lesson have lasting effect on miss dunstable mind may be doubted perhaps have already made up mind on subject mr moffat so well discussed be older than mr moffat in spite of two year of parliamentary experience have perhaps more knowledge of world with have to deal listened to what said with complacency understood object a well a have that of aristocratic rival be whit offended groaned in spirit a thought of wrong of augusta gresham good advice however must not win money for mr moffat without more decided step step soon decided on taking feeling assured that what have said must have due weight with heiress party at courcy castle be now soon about to be broken up male de courcys be going down to scotch mountain female de courcys be to be shipped off to irish castle mr moffat be to go up to town to prepare petition miss dunstable be again about to start on foreign tour in behalf of physician attendant frank gresham be at last to be allowed to go to cambridge be to say unless success with miss dunstable must render step on part quite preposterous think may speak now frank said countess really think may have known now for considerable time a far a can judge be very fond of nonsense aunt said frank doe care button for think differently looker on know always understand game best suppose be not afraid to ask afraid said frank in tone of considerable scorn almost made up mind that must ask to show that be not afraid only obstacle to doing so be that have not slightest intention of marrying there be to be one other great event before party broke up be dinner at duke of omnium duke have already declined to come to courcy have in measure atoned for by asking of guest to join great dinner be about to give to neighbour mr moffat be to leave courcy castle day after dinner party therefore determined to make great attempt on morning of day be with difficulty that brought about opportunity at last did so found alone with miss dunstable in walk of courcy park be strange thing be not said recurring to old view of same subject must be going to dine with duke of omnium richest man say among whole english aristocracy men of kind entertain everybody believe now then said miss dunstable not very civilly believe do be not going a one of everybodies be going from lord de courcy house with of own family have pride in not least have more pride in father honest industry show what money doe in country of ours yes indeed money doe great deal many queer thing in saying miss dunstable must not think that money have done very queer thing in inducing miss gresham to fall in love with mr moffat yes wealth be very powerful here be miss dunstable most honoured guest in house oh know about that may be for be member of parliament not member now miss dunstable well will be be same have such title to honour thank god walked on in silence for little while for mr moffat hardly knew how to manage business have in hand be quite delightful to watch people said at last now accuse of being tuft hunter do said miss dunstable upon word did know that anybody ever so accused did mean personally oh be glad of be what world say of person of class now seems to that toadying be on other side countess here doe toady so do young lady do if so upon word did know to tell truth think much of such thing live mostly to myself mr moffat see that do admire for miss dunstable can not always live so mr moffat looked at in manner gave first intimation of coming burst of tenderness be a may be mr moffat said went on beating about bush for time giving to understand how necessary be that person situated a be must live for for other above thing must beware of falling into mouth of voracious aristocratic lion who go about looking for prey till came to turn in ground at miss dunstable declared determination of going in have walked enough said a by time mr moffat immediate intention be becoming visible thought prudent to retire let take in mr moffat boot be little damp dr easyman will never forgive if hurry in a fast a can foot damp hope not do hope not said with look of greatest solicitude oh be nothing to signify be well to be prudent know good morning mr moffat miss dunstable eh yes miss dunstable stopped in grand path wo let return with mr moffat because know be not coming in so soon miss dunstable will be leaving to morrow yes go day after know be going to town be going abroad may be long very long before meet again about easter said miss dunstable be if doctor doe knock up on road have have wished to say something before part for so long time miss dunstable stop mr moffat let ask one question will hear anything that have got to say on one condition be that miss augusta gresham will be by while say will consent to miss augusta gresham said have no right to listen to private conversation have not mr moffat then think must have at rate will not so far interfere with what look on a undoubted privilege a to be party to secret in may not participate miss dunstable to tell fairly mr moffat secret that do tell will most undoubtedly repeat to before dinner good morning mr moffat foot be certainly little damp if stay moment longer dr easyman will put off foreign trip for at least week so left standing alone in middle of gravel walk for moment two mr moffat consoled in misfortune by thinking how might best avenge on miss dunstable soon however such futile idea left brain why must give over chase because rich galleon have escaped on first cruise in pursuit of such prize be not to be won so easily present objection clearly consisted in engagement to miss gresham in only let engagement be at end notoriously publicly broken off objection must fall to ground yes ship so richly freighted be not to be run down in one summer morning plain sailing instead of looking for revenge on miss dunstable must be more prudent in more in keeping with character to pursue object overcome such difficulty a might find in way chapter xix duke of omnium duke of omnium be a have said bachelor not le on account did on certain rare gala day entertain beauty of county at magnificent rural seat female fashion of london in belgrave square on occasion dinner at gatherum castle for such be name of mansion be to be confined to lord of creation be to be one of day on collected round board notable of county in order that popularity might not wane established glory of hospitable house become dim on occasion be not probable that lord de courcy must be one of guest party indeed who went from courcy castle be not large consisted of honourable george mr moffat frank gresham went in tax cart with tandem horse driven very knowingly by george de courcy fourth seat on back of vehicle be occupied by servant who be to look after horse at gatherum honourable george drove either well luckily for reached duke house in safety drove very fast poor miss dunstable what must have be lot have anything good happened to vehicle so richly freighted with three lover did not quarrel a to prize reached gatherum castle in good humour with other castle be new building of white stone lately erected at enormous cost by one of first architect of day be immense pile seemed to cover ground enough for moderate sized town nevertheless report said that when be completed noble owner found that have room to live in on account when disposed to study own comfort resided in house of perhaps one tenth size built by grandfather in county gatherum castle must probably be called italian in style of architecture though may think be doubted whether such edifice anything like be ever seen in part of italy be vast edifice irregular in height appeared to be so having long wing on side too high to be passed over by eye a mere adjunct to mansion portico so large a to make house behind look like building of greater altitude portico be supported by ionic column be in doubtless beautiful structure be approached by flight of step very broad very grand a approach by flight of step hardly suit englishman house to immediate entrance of be necessary that carriage must drive there be front door in one of wing be commonly used carriage however must on very stupendously grand occasion visit for instance of queen king royal duke be brought up under portico a step have be so constructed a to admit of road with rather stiff ascent being made close in front of wing up into very porch opening from porch be grand hall extended up to top of house be magnificent indeed being decorated with many coloured marble hung round with various trophy of house of omnium banner be there armour sculptured bust of many noble progenitor full length figure in marble of who have be especially prominent monument of glory that wealth long year great achievement must bring together if only man must live in hall be for ever happy there duke of omnium must not live happily in hall fact be that architect in contriving magnificent entrance for own honour fame have destroyed duke house a regard most of ordinary purpose of residence nevertheless gatherum castle be very noble pile standing a doe on eminence have very fine effect when seen from many distant knoll verdant wooded hill at seven o'clock mr de courcy friend got down from drag at smaller door for be day on to mount up under portico be that suitable vehicle to have be entitled to such honour frank felt excitement little stronger than usual to at such moment for have never yet be in company with duke of omnium rather puzzled to think on point must talk to man who be largest landowner in county in have so great interest however made up mind that must allow duke to choose own subject merely reserving to right of pointing out how deficient in gorse cover be west barsetshire that being duke division be soon divested of coat hat without entering on magnificence of great hall be conducted through rather narrow passage into rather small drawing room small be in proportion to number of gentleman there assembled there might be about thirty frank be inclined to think that be almost crowded man came forward to greet when name be announced hero at once knew that be not duke for man be fat short whereas duke be thin tall there be great hubbub going on for everybody seemed to be talking to neighbour in default of neighbour to be clear that exalted rank of host have put very little constraint on guest tongue for chatted away with a much freedom a farmer at ordinary be duke at last frank contrived to whisper to cousin oh be not here said george suppose will be in presently believe never show till just before dinner frank of course have nothing further to say already began to feel little snubbed thought that duke duke though be when asked people to dinner must be there to tell that be glad to see more people flashed into room frank found rather closely wedged in with stout clergyman of acquaintance be not badly off for mr athill be friend of own who have held living near greshamsbury lately however at lamented decease of dr stanhope who have died of apoplexy at villa in italy mr athill have be presented with better preferment of eiderdown have therefore removed to part of county be somewhat of bon vivant man who thoroughly understood dinner party with much good nature took frank under special protection stick to mr gresham said when go into dining room be old hand at duke dinner know how to make friend comfortable a well a myself why doe duke come in demanded frank will be here a soon a dinner be ready said mr athill rather dinner will be ready a soon a be here care therefore how soon come frank did not understand have nothing to do to wait see how thing went be beginning to be impatient for room be now nearly full seemed evident that other guest be coming when suddenly bell rang gong be sounded at same instant door have not yet be used flew open very plainly dressed plain tall man entered room frank at once knew that be at last in presence of duke of omnium grace late a be in commencing duty a host seemed in hurry to make up for lost time quietly stood on rug with back to empty grate spoke one two word in very low voice to one two gentleman who stood nearest to crowd in meanwhile became suddenly silent frank when found that duke did not come speak to felt that ought to go speak to duke one else did so when whispered surprise to mr athill gentleman told that be duke practice on such occasion fothergill said duke be only word have yet spoken out loud believe be ready for dinner now mr fothergill be duke land agent be who have greeted frank friend at entrance immediately gong be again sounded door leading out of drawing room into dining room be opened duke led way then guest followed stick close to mr gresham said athill will get about middle of table where will be cosy on other side of room out of dreadful draught know place well mr gresham stick to mr athill who be pleasant chatty companion have hardly seated be talking to frank a quickly a must when mr fothergill who sat at bottom of table asked to say grace seemed to be quite out of question that duke must take trouble with guest mr athill consequently dropped word be speaking uttered prayer if be prayer that might have grateful heart for god be about to give if be prayer a far a own experience go such utterance be seldom prayer seldom can be prayer if not prayer what then to be unintelligible that full tide of glibbest chatter can be stopped at moment in midst of profuse good living giver thanked becomingly in word of heartfelt praise setting aside for moment what one daily hears see may not one declare that change so sudden be not within compass of human mind then to such reasoning one can not add what one doe hear see one can not judge of ceremony by manner in one see performed uttered be listened to clergyman there be one meet now then who endeavour to give to dinner table grace of solemnity of church ritual what be effect much same a though one be to be interrupted for minute in midst of one of church liturgy to hear drinking song will be argued that man need be le thankful because at moment of receiving utters thanksgiving will be thought that man be made thankful because what be called grace be uttered after dinner can hardly be imagined that one will so argue so think dinner grace be probably last remaining relic of certain daily service church in olden day enjoined none compline vesper be others of none compline have happily got quit might be well if must get rid of dinner grace also let man ask whether on own part be act of prayer thanksgiving if not that what then footnote be know alleged that grace be said before dinner because saviour uttered blessing before last supper can not say that idea of such analogy be pleasing to when large party entered dining room one two gentleman might be seen to come in from other door set at table near to duke chair be guest of own who be staying in house particular friend men with whom lived others be stranger whom fed perhaps once year in order that name might be known in land a of one who distributed food wine hospitably through county food wine attendance also view of vast repository of plate vouchsafed willingly to county neighbour be beyond good nature to talk to to judge by present appearance of most of be quite a well satisfied to be left alone frank be altogether stranger there mr athill knew one at table be apjohn said know mr apjohn attorney from barchester be always here doe of fothergill law business make useful if fellow know value of good dinner doe will see that duke hospitality will not be thrown away on be very much thrown away upon know said frank who must not at put up with idea of sitting down to dinner without having be spoken to by host oh nonsense said clerical friend will enjoy amazingly by by there be not such champagne in other house in barsetshire then claret mr athill pressed lip together gently shook head meaning to signify by motion that claret of gatherum castle be sufficient atonement for penance man might have to go through in mode of obtaining who be funny little man sitting there next one to mr de courcy never saw such queer fellow in life know old bolus well thought one in barsetshire knew bolus especially must do so a be such dear friend of dr thorne dear friend of dr thorne yes be apothecary at scarington in old day before dr fillgrave came into vogue remember when bolus be thought to be very good sort of doctor be be whispered frank be by way of gentleman have have have well suppose must be charitable say that be quite a good at rate a many others there be here mr athill a spoke whispered into frank ear see there be finnie here barchester attorney now really think where finnie go may go too more merrier suppose said frank well something little like wonder why thorne be not here be sure be asked perhaps did not particularly wish to meet finnie bolus do know mr athill think be quite right not to come a for wish be anywhere else have have have know duke way yet what be more be young happy fellow thorne must have more sense ought to show here gormandizing be now going on at tremendous rate though volubility of tongue have be for while stopped by first shock of duke presence guest seemed to feel such constraint upon teeth fed one may almost say rabidly gave order to servant in eager manner much more impressive than usual at smaller party mr apjohn who sat immediately opposite to frank have by well planned manoeuvre contrived to get before jowl of salmon unfortunately be not for while equally successful in article of sauce very limited portion so at least thought mr apjohn have be put on plate servant with huge sauce tureen absolutely passed behind back inattentive to audible request poor mr apjohn in despair turned round to arrest man by coat tail be moment too late fell backwards on floor a righted muttered anathema looked with face of anguish at plate anything matter apjohn said mr fothergill kindly seeing utter despair written on poor man countenance can get anything for sauce said mr apjohn in voice must have melted hermit a looked at mr fothergill pointed at now distant sinner who be dispensing melted ambrosia at least ten head upwards away from unfortunate supplicant mr fothergill however knew where to look for balm for such wound in minute two mr apjohn be employed quite to heart content well said frank to neighbour may be very well once in way think that on whole dr thorne be right dear mr gresham see world on side said mr athill who have also be somewhat intent on gratification of own appetite though with energy le evident than of gentleman opposite see world on side if have opportunity believe good dinner now then be very good thing yes like eating with hog whish h softly softly mr gresham will disturb mr apjohn digestion upon word will want before have done now like kind of thing once in way do said frank in tone be almost savage yes indeed do one see so much character after what harm doe do idea be that people must live with whose society be pleasant to live yes mr gresham agree with there must do for to live with duke of omnium must understand probably approve way must perhaps much like constant presence of mr apjohn now then once in year so do own like to see here be cup now do mr gresham pas cup without tasting so dinner passed on slowly enough a frank thought too quickly for mr apjohn passed away wine came circulating freely tongue again be loosed teeth being released from labour under influence of claret duke presence be forgotten very speedily coffee be brought will soon be over now said frank to thankfully for though be mean despised good claret have lost temper too completely to enjoy at present moment be much mistaken farce a yet be only at commencement duke took cup of coffee so did few friend who sat close to beverage did not seem to be in great request with majority of guest when duke have taken modicum rose up silently retired saying word making sign then farce commenced now gentleman said mr fothergill cheerily be right apjohn be there claret there mr bolus know stick to madeira be quite right for there be much of left belief be there will never be more like so duke hospitality went on duke guest drank merrily for next two hour sha see more of asked frank more of whom said mr athill of duke oh will see more of always go when coffee come be brought in a excuse have have enough of light of countenance to last till next year duke be excellent friend have be so fifteen year never see more of than will go away said frank nonsense mr de courcy other friend wo stir for hour yet care will walk on may catch may be wrong seems to that man insult when asks to dine with never speaks to care if be ten time duke of omnium ca be more than gentleman a such be equal then having thus given vent to feeling in somewhat high flown language walked forth trudged away along road towards courcy frank gresham have be born bred conservative whereas duke of omnium be well known a consistent whig there be one so devoutly resolved to admit of superior a conservative born bred one so inclined to high domestic despotism a thoroughgoing consistent old whig when have proceeded about six mile frank be picked up by friend even then anger have hardly cooled be duke a civil a ever when took leave of said to cousin george a took seat on drag juke be jeuced jude wine lem tell that old fella hiccupped out honourable george a touched up leader under flank chapter xx proposal now departure from courcy castle came rapidly one after there remained one more evening before miss dunstable carriage be to be packed countess in early moment of frank courtship have controlled ardour checked rapidity of amorous profession a day at last week wore away found that be necessary to stir fire have before endeavoured to slacken there will be nobody here to night own circle said to really think must tell miss dunstable what intention be will have fair ground to complain of if frank began to feel that be in dilemma have commenced making love to miss dunstable partly because liked amusement partly from satirical propensity to quiz aunt by appearing to fall into scheme have overshot mark did not know what answer to give when be thus called upon to make downright proposal then although did not care two rush about miss dunstable in way of love nevertheless experienced sort of jealousy when found that appeared to be indifferent to that corresponded meanwhile with cousin george though flirtation have be carried on on side palpably by way of fun though frank have told ten time day that heart be true to mary thorne yet have undefined feeling that behoved miss dunstable to be little in love with be not quite at ease in be not little melancholy now that departure be so nigh above be anxious to know what be real fact about letter have in own breast threatened miss dunstable with heartache now when time for separation came found that own heart be more likely to ache of two suppose must say something to aunt will never be satisfied said to a sauntered into little drawing room on last evening at very time be ashamed of for knew be going to ask badly sister one of cousin be in room aunt who be quite on alert soon got out of frank miss dunstable be alone so all fun laughter be come to end said beginning conversation know how feel for really be little melancholy at idea of parting looked up at with laughing black eye a though never have never must have care in world melancholy oh yes look so said frank who really did feel somewhat lackadaisically sentimental how thoroughly glad countess must be that be going continued declare have treated most infamously ever since have be here have have amusement to ourselves have sometimes thought must turn out of house wish with heart have oh cruel barbarian why on earth must wish that might have joined in exile hate courcy castle must have rejoiced to leave what love miss dunstable must have doubly trebly rejoiced to leave with frank voice quivered little a made gallant profession still miss dunstable only laughed louder upon word of knight be by far best behaved said say much prettiest thing frank became rather red in face felt that did so miss dunstable be treating like boy while pretended to be so fond of be only laughing at corresponding while with cousin george now frank gresham already entertained sort of contempt for cousin increased bitterness of feeling must really be possible that george have succeeded while have utterly failed that stupid cousin have touched heart of heiress while be playing with a with boy of knight be that way talk to when be going to part when be miss dunstable that george de courcy became one of miss dunstable for while looked serious enough what make ask that said what make inquire about mr de courcy oh have eye know ca help seeing not that see have seen anything must possibly help what have seen mr gresham why know have be writing to did tell so no did not tell know for moment sat silent then face again resumed usual happy smile come mr gresham be not going to quarrel with hope even if did write letter to cousin why must not write to correspond with manner of people will write to of day if will let will promise to answer letter frank threw back on sofa on be sitting in doing so brought somewhat nearer to companion than have be then drew hand slowly across forehead pushing back thick hair a did so sighed somewhat plaintively care said for privilege of correspondence on such term if cousin george be to be correspondent of yours also will give up claim then sighed again so that be piteous to hear be certainly arrant puppy egregious as into bargain then must be remembered in favour that be only twenty one that much have be done to spoil miss dunstable did remember therefore abstained from laughing at why mr gresham what on earth do mean in human probability will never write line to mr de courcy if did what possible harm must do oh miss dunstable in least understand what feeling be then hope never will thought did thought be feeling of good true hearted friend feeling must sometimes look back upon with pleasure a being honest when so much that one meet be false have become very fond of mr gresham must be sorry to think did not understand feeling be almost worse worse young lady like miss dunstable for be still to be numbered in category of young lady usually tell young gentleman that be very fond of to boy girl may make such declaration now frank gresham regarded a one who have already fought battle fought not without glory must not therefore endure to be thus openly told by miss dunstable that be very fond of fond of miss dunstable wish be so be very little know how fond be of miss dunstable put out hand to take hold of hers then lifted up own slapped lightly on knuckle what can have to say to miss dunstable can make necessary that must pinch hand tell fairly mr gresham if make fool of will come to conclusion that be fool that be hopeless to look out for one worth caring for such advice a so kindly given so wisely meant so clearly intelligible must have taken understood young a be even yet did not do so fool of yes suppose must be fool if have so much regard for miss dunstable a to make painful for to know be to see more fool yes of course be fool man be always fool when love miss dunstable must not pretend to doubt meaning longer be determined to stop let cost what must now put out hand not over white a frank soon perceived gifted with very fair allowance of strength now mr gresham said before go further will listen to will listen to for moment without interrupting frank be of course obliged to promise that must do so be going rather be going for will stop to make profession of love profession said frank making slight unsuccessful effort to get hand free yes profession false profession mr gresham false profession false profession look into heart into heart of heart know at rate have heart look into closely mr gresham know love not a man must love woman whom swears to love frank be taken aback so appealed to found that must not longer say that did love must only look into face with eye sit there listening to how be possible that must love be heaven know how many year senior be young beautiful have be brought up a must be whom in time will really love make wife have nothing must make love be rich be not said frank stoutly feeling imperatively called upon to utter something in own defence ah mr gresham fear be that for what other reason can have laid plan to talk in way to woman a be have laid plan said frank now getting hand to at rate wrong there miss dunstable like so well nay love if woman may talk of love in way of friendship that if money money alone must make happy must have heaped on if want mr gresham will have have never thought of money said frank surlily grief continued doe grieve to think that so young so gay so bright that must have looked for in way from others have taken just a wind whistle now two big slow tear escaped from eye must have rolled down rosy cheek be not that brushed off with back of hand have utterly mistaken miss dunstable said frank if have will humbly beg pardon said have indeed have how can have mistaken be not about to say that loved to talk absolute nonsense to make offer if be not if have mistaken indeed will beg pardon frank have nothing further to say in own defence have not wanted miss dunstable money be true must not deny that have be about to talk that absolute nonsense of spoke with so much scorn must almost make think that there be none honest in fashionable world of yours well know why lady de courcy have have here how must help knowing have be so foolish in plan ten time day have told own secret have said to myself twenty time that if be crafty be honest be dishonest have laughed in sleeve to see how played game to hear others around playing of thinking that must get money of poor fool who have come at beck call be able to laugh at a long a thought have one true friend to laugh with one can not laugh with world against one be not against miss dunstable sell for money why if be man must not sell one jot of liberty for mountain of gold what tie in heyday of youth to person must never love for price perjure destroy not only also in order might live idly oh heaven mr gresham can be that word of such woman a aunt have sunk so deeply in heart have blackened so foully a to make think of such vile folly a have forgotten soul spirit man energy treasure of heart so young for shame mr gresham for shame for shame frank found task before by mean easy one have to make miss dunstable understand that have never have slightest idea of marrying that have made love to merely with object of keeping hand in for work a be with object other equally laudable one of interfering with cousin george yet there be nothing for to get through task a best might be goaded to by accusation miss dunstable brought against began to feel that though invective against might be bitter when have told truth must not be so bitter a now kept hinting at under mistaken impression a to view have never have strong propensity for money hunting now that offence appeared in eye abominable unmanly disgusting imputation must be better than miss dunstable never for moment thought of doing what accuse of on honour never did have be very foolish very wrong idiotic believe have never intended that then mr gresham what did intend be rather difficult question to answer frank be not very quick in attempting know will not forgive said at last indeed see how can know how came about be certain miss dunstable have never for moment thought about fortune be thought about in way of coveting never thought of making wife then never said frank looking boldly into face never intended really to propose to go with to altar then make rich by one great perjury never for moment said have never gloated over a bird of prey gloat over poor beast be soon to become carrion beneath claw have not counted out a equal to so much land calculated on a balance at banker ah mr gresham continued seeing that stared a though struck almost with awe by strong language little guess what woman situated a be have to suffer have behaved badly to miss dunstable beg pardon have never thought of money then will be friend again mr gresham wo be so nice to have friend like there think understand now need not tell be half by way of making fool of aunt said frank in apologetic tone there be merit in at rate said miss dunstable understand now thought to make fool of in real earnest well can forgive at rate be not mean may be that miss dunstable did not feel much acute anger at finding that young man have addressed with word of love in course of ordinary flirtation although flirtation have be unmeaning silly be not offence against heart breast have found peculiar cause to arm be not injury from have hitherto experienced suffering at rate frank again became friend before evening be over perfectly understood other twice during long tete tete lady de courcy came into room to see how thing be going on twice went out almost unnoticed be quite clear to that something uncommon have taken place be taking place must take place must be for weal for woe good must now come from interference on occasion therefore smiled sweetly on pair of turtle dove glided out of room a quietly a have glided into at last became necessary to remove for world have gone to bed frank in meantime have told to miss dunstable love for mary thorne miss dunstable have enjoined to be true to vow to eye there be something of heavenly beauty in young true love of beauty be heavenly because have be unknown to mind let hear mr gresham said mind do mr gresham never never forget for one moment not for one moment mr gresham frank be about to swear that never must again when countess for third time sailed into room young people said do know what o'clock be dear lady de courcy declare be past twelve really be ashamed of how glad will be to get rid of to morrow indeed sha will frank so miss dunstable passed out then once again aunt tapped nephew with fan be last time in life that did so looked up in face look be enough to tell that acre of greshamsbury be not to be reclaimed by ointment of lebanon nothing further on subject be said on following morning miss dunstable took departure not much heeding rather cold word of farewell hostess gave on following day frank started for greshamsbury chapter xxi mr moffat fall into trouble will now with reader kind permission skip over month in narrative frank returned from courcy castle to greshamsbury having communicated to mother much in same manner a have to countess fact that mission have be unsuccessful went up after day two to cambridge during short stay at greshamsbury did not even catch glimpse of mary asked for of course be told that be not likely that must be at house just at present called at doctor be denied to there be out janet said probably with miss oriel went to parsonage found miss oriel at home mary have not be seen that morning then returned to house having come to conclusion that have not thus vanished into air otherwise than by preconcerted arrangement boldly taxed beatrice on subject beatrice looked very demure declared that one in house have quarrelled with mary confessed that have be thought prudent that must for while stay away from greshamsbury of course ended by telling brother everything including scene have passed between mary be out of question thinking of marrying frank said must know that nobody feel more strongly than poor mary herself beatrice looked very personification of domestic prudence know nothing of kind said with headlong imperative air be usual with in discussing matter with sister know nothing of kind of course can not say what mary feeling may be pretty life must have have of among may be sure of beatrice so may mother that nothing on earth will make give up nothing frank a made protestation strengthened own resolution by thinking of counsel miss dunstable have given brother sister must hardly agree a beatrice be dead against match not that must not have liked mary thorne for sister in law that shared to certain degree feeling be now common to gresham frank must marry money seemed at rate to be imperative that must either do not marry at poor beatrice be not very mercenary in view have wish to sacrifice brother to miss dunstable yet felt a felt mary thorne included that match a of young heir with doctor niece be not to be thought of not to be spoken of a thing be in way possible therefore beatrice though be mary great friend though be brother favourite sister must give frank encouragement poor frank circumstance have made one bride possible to must marry money mother said nothing to on subject when learnt that affair with miss dunstable be not to come off merely remarked that must perhaps be best for to return to cambridge a soon a possible have spoken mind out must probably have also advised to remain there a long a possible countess have not omitted to write to when frank left courcy castle countess letter certainly made anxious mother think that son education have hardly yet be completed with secondary object with of keeping out of way of mary thorne in first place lady arabella be now quite satisfied that son must enjoy such advantage a education completed at university might give with father frank have long conversation ala gist of father conversation be that behoved frank to marry money father however did not put to in cold callous way in lady aunt have done lady mother did not bid go sell to first female must find possessed of wealth be with inward self reproach true grief of spirit that father told son that be not possible for to do a may do who be born really rich really poor if marry girl without fortune frank how be to live father asked after having confessed how deep have injured own heir care about money sir said frank will be just a happy a if boxall hill have never be sold care straw about sort of thing ah boy will care will soon find that do care let go into profession let go to bar be sure must earn own living earn of course must why not a well a others must like of thing to be barrister there be much more of same kind in frank said that must think of to lessen father regret in conversation not word be spoken about mary thorne frank be not aware whether father have be told of great family danger be dreaded in quarter that have be told may surmise a lady arabella be not wont to confine family danger to own bosom moreover mary presence have of course be missed truth be that squire have be told with great bitterness of what have come to pas evil have be laid at door have be who have encouraged mary to be regarded almost a daughter of house of greshamsbury be who taught that odious doctor odious in aptitude for good doctoring to think fit match for aristocracy of county have be fault great necessity that frank must marry money now be fault that frank be absolutely talking of marrying pauper by mean in quiescence did squire hear charge brought against lady arabella in attack got quite a much a gave at last be driven to retreat in state of headache declared to be chronic so assured daughter augusta must prevent from having more lengthened conversation with lord at rate for next three month though squire may be said to have come off on whole a victor in combat did not perhaps have on account le effect upon knew be true that have done much towards ruining son also must think of other remedy than matrimony be frank doom pronounced even by voice of father that must marry money so frank went off again to cambridge feeling a went to be much lesser man in greshamsbury estimation than have be two month earlier when birthday have be celebrated once during short stay at greshamsbury have seen doctor meeting have be anything pleasant have be afraid to ask after mary doctor have be too diffident of to speak of have met casually on road though in heart loved other meeting have be anything pleasant so frank went back to cambridge a did so stoutly resolved that nothing must make untrue to mary thorne beatrice said on morning went away when came into room to superintend packing beatrice if ever talk about oh frank darling frank think of be madness know be madness never mind if ever talk about tell that last word said be must never forget can do a like beatrice made promise never hinted that must give message may be taken for granted that have not be long in company with mary thorne before did give then there be other trouble at greshamsbury have be decided that augusta marriage be to take place in september mr moffat have unfortunately be obliged to postpone happy day have told augusta not of course without protestation a to regret have written to effect to mr gresham electioneering matter other trouble have said made peculiarly painful postponement absolutely necessary augusta seemed to bear misfortune with more equanimity than be believe usual with young lady under such circumstance spoke of to mother in very matter of fact way seemed almost contented at idea of remaining at greshamsbury till february be time now named for marriage lady arabella be not equally well satisfied be squire half believe that fellow be not honest have once said out loud before frank set frank thinking of what dishonesty in matter be probable that mr moffat might be guilty what must be fitting punishment for crime did think on subject in vain especially after conference on matter have with friend harry baker conference took place during christmas vacation must be mentioned that time spent by frank at courcy castle have not done much to assist in view a to early degree that have at last be settled that must stay up at cambridge year when came home at christmas found that house be not peculiarly lively mary be absent on visit with miss oriel young lady be staying with miss oriel aunt in neighbourhood of london frank soon learnt that there be chance that of must be home before return message have be left for by mary none at least have be left with beatrice began in heart to accuse of coldness perfidy not certainly with much justice seeing that have never given slightest encouragement absence of patience oriel added to dullness of place be certainly hard upon frank that attraction of village must be removed to make way prepare for return harder perhaps on for to tell truth miss oriel visit have be entirely planned to enable to give mary comfortable way of leaving greshamsbury during time that frank must remain at home frank thought cruelly used what did mr oriel think when doomed to eat christmas pudding alone because young squire must be unreasonable in love what did doctor think a sat solitary by deserted hearth doctor who no longer permitted to enjoy comfort of greshamsbury dining table frank hinted grumbled talked to beatrice of determined constancy of love occasionally consoled by stray smile from of neighbouring belle black horse be made perfect old grey pony be by mean discarded much be satisfactory be done in sporting line still house be dull frank felt that be cause of being so of doctor saw little never came to greshamsbury unless to see lady arabella a doctor to be closeted with squire there be social evening with animated confabulation at doctor house discourse between a there have wont to be about merit of different cover capacity of different hound be dull day on whole for frank sad enough may say for friend doctor in february frank again went back to college having settled with harry baker certain affair weighed on mind went back to cambridge promising to be home on th of month so a to be present at sister wedding cold chilling time have be named for hymeneal joy one not altogether unsuited to feeling of happy pair february be certainly not warm month with rich be generally cosy comfortable time good fire winter cheer groaning table warm blanket make fictitious summer to taste be more delightful than long day hot sun marriage be especially winter match depend for charm on same substantial attraction instead of heart beating to heart in sympathetic unison purse chink to purse rich new furniture of new abode be looked to instead of rapture of pure embrace new carriage be depended on rather than new heart companion first bright gloss prepared by upholsterer hand stand in lieu of rosy tint young love lends to true votary mr moffat have not spent christmas at greshamsbury that eternal election petition eternal lawyer eternal care of well managed wealth forbade enjoyment of such pleasure must not come to greshamsbury for christmas yet for festivity of new year now then wrote prettily worded note sending occasionally silver gilt pencil case small brooch informed lady arabella that looked forward to th of february with great satisfaction in meanwhile squire became anxious at last went up to london frank who be at cambridge bought heaviest cutting whip to be found in town wrote confidential letter to harry baker poor mr moffat be well known that none brave deserve fair thou without much excuse for bravery have secured for one who at rate be fair enough for thee must not have be well hadst thou looked into thyself to see what real bravery might be in thee before thou hadst prepared to desert fair one thou hadst already won that last achievement one may say did require special courage poor mr moffat be wonderful that a sat in gig going to gatherum castle planning how must be off with miss gresham afterwards on with miss dunstable be wonderful that must not then have cast eye behind looked at stalwart pair of shoulder be so close to own back a afterwards pondered on scheme while sipping duke claret be odd that must not have observed fiery pride of purpose power of wrath be so plainly written on young man brow when matured finished carried out purpose that did not think of keen grasp have already squeezed own hand with somewhat too warm vigour even in way of friendship poor mr moffat be probable that forgot to think of frank at a connected with promised bride be probable that looked forward only to squire violence enmity of house of courcy that found from enquiry at heart pulse that be man enough to meet must have guessed what whip frank gresham must have bought at cambridge must have divined what letter must have be written to harry baker be probable nay think may say certain that miss gresham must have become mr moffat miss gresham however never did become mr moffat about two day after frank departure for cambridge be just possible that mr moffat be so prudent a to make aware of fact just two day after frank departure very long elaborate clearly explanatory letter be received at greshamsbury mr moffat be quite sure that miss gresham very excellent parent must do justice to believe that be not actuated c c c long short of be that mr moffat signified intention of breaking off match without offering intelligible reason augusta again bore disappointment well not indeed without sorrow heartache inward hidden tear still well raved fainted walked about by moonlight alone wrote poetry never once thought of suicide when indeed remembered rosy tinted lining unfathomable softness of long acre carriage spirit did for one moment give way on whole bore a strong minded woman de courcy must do lady arabella squire be greatly vexed former have made match latter having consented to have incurred deeper responsibility to enable to bring about money be to have be given to mr moffat be still to fore ala how much how much that must ill spare have be thrown away on bridal preparation be moreover unpleasant thing for gentleman to have daughter jilted perhaps peculiarly so to have jilted by tailor son lady arabella woe be really piteous seemed to a though cruel fate be heaping misery after misery upon wretched house of greshamsbury few week since thing be going so well with frank then be accepted husband of almost untold wealth so at least be informed by sister in law whereas augusta be accepted wife of wealth not indeed untold of dimension quite sufficiently respectable to cause much joy in telling where now be golden hope where now splendid future of poor duped child augusta be left to pine alone frank in still worse plight insisted on maintaining love for bastard pauper for frank affair have received poor consolation by laying blame on squire shoulder what have then said be now repaid to with interest for not only have be maker of augusta match have boasted of deed with mother pride be from beatrice that frank have obtained tidings last resolve on part of mr moffat have not altogether be unsuspected by of gresham though altogether unsuspected by lady arabella frank have spoken of a possibility to beatrice be not quite unprepared when information reached consequently bought big cutting whip wrote confidential letter to harry baker on following day frank harry might have be seen with head nearly close together leaning over one of table in large breakfast room at tavistock hotel in covent garden ominous whip to handle of frank have already made hand well accustomed be lying on table between ever anon harry baker must take up feel weight approvingly oh mr moffat poor mr moffat go not out into fashionable world to day above go not to club of thine in pall mall oh especially go not there a be thy wont to do at three o'clock in afternoon with much care did two young general lay plan of attack let not for moment be thought that be ever in mind of of two men must attack one be thought that mr moffat might be rather coy in coming out from seclusion to meet proffered hand of once intended brother in law when must see that hand armed with heavy whip baker therefore be content to act a decoy duck remarked that might no doubt make useful in restraining public mercy probably in controlling interference of policeman will be deuced hard if ca get five six shy at said frank again clutching weapon almost spasmodically oh mr moffat five six shy with whip arm for must sooner join in second balaclava gallop than encounter at ten minute before four two hero might be seen walking up pall mall towards club young baker walked with eager disengaged air mr moffat did not know appearance have therefore no anxiety to pas along unnoticed frank have in mysterious way drawn hat very far over forehead have buttoned shooting coat up round chin harry have recommended to great coat in order that might better conceal face frank have found that great coat be encumbrance to arm put on when thus clothed have tried whip found that cut air with much le potency than in lighter garment contented therefore with looking down on pavement a walked along letting long point of whip stick up from pocket flattering that even mr moffat must not recognise at first glance poor mr moffat if have have chance now having arrived at front of club two friend for moment separate frank remains standing on pavement under shade of high stone area railing while harry jauntily skip up three step at time with very civil word of inquiry of hall porter sends in card to mr moffat mr harry baker mr moffat never having heard of such gentleman in life unwittingly come out into hall harry with sweetest smile address now plan of campaign have be settled in wise baker be to send into club for mr moffat invite that gentleman down into street be probable that invitation might be declined have be calculated in such case that two gentleman must retire for parley into stranger room be known to be immediately opposite hall door frank be to keep eye on portal if found that mr moffat did not appear a readily a might be desired also be to ascend step hurry into stranger room then whether met mr moffat there elsewhere wherever might meet be to greet with friendly vigour in power while harry disposed of club porter fortune who ever favour brave specially favoured frank gresham on occasion just a harry baker have put card into servant hand mr moffat with hat on prepared for street appeared in hall mr baker addressed with sweetest smile begged pleasure of saying word two a descended into street have not mr moffat be going thither must have be very improbable that must have done so at harry instance a be merely looked rather solemn at visitor be wont to look solemn continued descent of step frank heart leaping while saw prey retreated two step behind area railing dread weapon already well poised in hand oh mr moffat mr moffat if there be goddess to interfere in thy favour let come forward now without delay let now bear thee off on cloud if there be one to whom thou art sufficiently dear there be such goddess harry smiled blandly till be well on pavement saying nothing keeping victim face averted from avenging angel then when raised hand be sufficiently nigh withdrew two step towards nearest lamp post not for be honour of interview unless indeed succouring policeman might give occasion for gleam of glory succouring policeman be more to be come by than goddess where be ye men when savage whip fell about ear of poor ex legislator in scotland yard sitting dozing on bench talking soft nothing to housemaid round corner for ye be not walking on beat standing at coign of vantage to watch tumult of day have ye be there what must ye have done have sir richard be on spot frank gresham must still may say have have five shy at unfortunate one when harry baker quickly seceded from way mr moffat at once saw fate before hair doubtless stood on end voice refused to give loud screech with sought to invoke club ashy paleness suffused cheek tottering step be unable to bear away in flight once twice cutting whip came well down across back have be wise enough to stand still take thrashing in attitude must have be well for men so circumstanced have never such prudence after two blow made dash at step thinking to get back into club harry who have by mean reclined in idleness against lamp post here stopped have better go back into street said harry indeed have giving shove from off second step then of course frank must not do other than hit anywhere when gentleman be dancing about with much energy be hardly possible to strike fairly on back blow therefore came now on leg now on head frank unfortunately got more than five six shy before be interrupted interruption however came too soon for frank idea of justice though there be policeman to take part in london row there be always others ready enough to do so amateur policeman who generally sympathise with wrong side in nine case out of ten expend generous energy in protecting thief pickpocket when be seen with what tremendous ardour dread weapon fell about ear of poor undefended gentleman interference there be at last in spite of harry baker best endeavour loudest protestation interrupt sir said pray be family affair will of like in teeth however of assurance rude people did interfere after nine ten shy frank found encompassed by arm encumbered by weight of very stout gentleman who hung affectionately about neck shoulder whereas mr moffat be already receiving consolation from two motherly female sitting in state of syncope on good natured knee of fishmonger apprentice frank be thoroughly out of breath nothing came from lip half muttered expletive unintelligible denunciation of iniquity of foe still struggled to be at again know how dangerous be taste of blood now cruelty will become custom even with most tender hearted frank felt that have hardly fleshed virgin lash thought almost with despair that have not yet at succeeded a became man brother memory told of one two of slightest touch have gone well home to offender made desperate effort to throw off incubus round neck rush again to combat harry harry let go let go barely articulated do want to murder man sir to murder said stout gentleman over shoulder speaking solemnly into very ear care said frank struggling manfully uselessly let out say care let go harry do have got prettily tidily said harry think will perhaps do for present by time there be considerable concourse club step be crowded with member among whom there be many of mr moffat acquaintance policeman also now flocked up question arose a to what must be done with originator of affray frank harry found that be to consider under gentle arrest mr moffat in fainting state be carried into interior of club frank in innocence have intended to have celebrated little affair when be over by light repast bottle of claret with friend then to have gone back to cambridge by mail train found however that scheme in respect be frustrated have to get bail to attend at marlborough street police office must be wanted within next two three day be given to understand that must be under eye of police at rate until mr moffat must be out of danger out of danger said frank to friend with startled look why hardly got at nevertheless did have slight repast also bottle of claret on second morning after occurrence frank be again sitting in public room at tavistock harry be again sitting opposite to whip be not now so conspicuously produced between having be carefully packed up put away among frank other travelling property be so sitting rather glum when door swung open heavy quick step be heard advancing towards be squire whose arrival there have be momentarily expected frank said frank what on earth be a spoke stretched out hand right to son left to friend have given blackguard licking be said harry frank felt that hand be held with peculiarly warm grasp must not think that father face raised though eyebrow be though there be on intended expression of amazement perhaps regret nevertheless must not think that father face looked kindly at god bless soul dear boy what have done to man be not have'porth worse sir said frank still holding father hand oh be said harry shrugging shoulder must be made of very tough article then dear boy hope there be danger hope there be danger danger said frank who must not yet induce to believe that have be allowed fair chance with mr moffat oh frank frank how must be so rash in middle of pall mall too well well well woman down at greshamsbury will have that have killed almost wish have said frank oh frank frank now tell then father sat well pleased while heard chiefly from harry baker full story of son prowess then did not separate without slight repast bottle of claret mr moffat retired to country for while then went abroad having doubtless learnt that petition be not likely to give seat for city of barchester be end of wooing with miss gresham chapter xxii sir roger be unseated after little occurred at greshamsbury among greshamsbury people will be necessary for to record notice be of course taken of frank prolonged absence from college tidings perhaps exaggerated tidings of what have happened in pall mall be not slow to reach high street of cambridge that affair be gradually hushed up frank went on with study went back to study then being understood arrangement between father that must not return to greshamsbury till summer vacation on occasion squire lady arabella have strange to say be of same mind wished to keep son away from miss thorne calculated that at age with disposition be not probable that passion must last out six month absence when summer come will be excellent opportunity for to go abroad said lady arabella poor augusta will require change to renovate spirit to last proposition squire did not assent be however allowed to pas over much be fixed that frank be not to return home till midsummer will be remembered that sir roger scatcherd have be elected a sitting member for city of barchester will also be remembered that petition against return be threatened have petition depended solely on mr moffat sir roger seat doubt must have be saved by frank gresham cutting whip such be not case mr moffat have be put forward by de courcy interest that noble family with dependant be not to go to wall because mr moffat have have thrashing petition be to go on mr nearthewinde declared that petition in hand have half so good chance of success chance certainty said mr nearthewinde

to marry money thinking over in own way be not slow to convince that be out of question that must allow to love frank gresham however well heart might be inclined to feeling be duty to repress resolved therefore to do so sometimes flattered that have kept resolution be bad time for doctor bad time for mary too have declared that must live without going to greshamsbury did not find so easy have be going to greshamsbury life be a customary with to be there a at home such old custom be not broken without pain have left place must have be far different a be daily passed gate daily saw

yes must live without going to greshamsbury for time have poor life of felt nay almost heard that man woman boy girl in village be telling neighbour that mary thorne no longer went to house because of lady arabella young squire beatrice of course came to what be to say to beatrice truth nay be not always so easy to say truth even to one dearest friend will come up now have gone said beatrice indeed said mary must hardly be pleasant to lady arabella to trichy dearest visit to dear old greshamsbury be done done done perhaps in twenty year time may be walking down lawn with brother discussing childish day be always if then mr gresham will have invited how can frank have be so wrong so unkind so cruel said beatrice however be light in miss thorne did not take pleasure in discussing matter idea of frank fault unkindness cruelty be doubtless different from of sister such cruelty be not unnaturally excused in eye by many circumstance beatrice did not fully understand mary be quite ready to go hand in hand with lady arabella rest of greshamsbury fold in putting end if possible to frank passion must give one right to accuse of assisting to ruin young heir must hardly bring to admit that be so very wrong yet even so very cruel then squire came to see be yet harder trial than visit of beatrice be so difficult for to speak to that must not wish away yet have not come have altogether neglected must have felt to be unkind have ever be pet have always received kindness from be sorry for mary very sorry said standing up holding hand in ca be helped sir said smiling know said know ought to be helped somehow be quite sure have not be to blame said very quietly a though position be one quite matter of course think have be very much to blame there will be misfortune sometimes when nobody be to blame quite understand said squire if frank oh will not talk about said still laughing gently can understand mary how dear must be to if mr gresham must not for world be cause of unpleasantness between can not bear to think that have banished mary can not be helped thing will come right in time will be so lonely here oh will get over here know mr gresham ' be monarch of survey there be great deal in squire did not quite catch meaning glimmering of did reach be competent to lady arabella to banish from greshamsbury be within sphere of squire duty to prohibit son from imprudent match be for gresham to guard greshamsbury treasure a best must within own territory let beware that did not attack on hers in obedience to first expression of wish have submitted to public mark of disapproval because have seen at once with clear intellect that be only doing that conscience must approve without murmur therefore consented to be pointed at a young lady who have be turned out of greshamsbury because of young squire have help for let take care that did not go beyond outside greshamsbury gate frank gresham lady arabella met on equal term let fight own battle squire kissed forehead affectionately took leave feeling somehow that have be excused pitied made much of whereas have called on young neighbour with intention of excusing pitying making much of be not quite comfortable a left house nevertheless be sufficiently honest hearted to own to that mary thorne be fine girl only that be so absolutely necessary that frank must marry money only also that poor mary be such birthless foundling in world esteem only for thing what wife must have made for son of to one person only did talk freely on subject that one be patience oriel even with freedom be rather of mind than of heart never said word of feeling with reference to frank said much of position in village of necessity be under to keep out of way be very hard said patience that offence must be with punishment with oh a for said mary laughing will not confess to offence yet to punishment certainly not to punishment come to same thing in end not so patience there be always little sting of disgrace in punishment now be not going to hold in least disgraced mary must meet gresham sometimes meet have not slightest objection on earth to meet of be not whit dangerous to dear 't be that be wild beast 't be must avoid then added after pause slightly blushing have not slightest objection even to meet if chance brings in way let look to undertaking go further than will not be seen within gate girl so far understood other that patience undertook rather than promised to give mary what assistance must despite mary bravado be in such position that much wanted assistance of such friend a miss oriel after absence of six week frank a have seen returned home nothing be said to except by beatrice a to new greshamsbury arrangement when found mary be not at place went boldly to doctor house to seek have be seen also that discreetly kept out of way have thought fit to do when time came although have be so ready with boast that have objection on earth to meet after that there have be christmas vacation mary have again found discretion to be better part of valour be doubtless disagreeable enough have particular wish to spend christmas with miss oriel aunt instead of at uncle fireside indeed christmas festivity have hitherto be kept at greshamsbury doctor having made part of family circle there assembled be out of question now perhaps absolute change to old miss oriel house be better for than lesser change to uncle drawing room besides how must have demeaned when met frank in parish church have be fully understood by patience therefore have christmas visit be planned then affair of frank mary thorne ceased for while to be talked of at greshamsbury for other affair of mr moffat augusta monopolised rural attention augusta a have said bore well sustained public gaze without much flinching period of martyrdom however did not last long for soon news arrived of frank exploit in pall mall then greshamsburyites forgot to think much more of augusta being fully occupied in thinking of what frank have done tale a be first told declared that frank have followed mr moffat up into club have dragged thence into middle of pall mall have then slaughtered on spot be by degree modified till sobered fiction became generally prevalent that mr moffat be lying somewhere still alive with bone in general state of compound fracture adventure again brought frank into ascendant restored to mary former position a greshamsbury heroine one can not wonder at being very angry said beatrice discussing matter with mary very imprudently wonder wonder must have be if have not be angry one might have be quite sure that must have be angry enough suppose be not absolutely right for to beat mr moffat said beatrice apologetically not right trichy think be very right not to beat so very much mary oh suppose man ca exactly stand measuring how much doe thing like brother for what have done say so frankly though suppose ought to eat tongue out before must say thing eh trichy know that there be harm in said beatrice demurely if liked other there must be harm in if be must there said mary in low tone of bantering satire be so kind trichy coming from from one of family know be well aware mary that if must have wish yes be well aware what paragon of goodness be if must have way must be admitted into heaven again must only with proviso that if stray angel must ever whisper to with bated breath mistaking perchance for one of own class must be bound to close ear to whispering remind humbly be only poor mortal must trust so far must trichy must trust in way mary think be unkind in saying such thing to into heaven be admitted will go only on understanding be to be a good angel a of around mary dear why do say to because because because ah why indeed because have one else to say to certainly not because have deserved seems a though be finding fault with so be how can do other than find fault how can help being sore trichy hardly realise position hardly see how be treated how be forced to allow to be treated without sign of complaint see if did must not wonder must be sore beatrice did not quite see saw enough of to know mary be to be pitied so instead of scolding friend for being cross threw arm round kissed affectionately doctor time suffered much more than niece did must not complain out loudly must not aver that pet lamb have be ill treated must not even have pleasure of openly quarrelling with lady arabella not le did feel to be most cruel that mary must have to live before world a outcast because have pleased frank gresham to fall in love with bitterness be not chiefly against frank that frank have be very foolish must not acknowledge be kind of folly for doctor be able to find excuse for lady arabella cold propriety must find excuse with squire have spoken no word on subject up to period of be now writing with ladyship have never spoken on since day when have told that mary be to come more to greshamsbury never now dined spent evening at greshamsbury seldom be to be seen at house except when called in professionally squire indeed frequently met either did so in village out on horseback at own house when doctor first heard that sir roger have lost seat have returned to boxall hill resolved to go over see visit be postponed from day to day a visit be postponed may be made day did not in fact go till be summoned there somewhat peremptorily message be brought to one evening to say that sir roger have be struck by paralysis that not moment be to be lost always happens at night said mary who have more sympathy for living uncle whom did know than for other dying uncle whom did not know what matter there just give scarf in probability may not be home to night perhaps not till late to morrow god bless mary away doctor went on cold bleak ride to boxall hill who will be heir a doctor rode along must not quite rid mind of question poor man now about to die have wealth enough to make many heir what if heart must have softened towards sister child what if mary must be found in few day to be possessed of such wealth that gresham must be again happy to welcome at greshamsbury doctor be not lover of money did best to get rid of such pernicious thought longing perhaps be not so much that mary must be rich a must have power of heaping coal of fire upon head of people who have so injured chapter xxiv louis scatcherd when dr thorne reached boxall hill found mr rerechild from barchester there before poor lady scatcherd when husband be stricken by fit hardly knew in dismay what adequate step to take have a matter of course sent for dr thorne have thought that in so grave peril medical skill of one man must suffice be knew quite out of question for to invoke aid of dr fillgrave whom earthly persuasion must have brought to boxall hill a mr rerechild be supposed in barchester world to be second though at long interval to great man have applied for assistance now mr rerechild be follower humble friend of dr fillgrave be wont to regard anything came from barchester doctor a sure light from lamp of aesculapius must not therefore be other than enemy of dr thorne be prudent discreet man with long family averse to professional hostility a knowing that must make more by medical friend than medical foe not at inclined to take up man cudgel to own detriment have of course heard of dreadful affront have be put upon friend a have medical world medical world at least of barsetshire have often expressed sympathy with dr fillgrave abhorrence of dr thorne anti professional practice now that found about to be brought in contact with dr thorne reflected that galen of greshamsbury be at rate equal in reputation to of barchester that one be probably on rise whereas other be already considered by a rather antiquated therefore wisely resolved that present must be excellent opportunity for to make friend of dr thorne poor lady scatcherd have inkling dr fillgrave mr rerechild be accustomed to row in same boat be not altogether free from fear that there might be outbreak therefore took opportunity before dr thorne arrival to deprecate wrathful tendency oh lady scatcherd have greatest respect for dr thorne said greatest possible respect most skilful practitioner something brusque certainly perhaps little obstinate what then have fault lady scatcherd oh yes have mr rerechild be certain there friend fillgrave lady scatcherd can not bear anything of sort now think be wrong so tell mr rerechild be in error here for have never yet ventured to tell dr fillgrave that be wrong in anything must bear forbear know dr thorne be excellent man in way very excellent lady scatcherd little conversation took place after mr rerechild first visit to patient what step be immediately taken for relief of sufferer need not describe be doubtless well intended be perhaps a well adapted to stave off coming evil day a dr fillgrave even great sir omicron pie might have used then dr thorne arrived oh doctor doctor exclaimed lady scatcherd almost hanging round neck in hall what be to do what be to do be very bad have spoken nothing like word have made one two muttered sound poor soul must make nothing of oh doctor doctor have never be like before be easy to see where lady scatcherd placed such faith a might still have in healing art mr rerechild be here have seen continued thought best to send for two for fear of accident have done something know what doctor do tell truth now look to to tell truth dr thorne then went up saw patient have literally complied with lady scatcherd request might have told at once that there be hope a however have not heart to do mystified case a doctor so well know how to do told that there be cause to fear great cause for fear be sorry to say very great cause for much fear dr thorne promised to stay night there if possible following night also then lady scatcherd became troubled in mind a to what must do with mr rerechild also declared with much medical humanity let inconvenience be what might too must stay night loss said of such man a sir roger scatcherd be of such paramount importance a to make other matter trivial must certainly not allow whole weight to fall on shoulder of friend dr thorne also must stay at rate night by sick man bedside by following morning change might be expected say dr thorne said ladyship calling doctor into housekeeping room in hannah spent time that be not required upstairs just come in doctor must tell want more must tell whom said doctor why mr rerechild might go away do think dr thorne explained that mr rerechild certainly might go away if pleased that must by mean be proper for one doctor to tell to leave house so mr rerechild be allowed to share glory of night in meantime patient remained speechless soon became evident that nature be using effort to make one final rally from time to time moaned muttered a though be conscious seemed a though strove to speak gradually became awake at rate to suffering dr thorne began to think that last scene must be postponed for yet while longer wonderful strong constitution eh dr thorne wonderful said mr rerechild yes have be strong man strong a horse dr thorne lord what that man must have be if have given chance know constitution of course yes pretty well have attended for many year always drinking suppose always at eh have not be temperate man certainly brain see clean gone not particle of coating left to stomach yet what struggle make interesting case be be very sad to see such intellect so destroyed very sad very sad indeed how fillgrave must have liked to have seen case be clever man be fillgrave in way know be sure be said dr thorne not that 'd make anything of case like now be not know quite quite perhaps not quite up to new time of day if one may say so have have very extensive provincial practice said dr thorne oh very very made tidy lot of money too have fillgrave be worth six thousand pound suppose now be good deal of money to put by in little town like barchester yes indeed what say to fillgrave be keep eye open one must never be too old to learn there be always something new worth picking up wo believe that ca believe that new idea can be worth anything know man must go to wall in way eh doctor then again be called to patient be doing finely finely said mr rerechild to lady scatcherd there be fair ground to hope will rally fair ground be there not doctor yes will rally how long may last that can hardly say oh certainly not certainly not be not with certainty still be doing finely lady scatcherd considering everything how long will give doctor said mr rerechild to new friend when be again alone ten day dare say ten day from to fortnight not more think will struggle on ten day perhaps so said doctor must not like to say exactly to day certainly not can not say exactly to day say ten day a for anything like recovery that know be out of question said dr thorne gravely quite so quite so coating of stomach clean gone know brain destroyed did observe periporollida never saw so swelled before now when periporollida be swollen like yes very much be always case when paralysis have be brought about by intemperance always always have remarked that always periporollida in such case be always extended most interesting case be do wish fillgrave must have seen believe fillgrave quite eh not quite said dr thorne who a thought of last interview with dr fillgrave of gentleman exceeding anger a stood in hall below must not keep from smiling sad a occasion be nothing must induce lady scatcherd to go to bed two doctor agreed to lie down in room on one side of patient how be possible that anything good must come to being so guarded be going on finely lady scatcherd quite finely be last word mr rerechild said a left room then dr thorne taking lady scatcherd hand leading out into chamber told truth lady scatcherd said in tenderest voice voice must be very tender when occasion required lady scatcherd hope must not hope must be cruel to bid do so oh doctor oh doctor dear friend there be hope oh dr thorne said wife looking wildly up into companion face though hardly yet realised meaning of what said although sens be half stunned by blow dear lady scatcherd be not better must tell truth oh suppose so oh yes oh yes ah ah ah then began rocking backwards forward on chair with apron up to eye what will do what will do look to lady scatcherd who only can make such grief endurable yes yes yes suppose so ah ah dr thorne there must be chance be there chance that man say be going on so well fear there be chance a far a knowledge go there be chance then why doe that chattering magpie tell such lie to woman ah ah ah oh doctor doctor what will do what will do poor lady scatcherd fairly overcome by sorrow burst out cry like great school girl yet what have husband done for that must thus weep for must not her life be much more blessed when cause of trouble must be removed from must not then be free woman instead of slave might not then expect to begin to taste comfort of life what have harsh tyrant of hers done be good serviceable for why must thus weep for in paroxysm of truest grief hear good deal of jolly widow slanderous raillery of world tell much of conjugal disturbance a cure for woman will look forward to state of widowhood with not unwilling eye raillery of world be very slanderous in daily jest attribute to other vice of neighbour friend even enemy be ever guilty be favourite parlance to talk of family trouble of mr green on right to tell how mr young on left be strongly suspected of having raised hand to lord master what right have to make charge what have seen in own personal walk through life to make believe that woman be devil there may possibly have be xantippe here there imogenes be to be found under bush lady scatcherd in spite of life have led be one of must send message up to london for louis said doctor did that doctor did to day sent up telegraph oh oh poor boy what will do will never know what to do with never never with such sorrowful wailing sat rocking through long night now then comforting by performance of menial service in sick man room sir roger passed night much a have passed day except that appeared gradually to be growing nearer to state of consciousness on following morning succeeded at last in making mr rerechild understand that be not desirous of keeping longer from barchester practice at about twelve o'clock dr thorne also went promising that must return in evening again pas night at boxall hill in course of afternoon sir roger once more awoke to sens when did so son be standing at bedside louis philippe scatcherd a may be more convenient to call louis be young man just of age of frank gresham there must hardly be two youth more different in appearance louis though father mother be robust person be short slight now of sickly frame frank be picture of health strength though manly in disposition be by mean precocious either in appearance manner louis scatcherd looked a though be four year other senior have be sent to eton when be fifteen father being under impression that be most ready best recognised method of making gentleman here did not altogether fail a regarded coveted object of becoming companion of gentleman have more pocket money than other lad in school be possessed also of certain effrontery carried ahead among boy of own age gained therefore degree of eclat even among who knew very frequently said to other that young scatcherd be not fit to be companion except on such open occasion a of cricket match boat race boy in respect be at least a exclusive a men understand a well difference between inner outer circle scatcherd have many companion at school who be glad enough to go up to maidenhead with in boat there be not one among who must have talked to of sister sir roger be vastly proud of son success did best to stimulate by lavish expenditure at christopher whenever must manage to run down to eton practice though sufficiently unexceptionable to boy be not held in equal delight by master to tell truth sir roger son be favourite with stern custodian at last be felt necessary to get rid of louis be not long in giving opportunity by getting tipsy twice in one week on second occasion be sent away sir roger though long talked of be seen no more at eton university be still open to louis philippe before be eighteen be entered a gentleman commoner at trinity a be moreover eldest son of baronet have almost unlimited command of money here also be enabled for while to shine to shine very fitfully one may say almost with ghastly glare very lad who have eaten father dinner at eton shared four oar at eton knew much better than to associate with at cambridge now that have put on toga virilis be still a prone a ever to fun frolic devilry perhaps more so than ever seeing that more be in power acquired idea that behoved to be somewhat circumspect a to men with whom prank be perpetrated so in day louis scatcherd be coldly looked on by whilom eton friend young scatcherd did not fail to find companion at cambridge also there be few place indeed in rich man can not buy companionship set with whom lived at cambridge be worst of place be fast slang men who be fast slang nothing else men who imitated groom in more than dress who looked on customary hero of race course a highest lord of ascendant upon earth among at college young scatcherd did shine a long a such lustre be permitted here indeed father who have striven only to encourage at eton did strive somewhat to control be not now easy if limited son allowance only drove to do debauchery on credit there be plenty to lend money to son of great millionaire so after eighteen month trial of university education sir roger have alternative to withdraw son from alma mater what be then to do with unluckily be considered quite unnecessary to take step towards enabling to earn bread now nothing on earth can be more difficult than bringing up well young man who have not to earn own bread who have recognised station among other men similarly circumstanced juvenile duke sprouting earl find duty place a easily a embryo clergyman sucking barrister provision be made for peculiar position though may possibly go astray have fair chance given to of running within post same may be said of such youth a frank gresham there be enough of in community to have made necessary that well being must be matter of care forethought there be few men turned out in world in position of louis scatcherd of few very few enter real battle of life under good auspex poor sir roger though have hardly time with multitudinous railway to look into thoroughly have glimmering of when saw son pale face paid wine bill heard of doings in horse flesh did know that thing be not going well did understand that heir to baronetcy fortune of ten thousand year might be doing better what be to do must not watch over boy so took tutor for sent abroad louis tutor got a far a berlin with what mutual satisfaction to other need not be specially described from berlin sir roger received letter in tutor declined to go further in task have undertaken found that have influence over pupil must not reconcile to conscience to be spectator of life a mr scatcherd led have power in inducing mr scatcherd to leave berlin must remain there till must hear from sir roger so sir roger have to leave huge government work be then erecting on southern coast hurry off to berlin to see what must be done with young hopeful young hopeful be by mean fool in matter be more than match for father sir roger in anger threatened to cast off without shilling louis with mixed penitence effrontery reminded that must not change descent of title promised amendment declared that have done only a do other young men of fortune hinted that tutor be strait laced as father son returned together to boxall hill three month afterwards mr scatcherd set up for in london now life if not more virtuous be more crafty than have be have tutor to watch doings complain of have sufficient sense to keep from absolute pecuniary ruin lived be true where sharper blackleg have too often opportunity of plucking young a be have be sufficiently long about world to take care be not openly robbed a be not openly robbed father in certain sense be proud of tidings however came came at least in last day cut sir roger to quick tidings of vice in son father must not attribute to own example twice mother be called up to sick bed of only child while lay raving in horrid madness by outraged mind avenges on body twice be found raging in delirium tremens twice father be told that continuance of such life must end in early death may easily be conceived that sir roger be not happy man lying there with brandy bottle beneath pillow reflecting in moment of rest that son of have brandy bottle beneath pillow must hardly have be happy be not man to say much about misery though must restrain heir must endure in silence in silence did endure till opening eye to consciousness of death at last spoke few word to only friend knew louis scatcherd be not fool be naturally perhaps of depraved disposition have to reap fruit of worst education england be able to give there be moment in life when felt that better higher nay much happier career be open to than have prepared to lead now then must reflect what money rank might have done for must look with wishful eye to proud doings of others of age must dream of quiet joy of sweet wife of house to might be asked friend who be jockey drunkard must dream of such thing in short interval of constrained sobriety dream must only serve to make moody be best side of character worst probably be that be brought into play by fact that be not fool must have better chance of redemption in world perhaps also in have be fool a be be fool be not to be done not knew one better value of shilling knew also how to keep shilling how to spend consorted much with blackleg such like because blackleg be to taste boasted daily nay hourly to frequently to around that leech who be stuck round must draw little blood from must spend money freely must so spend that might reap gratification of expenditure be acute crafty knowing up to damnable dodge practised by men of class with whom lived at one twenty be that most odious of odious character close fisted reprobate be small man not ill made by nature reduced to unnatural tenuity by dissipation corporeal attribute of be apt to boast a enabled a said to put up at st lb without d nonsense of not eating drinking power however be one of did not often avail a nerve be seldom in fit state for riding hair be dark red wore red moustache great deal of red beard beneath chin cut in manner to make look like american voice also have yankee twang being cross between of american trader english groom eye be keen fixed cold knowing such be son whom sir roger saw standing at bedside when first awoke to consciousness must not be supposed that sir roger looked at with eye to be only child heir of wealth future bearer of title most heart stirring remembrancer of other day when have be so much poorer so much happier man let that boy be bad good be sir roger have father be still able to hope when others thought that ground for hope be gone mother also loved son with mother natural love louis have ever be ashamed of mother have a far a possible estranged from heart perhaps fixed with almost warmer love on frank gresham foster son frank saw seldom when did see never refused embrace there be too joyous genial lustre about frank face always endeared to woman made former nurse regard a pet creation of age though seldom interfered with monetary arrangement of husband yet once twice have ventured to hint that legacy left to young squire must make happy woman sir roger however on occasion have not appeared very desirous of making wife happy ah louis be that ejaculated sir roger in tone hardly more than half formed afterwards in day two be fully recovered voice just then must hardly open jaw spoke almost through teeth managed however to put out hand lay on counterpane so that son must take why be well governor said son will be a right a trivet in day two eh governor governor smiled with ghastly smile already pretty well knew that must never again be right a son called on side of grave did not moreover suit to say much just at moment so contented with holding son hand lay still in position for moment then turning round painfully on side endeavoured to put hand to place where dire enemy usually be concealed sir roger however be too weak now to be own master be at length though too late captive in hand of nurse doctor bottle have now be removed then lady scatcherd came in seeing that husband be no longer unconscious must not believe that dr thorne have be wrong must not think that there must be ground for hope threw on knee at bedside bursting into tear a did so taking sir roger hand in hers covered with kiss bother said sir roger did not however long occupy with indulgence of feeling going speedily to work produced such sustenance a doctor have ordered to be given when patient might awake breakfast cup be brought to few drop be put into mouth soon made manifest that must take nothing more of description so perfectly innocent drop of brandy just little drop said half ordering half entreating ah roger said lady scatcherd just little drop louis said sick man appealing to son little will be good for bring bottle mother said son after altercation brandy bottle be brought louis with what thought very sparing hand proceeded to pour about wine glassful into cup a did so sir roger weak a be contrived to shake son arm so a greatly to increase dose have have have laughed sick man then greedily swallowed dose chapter xxv sir roger dy night doctor stayed at boxall hill next night so that became customary thing for to sleep there during latter part of sir roger illness returned home daily to greshamsbury for have patient there to whom be a necessary a to sir roger foremost of whom be lady arabella have therefore no slight work on hand seeing that night be by mean wholly devoted to rest mr rerechild have not be much wrong a to remaining space of life have allotted to dying man once twice dr thorne have thought that great original strength of patient must have enabled to fight against death for somewhat longer period sir roger must give chance whenever be strong enough to have will of own insisted on having very medicine mixed with brandy in hour of doctor absence be too often successful in attempt doe not much matter dr thorne have said to lady scatcherd do what can to keep down quantity irritate by refusing to obey doe not much signify now so lady scatcherd still administered alcohol from day to day invented little scheme for increasing amount over chuckled with ghastly laughter two three time during day sir roger essayed to speak seriously to son louis always frustrated either got out of room on excuse made mother interfere on score so much talking must be bad for father already knew with tolerable accuracy what be purport of father will by mean approved of a must not now hope to induce father to alter so a to make more favourable to conceived that conversation on matter of business must be of use to louis said sir roger one afternoon to son louis have not done by a ought to have done know now nonsense governor never mind about now will do well enough dare say besides be too late can make twenty three year instead of twenty five if like mean a to money louis there be thing besides money father ought to look to now father fret be right may be sure of louis be that accursed brandy be that be afraid of see here boy how be lying here now be annoying governor be right quite right a for why will be up about in month so will never be off bed boy till be carried into coffin on chair there be not thinking of louis think what may have before if ca avoid accursed bottle be right governor right a trivet be very little take except at odd time so oh louis louis come father cheer up sort of thing be thing for at wonder where mother be ought to be here with broth just let go will see for father understood saw that be now much beyond faded power to touch heart conscience of such youth a son have become what now must do for boy except die what else what other benefit did son require of to die to die so that mean of dissipation might be unbounded let go unresisting hand held a young man crept out of room turned face to wall turned face to wall held bitter commune with own heart to what have brought to what have

despite a be fed with hope that mary future might be made more secure aye brighter too by small unheeded fraction broken off from huge mass of uncle wealth such hope if have amounted to hope be now gone be not be worst of that have done right in utterly repudiating idea of marriage between mary cousin of that be certain enough that earthly consideration must have induced mary to plight troth to man with be a certain a doom how far have done right in keeping from sight of uncle how must justify to if have thus robbed her of inheritance seeing that have done so from selfish fear lest who be now own must be known to world a belonging to others rather than to have taken upon on behalf to reject wealth a valueless yet have sooner done so than began to consume hour with reflecting how great to must be value of wealth thus when sir roger told a left room that have ruined mary fortune be hardly able to bear taunt with equanimity on next morning after paying professional visit to patient satisfying that end be now drawing near with step terribly quickened went down to greshamsbury how long be to last uncle said niece with sad voice a again prepared to return to boxall hill not long mary begrudge few more hour of life uncle will say nothing more about be son with then perversely enough persisted in asking numerous question about louis scatcherd be likely to marry uncle hope so

great part of day a knew also that great man of business be accustomed to do most important work by hand of such tool a did not doubt that will have be altered remodelled indeed thought more than probable that when be opened must be found to be wholly different in provision from sir roger have already described louis be clever enough said sharp enough mean wo squander property have good natural ability said doctor excellent excellent said father may do well very well if can only be kept from sir roger held up empty wine glass stood by bedside what life may have before to throw away for a spoke took glass tossed across room oh doctor must that be to begin again wish that dare say scatcherd wish ai worth shilling yet regret nothing be worth million in one way other regret everything everything everything must not think in way scatcherd need not think so yesterday told clarke that be comfortable in mind mr clarke be clergyman who have visited of course did what else must say when asked must have be civil to have told that time word be thrown away thorne believe when man heart be sad sad sad to core few word from parson at last moment will never make right may have mercy on friend if will think of look to will have mercy on well will try doctor must that be to do again will see to old woman for sake wo what lady scatcherd lady devil if anything anger now be

will thorne dr thorne again assured that a long a lived lady scatcherd must never want one true friend in making promise however managed to drop allusion to obnoxious title will be with a much a possible wo again asked baronet after lying quite silent for quarter of hour with whom said doctor who be then asleep with poor boy with louis if will let will said doctor doctor when see glass at mouth dash down thrust down though thrust out teeth with when see that thorne tell of father tell what father might have be for tell how father died like beast because must not keep from drink reader be last word spoken by sir roger scatcherd a uttered rose up in bed with same vehemence have shown on former evening in very act of doing so be again struck by paralysis before nine on following morning be over oh man own own man exclaimed widow remembering in paroxysm of grief nothing love of early day best brightest cleverest of week after sir roger be buried with much pomp ceremony within precinct of barchester cathedral monument be put up to soon after in be portrayed a smoothing block of granite with mallet chisel while eagle eye disdaining such humble work be fixed upon intricate mathematical instrument above must sir roger have seen must probably have declared that workman be ever worth salt who looked one way while rowed immediately after funeral will be opened dr thorne discovered that clause of be exactly identical with friend have described to month back nothing have be altered have document be unfolded since strange codicil be added in be declared that dr thorne knew only dr thorne who be eldest child of testator only sister at same time however joint executor with dr thorne have be named one mr stock man of railway fame dr thorne be made legatee to humble extent of thousand pound life income of thousand pound year be left to lady scatcherd chapter xxvi war need not follow sir roger to grave partake of baked meat be furnished for funeral banquet such men a sir roger scatcherd be always well buried have already seen that glory be duly told to posterity in graphic diction of sepulchral monument in few day doctor have returned to quiet home sir louis found reigning at boxall hill in father stead with however much diminished sway a thought poor exchequer must soon return to say something of career a baronet for present may go back to more pleasant friend at greshamsbury friend at greshamsbury have not be making pleasant not so pleasant to other a circumstance must have admitted in day doctor have felt bound to pas if not altogether at boxall hill yet altogether away from own home so a to admit of being a much a possible with patient mary have be thrown more than ever with patience oriel also almost more than ever with beatrice gresham a regarded mary must doubtless have preferred companionship of patience though loved beatrice far best have choice when went to parsonage beatrice came there also when patience came to doctor house beatrice accompanied followed mary must hardly have rejected society even have felt wise to do so must in such case have be alone severance from greshamsbury house household from big family in have for so many year be almost at home must have made such solitude almost unendurable then two girl knew not secret have secret little history of ill treatment knew that though have be blameless in matter yet have be one to bear punishment a girl bosom friend must not sympathise with endow with heroic attribute make in fact a be doing little heroine for nonce be perhaps not serviceable for mary be far from being disagreeable tendency to finding matter for hero worship in mary endurance be much stronger with beatrice than with miss oriel miss oriel be elder naturally le afflicted with sentimentation of romance have thrown into mary arm because have seen that be essentially necessary for mary comfort that must do so be anxious to make friend smile to smile with beatrice be quite a true in sympathy rather wished that mary might weep in unison shed mutual tear break heart together patience have spoken of frank love a misfortune of conduct a erroneous to be excused only by youth have never appeared to surmise mary also might be in love a well a to beatrice affair be tragic difficulty admitting of solution gordian knot not to be cut misery now for ever must always talk about frank when mary be alone to speak truth mary did not stop her a perhaps must have done a for marriage between be impossible beatrice be well sure of that be frank unfortunate destiny that must marry money money a beatrice sometimes thoughtlessly added cutting mary to quick money family also under such circumstance marriage between be quite impossible not le did beatrice declare that must have loved mary a sister in law have be possible how worthy frank be of girl love have such love be permissible be so cruel beatrice must say so very very cruel must have suited in way nonsense trichy must have suited in possible way at oh must exactly papa love so well mamma must have be so nice yes mamma too be have have fortune said daughter naively always liked personally always did always love so especially lady alexandrina must not have signified for frank can not endure de courcys dear doe not matter one straw whom brother can endure not endure just at present character be to be formed taste heart also oh mary heart yes heart not fact of having heart think have heart doe not yet understand oh mary know such conversation be not without danger to poor mary comfort came soon to be case that looked rather for sort of sympathy from beatrice than for miss oriel pleasant le piquant gaiety so day of doctor absence be passed so also first week after return during week be almost daily necessary that squire must be with doctor be now legal holder of sir roger property a such holder also of mortgage on mr gresham property be natural that must be much together doctor must not however go up to greshamsbury on other than medical business therefore became necessary that squire must be good deal at doctor house then lady arabella became unhappy in mind frank be true be away at cambridge have be successfully kept out of mary way since suspicion of danger have fallen upon lady arabella mind frank be away mary be systematically banished with due acknowledgement from power in greshamsbury be not enough for lady arabella a long a daughter still habitually consorted with female culprit a long a husband consorted with male culprit seemed to lady arabella at moment a though in banishing mary from house have in effect banished from most intimate of greshamsbury social circle magnified in own mind importance of conference between girl be not without fear that doctor might be talking squire over into very dangerous compliance resolved therefore on duel with doctor in first have be pre eminently unexpectedly successful young sucking dove must have be more mild than terrible enemy whom have for year regarded a being too puissant for attack in ten minute have vanquished succeeded in banishing niece from house without losing value of service a be always case with have begun to despise enemy have conquered to think that foe once beaten must never rally object be to break off confidential intercourse between beatrice mary to interrupt a far a must do between doctor squire may be said must be more easily done by skilful management within own household have however tried that failed have said much to beatrice a to imprudence of friendship with mary have done purposely before squire injudiciously however for squire have immediately taken mary part have declared that have wish to see quarrel between family that of doctor mary thorne be in way good girl eligible friend for own child have ended by declaring that must not have mary persecuted for frank fault have not be end nearly end of what have be said on matter at greshamsbury end when came came in wise lady arabella determined to say few word to doctor a to expediency of forbidding familiar intercourse between mary of greshamsbury people with view lady arabella absolutely bearded lion in den doctor in shop have heard that mary beatrice be to pas certain afternoon at parsonage took opportunity of calling at doctor house period of many year have passed since have last so honoured that abode mary indeed have be so much one of own family that ceremony of calling on have never be thought necessary thus unless mary have be absolutely ill there must have be nothing to bring ladyship to house knew must add to importance of occasion judged prudent to make occasion a important a might well be be so far successful that soon found tete tete with doctor in own study be whit dismayed by pair of human thigh bone lay close to hand when be talking in den of own be in constant habit of handling with much energy be frightened out of propriety even by little child skull grinned at from off chimney piece doctor said a soon a first complimentary greeting be over speaking in kindest most must be confidential tone doctor be still uneasy about boy of mine have thought best to come see at once tell freely what think doctor bowed said that be very sorry that must have cause for uneasiness about young friend frank indeed be very uneasy doctor having a do have such reliance on prudence such perfect confidence in friendship have thought best to come speak to openly thereupon lady arabella paused doctor bowed again nobody know so well a do dreadful state of squire affair not so very dreadful not so very dreadful said doctor mildly be a far a know yes be doctor very dreadful very dreadful indeed know how much owes to young man for squire never tell anything to know that be very large sum of money enough to swamp estate ruin frank now call that very dreadful not ruin lady arabella not ruin hope however did not come to talk to about that a said before know nothing of squire affair a matter of course ask to tell be sure will agree with in a mother can not be interested about only son lady arabella put cambric handkerchief to eye of course be of course be said doctor lady arabella opinion of frank be such that feel sure that will do well in energy dr thorne brandished one of thigh bone almost in lady face hope will be sure hope will doctor have such danger to contend with be so warm impulsive that fear heart will bring into trouble now know unless frank marries money be lost doctor made answer to last appeal a sat listened slight frown came across brow must marry money doctor now have see with assistance contrived to separate from dear mary with assistance lady arabella have given assistance have meddled in matter will well doctor perhaps not meddled agreed with know that two young people have be imprudent agreed to such thing lady arabella never never not only never agreed that mary have be imprudent will not agree to now will not allow one to assert in presence without contradicting then doctor worked away at thigh bone in manner did rather alarm ladyship at rate thought that young people have better be kept apart neither did think that niece felt sure be safe from danger knew that must hing must bring to shame not to shame said lady apologetically a be using word perhaps not exactly in doctor sense felt alarm for continued doctor desired change frank be son be for to look to thought proper to do so by desiring mary to absent from greshamsbury oh said lady arabella did lady arabella a greshamsbury be home neither niece have ground of complaint acquiesced not without much suffering did acquiesce think can have ground of complaint against lady arabella have hardly expected that doctor must reply to mild conciliatory exordium with so much sternness have yielded so easily to on former occasion did not comprehend that when uttered sentence of exile against mary have given order have power of enforcing obedience to order have now placed mary altogether beyond jurisdiction be therefore little surprised for few moment overawed by doctor manner soon recovered remembering doubtless that fortune favour none brave make complaint dr thorne said after assuming tone more befitting de courcy than hitherto used make complaint either a regard mary be very kind lady arabella think that be duty to put stop peremptory stop to anything like love affair between son niece have not least objection in life if there be such love affair put stop to be if have power here doctor be doubtless imprudent have begun to think that have yielded sufficiently to lady have begun to resolve also that though must not become to encourage even idea of such marriage must make lady arabella understand that thought niece quite good enough for son that match if regarded a imprudent be to be regarded a equally imprudent on side must not suffer that mary heart feeling interest must be altogether postponed to of young heir perhaps be unconsciously encouraged in determination by reflection that mary might perhaps become young heiress be duty said lady arabella repeating word with even stronger de courcy intonation duty also dr thorne duty said rising from chair leaning on table with two thigh bone lady arabella pray understand at once repudiate such duty will have nothing to do with mean to say that will encourage unfortunate boy to marry niece unfortunate boy lady arabella whom by by regard a very fortunate young man be son not mine will take step about marriage one way other think right then that niece must throw in way throw in way what must say if came up to greshamsbury spoke to of daughter in such language what must dear friend mr gresham say if neighbour wife must come so speak to will tell what must say must quietly beg to go back to own home meddle only with own matter be dreadful to lady arabella even dr thorne have never before dared thus to lower to level of common humanity liken to other wife in country side moreover be not quite sure whether parish doctor be not desiring earl daughter to go home mind own business on first point however there seemed to be room for doubt of gave benefit must not become to argue with dr thorne said not at least on subject said can only repeat that mean nothing offensive to dear mary for whom think may say have always shown almost mother care be be mary ungrateful for kindness have received at greshamsbury must do duty own child must be first consideration of course must lady arabella be of course therefore have called on to say that think be imprudent that beatrice mary must be so much together doctor have be standing during latter part of conversation now began to walk about still holding two bone like pair of dumb bell god bless soul said god bless soul why lady arabella do suspect own daughter a well a own son do think that beatrice be assisting mary in preparing wicked clandestine marriage tell fairly lady arabella present tone of mind be such that can not understand suspect nobody dr thorne young people will be young old people must be old suppose more pity lady arabella mary be same to a own daughter owes obedience of child a disapprove of daughter beatrice a acquaintance for rather on other hand regard with pleasure friendship can not expect must take step to put end to suppose must lead to renewed intercourse between frank mary have objection frank be very nice young fellow gentleman like in manner neighbourly in disposition dr thorne lady arabella can not believe that really intend to express wish be quite right have not intended to express wish do intend to do so mary be at liberty within certain bound be sure will not pas to choose own friend think have not chosen badly a regard miss beatrice gresham must even add frank gresham to number friend why be more than friend be declared lover doubt that lady arabella because have not heard of from mary even if be so see why must object not object a said before frank be to thinking excellent young man why must object dr thorne said ladyship now also rising from chair in state of too evident perturbation why must object be for lady arabella to look after lamb for to see that if possible harm will come to mine if think that mary be improper acquaintance for child be for to guide for father say what think fit to own daughter pray understand once for will allow one to interfere with niece interfere said lady arabella now absolutely confused by severity of doctor manner will allow one to interfere with one lady arabella have suffered very greatly from imputation have most unjustly thrown on be however undoubted right to turn out of house if thought fit though a woman who have known for so many year might think have treated with more forbearance that however be right exercised there privilege stop yes must stop lady arabella will not persecute here on only spot of ground can call own persecute dr thorne mean to say have persecuted ah do mean to say so do persecute must continue to do so did not defend be not sufficient that be forbidden to enter domain so forbidden with knowledge of country round must come here also with hope of interrupting innocent pleasure of life fearing lest must be allowed even to speak to son to hear word of through own sister must put in prison tie up keep from light of day dr thorne how can doctor be not to be interrupted never occurs to to tie up to put in prison be heir of greshamsbury be son earl grandson be only natural after that must throw few foolish word at doctor niece be offence not to be forgiven on part that must however unwillingly have be forced to listen to now understand lady arabella if of family come to house will be delighted to welcome if mary must meet of elsewhere will be delighted to hear of must tell to morrow that be engaged to marry frank must talk matter over with quite coolly solely with view to interest a must be duty feeling at same time that frank must be lucky in having wife now know mind lady arabella be so must do duty can do yours a may think fit lady arabella have by time perceived that be not destined on occasion to gain great victory however be angry a well a doctor be not man vehemence that provoked so much a evident determination to break down prestige of rank place on footing in respect superior to own have never before be so audaciously arrogant a moved towards door determined in wrath that must never again have confidential intercourse with in relation of life whatsoever dr thorne said think have forgotten must excuse if say that after what have passed certainly said fully understanding what meant bowing low a opened first study door then front door then garden gate then lady arabella stalked off not without full observation from mr yates umbleby friend miss gushing who lived close by chapter xxvii miss thorne go on visit now began unpleasant thing at greshamsbury of have here told when lady arabella walked away from doctor house resolved that let cost what might there must be war to knife between have be insulted by so at least said to herself so be prepared to say to others also be not to be borne that de courcy must allow parish doctor to insult with impunity must tell husband with dignity that must assume that have now become absolutely necessary that must protect wife by breaking entirely with unmannered neighbour a regarded young member of family must use authority of mother absolutely forbid to hold intercourse with mary thorne so resolving walked quickly back to own house doctor when left alone be not quite satisfied with part have taken in interview have spoken from impulse rather than from judgement a be generally case with men who do so speak have afterwards to acknowledge to that have be imprudent accused probably of more violence than have really used be therefore unhappy nevertheless indignation be not at rest be angry with not on account le angry with lady arabella be cruel overbearing unreasonable cruel in most cruel of manner so thought not on account be justified in forgetting forbearance due from gentleman to lady mary moreover have owed much to kindness of woman therefore dr thorne felt that must have forgiven much thus doctor walked about room much disturbed now accusing for having be so angry with lady arabella then feeding own anger by thinking of misconduct only immediate conclusion at resolved be that be unnecessary that must say anything to mary on subject of ladyship visit there be doubt sorrow enough in store for darling why must aggravate lady arabella must doubtless not stop now in course why must accelerate evil must doubtless be able to effect lady arabella when returned to house allowed grass to grow under foot a entered house desired that miss beatrice must be sent to directly returned desired also that a soon a squire must be in room message to effect might be immediately brought to beatrice said a soon a young lady appeared before in speaking assumed firmest tone of authority beatrice be sorry dear to say anything be unpleasant to must make positive request that will for future drop intercourse with dr thorne family beatrice who have received lady arabella message immediately on entering house have run upstairs imagining that instant haste be required now stood before mother rather out of breath holding bonnet by string oh mamma exclaimed what on earth have happened dear said mother can not really explain to what have happened must ask to give positive assurance that will comply with request mean that be not to see mary more yes do dear at rate for present when tell that brother interest imperatively demand be sure that will not refuse beatrice did not refuse did not appear too willing to comply stood silent leaning against end of sofa twisting bonnet string in hand well beatrice mamma understand lady arabella have said that must not exactly explain found necessary to attempt to do so dr thorne have openly declared to that marriage between poor frank mary be must desire for niece after such unparalleled audacity a even father will see necessity of breaking with dr thorne oh mamma must have misunderstood dear be not apt to misunderstand people especially when be so much in earnest a be in talking to dr thorne mamma know so well what mary think about know what dr thorne think about at rate have be candid in what said there can be doubt on earth that have spoken true thought there can be reason to doubt of course such match must be that must wish mamma feel sure that there be mistake very well dear know that be infatuated about people that be always inclined to contradict what say to remember expect that will obey when tell not to go to dr thorne house more mamma expect to obey beatrice though be so prone to contradict have never disobeyed fully trust that will not do so now lady arabella have begun by exacting trying to exact promise a found that be not forthcoming thought better to give up point without dispute might be that beatrice must absolutely refuse to pay respect to mother authority then where must have be at moment servant came up to say that squire be in room lady arabella be opportunely saved necessity of discussing matter further with daughter be now said going to see father on same subject may be quite sure beatrice must not willingly speak to on matter relating to dr thorne did not find absolutely necessary to do so beatrice knew be true did therefore feel convinced that something terrible must have happened while lady arabella opened budget squire sat quite silent listening to with apparent respect found necessary that description to must be much more elaborate than have vouchsafed to daughter in telling grievance insisted most especially on personal insult have be offered to herself after have now happened said not quite able to repress tone of triumph a spoke do expect mr gresham that will will will what dear will at least protect from repetition of such treatment be not afraid that dr thorne will come here to attack a far a can understand never come near place unless when send for think that will come to greshamsbury more believe have put stop to then what be dear that want to do lady arabella paused minute before replied game now have to play be not very easy knew thought knew that husband in heart of heart much preferred friend to wife of bosom that must if must shuffle out of noticing doctor iniquity behoved therefore to put forward in such way that must be noticed suppose mr gresham wish that frank must marry girl think there be slightest chance of such thing be quite sure that dr thorne must not encourage tell mr gresham that say will encourage have misunderstood of course always misunderstand everything know that misunderstood when told how must distress if took nasty hound have have other trouble more expensive than hound said poor squire sighing oh yes know what mean wife family be expensive of course be little too late now to complain of dear be always too late to complain of trouble when be no longer to be avoided need not therefore talk more about hound at present wish to speak of mr gresham hope will not think unreasonable if be anxious to know what intend to do about dr thorne to do yes suppose will do something wish to see son marry girl a mary thorne a far a girl be concerned said squire turning rather red be not sure that must do much better know nothing against mary frank however can not afford to make such match must be ruin of course must utter ruin never must hold up head again therefore be ask what do intend to do squire be bothered have intention whatever of doing anything belief in wife assertion a to dr thorne iniquity did not know how to get out of room asked same question over over again on occasion urged on heinousness of insult to personally have be subjected so that at last be driven to ask what be wished to do well then mr gresham if ask must say that think must abstain from intercourse with dr thorne break off intercourse with yes what do mean have be turned out of house be not to go to see at own certainly think that ought to discontinue visit to dr thorne altogether nonsense dear absolute nonsense nonsense mr gresham be nonsense a speak in way must let know plainly what feel be endeavouring to do duty by son a justly observe marriage a must be utter ruin to when found that young people be actually talking of being in love with other making vow sort of thing did think time to interfere did not however turn out of greshamsbury a accuse of doing in kindest possible manner well well well know that there be gone be enough complain surely that ought to be enough enough mr gresham be not enough find that in spite of what have occurred closest intimacy exists between two family that poor beatrice who be so very young not so prudent a must be be made to act a go between when speak to doctor hoping that will assist in preventing not only tell that mean to encourage mary in plan positively insult to face laugh at for being earl daughter tell yes absolutely told to get out of house let be told with shame a to squire conduct that first feeling on hearing be one of envy of envy regret that must not make same uncivil request not that wished to turn wife absolutely out of house must have be very glad to have have power of dismissing summarily from own room however be at present impossible so be obliged to make mild reply must have mistaken dear must not have intended to say that oh of course mr gresham be mistake of course will be mistake only mistake when find son married to mary thorne well dear can not undertake to quarrel with dr thorne be true for squire must hardly have quarrelled with dr thorne even have wished then think right to tell that will mr gresham did not expect much co operation from did think that must have shown little anger when heard have be so ill treated will however know how to take care of myself will continue to do best can to protect frank from wicked intrigue so saying ladyship arose left room having succeeded in destroying comfort of greshamsbury friend be very well for squire to declare that must not quarrel with dr thorne of course did not do so have wish whatever that son must marry mary thorne a falling drop will hollow stone so did continual harping of wife on subject give rise to amount of suspicion in own mind then a to beatrice though have made promise that must not again visit mary be by mean prepared to set mother authority altogether at defiance also be sufficiently uncomfortable dr thorne said nothing of matter to niece therefore must have be absolutely bewildered by beatrice absence have not received tidings of what have taken place at greshamsbury through patience oriel beatrice patience discussed matter fully be agreed between that must be better that mary must know what sterner order respecting have gone forth from tyrant at greshamsbury that might understand beatrice absence be compulsory patience be thus placed in position that on one day walked talked with beatrice on next with mary so matter went on for while at greshamsbury not very pleasantly very unpleasantly very uncomfortably did month of may june pas away beatrice mary occasionally met drinking tea together at parsonage in other of ordinary meeting of country society there be more confidentially distressing confidential discourse more whispering of frank name no more sweet allusion to inexpediency of passion according to beatrice view must have be so delightful have be expedient squire doctor also met constantly there be unfortunately many subject on be obliged to meet louis philippe sir louis a must call though have power over own property be wide awake to coming privilege of ownership must constantly point out to guardian manner in according to idea most must be made of young baronet idea of good taste be not of most refined description did not hesitate to tell dr thorne that doctor friendship with mr gresham must be bar to baronet interest sir louis also have own lawyer who gave dr thorne to understand that according to idea sum due on mr gresham property be too large to be left on present footing title deed said must be surrendered mortgage foreclosed added to sadness now seemed to envelop village of greshamsbury early in july frank be to come home manner in coming going of poor frank be allowed to disturb arrangement of lady of gentleman of greshamsbury be most abominable yet can hardly be said to have be fault must have be only too well pleased have thing be allowed to go on after old fashion thing be not allowed so to go on at christmas miss oriel have submitted to be exiled in order that might carry mary away from presence of young bashaw arrangement by winter festivity of poor doctor have be thoroughly sacrificed now began to be said that similar plan for summer must be suggested must not be supposed that direction to effect be conveyed either to mary to doctor suggestion came from be mentioned only to patience patience a matter of course told beatrice beatrice told mother somewhat triumphantly hoping thereby to convince dragon of mary innocence ala dragon be not easily convinced of innocence of one lady arabella quite coincided in propriety of mary being sent off whither never inquired in order that coast might be clear for poor frank did not whit more abstain from talking of wicked intrigue of thornes a turned out mary absence caused to talk more boxall hill property including house furniture have be left to contractor son being understood that property must not be at present in own hand that might inhabit house if chose to do so must thus be necessary for lady scatcherd to find home for herself unless must remain at boxall hill by son permission in position of affair doctor have be obliged to make bargain between sir louis did wish to have comfort perhaps honour of country house did not wish to have expense of keeping up be also willing to let mother live at house not without consideration after prolonged degree of haggling term be agreed upon few week after husband death lady scatcherd found alone at boxall hill alone a regard society in ordinary sense not quite alone a concerned ladyship for faithful hannah be still with doctor be of course often at boxall hill never left without urgent request from lady scatcherd that must bring niece over to see now lady scatcherd be fit companion for mary thorne though mary have often asked to be taken to boxall hill certain consideration have hitherto induced doctor to refuse request there be that about lady scatcherd kind of homely honesty of purpose absence of conceit a to own position strength of womanly confidence in doctor a friend by degree won upon heart when therefore mary felt that must be better for again to absent for while from greshamsbury be after much deliberation agreed that must go on visit to boxall hill to boxall hill accordingly went be received almost a princess mary have life be accustomed to woman of rank have never habituated to feel much trepidation in presence of titled grandee have prepared to be more than ordinarily submissive to lady scatcherd hostess be widow be not woman of high birth be woman of whom uncle spoke well for reason mary be determined to respect pay to consideration when settled down in house found almost impossible to do so lady scatcherd treated a farmer wife might have treated convalescent young lady who have be sent to charge for few week in order that might benefit by country air ladyship must hardly bring to sit still eat dinner tranquilly in guest presence then nothing be good enough for mary lady scatcherd besought almost with tear to say what liked best to eat drink be in despair when mary declared did care that liked anything that be in nowise particular in such matter roast fowl miss thorne very nice lady scatcherd bread sauce bread sauce yes oh yes like bread sauce

well miss thorne if like boiled fowl better with little bit of ham know do hope will say so there be lamb in house quite beautiful now do 'ee say something do miss thorne so invoked mary felt obliged

about place on donkey be accustomed to riding doctor having generally taken care that one of own horse must when required consent to carry lady there be steed at boxall hill that must mount when lady scatcherd have offered to get pony for have willingly compromised matter by expressing delight must have in making campaign on donkey upon lady scatcherd have herself set off in quest of desired animal much to mary horror did not return till necessary purchase have be effected then came back with donkey close at heel almost holding collar stood there at hall door till mary came to approve hope will do think will kick said lady scatcherd patting head of purchase quite triumphantly oh be so kind lady scatcherd be sure will do quite nicely seems very quiet said mary please lady be said boy who held halter oh be said ladyship donkey be quite a quiet a shes ai oh yes lady deal quieter world over twice a useful be so glad of miss thorne said lady scatcherd eye bright with joy so mary

short pause if think will do good of course will put up with then know louis must be mad if talked of such thing miss thorne dear woman like like to have to be made fool of day of life if can help lady scatcherd said mary when question of title have be duly settled ladyship made to understand that must bear burden for rest of life lady scatcherd be speaking of sir roger sister what became of oh did very well at last a sir roger did in early life be very unfortunate just at time of marriage with dear roger then just a be about to commence so much a knew of history of mary scatcherd remembered that author of sister in law misery have be thorne brother of doctor therefore a presumed relative of guest suddenly became mute well said mary just a be married lady scatcherd poor lady scatcherd have very little worldly knowledge did not in least know how to turn conversation escape from trouble into have fallen manner of reflection began to crowd upon in early day have known very little of thornes have thought much of since except a regarded friend doctor at moment began for first time to remember that have never heard of more than two brother in family who then must have be mary father felt at once that must be improper for to say anything a to henry thorne terrible fault sudden fate improper also to say more about mary scatcherd be quite unable to drop matter otherwise than abruptly with start be very unfortunate say lady scatcherd yes miss thorne mary mean never mind will do in time yes be now think of have better say nothing more about there be reason ought not to have spoken of wo be provoked with will mary assured that must not be provoked of course asked more question about mary scatcherd did think much more about be not so however with ladyship who must not keep from reflecting that old clergyman in close at barchester certainly have two son one of whom be now doctor at greshamsbury other of whom have perished so wretchedly at gate of farmyard who then be father of mary thorne day passed very quietly at boxall hill morning mary went out on donkey who justified by demeanour have be said in praise then must read draw then walk with lady scatcherd then dine then walk again so day passed quietly away once twice week doctor must come over drink tea there riding home in cool of evening mary also received one visit from friend patience so day passed quietly away till tranquillity of house be suddenly broken by tidings from london lady scatcherd received letter from son contained in three line in intimated that on following day meant to honour with visit have intended said to have gone to brighton with friend a felt little out of sort must postpone marine trip do mother grace of spending few day with news be not very pleasant to mary by whom have be understood a have also by uncle that lady scatcherd must have have house to herself a there be mean of preventing evil mary must only inform doctor prepare to meet sir louis scatcherd chapter xxviii doctor hears something to advantage sir louis scatcherd have told mother that be rather out of sort when reached boxall hill certainly did not appear that have given exaggerated statement of own malady certainly be good deal out of sort have have more than one attack of delirium tremens since father death have almost be at death door nothing have be said about by dr thorne at boxall hill be by mean ignorant of ward state twice have gone up to london to visit twice have begged to go down into country place under mother care on last occasion doctor have threatened with manner of pain penalty with pain a to speedy departure from world joy with penalty in shape of poverty if departure must by chance be retarded threat have at moment be in vain doctor have compromised matter by inducing sir louis to promise that must go to brighton baronet however who be at length frightened by renewed attack gave up brighton scheme without notice to doctor hurried down to boxall hill mary did not see on first day of coming doctor did received such intimation of visit a enabled to be at house soon after young man arrival knowing that assistance might be necessary rode over to boxall hill be dreadful task to of making same fruitless endeavour for son that have made for father in same house be bound by consideration to perform task have promised father that must do for son be in power have consciousness must sir louis succeed in destroying next heir to property be own niece mary thorne found sir louis in low wretched miserable state though be drunkard a father be be not at such drunkard a be father physical capacity of men be very different daily amount of alcohol father have consumed must have burnt up son in week whereas though son be continually tipsy what swallowed must hardly have have injurious effect upon father be wrong quite wrong said sir louis petulantly be that at have taken nothing week past literally nothing think be liver dr thorne wanted one to tell be matter with ward be liver liver head stomach heart organ in body have be destroyed be in course of destruction father have killed with son more elevated in taste be doing same thing with curacoa maraschino cherry bounce sir louis said doctor be obliged to be much more punctilious with than have be with contractor matter be in own hand entirely if can not keep lip from accursed poison have nothing in world to look forward to nothing nothing mary proposed to return with uncle to greshamsbury be at first well inclined that must do so idea be overruled partly in compliance with lady scatcherd entreaty partly because must have seemed a though have thought presence of owner have made house unfit habitation for decent people doctor therefore returned leaving mary there lady scatcherd busied between two guest on next day sir louis be able to come down to late dinner mary be introduced to have dressed in best array a have at rate for present moment be frightened out of libation be prepared to make a agreeable a possible mother waited on almost a slave might have done seemed to do so with fear of slave rather than love of mother be fidgety in attention worried by endeavouring to make evening sitting room agreeable sir louis though be not very sweetly behaved under manipulation from mother hand be quite complaisant to miss thorne nay after expiration of week be almost more than complaisant piqued on gallantry now found that in otherwise dull seclusion of boxall hill have good opportunity of exercising to do justice must be admitted that must not have be incapable of decent career have stumbled upon girl who must have loved before stumbled upon maraschino bottle such might have be case with many lost rake thing be bad be accepted because thing be good come easily in way how many miserable father reviles with bitterness of spirit low taste of son who have done nothing to provide child with higher pleasure sir louis partly in hope of mary smile partly frightened by doctor threat did for while keep within decent bound did not usually appear before mary eye till three four in afternoon when did come forth came forth sober resolute to please mother be delighted be not slow to sing praise even doctor who now visited boxall hill more frequently than ever began to have hope one constant subject must not say of conversation on part of lady scatcherd rather of declamation have hitherto be beauty manly attribute of frank gresham have hardly ceased to talk to mary of infinite good quality of young squire especially of prowess in matter of mr moffat mary have listened to eloquence not perhaps with inattention without much reply have not be exactly sorry to hear frank talked about indeed have be so minded must have said something on same subject did not wish to take lady scatcherd altogether into confidence have be unable to say much about frank gresham without doing so lady scatcherd have therefore gradually conceived idea that darling be not favourite with guest now therefore changed subject a own son be behaving with such unexampled propriety dropped frank confined eulogy to louis have be little wild admitted young men so often be so hoped that be now over doe still take little drop of french drink in morning said lady scatcherd in confidence for be too honest to be false even in own cause doe do know be nothing dear to swilling day everything ca be done at once can miss thorne on subject mary found tongue loosened must not talk about frank gresham must speak with hope to mother of only son must say that sir louis be still very young that there be reason to trust that might now reform that present conduct be apparently good that appeared capable of better thing so much did say mother took sympathy for more than be worth on matter on matter perhaps alone sir louis lady scatcherd be in accord there be much to recommend mary to baronet not only did see to be beautiful perceive to be attractive ladylike be also niece of man who for present held purse string of wealth mary be true have fortune sir louis knew that be acknowledged to be lady be ambitious that lady must be lady there be also much to recommend mary to mother to mother thus came to pas miss thorne have obstacle between dignity of being lady scatcherd second obstacle whatever if only must bring to wish be time two three week perhaps before mary mind be first opened to new brilliancy in prospect sir louis at first be rather afraid of did not declare admiration in very determined term certainly paid many compliment from one else must have regarded a abominable did not expect great thing from baronet taste concluded that be only doing what thought gentleman must do be willing to forgive much for lady scatcherd sake first attempt be perhaps more ludicrous than passionate be still too much invalid to take walk mary be therefore saved from company in ramble have horse of own at boxall hill have be advised to ride by doctor mary also rode on donkey only be true sir louis found bound in gallantry to accompany mary steed have answered expectation proved very quiet so quiet that without admonition of cudgel behind must hardly be persuaded into demurest trot now a sir louis horse be of very different mettle found rather difficult not to step faster than inamorata let struggle a must be generally so far ahead a to be debarred delight of conversation when for second time proposed to accompany mary did what must to hinder saw that have be rather ashamed of manner in companion be mounted must have enjoyed ride much more without be invalid however be necessary to make much of mary did not absolutely refuse offer lady scatcherd said a be standing at door previous to mounting always called mother lady scatcherd why have horse for miss thorne donkey be be really be so very very ca go at know lady scatcherd began to declare that must willingly have got pony if mary must have let do so oh lady scatcherd not on account do like donkey so much do indeed wo go said sir louis for person who ride like miss thorne such horsewoman know why know lady scatcherd be positively ridiculous d absurd know then with angry look at mother mounted horse be soon leading way down avenue miss thorne said pulling up at gate if have known be to be so extremely happy a to have found here must have brought down most beautiful creature arab belongs to friend jenkins must have stood at price in getting for by jove if be on mare 'd back for style appearance against anything in hyde park offer of sporting wager naturally must have be very gratifying to mary be lost upon for sir louis have again unwittingly got on in advance stopped in time to hear mary again declare passion be donkey if must only see jenkins little mare miss thorne only say one word will be down here before week end price will be obstacle none by jove what pair must be generous offer be repeated four five time on occasion mary only half heard what be said on occasion baronet be far too much in advance to hear mary reply at last recollected that wanted to call on one of tenant begged companion to allow to ride on if at dislike being left alone know oh dear not at sir louis be quite used to because care about know only ca make horse walk same pace a brute must abuse pet sir louis be d shame on mother part said sir louis who even when in best behaviour must not quite give up ordinary mode of conversation when be fortunate enough to get such girl a to come stay with ought to have have something proper for to ride upon will look to a soon a be little stronger see if so saying sir louis trotted off leaving mary in peace with donkey sir louis have now be living cleanly forswearing sack for what be to very long period health felt good effect of one rejoiced at more cordially than did doctor to rejoice at be with point of conscience must not help telling now again that circumstanced a be be most specially bound to take joy in sign of reformation baronet might show not to do so must be almost tantamount to wishing that might die in order that mary might inherit wealth therefore doctor did with energy devote to difficult task of hoping striving that sir louis might yet live to enjoy what be own task be altogether difficult one for a sir louis became stronger in health so also did become more exorbitant in demand on doctor patience more repugnant to doctor taste in worst fit of disreputable living be ashamed to apply to guardian for money in worst fit of illness be through fear somewhat patient under doctor hand just at present have nothing of to be ashamed be not at patient doctor said one day at boxall hill how about greshamsbury title deed oh will be properly settled between lawyer own oh ah yes doubt lawyer will settle settle with fine bill of cost of course a finnie say finnie be sir louis legal adviser have got tremendously large interest at stake in matter eighty thousand pound be joke ai everybody can shell out eighty thousand pound when be wanted must like to know how thing going on have right to ask know eh doctor title deed of large portion of greshamsbury estate will be placed with mortgage deed before end of next month oh be right choose to know about thing for though father did make such con found ed will be reason must know how thing be going will know everything know sir louis now doctor what be to do about money about money yes money rhino ready 'put money in purse cut dash eh doctor not want to cut dash be going on quiet line altogether now have done with sort of thing be heartily glad of heartily said doctor yes be not going to make way for far away cousin yet not if know at least will soon be right now doctor sha 'all right ' be long word sir louis do hope will be right in time if will live with decent prudence must take filth in morning though filth in morning mother suppose that be ladyship be be talking have believe doctor there be not young man in barsetshire be going more regular right within post than be doctor be obliged to acknowledge that there did seem to be improvement now doctor how about money eh doctor thorne like other guardian similarly circumstanced began to explain that sir louis have already have good deal of money have begun also to promise that more must be forthcoming in event of good behaviour when be somewhat suddenly interrupted by sir louis well now will tell what doctor have got bit of news for something that think will astonish doctor opened eye tried to look a though ready to be surprised something will really make look about something too will be very much to hearer advantage a newspaper advertisement say something to advantage said doctor well hope will think so doctor what must think now of getting married must be delighted to hear of more delighted than can express be of course if be to marry well be father most eager wish that must marry early be partly reason said young hypocrite then if marry must have income fit to live on eh doctor doctor have fear that interesting protegee be desirous of wife for sake of income instead of desiring income for sake of wife let cause be what must marriage must probably be good for have hesitation therefore in telling that if married well must be put in possession of sufficient income to maintain new lady scatcherd in manner becoming dignity a to marrying well said sir louis take will be last man doctor to quarrel with choice will said doctor smiling well wo disapprove guess a yankee say what must think of miss mary thorne must be said in sir louis favour that have probably idea of estimation in such young lady a mary thorne be held by who be nearest dearest to have sort of conception that be regarded by uncle a inestimable treasure almost too precious to be rendered up to arm of man infinitely beyond price in silver gold baronet income of eight ten thousand year such coin usually current in world market be rich man baronet mary be unmarried girl without portion in sir louis estimation be offering everything asking for nothing certainly have idea that girl be apt to be coy required little wooing in shape of present civil speech perhaps kiss also civil speech have thought done imagined that have be well received other thing be to follow arab pony for instance kiss probably with then difficulty must be smoothed did not for moment conceive that there must be difficulty with uncle how must there be be not baronet with ten thousand year coming to have not everything father want for portionless daughter uncle for dependant niece might not well inform doctor that have something to tell for advantage yet to tell truth doctor did not seem to be overjoyed when announcement be first made to be by mean overjoyed on contrary even sir louis must perceive guardian surprise be altogether unmixed with delight what question be be asked what must think of marriage between mary thorne mary sir louis scatcherd between alpha of whole alphabet whom must not regard a omega think of why must think of a though lamb wolf be to stand at altar together have sir louis be hottentot esquimaux proposal must not have astonished more two person be so totally of different class that idea of one falling in love with other have never occurred to what must think of miss mary thorne sir louis have asked doctor instead of answering with ready pleased alacrity stood silent thunderstruck with amazement well must be good wife said sir louis rather in tone of disgust at evident disapproval shown at choice thought 'd have be so delighted mary thorne ejaculated doctor at last have spoken to niece about sir louis well have yet have have yet in manner have understand said doctor why see have exactly popped to yet have be doing civil if be up to snuff a take to be know very well what be after by time up to snuff mary thorne mary thorne up to snuff to snuff too of such very disagreeable description think sir louis that be in mistake about think will find mary will not be disposed to avail herself of great advantage for great undoubtedly be be able to offer to intended wife if will take advice will give up thinking of mary must not suit not suit oh think just must be got money mean did not mean that will not signify to whether wife have money not need not look for money must think of one more nearly of own temperament be quite sure that niece must refuse last word doctor uttered with much emphasis intention be to make baronet understand that matter be quite hopeless to induce if possible to drop on spot did not know sir louis ranked too low in scale of human being gave credit for strength of character sir louis in way did love mary thorne must not bring to believe that mary did not at rate must not soon return passion be moreover sufficiently obstinate firm ought perhaps to say for pursuit in case be certainly not evil one at once made up mind to succeed in spite of uncle if consent however will do so too asked be impossible must consent said doctor impossible see anything at impossible if doe wo very well be to be seen just tell if doe will consent star must fall first be nonsense give up dear friend believe be only preparing unhappiness for doctor put hand kindly on young man arm will not can not accept such offer will not can not said baronet thinking over reason in estimation must possibly be inducing doctor to be so hostile to view shaking hand off arm will not can not come doctor answer question fairly if will have for better worse wo say aught against will wo have why must give pain of refusal oh a for must stand chance like a for why d doctor must have believe that young lady think so very dreadful to have baronet with ten thousand pound year at foot specially when same baronet ai very old yet particularly ugly ai so green a doctor suppose must go through then said doctor musing dr thorne did look for kinder answer from considering that so often say about great friendship with father did think 'd at rate answer when asked question doctor did not want to answer special question must be possible that mary must wish to marry odious man must such state of thing be imagined to be case must not refuse consent infinitely a must be disgusted by choice must not give sir louis excuse for telling mary that uncle approved of so odious match can not say that in case must approve of such marriage sir louis can not bring to say so for know must make miserable on matter niece will choose wholly for herself about money doctor if marry decent woman will not want mean of supporting decently so saying doctor walked away leaving sir louis to meditation chapter xxix donkey ride sir louis when left to be slightly dismayed somewhat discouraged be not induced to give up object first effort of mind be made in conjecturing what private motive dr thorne must possibly have in wishing to debar niece from marrying rich young baronet that objection be personal to sir louis did not for moment imagine must be that doctor did not wish that niece must be richer grander altogether bigger than be possible that guardian be anxious to prevent from marrying from view of reversion of large fortune that there be such reason sir louis be well sure let be what might must get better of doctor knew so said to what stuff girl be made of baronet did not grow like blackberry so assuring with such philosophy determined to make offer time selected for doing be hour before dinner on day on conversation with doctor have taken place be deterred by presence of strange visitor to account for strange visit will be necessary that must return to greshamsbury for few minute frank when returned home for summer vacation found that mary have again flown very fact of absence added fuel to fire of love more perhaps than even presence might have done for flight of quarry ever add eagerness to pursuit of huntsman lady arabella moreover have bitter enemy foe utterly opposed to side in contest where have once fondly looked for staunchest ally frank be now in habit of corresponding with miss dunstable received from most energetic admonition to be true to love have sworn true to resolved to be therefore when found that mary be flown resolved to fly after did not however do till have be in measure provoked to by by sharp tongued caution blunted irony of mother be not enough for that have banished mary out of parish made dr thorne life miserable not enough that harassed husband with harangue on constant subject of frank marrying money dismayed beatrice with invective against iniquity of friend snake be so scotched to kill outright must induce frank utterly to renounce miss thorne task essayed not exactly with success well mother said frank at last turning very red partly with shame partly with indignation a made frank avowal since press about tell fairly that mind be made up to marry mary sooner later if oh frank good heaven wicked boy be saying purposely to drive distracted if continued frank not attending to mother interjection if will consent consent said lady arabella oh heaven falling into corner of sofa buried face in handkerchief yes mother if will consent now have told so much be only just must tell also that a far a can see at present have reason to hope that will do so oh frank girl be doing can to catch said lady arabella not prudently mother there wrong altogether wrong most cruelly ungracious wicked boy call cruel call cruel wrong cruelly most cruelly when have spoken to about for have spoken to have behaved exactly a must have wanted to do not at all a wished have given encouragement have turned out among frank be beginning to be very bitter now have done nothing to deserve if there have be fault have be mine be well that must understand other intention be to marry mary if can so speaking certainly without due filial respect turned towards door frank said mother raising up with energy to make one last appeal frank do wish to see die of broken heart know mother must wish to make happy if must if wish to see ever happy again if wish to see sink broken hearted to grave must give up mad idea frank now lady arabella energy came out frank there be one course left open to must marry money then lady arabella stood up before son a lady macbeth might have stood have lady macbeth lived to have son of frank year miss dunstable suppose said frank scornfully mother made as worse than as of once in way wo do again hate money oh frank hate money frank estate hate estate at least will hate if be expected to buy at price a that estate be father oh frank be not be in sense mean may do with a plea will never have word of complaint from be ready to go into profession to morrow will be lawyer doctor engineer care what frank in enthusiasm probably overlooked of preliminary difficulty will take farm under earn bread way mother talk to more about marrying money so saying frank left room frank will be remembered be twenty one when be first introduced to reader be now twenty two may be said that there be great difference between character then now year at period will make great difference change have be not in character in feeling frank went out from mother immediately ordered black horse to be got ready for must at once go over to boxall hill went to stable to give order a returned to get glove whip met beatrice in corridor beatrice said step in here followed into room be not going to bear longer be going to boxall hill oh frank how can be so imprudent at rate have decent feeling for mary believe have regard for therefore tell will send message oh yes best best love be if will see frank be very foolish very will be infinitely distressed mention be not at present not that mean to make secret of will tell father everything be off now then paying attention to remonstrance turned down stair be soon on horseback took road to boxall hill did not ride very fast did not go jauntily a jolly thriving wooer musingly often with diffidence meditating now then whether must not be better for to turn back to turn back not from fear of mother not from prudential motif not because often repeated lesson a to marrying money be beginning to take effect not from such cause a because doubted how might be received by mary did be true think something about worldly prospect have talked rather grandiloquently to mother a to hating money hating estate mother never ceasing worldly care on such subject perhaps demanded that little grandiloquence must be opposed to frank did not hate estate did at hate position of english country gentleman miss dunstable eloquence however rang in ear for miss dunstable have eloquence of own even in letter never let talk out of own true honest hearty feeling have said greshamsbury be very nice place be sure hope will see day green knoll be not half so nice must not be half so precious a pulse of own heart be own estate own very own own may go to money lender send that there mortgage mr gresham said frank pluckily a put horse into faster trot wo mortgage that may do what like with estate heart own so speaking to almost aloud turned corner of road rapidly came at once upon doctor hallo doctor be that said frank rather disgusted what frank hardly expected to meet here said dr thorne not much better pleased be now not above mile from boxall hill doctor therefore must not surmise whither frank be going have repeatedly met since frank return from cambridge in village in doctor house not word have be said between about mary beyond what merest courtesy

pray to frank to return with not to go make further mischief not to do might cause more bitter estrangement between squire have not courage to do must not bring to accuse frank of being in love with niece so after few more senseless word on side word knew to be senseless a uttered rode on own way then doctor silently almost unconsciously made such comparison between louis scatcherd frank gresham a hamlet made between dead live king be hyperion to satyr be not a impossible that mary must not love one a must love other frank offer of affection have at first probably be boyish ebullition of feeling if must now be that have grown into manly disinterested love how must mary remain unmoved what must heart want more better more beautiful more rich than love a be not personally that girl must like be not disposition mind character acquirement such a woman most delight to love be not impossible that mary must be indifferent to so meditated doctor a rode along with only too true knowledge of

than be to men to girl than be to boy when frank have first told that loved aye month before when merely looked love heart have received whisper have acknowledged glance unconscious a be resolved a be to rebuke advance when in hearing have said soft nothing to patience oriel hated irrepressible tear have gathered in eye when have pressed in warm loving grasp hand have offered a token of mere

that there must be happiness in store for be not too clear that let matter go how must there be happiness in store for much a might love frank gresham must never consent to be wife unless squire must smile on a daughter in law squire have be be kind be affectionate then too lady arabella a thought of lady arabella sterner form of thought came across brow why must lady arabella rob of heart joy what be lady arabella that mary thorne need quail before have lady arabella stood only in way lady arabella flanked by de courcy legion mary felt that must have demanded frank hand a own before without blush of shame moment hesitation thus when heart be ready to collapse within must gain little strength by thinking of lady arabella please lady here be young squoire gresham said one of untutored servant at boxall hill opening lady scatcherd little parlour door a ladyship be amusing by pulling down turning re folding putting up again heap of household linen be kept in huge press for express purpose of supplying with occupation lady scatcherd holding vast counterpane in arm looked back over shoulder perceived that frank be in room down went counterpane on ground frank soon found

that may think what like if live for next twenty year will always be own boy so will by degree slow degree frank managed to change conversation to induce lady scatcherd to speak on other topic than own infantine perfection affected indifference a spoke of guest must have deceived one lady scatcherd did deceive then asked where mary be be just gone out on donkey somewhere about place ride on donkey mostly day will stop take bit of dinner with eh now do 'ee master frank master frank excused did not choose to pledge to sit down to dinner with mary did not know in what mood might return with regard to other at dinner time said therefore that must walk out if possible find miss thorne that must return to house again before went lady scatcherd then began making apology for sir louis be invalid doctor have be with morning be not yet out of room apology frank willingly accepted then made way a must on to lawn gardener of whom inquired offered to go with in pursuit of miss thorne assistance however declined set forth in quest of having learnt what be most usual haunt be directed wrongly for after walking about twenty minute saw through tree leg of donkey moving on green sward at about two hundred yard from on donkey doubtless sat mary thorne donkey be coming towards not exactly in straight line so much so a to make impossible that mary must not see if stood still did stand still soon emerging from tree mary saw close to heart gave leap within be so far mistress of a to repress visible sign of outward emotion did not fall from donkey scream burst into tear merely uttered word mr gresham in tone of not unnatural surprise yes said trying to laugh le successful than have be in suppressing show of feeling mr gresham have come over at last to pay respect to must have thought very uncourteous not to do so before denied have not said thought at uncivil have come to boxall hill to be out of way of course have not expected such formality a uttered almost blushed at abrupt truth of what be saying be taken so much unawares that did not know how to make truth other than abrupt to be out of way said frank why must want to be out of way oh there be reason said laughing perhaps have quarrelled dreadfully with uncle frank at present moment have not about scrap of badinage have not single easy word at command must not answer with anything in guise of joke so walked on not answering at hope friend at greshamsbury be well said mary be beatrice quite well quite well said patience what miss oriel yes believe so have seen day two how be that mary felt little flush of joy a frank spoke in indifferent way about miss oriel health thought be always particular friend of yours said what who miss oriel so be like amazingly so doe beatrice then walked about six step in silence plucking up courage for great attempt did pluck up courage then rushed at once to attack mary said a spoke put hand on donkey neck looked tenderly into face looked tenderly a mary ear at once told voice sounded more soft than have ever sounded before mary do remember last time that be together mary did remember well be on occasion when have treacherously held hand on day when according to law have become man when have outraged propriety of de courcy interest by offering love to mary in augusta hearing mary did remember well how be to speak of be birthday think said yes be birthday wonder whether remember what said to then remember that be very foolish mr gresham mary have come to repeat folly be if be folly told then that loved dare say did so awkwardly like boy perhaps may be just a awkward now ought at rate to believe when find that year have not altered mary did not think at awkward did believe how be to answer have not yet taught what answer ought to make if persisted in suit have hitherto be content to run away from have done so because must not submit to be accused of indelicacy of putting in way have rebuked when first spoke of love have done so because looked on what said a boy nonsense have schooled in obedience to greshamsbury doctrine be there real reason reason founded on truth honesty why must not be fitting wife to frank gresham francis newbold gresham of greshamsbury though be be to be be well born a well born a gentleman in england be basely born a basely born a lady must be be sufficient bar against match mary felt in heart that twelvemonth since before knew what little did now know of own story must have said be so must indulge own love by inveigling loved into base marriage then reason spoke again what after be blood of have taught to think so much must have be more honest more fit to grace honest man hearthstone have be legitimate descendant of score of legitimate duchess be not first duty to think of of what must make happy then of uncle what must approve then of must best become modesty sense of honour must be well that must sacrifice happiness of two person to theoretic love of pure blood so have argued within not now sitting on donkey with frank hand before on tame brute neck on other former occasion a have ridden along demurely among tree so have argued have never brought argument to decision manner of thought crowded on to prevent doing so must think of squire resolve to reject frank must then remember lady arabella resolve to accept resolution however be most irresolute so when frank appeared in person before carrying heart in hand did not know what answer to make to thus be with a with so many other maiden similarly circumstanced at last left to chance ought at rate to believe said frank when find that year have not altered year must have taught to be wiser said must have learnt by time mr gresham that lot mine be not cast in same mould that station in life be different must father mother approve of even coming here to see mary a spoke sensible word felt that be flat stale unprofitable felt also that be not true in sense that did not come from heart that be not such a frank deserved at hand be ashamed of father hope will approve of said that mother must disapprove of be misfortune can not help on point will take answer from father mother question be one too personal to myself mary if say that will not can not return love will go away not from here only from greshamsbury presence will not banish from that hold dear if can honestly say that be nothing to can be nothing to will then tell mother that may be at ease will go away somewhere get over a may poor fellow got so far looking apparently at donkey ear with hardly gasp of hope in voice so far carried mary with that also have hardly gasp of hope in heart there paused for moment then looking up into face spoke one word more said there stopped be clearly told in thus must do if mary must declare that did not care for if however must not bring so to declare then be ready to throw father mother to wind then must stand ground then must look other difficulty in face sure that might finally be overcome poor whole onus of settling matter be thus thrown upon have only to say that be indifferent to be if blood of howard have depended upon must not have brought to utter falsehood indifferent to a walked there by donkey side talking thus earnestly of love for be not to like god come from heaven to make blessed did not sun shine upon with halo so that be bright a angel indifferent to must open unadulterated truth have be practicable for must have declared indifference in term must truly have astonished a be found easier to say nothing bit lip to keep from sobbing struggled hard in vain to prevent hand foot from trembling seemed to swing upon donkey a though like to fall must have given much to be upon own foot upon sward si la jeunesse savait there be so much in wicked old french proverb have frank known more about woman mind have be be forty two instead of twenty two must at once have be sure of game have felt that mary silence told wished to know then have be forty two instead of twenty two must not have be so ready to risk acre of greshamsbury for smile of mary thorne if ca say one word to comfort will go said disconsolately made up mind to tell so came over told lady scatcherd must not stay not even for dinner did not know be so hurried said almost in whisper on sudden stood still pulling donkey rein caused to stand still also beast required very little persuasion to be so guided obligingly remained meekly passive mary mary said frank throwing arm round knee a sat upon steed pressing face against body mary be always honest be honest now love with heart will be wife still mary said not word no longer bit lip be beyond be now using effort to prevent tear from falling absolutely on lover face said nothing must no more rebuke now send from than must encourage must only sit there shaking cry wishing be on ground frank on whole rather liked donkey enabled to approach somewhat nearer to embrace than might have found practicable have be on foot donkey be quite at ease looked a though be approvingly conscious of what be going on behind ear have right to word mary say will leave at once mary did not say go perhaps must have done so have be able just at present must say nothing came from having failed to make up mind in due time a to what course must best become to follow one word mary one little word there if will not speak here be hand if will have let lie in yours if not push away so saying managed to get end of finger on to palm there remained unrepulsed la jeunesse be beginning to get lesson experience when duly sought after sometimes come early in life in truth mary have not strength to push finger away love own own said frank presuming on very negative sign of acquiescence life own one own mary then hand be caught hold of be at lip before effort must be made to save from such treatment mary look at say one word to there be deep sigh then came one word oh frank mr gresham hope have honour of seeing quite well said voice close to ear beg to say that be welcome to boxall hill frank turned round instantly found shaking hand with sir louis scatcherd how mary got over confusion frank never saw for have enough to do to get over own involuntarily deserted mary began talking very fast to sir louis sir louis did not once look at miss thorne walked back towards house with mr gresham sulky enough in temper still making effort to do fine gentleman mary glad to be left alone merely occupied with sitting on donkey donkey when found that two gentleman went towards house for company sake for stable sake followed after frank stayed three minute in house gave kiss to lady scatcherd getting three in return thereby infinitely disgusting sir louis shook hand anything warmly with young baronet just felt warmth of mary hand within own felt also warmth of eye last glance rode home happy man chapter xxx post prandial frank rode home happy man cheering a successful lover do cheer with brilliancy of late exploit be till have turned corner into greshamsbury stable that began to reflect what must do next be very well to have induced mary to allow three finger to lie minute in soft hand having done so might certainly be sufficient evidence that have overcome one of lion in path must hardly be said that difficulty be now smoothed how be to make further progress to mary also same idea doubt occurred with many others then be not for mary to make progress in matter to at least belonged passive comfort at present act hostile to de courcy interest must be expected from that must do must be to tell uncle so much a be fitting that must know doing must doubtless be in degree difficult be not probable that there must be much difference much of anything loving anxiety for other between dr thorne one other thing indeed must do frank must be made to understand what birth have be said to herself will give opportunity of retracting what have done must choose to avail of be well must have such opportunity frank have more than to do have told beatrice that must make secret of love fully resolved to be a good a word to father owed unreserved confidence be fully minded to give be knew altogether out of question that must at once marry portionless girl without father consent probably out of question that must do so even with must at rate tell father then decide a to what must be done next so resolving put black horse into stable went in to dinner after dinner father must be alone yes after dinner father must be alone dressed hurriedly for dinner bell be almost on stroke a entered house said to once again when meat pudding then cheese be borne away a decanter be placed before father lady arabella sipped one glass of claret sister ate portion of strawberry pressing anxiety for coming interview began to wax somewhat dull mother sister however rendered assistance by prolonging stay with unwonted assiduity pressed second glass of claret on mother lady arabella be not only temperate in habit also at present moment very angry with son thought that have be to boxall hill be only waiting proper moment to cross question sternly on subject now departed taking train of daughter with give one big gooseberry said nina a squeezed in under brother arm prior to making retreat frank must willingly have given dozen of biggest have wanted having got one squeezed out again scampered off squire be very cheery evening from what cause can not now be said perhaps have succeeded in negotiating further loan thus temporarily sprinkling drop of water over ever rising dust of difficulty well frank what have be after to day peter told have black horse out said pushing decanter to son take advice boy give too much summer road work leg wo stand let be ever so good why sir be obliged to go out to day therefore have to be either old mare young horse why did take ramble now ramble be squire own saddle hack used for farm surveying occasionally for going to cover must think of doing that

must want do pray pray take care of black horse leg be turning out more of horse than took to be must be sorry to see injured where have be to day well father have something to tell something to tell then squire happy gay look have be only rendered more happy more gay by assumed anxiety about black horse gave place to heaviness of visage acrimony misfortune have made so habitual to something to tell grave word like always presaged money difficulty to squire ear loved frank with tenderest love must have done so under almost circumstance doubtless that love have be made more palpable to by fact that frank have be good son a regard money not exigeant a be lady arabella selfishly reckless a be nephew lord porlock now frank must be in difficulty about money be first idea what be frank have seldom have anything to say have not be pleasant for to hear then heaviness of visage again gave way for moment a eye fell upon son have be to boxall hill sir tenor of father thought be changed in instant dread of immediate temporary annoyance gave place to true anxiety for son squire have be no party to mary exile from own domain have seen with pain that have now second time be driven from home have never hitherto questioned expediency of separating son from mary thorne ala became too necessary too necessary through own default that frank must marry money at boxall hill frank have that be prudent indeed have be generous to miss thorne who have be driven there a be by imprudence father be well that must understand other about fill glass frank frank mechanically did a be told passed bottle must never forgive be to deceive keep anything from believe be not in nature to deceive frank fact be sir have made up mind that mary thorne will be wife sooner later be unless of course must utterly refuse hitherto have utterly refused believe may now say that have accepted squire sipped claret at moment said nothing there be quiet manly yet modest determination about son that have hardly noticed before frank have become legally of age legally man when be twenty one nature seems have postponed ceremony till be twenty two nature often doe postpone ceremony even to much later age sometimes altogether forgets to accomplish squire continued to sip claret have to think over matter while before must answer statement so deliberately made by son think may say so continued frank with perhaps unnecessary modesty be so honest that have not intended must have said so honestly be right father in thinking that a regard mary personally must not reject a daughter in law personally said squire glad to have subject presented to in view enabled to speak out oh personally must not object to for love dearly be good girl do believe be good girl in respect have always liked liked to see about house know what must say father be rather more than squire knew marriage be imprudent be more than frank fear be impossible impossible father be not impossible be impossible frank in usual sense what be to live upon what must do with child must not wish to see wife distressed comfortless must not like to see that must not wish to begin life a embarrassed man end a ruined man if be now to marry miss thorne such must fear doubtless be lot frank caught at word now expect to marry immediately know must be imprudent be pledged father certainly can not go back now have told what be advice to father again sat silent still sipping wine there be nothing in son that must be ashamed of nothing that must meet with anger nothing that must not love how must answer fact be that son have more in than father mind spirit be of calibre not to be opposed successfully by mind spirit of squire do know mary history said mr gresham at last history of birth not word of said frank did not know have history doe know at least presume not must know now frank will tell not to turn from not with object though think that to certain extent must have effect mary birth be not such a must become wife be beneficial to child if so father must have known sooner why be brought in here among true frank fault be mine mine mother circumstance brought about year ago when never occurred to that must arise will tell history frank remember though tell a secret secret to be kept from world one be quite at liberty to let doctor know have told indeed will be careful to let know must ever be necessary that must speak together a to engagement squire then told son whole story of mary birth a be known to reader frank sat silent looking very blank also have a have gresham great love for pure blood have said to mother that hated money that hated estate must have be very slow to say even in warmest opposition to that hated roll of family pedigree loved dearly though seldom spoke of a men of good family seldom do speak of be one of possession to have be sufficient man having need not boast of what have show off before world on account value more have regarded mary a cutting duly taken from ullathorne tree not indeed a grafting branch full of flower just separated from parent stalk a being not whit le truly endowed with pure sap of venerable trunk when therefore heard true history sat awhile dismayed be sad story said father yes sad enough said frank rising from chair standing with before leaning on back of poor mary poor mary will have to learn day fear so frank then there be again few moment silence to father be told too late can now have effect on indeed said sighing a spoke still relieving by very sigh must have have effect have learned ever so soon must have told before said father certainly ought to have done so must have be good said frank ah sir tell who be miss dunstable parent what be fellow moffat family be perhaps cruel of frank squire however made answer to question have thought right to tell said leave commentary to yourself need not tell what mother will think what did think of miss dunstable birth said again more bitterly than before sir continued after further pause can make change none at rate now ca make love le even if must have prevented even must do so ca least not in least must do so must not break engagement be now engaged to mary thorne then again repeated question asking for father advice under present circumstance conversation be very long one a long a to disarrange lady arabella plan have determined to take son most stringently to task very evening with object have ensconced in small drawing room have formerly be used for similar purpose by august countess herself here now sat having desired augusta beatrice a well a twin to beg frank to go to a soon a must come out of dining room poor lady there waited till ten o'clock tealess there be not much of bluebeard about squire have succeeded in making understood through household that be not to be interrupted by message from wife during post prandial hour though toper loved so well a period of twelve month will now have to be passed over upshot of long conversation must be told in a few word a possible father found impracticable to talk son out of intended marriage indeed hardly attempted to do so by direct persuasion explained to that be impossible that must marry at once suggested that frank be very young married sir before be one twenty said frank yes repented before be two twenty so did not say squire suggested that mary must have time to ascertain what must be uncle wish ended by inducing frank to promise after taking degree in october must go abroad for month that must not indeed return to greshamsbury till be three twenty may perhaps forget said father to a agreement be made between think that will forget said frank to at same time doe not know when lady arabella at last got hold of son found that time for preaching be utterly gone by told almost with sang froid what plan be when came to understand to understand also what have taken place at boxall hill must not blame squire for what have done also said to herself more confidently than squire have done that frank must quite forget mary before year be out lord buckish said to herself rejoicingly be now with ambassador at paris lord buckish be nephew with frank will meet woman be really beautiful woman of fashion when with lord buckish will soon forget mary thorne not on account did change resolve to follow up to furthest point hostility to thornes be fully enabled now to do so for dr fillgrave be already reinstalled at greshamsbury a medical adviser one other short visit did frank pay to boxall hill one interview have with dr thorne mary told knew of own sad history be answered only by kiss kiss absolutely not in way by to be avoided first only one have ever yet reached lip from then went away doctor told story yes said frank knew before dear mary dearest mary doctor teach to believe that will forget then also went way from went way also from greshamsbury be absent for full period of allotted banishment twelve month namely day chapter xxxi small end of wedge frank gresham be absent from greshamsbury twelve month day day be always added to period of such absence a shown in history of lord bateman other noble hero need not detail circumstance of banishment detail of compact be made one detail of course be that there must be corresponding point to squire found difficulty in bringing son to assent must not be supposed that mary thorne doctor be in way party to privy to agreement by mean agreement be drawn out made signed sealed at greshamsbury be known of nowhere else reader must not imagine that lady arabella be prepared to give up son if only love must remain constant for one year neither did lady arabella consent to such arrangement did squire be settled rather in wise frank must be subjected to torturing process pestered to give promise must in way be bullied about mary be not at present if must go away for year then at end of year matter must again be discussed agreeing to frank took departure be absent a per agreement what be mary fortune immediately after departure must be shortly told then will again join of greshamsbury friend at period about month before frank return when sir louis saw frank gresham standing by mary donkey with arm round mary knee began to fear that there must be something in have intended that very day to throw at mary foot now appeared to inexperienced eye a though somebody else have be at same work before not unnaturally made cross so after having sullenly wished visitor good bye betook to room there drank curacoa alone instead of coming down to dinner did for two three day then taking heart of grace remembered that after have very many advantage over young gresham in first place be baronet must make wife lady in next place frank father be alive like to live whereas own be dead possessed boxall hill in own right rival have house land of own after might not be possible for also to put arm round mary knee knee waist perhaps even neck faint heart never won fair lady at rate must try did try with what result a regard mary need hardly be told certainly did not get nearly so far a putting hand even upon knee before be made to understand that be no go a graphically described to mother tried once again on first time mary be very civil though very determined on second be more determined though le civil then told that if pressed further must drive from mother house there be something then about mary eye fixed composure round mouth authority in face went far to quell did not press again immediately left boxall hill returning to london have more violent recourse to curacoa be not long before doctor heard of be obliged to follow then again occurred frightful scene in poor wretch have to expiate either in terrible delirium more terrible prostration of spirit vile sin father have so early taught then mary returned to uncle home frank be gone therefore must resume place at greshamsbury yes came back to greshamsbury greshamsbury be by mean same place that be formerly almost intercourse be now over between doctor greshamsbury people rarely ever saw squire then only on business not that squire have purposely quarrelled with dr thorne have chosen that must be so since frank have openly proposed for niece frank be now gone lady arabella be in arm against must not be said that kept up intimacy for sake of aiding lover in love one must rightfully accuse of inveigling heir to marry niece mary therefore found utterly separated from beatrice be not even able to learn what beatrice must think did think of engagement a now stood must not even explain to friend that love have be too strong for endeavour to get comfort from friend absolution from sin estrangement be now carried so far that beatrice did not even meet on neutral ground lady arabella made known to miss oriel that daughter must not meet mary thorne even a stranger meet be made known to others also mr yates umbleby dear friend miss gushing to whose charming tea party none of greshamsbury lady went above once in twelvemonth talked through parish of distressing difficulty must have be so happy to have asked dear mary thorne only greshamsbury lady did not approve mary be thus tabooed from society in place in twelvemonth since have be of denizen perhaps most courted in day bevy of greshamsbury young lady have fairly represented greshamsbury young ladyhood if mary thorne be not there now be excluded from such bevy patience did not quarrel with certainly came to see frequently invited to walk invited frequently to parsonage mary be shy of acceding to such invitation at last frankly told friend patience that must not again break bread in greshamsbury in house in be not thought fit to meet other guest who habitually resorted there in truth doctor niece be very sore be of temperament keep soreness to mary walked out by boldly looking at least a though be indifferent to world be indeed hardly treated young lady engagement be generally matter of profoundest secrecy be hardly known of by near friend till marriage be thing settled world knew of mary engagement within month of day on have neglected to expel frank finger from hand have be told openly through country side that have confessed love for young squire now be disagreeable for young lady to walk about under such circumstance especially so when have female friend to keep in countenance more especially so when gentleman be of such importance in neighbourhood a frank be in locality be matter of moment to farmer farmer wife bride frank must marry of bespoken for mary namely money yokel about place have be made to understand that by feminine sleight of hand doctor niece have managed to trap master frank that master frank have be sent out of way so that might if yet possible break through trapping made life rather unpleasant for one day walking solitary in lane met that sturdy farmer to whose daughter have in former day be so serviceable god bless miss mary said always did bid god bless when saw miss mary to say mind out freely thee be quite gude enough for un quite gude enough so thee bebet tho ' f be ten squoires there may perhaps have be something pleasant in heartiness of be not pleasant to have heart affair of hers thus publicly scanned talked over to have known to one have set heart on marrying frank gresham that gresham have set heart on preventing yet must in nowise help girl must have be more staid demure le demonstrative boastful about love have never yet spoken freely out of full heart to one human being oh frank spoken sin have be contained in lady arabella have be very active suited better that must be known far wide that nameless pauper lady arabella only surmised that foe be nameless did not scruple to declare be intriguing to catch heir of greshamsbury none of gresham must meet mary thorne be edict sent about country edict be well understood be bad day for miss thorne have never yet spoken on matter freely out of full heart to one human being not to one not to not to uncle not even to fully freely have told that have passed between frank amounted at rate on part to proposal well dearest what be answer said uncle drawing close to speaking in kindest voice hardly made answer uncle did not reject mary uncle then paused have never known tremble a now trembled if say that ought will added drawing word from herself with difficulty say ought mary nay question must answer must said plaintively then sat for next half hour with head against shoulder nothing more be said about acquiesced in sentence have be pronounced against went on together more lovingly than before doctor be quite a weak a niece nay weaker hesitated fearfully a to what ought to do whether must obey heart dictate of greshamsbury have other doubt than hers nearly set wild when strove to bring mind to decision be now in possession of course a trustee only of title deed of estate more of estate much more belonged to heir under sir roger scatcherd will than to squire be now more than probable that heir must be mary thorne conviction became stronger stronger that human effort must keep sir louis in land of living till be twenty five must therefore wisely honestly in true friendship to squire to frank to niece take step to separate two person who loved other whose marriage must in human probability be so suitable yet must not bring to encourage then idea of looking after dead men shoe be abhorrent to mind especially when man whose death contemplated have be so trusted to a have be sir louis scatcherd must not speak of event even to squire a being possible so kept peace from day to day gave counsel to mary in matter then have own individual annoyance very aggravating annoyance be carriage rather post chaise of dr fillgrave be now frequent in greshamsbury passing constantly in street among lane on high road seemed a though dr fillgrave must never get to patient at big house without showing to beaten rival on way thither on return alone must perhaps not have hurt doctor much did hurt to know dr fillgrave be attending squire for little incipient gout that dear nina be in measles under unloving hand then also old fashioned phaeton of old fashioned old dr century be seen to rumble up to big house became known that lady arabella be not very well not very well when pronounced in low grave voice about lady arabella always meant something serious in case something serious be meant lady arabella be not only ill frightened appeared even to that dr fillgrave hardly knew what be about that be not so sure in opinion so confident in a dr thorne used to be how must be seeing that dr thorne have medically have lady arabella in hand for last ten year if sitting with dignity in hired carriage stepping with authority up big front step must have done anything dr fillgrave might have done much lady arabella be greatly taken with look when first came to be only when by degree perceived that symptom knew so well did not yield to that began to doubt look after while dr fillgrave suggested dr century not that fear anything lady arabella said lying hugely for did fear fear for for dr century have great experience in such matter when interest be so important one can not be too safe so dr century came toddled slowly into ladyship room did not say much left talking to learned brother who certainly be able to do part of business dr century though said very little looked very grave by mean quieted lady arabella mind a saw two putting head together already have misgiving that have done wrong knew that must not be safe without dr thorne at bedside already felt that have exercised most injudicious courage in driving away well doctor said a soon a dr century have toddled downstairs to see squire oh will be right lady arabella right very soon must be careful very careful be glad have have century here very there be nothing to alter little nothing there be few word spoken between dr century squire few a be frightened mr gresham when dr fillgrave came down grand stair servant waited at bottom to ask also to go to squire now there never have be much cordiality between squire dr fillgrave though mr gresham have consented to take preventative pill from hand little man therefore swelled out somewhat more than ordinarily a followed servant dr fillgrave said squire at once beginning conversation lady arabella be fear in danger well hope not in danger mr gresham certainly believe may be justified in expressing hope that be not in danger state be doubt rather serious rather serious a dr century have probably told dr fillgrave made bow to old man who sat quiet in one of dining room arm chair well doctor said squire have not ground on to doubt judgement dr fillgrave bowed with stiffest slightest inclination head must possibly make rather thought that mr gresham have ground for doubting judgement do doctor bowed little very little le stiffly doctor think that something ought to be done doctor time did bowing merely with eye mouth former closed for moment latter pressed then decorously rubbed hand one over other be afraid dr fillgrave that friend thorne be not best friend in world mr gresham may go so far a to say be not well be sorry for perhaps mr gresham need hardly discus there have be circumstance be not going to discus anything dr fillgrave say be sorry for because believe prudence will imperatively require lady arabella to have doctor thorne back again now if must not object to meet mr gresham beg pardon beg pardon indeed must really excuse doctor thorne have in estimation doctor fillgrave mr gresham really must excuse really must indeed anything else must do for lady arabella must be most happy to do after have passed can not meet doctor thorne really can not must not ask to do so mr gresham mr gresham continued doctor did understand from lady arabella that be dr thorne conduct to ladyship have be such so very outrageous may say that of course mr gresham know best did think that lady arabella herself be quite unwilling to see doctor thorne again dr fillgrave looked very big very dignified very exclusive squire did not ask again have warrant for supposing lady arabella must receive dr thorne if did come saw that be useless to attempt to overcome rancour of man so pig headed a little galen now before other proposition be then broached be at last decided that assistance must be sought for from london in person of great sir omicron pie sir omicron came drs fillgrave century be there to meet when assembled in lady arabella room poor woman heart almost sank within a well might at sight if must only reconcile with honour consistency with high de courcy principle to send once more for dr thorne oh frank frank to what misery disobedience brought mother sir omicron lesser provincial light have consultation lesser light went way to barchester silverbridge leaving sir omicron to enjoy hospitality of greshamsbury must have thorne back here mr gresham said sir omicron almost in whisper when be quite alone doctor fillgrave be very good man so be dr century very good be sure thorne have known ladyship so long then on following morning sir omicron also went way then there be scene between squire ladyship lady arabella have given credit for great good generalship when found that squire have be induced to take pill have heard of little end of wedge have most of idea that little end be difficulty pill have be little end of lady arabella wedge up to period have be struggling in vain to make severance between husband enemy that pill must do business well knew how to make most of to have published in greshamsbury that squire have put gouty toe into dr fillgrave hand how to let be known especially at humble house in corner of street fillgrave prescription now ran current through whole establishment dr thorne did hear of did suffer have be true friend to squire thought squire must have stood to more staunchly after said perhaps be a well perhaps will be best must leave place altogether then thought of sir roger will of mary lover then of mary birth of own theoretical doctrine a to pure blood so trouble multiplied saw present daylight through such have be way in lady arabella have got in little end of wedge must have triumphed joyfully have not increased doubt fear a to herself then come in to check triumph destroy joy have not yet confessed to one secret regret for friend have driven away hardly yet acknowledged to herself that did regret be uneasy frightened in low spirit dear said squire sitting down by bedside want to tell what sir omicron said a went away well said ladyship sitting up looking frightened know how may take bell think very good news squire never called wife bell except when wanted to be on particularly good term with well said again be not over anxious to be gracious did not reciprocate familiarity sir omicron say that must have thorne back again upon honour can not agree with now thorne be clever man very clever man nobody denies that then know why did not sir omicron say that to said ladyship sharply disposition in dr thorne favour becoming wonderfully damped by husband advocacy suppose thought better to say to said squire rather curtly must have spoken to said lady arabella who though did not absolutely doubt husband word gave credit for having induced led on sir omicron to uttering of opinion doctor thorne have behaved to in so gross so indecent manner then a understand be absolutely encouraging that girl now bell be quite wrong of course be always be quite wrong quite wrong in mixing up two thing doctor thorne a acquaintance dr thorne a doctor be dreadful to have here even standing in room with how can one talk to one doctor openly confidentially when one look upon a one worst enemy lady arabella softening almost melted into tear dear can not wonder must be anxious for lady arabella gave little snuffle might be taken a not very eloquent expression of thanks for squire solicitude a ironical jeer at want of sincerity therefore have not lost moment in telling what sir omicron said must have thorne back here ' be very word can think over dear remember bell if be to do good time must be lost then squire left room lady arabella remained alone perplexed by many doubt chapter xxxii mr oriel must now shortly a shortly a be in power to do introduce new character to reader mention have be made of rectory of greshamsbury hitherto opportunity have offered for rev caleb oriel to come upon board mr oriel be man of family fortune who having gone to oxford with usual view of such men have become inoculated there with very high church principle have gone into order influenced by feeling of enthusiastic love for priesthood be by mean ascetic such men indeed seldom be be devotee be man well able certainly willing to do work of parish clergyman when became one be efficacious in profession may perhaps be said of without speaking slanderously that original calling a young man be rather to outward visible sign of religion than to inward spiritual grace delighted in lectern credence table in service at dark hour of winter morning when one must attend in high waistcoat narrow white necktie in chanted service intoned prayer in paraphernalia of anglican formality have given such offence to of brother who live in daily fear of scarlet lady many of friend declared that mr oriel must sooner later deliver over body soul to lady there be need to fear for for though sufficiently enthusiastic to get out of bed at five be on winter morning did so at least through first winter at greshamsbury be not made of stuff be necessary for staunch burning self denying convert be not in to change very sleek black coat for capuchin filthy cassock pleasant parsonage for dirty hole in rome be better so for others there be few very few to whom be given to be hus wickliffe luther man gain little by being false hus false luther neighbour gain le certain length in self privation mr oriel did go at rate for time eschewed matrimony imagining that became a priest to do so fasted rigorously on friday neighbour declared that scourged mr oriel be a have be said man of fortune be to say when came of age be master of thirty thousand pound when took into head to go into church friend bought for next presentation to living at greshamsbury year after ordination living falling in mr oriel brought sister to rectory mr oriel soon became popular be dark haired good looking man of polished manner agreeable in society not given to monkish austerity except in matter of friday yet to low church severity of demeanour be thoroughly gentleman good humoured inoffensive sociable have one fault be not marrying man on ground there be feeling against so strong a almost at one time to throw into serious danger be not only that must be sworn against matrimony in individual self whom fate have made so able to sustain weight of wife family what example be setting if other clergyman around must declare against wife family what be to become of country what be to be done in rural district religious observance a regard woman of brigham young be hardly so bad a there be around greshamsbury very many unmarried lady believe there generally be so round most such village from great house did not receive much annoyance beatrice be then only just on verge of being brought out be not perhaps inclined to think very much of young clergyman augusta certainly intended to fly at higher game there be miss athelings daughter of neighbouring clergyman who be ready to go length with in high church matter except a one tremendously papal step of celibacy two miss hesterwells of hesterwell park younger of whom boldly declared purpose of civilising savage mr opie green very pretty widow with very pretty jointure who lived in very pretty house about mile from greshamsbury who declared opinion that mr oriel be quite right in view of clergyman position how must woman situated a be have comfort of clergyman attention if be to be regarded just a other man must now know in light to regard mr oriel must be able without scruple to avail herself of zeal so did avail herself of zeal that without scruple then there be miss gushing young thing miss gushing have great advantage over other competitor for civilisation of mr oriel namely in that be able to attend morning service if mr oriel be to be reached in way be probable that might be reached in way if anything must civilise must do therefore young thing through one long tedious winter tore from warm bed be to be seen not seen heard entering mr oriel church at six o'clock with indefatigable assiduity response be made uttered from under close bonnet out of dark corner in enthusiastically feminine voice through whole winter did miss gushing altogether fail in object when clergyman daily audience consists of one person person be young lady be hardly possible that must not become personally intimate with hardly possible that must not be in measure grateful miss gushing response came from with such fervour begged for ghostly advice with such eager longing to have scruple satisfied that mr oriel have nothing for to give way to certain amount of civilisation by degree came to pas miss gushing must never get final prayer said shawl boa adjusted stow away nice new prayer book with red letter inside cross on back till mr oriel have be into vestry got rid of surplice then met at church porch naturally walked together till mr oriel cruel gateway separated young thing did sometimes think that a parson civilisation progressed might have taken trouble to walk with a far a mr yates umbleby hall door have hope to sustain firm resolve to merit success even though might not attain be not ten thousand pity once said to that none here must avail of inestimable privilege coming have conferred upon oh mr oriel do so wonder at to be so delightful morning service in dark church be so beautiful so touching suppose think be bore getting up so early said mr oriel ah bore said miss gushing in enthusiastic tone of depreciation how insensate must be to give new charm to life quiet one for day make one so much fitter for one daily trial daily trouble doe not mr oriel look upon morning prayer a imperative duty certainly oh certainly most imperative duty so delicious at same time spoke to mr umbleby about said must not leave child dare say not said mr oriel mr umbleby said business kept up so late at night very probably hardly expect attendance of men of business servant might come might mr oriel fear that servant seldom can have time for daily prayer in church oh ah perhaps not then miss gushing began to bethink herself of whom must be composed congregation must be presumed that mr oriel wished to see around on matter did not enlighten then miss gushing took to fasting on friday made futile attempt to induce priest to give comfort of confessional absolution unfortunately zeal of master waxed cool a of pupil waxed hot at last when young thing returned to greshamsbury from autumn excursion have made with mr umbleby to weston super mare found that delicious morning service have died natural death miss gushing did not on account give up game be bound to fight with particular advantage in favour miss oriel though good churchwoman be by mean convert to brother extremist view perhaps gave scanty credit to gushings athelings opie green for sincerity of religion nevertheless brother be staunch friend still hoped to see day when might be induced to think that english parson might get through parish work with assistance of wife better than must do without such feminine encumbrance girl whom selected for bride be not young thing beatrice gresham at last seemed probable to mr oriel nearest friend that be in fair way to be overcome not that have begun to make love to beatrice committed by utterance of opinion a to propriety of clerical marriage daily became looser about peculiar tenet raved le immoderately than heretofore a to atrocity of greshamsbury church pew be observed to take opportunity of conversing alone with beatrice beatrice have always denied imputation have usually be made by mary in happy day with vehement asseveration of anger miss gushing have tittered expressed a supposing that great people daughter might be a barefaced a pleased have happened previous to great greshamsbury feud mr oriel gradually got into way of sauntering up to great house sauntering into drawing room for purpose a be sure thought of talking to lady arabella then of sauntering home again having usually found opportunity for saying few word to beatrice during visit went on through feud up to period of lady arabella illness then one morning about month before date fixed for frank return mr oriel found engaged to miss beatrice gresham from day that miss gushing heard of be not however for

misery have to suffer since frank departure now nearly twelve month ago have not heard word about rather have only heard that be very much in love with lady in london news reached in manner so circuitous from such doubtful source seemed to to savour so strongly of lady arabella precaution that attributed at once to malice blew to wind might not improbably be case that frank be untrue to must not take for granted because be now told so be more than probable that must amuse with one flirting be prevailing sin if did flirt most must of course be made of found to be very desolate to be thus left alone without word of comfort word of love without being able to speak to one of filled heart doubting nay more than doubting being sure that passion must terminate in misery why have not obeyed conscience better instinct in moment when necessity for deciding have come upon why have allowed to understand that be master of heart did not know that there be everything against marriage a proposed have not done wrong very wrong even to think of have not sinned deeply against mr gresham who have ever be so kind to must hope be possible that boy like frank must be true to first love if be true if be ready to go to altar with to morrow ought to allow to degrade by marriage there be truth about london lady frank have taken degree a arranged have then gone abroad for winter doing

well for to inquire chapter xxxiv barouche four arrives at greshamsbury during last twelve month sir louis scatcherd have be very efficacious in bringing trouble turmoil vexation upon greshamsbury now that be too late to take step to save dr thorne found that will left by sir roger be so made a to entail upon duty that must find almost impossible to perform sir louis though father have wished to make still child in eye of law be child knew own right be determined to exact before sir roger have be dead three month doctor found in continual litigation with low barchester attorney who be acting on behalf of doctor own ward if doctor suffered so did squire so did who have hitherto have management of squire affair dr thorne soon perceived that be to be driven into litigation not only with mr finnie barchester attorney with squire while finnie harassed be compelled to harass mr gresham be lawyer though have be able to manage very well between squire sir roger have perhaps given credit for lawyer like ability in so doing be utterly unable to manage between sir louis mr gresham have therefore to employ lawyer on own account seemed probable that whole amount of sir roger legacy to must by degree be expended in manner then squire lawyer have to take up matter did so greatly to detriment of poor mr yates umbleby who be found to have made mess of affair entrusted to mr umbleby account be incorrect mind be anything clear confessed when put to by very sharp gentleman came down from london that be bothered so after while be suspended from duty mr gazebee sharp gentleman from london reigned over diminished rent roll of greshamsbury estate thus everything be going wrong at greshamsbury with one exception of mr oriel love suit miss gushing attributed deposition of mr umbleby to narrowness of victory beatrice have won in carrying off mr oriel for miss gushing be relation of umblebys have be for many year one of family if have only chosen to exert a miss gresham have done must have have mr oriel easily oh too easily have despised such work so said though have despised gresham have not be le irritated therefore mr umbleby have be driven out of house can hardly believe a

long a must have deferred odious work of investigation till thing have seemed resolved on investigating then when be absolutely necessary that mr umbleby must go there be nothing for left to fall into ready hand of messrs gumption gazebee gazebee must not be supposed that messrs gumption gazebee gazebee be in least like ordinary run of attorney wrote letter for six eightpence collected debt filed

thirty eight have really remarkable pair of jet black whisker fully made up for deficiency a to head have also dark eye beaked nose what may be called distinguished mouth be always dressed in fashionable attire fact be that mr mortimer gazebee junior partner in firm gumption gazebee gazebee by mean considered to be made of very disagreeable material mortal call small beer when great firm be applied to to get mr gresham through difficulty when state of affair be made known to at first expressed rather disinclination for work at last moved doubtless by respect for de courcy interest assented mr gazebee junior went down to greshamsbury poor squire passed many sad day after before again felt to be master even of own domain nevertheless when mr mortimer gazebee visited greshamsbury did on more than one two occasion be always received en grand seigneur to lady arabella be by mean unwelcome guest for found able for first time in life to speak confidentially on husband pecuniary affair with man who have management of husband property mr gazebee also be pet with lady de courcy being known to be fashionable man in london quite different sort of person from poor mr umbleby be always received with smile have hundred little way of making agreeable augusta declared to cousin lady amelia after having be acquainted with for few month that must be perfect gentleman only that family have never be anything attorney lady amelia smiled in own peculiarly aristocratic way shrugged shoulder slightly said that mr mortimer gazebee be very good sort of person very poor augusta felt snubbed thinking perhaps of tailor son a there be never appeal against lady amelia said nothing more at moment in favour of mr mortimer gazebee evil mr mortimer gazebee being worst of have sir louis scatcherd brought down on poor squire head there may be who will say that squire have brought on by running into debt so doubtless have be not le true that baronet interference be unnecessary vexatious one might almost say malicious interest must have be quite safe in doctor hand have in fact legal right to meddle doctor squire must prevent mr finnie knew very well what be about if sir louis did not so three went on with own lawyer of distrustful unhappy ill at ease be hard upon doctor for be not in debt have borrowed money there be not much reason to suppose that visit of sir louis to greshamsbury must much improve matter must be presumed that be not coming with amicable view with object rather of looking after own phrase be now constantly in mouth might probably find necessary while looking after own at greshamsbury to say very disagreeable thing to squire doctor therefore hardly expected that visit must go off pleasantly when last saw sir louis now nearly twelve month since be intent on making proposal of marriage to miss thorne intention carried out about two day after frank gresham have done same thing have delayed doing so till have succeeded in purchasing friend jenkins arab pony imagining that present must not go far in weaning mary heart from other lover poor mary be put to trouble of refusing baronet pony very bad time have of while doing so sir louis be man easily angered not very easily pacified mary have to endure good deal of annoyance from other person indeed must have called impertinence sir louis however have to bear rejection a best must after perseverance of three day returned to london in disgust mary have not seen since mr greyson first letter be followed by second second be followed by baronet in person also required to be received en grand seigneur perhaps more imperatively than mr mortimer gazebee came with four poster from barchester station have rattled up to doctor door in way took breath away from greshamsbury why squire for many long year have be contented to come home with pair of horse four be never seen in place except when de courcys came to greshamsbury lady arabella with daughter returned from hard fought metropolitan campaign sir louis however came with four very arrogant looked leaning back in barouche belonging to george dragon wrapped up in fur although be now midsummer up in dicky behind be servant more arrogant if possible than master baronet own man who be object of dr thorne special detestation disgust be little fellow chosen originally on account of light weight on horseback if may be considered merit be only one have out door show dress be little tight frock coat round polished strap be always buckled tightly stiff white choker leather breech top boot hat with cockade stuck on one side of head name be jonah master master friend shortened into joe none however who be very intimate with master be allowed to do so with impunity joe be dr thorne special aversion in anxiety to take possible step to keep sir louis from poisoning have at first attempted to enlist baronet own man in cause joe have promised fairly have betrayed doctor at once have become worst instrument of master dissipation when therefore hat cockade be seen a carriage dashed up to door doctor contentment be by mean increased sir louis be now twenty three year old be great deal too knowing to allow to be kept under doctor thumb have indeed become plan to rebel against guardian in almost everything have at first be decently submissive with view of obtaining increased supply of ready money have be sharp enough to perceive let conduct be what must doctor must keep out of debt that doing so took so large sum that must not hope for further advance in respect sir louis be perhaps more keen witted than dr thorne mary when saw carriage at once ran up to own bedroom doctor who have be with in drawing room went down to meet ward a soon a saw cockade darted almost involuntarily into shop shut door protection however lasted only for moment felt that decency required to meet guest so went forth faced enemy say said joe speaking to janet who stood curtsying at gate with bridget other maid behind say be there chap about place to take thing eh come look sharp here so happened that doctor groom be not on spot other chap doctor have none take thing bridget said coming forward offering hand to baronet sir louis when saw host roused slowly from back of carriage how do doctor said what terrible bad road have here upon word be a cold a winter so saying slowly proceeded to descend sir louis be year older than when last saw in generation year wiser have then be somewhat humble before doctor now be determined to let guardian see that knew how to act baronet that have acquired manner of great man that be not to be put upon have lesson from jenkins in london other friend of same sort be about to profit by doctor showed to room then proceeded to ask after health oh be right enough said sir louis must believe fellow greyson tell want to take salt senna opodeldoc sort of stuff look after bill know eh like rest of wo have not at price then writes to be glad to see able to travel said dr thorne who must not force to tell guest that be glad to see at greshamsbury oh travel yes can travel well enough wish have better sort of trap down in country part be shaken to bit doctor must tell people to send fellow of mine up here with hot water so dismissed doctor went way met joe swaggering in one of passage while janet colleague dragged along between heavy article of baggage janet said go downstairs get sir hot water joe do take hold of master portmanteau joe sulkily did a be bid seems to said turning to girl speaking before doctor be out of hearing seems to dear be rather short handed here lot of work nothing to get be about ticket ai bridget be too demurely modest to make answer upon so short acquaintance so putting end of burden down at strange gentleman door retreated into kitchen sir louis in answer to doctor inquiry have declared to be right appearance be anything right twelve month since life of dissipation rather perhaps life of drinking have not have upon so strong effect that of salt of youth be still left of freshness of young year might still be seen in face be now gone eye be sunken watery cheek be hollow wan mouth be drawn lip dry back be even bent leg be unsteady under so that have be forced to step down from carriage a old man must do ala ala have further chance now of ever being right again mary have secluded herself in bedroom a soon a carriage have driven up to door there remained till dinner time must not shut up altogether must be necessary that must appear at dinner therefore few minute before hour crept out into drawing room a

handkerchief in hand have ring on finger carbuncle stud in shirt smelt a sweet a patchouli must make must hardly do more than shuffle into room seemed almost to drag one of leg behind mary in spite of aversion be shocked distressed when saw however seemed to think perfect be whit abashed by unfavourable reception twelve month since have be paid to suit mary came up shook hand with received with compliment doubt thought must be acceptable upon word miss thorne place seems to agree with one better than be looking charming at boxall hill upon word charming be half strong enough now mary sat down quietly doctor assumed face of unutterable disgust be creature for whom sympathy have be demanded best energy put in requisition on whose behalf be to quarrel with oldest friend lose peace quietness of life exercise function of loving friend be self invited guest whom be bound to foster whom must not turn from door then dinner came mary have to put hand upon arm certainly did not lean upon once twice felt inclined to give support reached dining room however doctor following then sat down janet waiting in room a be usual say doctor said baronet have man better come in help be got nothing to do know must be more cosy must janet will manage pretty well said doctor oh 'd better have joe there be nothing like good servant at table say janet just send fellow in will will do very well without said doctor becoming rather red about cheek bone with slight gleam of determination about eye janet who saw how matter stood made attempt to obey baronet order oh nonsense doctor think be uppish sort of fellow know like to trouble when be near be right just send in will sir louis said doctor be accustomed to none own old woman here in own house if will allow will keep old way will be sorry if be not comfortable baronet said nothing more dinner passed off slowly wearily enough when mary have eaten fruit escaped doctor got into one arm chair baronet into latter began only work of existence of knew anything be good port said very fair port doctor loved port wine thawed little in manner loved not a toper a collector love pet picture liked to talk about think about to praise hear praised to look at turned towards light to count over year have lain in cellar yes said be pretty fair wine be at least when got twenty year ago suppose time have hurt held glass up to window looked

got from muzzle drug at ninety six shilling be great favour though will tell now will send up for couple of dozen to morrow must drink out of house high dry must doctor doctor froze immediately think need trouble said never drink claret at least not here there be enough of old bin left to last little time longer yet sir louis drank two three glass of wine very quickly after other immediately began to tell upon weak stomach before be tipsy became more impudent more disagreeable doctor said when be to see of greshamsbury money be what want to know money be quite safe sir louis interest be paid to day interest yes how do know how long will be paid must like to see principal hundred thousand pound something like be precious large stake to have in one man hand preciously hard up will tell what doctor will look squire up look up yes look up ferret out tell bit of mind will thank to pas bottle d doctor mean to know how thing be going on money be quite safe repeated doctor to mind must not be better invested that be very well d well dare say for squire gresham what do mean sir louis mean why mean that will sell squire up be what mean hallo beg pardon be blessed if have broken water jug come of having water on table oh d be over then getting up to avoid flood have caused nearly fell into doctor arm be tired with journey sir louis perhaps 'd better go to bed well be bit seedy so cursed road of yours shake fellow so doctor rang bell on occasion did request joe might be sent for joe came in though be much steadier than master looked a though also have found bin of have approved sir louis wish to go to bed said doctor have better give arm oh yes in course will said joe standing immoveable about way between door table will just take one more glass of old port eh doctor said sir louis putting out hand clutching decanter be very hard for man to deny guest in own house doctor at moment did not know how to do so sir louis got wine after pouring half of over table come in sir give sir louis arm said doctor angrily so will in course if master tell if please dr thorne joe put hand up to hair in manner have great deal more of impudence than reverence in just want to ax one question where be to sleep now be question doctor be not prepared to answer on spur of moment however well janet mary might have be able to do so sleep said know where be to sleep care ask janet be very well master hold tongue sirrah said sir louis what devil do want of sleep come here then with servant help made way up to bedroom be more heard of night did get tipsy asked mary almost in whisper when uncle joined in drawing room talk of said poor wretch poor wretch let have tea now molly pray talk more about to night then mary did make tea did not talk more about sir louis night what on earth be to do with have come there invited connexion with doctor be such that be impossible must be told to go away either that servant of there be reason to disbelieve when declared that have come down to ferret out squire such be doubtless intention must ferret out squire perhaps might ferret out lady arabella also frank must be home in few day too might be ferreted out matter took very singular turn one quite unexpected on doctor part on morning following little dinner of have spoken one of greshamsbury groom rode up to doctor door with two note one be addressed to doctor in squire well known large handwriting other be for sir louis contained invitation to dinner for following day to doctor be in wise dear doctor do come dine here to morrow bring sir louis scatcherd with if be man take to be wo refuse lady arabella sends note for sir louis there will be nobody here oriel mr gazebee who be staying in house yours ever f n gresham greshamsbury july p make positive request that will come think will hardly refuse doctor read twice before must believe then ordered janet to take other note up to sir louis a invitation be rather in opposition to then existing greshamsbury tactic cause of lady arabella special civility must be explained mr mortimer gazebee be now at house therefore must be presumed that thing be not allowed to go on after old fashion mr gazebee be acute a well a fashionable man one who knew what be about who moreover have determined to give very best effort on behalf of greshamsbury property energy in respect will explain hereafter be not probable that arrival in village of such person a sir louis scatcherd must escape attention have heard of before dinner before evening be over have discussed with lady arabella ladyship be not at first inclined to make much of sir louis expressed a little inclined to agree with mr gazebee when gentleman suggested that must be treated with civility at greshamsbury be at last talked over found pleasant enough to have more to do with secret management of estate than mr gresham when mr gazebee proved to by sundry nod wink subtle allusion to own infinite good sense that be necessary to catch obscene bird have come to prey upon estate by throwing little salt upon tail also nodded winked directed augusta to prepare salt according to order wo be odd mr gazebee asking out of dr thorne house oh must have doctor too lady arabella by mean ask doctor also lady arabella brow grew dark mr gazebee said can hardly believe how man have behaved to be altogether beneath anger said mr gazebee with bow know in one way may be not in really think can sit down to table with doctor thorne nevertheless mr gazebee gained point be now about week since sir omicron pie have be at greshamsbury squire have almost daily spoken to wife a to learned man advice lady arabella always answered in same tone can hardly know mr gresham how man have insulted nevertheless physician advice have not be disbelieved tallied too well with own inward conviction be anxious enough to have doctor thorne back at bedside if must only get there without damage to pride husband thought might probably send doctor there without absolute permission from herself in case must have be able to scold show that be offended at same time profit by what have be done mr gresham never thought of taking so violent step a therefore dr fillgrave still came ladyship finesse be wasted in vain mr gazebee proposition opened door by point might be gained well said at last with infinite self denial if think be for mr gresham advantage if chooses to ask dr thorne will not refuse to receive mr gazebee next task be to discus matter with squire be easy for mr gazebee be favourite with mr gresham task be at last performed successfully mr gresham be so glad at heart to find able once more to ask old friend to own house though must have pleased better that sign of relenting on wife part must have reached by other mean did not refuse to take advantage of so wrote above letter to dr thorne doctor a have said read twice at once resolved stoutly that must not go oh do do go said mary well knew how wretched feud have made uncle pray pray go indeed will not said there be thing man must bear must not must go said mary who have taken note from uncle hand read can not refuse when asks like that will greatly grieve must refuse also be angry uncle very angry with lady arabella for for squire must go to on knee if asked in way yes have asked also must have gone oh now will be so wretched be invitation not hers mr gresham must not ask a for think of do do go when asks like will make so miserable if then sir louis can not go without mary pointed upstairs may be sure that will go yes make beast of colloquy be cut short by message praying doctor to go up to sir louis room young man be sitting in dressing gown drinking cup of coffee at toilet table while joe be preparing razor hot water doctor nose immediately told that there be more in coffee cup than have come out of own kitchen must not let offence pas unnoticed be taking brandy morning sir louis just little chasse cafe said not exactly understanding word used be go now capital thing for stomach be not capital thing for stomach about least capital thing can take be if wish to live never mind about now doctor look here be what call civil thing eh showed greshamsbury note not what have object of course understand lot of girl there eh doctor took note read be civil said very civil well will go of course bear malice because ca pay money owes will eat dinner look at girl have invite too doctor yes have will go think not that need not deter sir louis well eh what be step downstairs moment said doctor turning to servant wait till be called for wish to speak to master joe for moment looked up at baronet face a though wanted slightest encouragement to disobey doctor order not seeing slowly retired placed of course at keyhole then doctor began long very useless lecture first object of be to induce ward not to get drunk at greshamsbury having got so far went on did succeed in frightening unhappy guest sir louis did not posse iron nerve of father nerve even brandy have not be able to subdue doctor spoke strongly very strongly spoke of quick almost immediate death in case of further excess spoke to of certainty there must be that must not live to dispose of own property if must not refrain thus did frighten sir louis father have never be able to frighten there be men who though fear death hugely fear present suffering more who indeed will not bear moment of pain if there be mode of escape sir louis be such have strength of nerve courage ability to make resolution keep promised doctor that must refrain a did so swallowed down cup of coffee brandy in two article bore about equal proportion doctor did at last make up mind to go whichever way determined found that be not contented with did not like to trust sir louis by did not like to show that be angry still le did like idea of breaking bread in lady arabella house till amends have be made to mary heart must not allow to refuse petition contained in squire postscript matter ended in accepting invitation visit of ward be in way pernicious to doctor must not go about business fearing to leave man alone with mary on afternoon of second day escaped to parsonage for hour so then walked away among lane calling on of old friend among farmer wife even then doctor be afraid to leave sir louis what must such man do left alone in village like greshamsbury so stayed at home two together went over account baronet be particular about account said good deal a to having finnie over to greshamsbury to however dr thorne positively refused consent evening passed off better than preceding one at least early part of sir louis did not get tipsy came up to tea mary who did not feel so keenly on subject a uncle almost wished that have done so at ten o'clock went to bed after new trouble came on doctor have gone downstairs into study to make up of time have lost have just seated at desk when janet without announcing burst into room bridget dissolved in hysterical tear with apron to eye appeared behind

at hearing achievement of hers thus spoken of bridget sobbed more hysterically than ever doctor looking at arm a held apron to face thought in heart that joe must have have so much worst of that there

arabella have not be in london at year be sore subject with said very graciously circumstance have kept at home sir louis only understood one description of circumstance circumstance in idea meant

much approve of getting married know how can help of course mean to miss mary do love really do dr thorne be quite impossible sir louis quite do niece much honour be able to answer for positively that proposition be quite out of question look here now dr thorne anything in way of settlement will not hear word on subject be very welcome to use of house a long a may suit to remain here must insist that niece will not be troubled on matter do mean to say be in love with young gresham be too much for doctor patience sir louis said can forgive much for father sake can also forgive something on score of own ill health ought to know ought by time to have learnt that there be thing man can not forgive will not talk to about niece remember also will not have troubled by so saying doctor left on next day baronet be sufficiently recovered to be able to resume braggadocio air swore at janet insisted on being served by own man demanded in loud voice in vain that liqueur case must be restored to desired that post horse might be ready for on morrow on day got up ate dinner in bedroom on next morning countermanded horse informing doctor that did so because have little bit of business to transact with squire gresham before left place with difficulty doctor made understand that squire must not see on business be at last decided that mr gazebee must be invited to call on at doctor house mr gazebee agreed to do in order to prevent annoyance of having baronet up at greshamsbury on day evening before mr gazebee visit sir louis condescended to come down to dinner dined however tete tete with doctor mary be not there be anything said a to absence sir louis scatcherd never set eye upon again bore very arrogantly on evening having resumed air must be dignity thought belonged to a man of rank property in period of low spirit be abject humble enough abject fearful of lamentable destiny at moment believed to be in store for be one of peculiar symptom of state that a partially recovered bodily health tone of mind recovered also fear for time be relieved there be very little said between doctor evening doctor sat guarding wine thinking when must have house to again sir louis sat moody now then uttering impertinence a to gresham greshamsbury property at early hour allowed joe to put to bed horse be ordered on next day for three at two mr gazebee came to house have never be there before have ever met dr thorne except at squire dinner on occasion asked only for baronet ah ah be glad be come mr gazebee very glad said sir louis acting part of rich great man with power have want

among lawyer lawyer be very well dare say when man have so large stake at interest a have in greshamsbury property why see mr gazebee feel little inclined to look after now do know mr gazebee how much be that mr gresham owes mr gazebee of course did know very well be not going to discus subject with sir louis if must help claim father estate may have on of mr gresham be a far a understand vested in dr thorne hand a trustee be inclined to believe that have not yourself at present claim on greshamsbury interest a becomes due be paid to dr thorne if may be allowed to make suggestion must say that will not be expedient to make change in arrangement till property will come into own hand differ from entirely mr gazebee in toto a used to say at eton what mean to say be ca go to law with mr gresham be not so sure of perhaps not can compel dr thorne to look after interest can force to foreclose to tell truth gazebee unless arrangement be proposed to will think advantageous will do so at once there be near hundred thousand pound owing to yes to thorne be only name in matter money be money by mean to look after have doubt sir louis a to money being secure yes have be so easy to have hundred thousand pound secured squire be poor man choose to allow poor man to owe such sum a besides mean to invest in land tell fairly therefore will foreclose mr gazebee using perspicuity professional education have left to tried to make sir louis understand that have power to do anything of kind power mr gresham will see whether have power when man have hundred thousand pound owing to ought to have power a take have will see perhaps know finnie do mr gazebee with good deal of scorn in face said that have not that pleasure mr finnie be not in line well will know then will find be sharp enough be unless have offer made to that may choose to accept mr gazebee declared that be not instructed to make offer so took leave on afternoon sir louis went off to boxall hill transferring miserable task of superintending self destruction from shoulder of doctor to of mother of lady scatcherd baronet took account in proposed sojourn in country did take much of doctor in leaving greshamsbury again wrapped in fur with tottering step climbed up into barouche be to carry away be man up behind said to janet while doctor be standing at little front garden gate making adieu sir be not up yet said janet respectfully then send out will ca lose time waiting here day will come over to boxall hill see said doctor whose heart softened towards man in spite of brutality a hour of departure came will be happy to see if like to come of course be in way of visiting that sort of thing a for doctoring if want will send for fillgrave such be last word a carriage with rush went off from door doctor a re entered house must not avoid smiling for thought of dr fillgrave last patient at boxall hill be question to said to whether dr fillgrave will ever be induced to make visit to house even with object of rescuing baronet out of hand be gone be uncle said mary coming out of room yes dear be gone poor fellow may be poor fellow uncle be very disagreeable inmate in house have not have dinner two day have have what can be called cup of tea since be be in house will make up for to night chapter xxxviii de courcy precept de courcy practice there be mode of novel writing used to be much in vogue have now gone out of fashion be nevertheless one be very expressive when in good hand enables author to tell story portion of story with more natural trust than other mean that of familiar letter trust will be excused if attempt a regard one chapter though may be that will break down fall into commonplace narrative even before one chapter be completed correspondent be lady amelia de courcy miss gresham of course give precedence to higher rank first epistle originated with latter named young lady let hope that will explain miss gresham to lady amelia de courcy greshamsbury house june dearest amelia wish to consult on subject a will perceive be of most momentous nature know how much reliance place in judgement knowledge of what be proper therefore write to before speaking to other living person on subject not even to mamma for although judgement be good too have so many care trouble that be natural that must be little warped when interest of child be concerned now that be over feel that may possibly have be so in case of mr moffat be aware that mr mortimer gazebee be now staying here that have be here for nearly two month be engaged in managing poor papa affair mamma who like very much say that be most excellent man of business of course know that be junior partner in very old firm of gumption gazebee gazebee who understand undertake business at except what come to from peer commoner of very highest class soon perceived dearest amelia mr gazebee paid more than ordinary attention immediately became very guarded in manner certainly liked mr gazebee from first manner be quite excellent conduct to mamma be charming a regard must say that there have be nothing in behaviour of even must complain have never attempted slightest familiarity will do justice to say that though have be very attentive have also be very respectful must confess that for last three week have thought that meant something might perhaps have done more to repel might have consulted earlier a to propriety of keeping out of way know amelia how often thing lead to nothing though thought all along mr gazebee be in earnest hardly liked to say anything about even to till be quite certain if have advised know to accept offer if after that have never made must have felt so foolish now have made came to yesterday just before dinner in little drawing room told in most delicate manner in word even must not have approved that highest ambition be to be thought worthy of regard that felt for warmest love most profound admiration deepest respect may say amelia that be only attorney believe that be attorney be sure must have esteemed have heard very delicate way in expressed sentiment something have given presentiment of what be going to do when saw come into room so be on guard tried very hard to show emotion suppose be little flurried a once detected calling mr mortimer name know be mortimer gazebee ought not to have done so certainly be not so bad a if have called mortimer without mr be think there must possibly be prettier christian name than mortimer well amelia allowed to express without interruption once attempted to take hand even be done without assumption of familiarity when saw must not permit drew back fixed eye on ground a though be ashamed even of of course have to give answer though have expected that something of sort must take place have not made up mind on subject must not certainly under circumstance accept without consulting if really disliked of course there must be doubt ca say dearest amelia do absolutely dislike really think that must make other very happy if marriage be suitable a regarded position collected a well a must really do think that must have said that did not behave badly though position be rather trying told that of course be flattered by sentiment though much surprised at hearing that since knew have esteemed valued a acquaintance that looking on a man of business have never expected anything more then endeavoured to explain to be not perhaps privileged a other girl might be to indulge own feeling altogether perhaps be saying too much might make think be in love with from way said think must for be very much guarded in manner very collected then told that in proposal of marriage might be made to must be duty to consult family a much if not more than said of course asked whether might speak to papa tried to make understand that in talking of family did not exactly mean papa even mamma of course be thinking of what be due to name of gresham know very well what papa must say must give consent in minute be so broken hearted by debt to tell truth amelia think mamma must too did not seem quite to comprehend what meant did say that knew be high ambition to marry into family of gresham be sure must confess that have most proper feeling a for expressing man must do better owned that be ambition to ally with family above own rank in life that looked to doing so a mean of advancing now be at rate honest be one of motif said though of course not first then declared how truly attached be to in answer to remarked that have known only very short time perhaps be giving too much encouragement at moment hardly knew what to say for did not wish to hurt feeling then spoke of income have fifteen hundred year from business will be greatly increased when father leaf father be much older than mr gumption though be only second partner mortimer gazebee will be senior partner before very long perhaps that doe alter position little have very nice place down somewhere in surrey have heard mamma say be quite gentleman place be let now will live there when be married have property of own besides can settle so see be quite a well off a mr oriel better indeed if man be in profession believe be considered that doe not much matter what of course clergyman can be bishop then think have heard that one attorney did once become lord chancellor must have carriage know remember saying that especially though can not recollect how brought in told at last be so much taken by surprise must not give answer then be going up to london said on next day might be permitted to address on same subject when returned must not refuse know so now have taken opportunity of absence to write to for advice understand world so very well know so exactly what one ought to do in strange position hope have made intelligible at least a to what have written about have said nothing a to own feeling because wish to think on matter without consulting if must be derogatory to accept mr gazebee certainly must not do so because happen to like if be to act in way must world come to amelia perhaps idea may be overstrained if so will tell when mr oriel proposed for beatrice nobody seemed to make objection seemed to go a matter of course say that family be excellent a far a can learn grandfather be general in india came home very rich mr gazebee grandfather be member of firm so believe be great grandfather think ought to count for something besides have business except with most aristocratic person such a uncle de courcy marquis of kensington gore that sort mention marquis because mr mortimer gazebee be there now know one of gumption be once in parliament think that of oriel ever be name of attorney be certainly very bad be not amelia certainly seem to be same do think that ought to make difference to hear mr mortimer gazebee talk of attorney at barchester must say that there be quite a much difference between a between bishop curate so think there be wish at to speak of own feeling if be not attorney be think sort of man must like be very nice in way if be not told think 'd know be attorney dear amelia will be guided by altogether be certainly much nicer than mr moffat have great deal more to say for of course mr moffat having be in parliament having be taken up by uncle de courcy be in different sphere really felt almost relieved when behaved in way with mortimer gazebee think must be different will wait so impatiently for answer so do pray write at once hear people say that sort of thing be not so much thought of now a be once that manner of marriage be considered to be comme il faut want know to make foolish by being too particular perhaps change be bad rather think be if world change one must change too one ca go against world so do write tell what think suppose that dislike man for really can not say that do must not for anything make alliance for one bearing name of de courcy must have to blush always dearest amelia most affectionate cousin augusta gresham p fear frank be going to be very foolish with mary thorne know be absolutely important that frank must marry money strike a quite possible that mortimer gazebee may be in parliament of day be just man for poor augusta prayed very hard for husband prayed to bosom on subject be a hard a flint prayed in vain augusta gresham be twenty two lady amelia de courcy be thirty four be likely that lady amelia must permit augusta to marry issue having thus be left in hand why must augusta derogate from position by marrying beneath seeing that lady amelia have spent so many more year in world without having found necessary to do so augusta letter be written on two sheet of note paper crossed over lady amelia answer be almost equally formidable lady amelia de courcy to miss augusta gresham courcy castle june dear augusta received letter yesterday morning have put off answering till evening a have wished to give very mature consideration question be one concern not only character happiness for life nothing le than very mature consideration must justify in giving decided opinion on subject in first place may tell have not word to say against mr mortimer gazebee when augusta have read a far a heart sank within rest be leather prunella saw at once that fiat have gone against that wish to become mr mortimer gazebee be not to be indulged have known for long time believe to be very respectable person have doubt good man of business firm of messrs gumption gazebee stand probably quite among first attorney in london know papa have very high opinion of of must be excellent argument to use in favour of mr gazebee a suitor have proposal be made to one in own rank of life in considering matter must think look on in very different light very fact that pronounce to be so much superior to other attorney show in how very low esteem hold profession in general show also dear augusta how well aware be that be class of people among whom must not seek partner for life opinion be that must make mr gazebee understand very courteously of course that can not accept hand observe that confesses that in marrying must seek wife in rank above own be not therefore clear that in marrying must descend to rank below own will be very sorry if grief still will be better that must bear grief of overcoming temporary fancy than take step may so probably make unhappy of friend must certainly regard a disgraceful be not permitted to dear augusta to think of ourselves in such matter a truly say if be to act in way must world come to have be god pleasure that must be born with high blood in vein be great boon value boon have responsibility a well a privilege be established by law that royal family will not intermarry with subject in case there be law necessity be not le felt must not intermarry with who be probably of lower rank mr mortimer gazebee be after only attorney although speak of great grandfather be man of blood whatsoever must acknowledge that admixture must be looked on by de courcy even by gresham a pollution here augusta got very red felt almost inclined to be angry with cousin beatrice marriage with mr oriel be different though remember be by mean defending that may be good bad have have opportunity of inquiring respecting mr oriel family beatrice moreover have never appeared to to feel what be due to herself in such matter a said marriage with mr oriel be very different clergyman particularly rector vicar of country parish do become privileged above other professional men must explain why must be too long in letter feeling on subject altogether do great credit have doubt that mr gresham if asked must accede to match be just reason why must not be asked must not be right must say anything against father to be impossible for of not to see that through life have thrown away advantage sacrificed family why be now in debt a say why be not holding family seat in parliament even though be daughter can not feel that must not do right to consult on subject a to dear aunt feel sure be in good health left to exercise own judgement must not wish to see married to agent for family estate for dear augusta be real truth mr gazebee often come here in way of business though papa always receives a gentleman be dines at table that be not on same footing in house a ordinary guest friend of family how must like to be received at courcy castle in same way will say perhaps that must still be papa niece so must know how strict in such matter papa be must remember that wife always follows rank of husband papa be accustomed to strict etiquette of court be sure that consideration must induce to receive estate agent in light of nephew indeed be to marry gazebee house to belongs must imagine have to give up management of property even be mr gazebee in parliament see how be probable that must get there must not make difference must remember dearest that never be advocate for moffat match acquiesced in because mamma did so if must have have own way must adhere to old prescriptive principle money position can atone to for low birth world ala be retrograding according to new fangled doctrine of day lady of blood be not disgraced by allying to man of wealth what may be called quasi aristocratic position wish be otherwise so be therefore match with mr moffat be not disgraceful though must not be regarded a altogether satisfactory with mr gazebee matter must be altogether different be man earning bread honestly dare say in humble position say be very respectable doubt so be mr butcher at courcy see augusta to what such argument reduce dare say may be nicer than mr moffat in one way be may have more small talk at command be more clever in little pursuit amusement be valued by ordinary young lady opinion be that must be justified in sacrificing for such amusement have high duty before may be that performance of duty will prohibit from taking part in ordinary arena of feminine world be natural that girl must wish to marry therefore who be weak take first come who have more judgement make sort of selection strongest minded be perhaps who be able to forgo own fancy to refrain from alliance doe not tend to maintenance of high principle of course speak of who have blood in vein need not dilate a to conduct of others hope what have said will convince indeed know that only requires that must have little cousinly talk on matter to be quite in accord must now remain at greshamsbury till mr gazebee will return immediately that doe so seek interview with wait till asks for then tell that when addressed matter have taken so much by surprise that be not at moment able to answer with decision that subject demanded tell that be flattered in saying however must keep collected countenance be very cold in manner that family reason must forbid to avail of offer even did other cause prevent then dear augusta come to here know will be little down hearted after going through struggle will endeavour to inspirit when be together will feel more sensibly value of high position will preserve by rejecting mr gazebee will regret le acutely whatever may lose very affectionate cousin amelia de courcy p be greatly grieved about frank have long feared that must do very silly thing have heard lately that miss mary thorne be not even legitimate niece of dr thorne be daughter of poor creature who be seduced by doctor in barchester know how true may be think brother must be put on guard might do good poor augusta be in truth to be pitied for effort be made with intention of doing right according to light for mr moffat have never cared straw when therefore lost piece of gilding for have be instructed by mother to sell be impossible to pity mr gazebee must have loved with sort of love be in power to bestow with must have be happy respectable contented have written letter with great care when offer be made to must not bring to throw lady amelia to wind marry man a be out of own head lady amelia have be tyrant of life so strove hard to obtain tyrant permission used little cunning in showing that after mr gazebee be not so very plebeian little cunning be utterly worthless lady amelia mind be too strong to be caught with such chaff augusta must not serve god mammon must either be true to god of cousin idolatry remain single serve mammon of own inclination marry mr gazebee when refolding cousin letter after first perusal did for moment think of rebellion must not be happy at nice place in surrey having a must have carriage even though de courcys must drop have be put to that must not like to be received at courcy castle with scant civility must be considered due to mr mortimer gazebee what if must put up without being received at courcy castle at such idea did float through mind dimly courage failed be so hard to throw off tyrant so much easier to yield when have be in habit of yielding third letter therefore be written be end of correspondence miss augusta gresham to lady amelia de courcy greshamsbury house july dearest amelia did not answer letter before because thought better to delay doing so till mr gazebee have be here came day before yesterday yesterday did a nearly a possible what advised perhaps on whole will be better a say rank have responsibility a well a privilege quite understand what mean about clergyman can talk that over when meet indeed seems to that if one be to be particular about family be sure think ought one ought to be so without exception if mr oriel be parvenu beatrice child wo be well born merely because father be clergyman even though be rector since former letter have heard that mr gazebee great great great grandfather established firm there be many people who be nobody then who be thought to have good blood in vein now say because differ from agree with so fully that at once made up mind to reject man consequently have done so when told must not accept from family consideration asked whether have spoken to papa told that must be no good a have made up own mind think quite understood did not perhaps much matter told to be very cold think that perhaps thought le gracious than before indeed fear that when first spoke may seem to have given too much encouragement however be over now quite over a augusta wrote barely managed to save paper beneath hand from being moistened with tear escaped from eye mind confessing now continued at rate to that did like mr gazebee little think temper disposition must have suited be quite satisfied have done right tried very hard to make change mind be said great many thing a to whether must not put off decision be quite firm must say that behaved very well really do think liked honestly truly of course must not sacrifice family consideration on account yes rank have responsibility a well a privilege will remember that be necessary to do so a otherwise one must be without consolation for what one have to suffer for find one have to suffer amelia know papa must have advised to marry man so dare say mamma must frank beatrice if knew that liked must not be so bad if thought alike about be hard to have responsibility on one own shoulder be not will go over to will comfort always feel stronger on subject at courcy than at greshamsbury will have long talk about then will be happy again purpose going on next friday if will suit dear aunt have told mamma that wanted made objection do write at once dearest amelia for to hear from now will be only comfort yours ever most affectionately obliged augusta gresham p told mamma what said about mary thorne said yes suppose world know now if world did know make difference to frank seemed very angry so see be true though by so doing will somewhat anticipate end of story may be desirable that full tale of mr gazebee love must be told here when mary be breaking heart on death bed in last chapter otherwise accomplishing destiny will hardly find fit opportunity of saying much about mr gazebee aristocratic bride for did succeed at last in obtaining bride in whose vein ran noble ichor of de courcy blood in spite of high doctrine preached so eloquently by lady amelia a augusta have truly said have failed to understand be led to think by manner of receiving first proposal justly so enough that liked must accept be therefore rather perplexed by second interview tried again again begged permission to mention matter to mr gresham augusta be very firm at last retired in disgust augusta went to courcy castle received from cousin that consolation re strengthening so much required four year afterwards long after fate of mary thorne have fallen like thunderbolt on inhabitant of greshamsbury when beatrice be preparing for second baby of twin have accepted lover mr mortimer gazebee went down to courcy castle of course on matter of business doubt dined at table that have word of lady amelia that earl with usual good nature allowed such privilege let hope that never encroached on on occasion mr gazebee stayed long time at castle singular rumour a to cause of prolonged visit became current in little town female scion of present family of courcy have a yet found mate may imagine that eagle find difficult to pair when become scarce in locality know how hard have sometimes be to get comme il faut husband when there have be number of protestant princess on hand such difficulty have doubtless brought about that countess be still surrounded by full bevy of maiden rank have responsibility a well a privilege young lady responsibility seemed to have consisted in rejecting suitor who may have hitherto kneeled to now be told through courcy that one suitor have kneeled not in vain from courcy rumour flew to barchester thence came down to greshamsbury startling inhabitant making one poor heart throb with violence must have be piteous have be known suitor so named be mr mortimer gazebee yes mr mortimer gazebee have now awarded to many other privilege than of dining at table that rode with young lady in park talked to very familiarly before company except lady amelia countess even called mortimer treated quite a one of family at last came letter from countess to dear sister arabella must be given at length that fear to introduce epistle be such easy mode of writing facility be always dangerous in letter be announced with much preliminary ambiguity that mortimer gazebee who have be found to be treasure in way quite paragon of men be about to be taken into de courcy bosom a child of house on day fortnight be destined to lead to altar lady amelia countess then went on to say that dear amelia did not write being so much engaged by coming duty responsibility of doubtless fully realised a well a privilege have begged mother to request that twin must come act a bridesmaid on occasion dear augusta knew be too much occupied in coming event in mr oriel family to be able to attend mr mortimer gazebee be taken into de courcy family did lead lady amelia to altar gresham twin did go there act a bridesmaid be much more to say for human nature augusta did forgive cousin after certain interval went on visit to nice place in surrey have once hoped must be own home must have be very nice place augusta thought have not lady amelia gazebee be so very economical must presume that there be explanation between if so augusta yielded to confessed to be satisfactory have always yielded to cousin loved with sort of love be begotten between fear respect anything be better than quarrelling with cousin amelia mr mortimer gazebee did not altogether make bad bargain never received shilling of dowry that have not expected did want trouble arose from overstrained economy of noble wife must have that a have married poor man mr gazebee however be not poor man behoved to manage house with great care match a have made told in confidence to augusta have responsibility a well a privilege on

need not have scruple with tell will be sister not come here again to greshamsbury why tell that will be living here while be living there at parsonage for year year to come beatrice promised that must go to mary again that must endeavour to talk mother over if mary must consent to come must not yet make herself believe that mary thorne must ever be mistress of greshamsbury be so indispensably necessary that frank must marry money besides what be horrid rumour be now becoming rife a to mary birth rumour more horrid than have yet be heard augusta have said hardly more than truth when spoke of father being broken hearted by debt trouble be becoming almost too many for mr gazebee though doubt be excellent man of business did not seem to lessen mr gazebee indeed be continually pointing out how much owed in what quagmire of difficulty have entangled now to do mr yates umbleby justice have never made disagreeable in manner mr gazebee have be doubtless right when declared that sir louis scatcherd have not power to take step hostile to squire sir louis have also be right when boasted that in spite of father will must cause others to move in matter others did move be moving began to be understood that moiety at least of remaining greshamsbury property must be sold even however must by mean leave squire in undisturbed possession of other moiety thus mr gresham be nearly broken hearted frank have now be at home week father have not a yet spoken to about family trouble have word a yet be said between a to mary thorne have be agreed that frank must go away for twelve month in order that might forget have be away twelvemonth have now returned not having forgotten generally happens that in household one subject of importance occupies at time subject of importance now mostly thought of in greshamsbury household be marriage of beatrice lady arabella have to supply trousseau for daughter squire have to supply money for trousseau mr gazebee have task of obtaining money for squire while be going on mr gresham be not anxious to talk to son about own debt son love there must be time for thing when marriage feast must be over so thought father matter be precipitated by frank also have put off declaration have to make partly from wish to spare squire partly also with view to spare have of cowardice induces to postpone inevitably evil day at time discussion a to beatrice wedding be frequent in house at one of frank have heard mother repeat name of proposed bridesmaid mary name be not among hence have arisen attack on sister lady arabella have have reason for naming list before son overshot mark wished to show how totally mary be forgotten at greshamsbury only inspired with resolve that must not be forgotten accordingly went to sister then subject being full on mind resolved at once to discus with father sir be at leisure for five minute said entering room in squire be accustomed to sit majestically to receive tenant scold dependant in in former happy day have always arranged meet of barsetshire hunt mr gresham be quite at leisure when be not so have be immersed in deepest business of be capable must gladly have put aside at son instance like to have secret from sir said frank for matter of from anybody else anybody else be intended to have reference to mother therefore must rather tell at once what have made up mind to do frank address be very abrupt felt be so be rather red in face manner be fluttered have quite made up mind to break whole affair to father have hardly made up mind a to best mode of doing so good heaven frank what do mean be not going to do anything rash what be mean frank think be rash said frank sit down boy sit down what be that say be going to hing immediately sir said rather abashed a have made up mind about mary thorne quite made up mind think right to tell oh about mary said squire almost relieved then frank in voluble language hardly however have quite under command told father have passed between mary see sir said that be fixed now can not be altered must be altered asked to go away for twelve month have done so have made difference see a to mean of living be quite willing to do anything may be best most prudent be thinking sir of taking farm somewhere near here living on that squire sat quite silent for moment after communication have be made to frank conduct a son have be such that must not find fault with in special matter of love how be possible for to find fault be almost a fond of mary a of daughter though too must have be desirous that son must relieve estate from embarrassment by rich marriage did not at share lady arabella feeling on subject countess de courcy have ever engraved on tablet of mind that world must come to ruin if frank did not marry money ruin there be must be have be brought about by sin of frank do remember about birth frank said at last yes sir everything told knew dr thorne finished story what do think of be pity misfortune might perhaps have be reason why mother must not have have mary in house many year ago can not make difference now frank have not meant to lean so heavily on father did do so story have never be told to lady arabella be not even known to now positively on good authority mr gresham have always known if mary birth be so great stain upon why have brought into house among child be misfortune frank very great misfortune will not do for to ignore birth too much of value of one position depends upon what be mr moffat birth said frank almost with scorn what miss dunstable must have added have not be that father have not be concerned in sin of wedding to oil of lebanon true frank yet what must mean to say be not true must take world a find be to marry rich heiress be birth even a low a of poor mary call poor mary father be not poor wife will have right to take rank in world however be born well poor in way be heiress world must forgive birth on account of wealth world be very complaisant sir must take a find frank only say that such be fact if porlock be to marry daughter of shoeblack without farthing must make mesalliance if daughter of shoeblack have million of money nobody must dream of saying so be stating opinion of own be only giving world opinion give straw for world be mistake boy do care for must be very foolish if did not what mean be that on particular point value love more than world opinion well yes be what mean squire though have be very lucid in definition have got no nearer to object have not even yet ascertained what own object be marriage must be ruinous to greshamsbury yet what be to say against seeing that ruin have be fault not son must let have farm must not sir be thinking of about six seven hundred acre suppose must be managed somehow farm said father abstractedly yes sir must do something for living must make le of mess of than of anything else besides must take such time to be attorney doctor anything of sort do something for living be heir of greshamsbury come to heir only son whereas squire have succeeded at earlier age than frank to unembarrassed income of fourteen thousand pound year reflection be very hard to bear yes dare say must have farm then threw back in chair closing eye then after while rose again walked hurriedly about room frank said at last standing opposite to son wonder what think of think of sir ejaculated frank yes what do think of for having thus ruined wonder whether hate frank jumping up from chair threw arm round father neck hate sir how can speak so cruelly know well that love father trouble about estate for sake care for can be just a happy without let girl have what be left will make own way in world somehow will go to australia yes sir will be best mary will go nobody will care about birth there father never say never think that love squire be too much moved to speak at once so sat down again covered face with hand frank went on pacing room till gradually first idea recovered possession of mind remembrance of father grief faded away may tell mary said at last that consent to marriage will make so happy squire be not prepared to say be pledged to wife to do that must to oppose thought that if anything must consummate family ruin must be marriage can not say that frank can not say that what must live on must be madness must go to australia answered bitterly have just said so oh boy can not do that must not throw old place up altogether there be other one frank have lived here now for so many many year if can not live here longer father for scheme of yours might do so will give up everything to management of estate park land have in hand if will give up fatal scheme for frank be fatal be only twenty three why must be in such hurry to marry married at twenty one sir frank be again severe on father unwittingly yes did said mr gresham see what have come of have waited ten year longer how different must everything have be frank can not consent to marriage will mother be consent ask sir be asking for nothing consent must be sheer madness madness for own frank dear dear boy drive to distraction give up for four year four year yes for four year ask a personal favour a obligation to myself in order that may be saved from ruin mother sister family name old house talk about be marriage to take place must be driven to despair frank found very hard to resist father who now have hold of hand arm be thus half retaining half embracing frank say that will forget for four year say for three year frank must not say so to postpone marriage for four year for three seemed to to be tantamount to giving up mary altogether must not acknowledge that one have right to demand of to do word be pledged sir said pledged pledged to whom to miss thorne will see frank uncle be always reasonable be sure will not wish to bring ruin on old friend at greshamsbury old friend at greshamsbury have done little lately to deserve consideration have be treated shamefully know have not be by sir must say so have already be treated shamefully will not treat falsely well frank can say no more to have destroyed estate must have be yours have right to expect must regard what say frank be greatly distressed have not feeling of animosity against father with reference to property must have done anything to make squire understand short of giving up engagement to mary feeling rather be that a have case against other must cry quits that must forgive father for bad management on condition that be to be forgiven with regard to determined marriage not that put exactly in shape even to must have unravelled own thought must have found that such be web on be based father do regard what say must not have be false have doubled property instead of lessening must not regard what say more must be able to speak in very different tone feel that frank feel more sir say what wish a must have said under other circumstance pray believe idea never occurs to have ground of complaint a regard property never trouble may have let that trouble soon after frank left what more be there must be said between must not be of one accord even yet might not be necessary that must quarrel went out roamed by through ground rather more in meditation than be wont if did marry how be to live talked of profession have meant to do a others do who make way in profession must have thought of that year two ago rather have done more than think of spoke also of farm even must not be have in moment if must must produce living where be capital where skill might have asked also where industry so necessary for trade might set father at defiance if mary be equally headstrong with might marry what then a walked slowly about cutting off daisy with stick met mr oriel going up to house a be now custom to dine there spend evening close to beatrice how envy oriel said what must not give to have position in world a yours thou shalt not covet man house wife said mr oriel perhaps ought to have be added position must have made much difference when man be tempted commandment believe go for much do not frank that be dangerous doctrine one if have position must hardly admit what make so much out of sort own position be generally considered about best world have to give be then let tell that world have very little to give what can do where can turn oriel if there be empty lying humbug in world be theory of high birth pure blood of endeavour to maintain blood indeed if father have be baker must know by time where to look for livelihood a be be told of nothing blood will blood ever get crown then young democrat walked on again in solitude leaving mr oriel in doubt a to exact line of argument have meant to inculcate chapter xl two doctor change patient dr fillgrave still continued visit to greshamsbury for lady arabella have not yet mustered courage necessary for swallowing pride sending once more for dr thorne nothing pleased dr fillgrave more than visit habitually attended grander family richer people then have attended habitually greshamsbury be prize taken from enemy be rock of gibraltar of thought much more than of ordinary hampshire wiltshire have always be within own kingdom be just starting one morning with post horse for greshamsbury when impudent looking groom with crooked nose trotted up to door for joe still have crooked nose doctor care having be inefficacious to remedy evil effect of bridget little tap with rolling pin joe have written credential for master be hardly equal to writing lady scatcherd have declined to put into further personal communication with dr fillgrave have effrontery enough to deliver message be dr fillgrave said joe with one finger just raised to cocked hat yes said dr fillgrave with one foot on step of carriage pausing at sight of so well turned out servant yes be dr fillgrave then be to go to boxall hill immediately before anywhere else boxall hill said doctor with very angry frown yes boxall hill master place master be sir louis scatcherd baronet have heard of suppose dr fillgrave have not mind quite ready for such occasion so withdrew foot from carriage step rubbing hand one over looked at own hall door for inspiration single glance at face be sufficient to show that ordinary thought be being turned over within breast well said joe thinking that master name have not altogether produced magic effect have expected remembering also how submissive greyson have always be who being london doctor must be supposed to be bigger man than provincial fellow do know a how master be dying very like while stand there what be master disease said doctor facing joe slowly still rubbing hand what ail what be matter with oh matter with well to say out at once then do take drop too much at time then have horror what be call delicious beam end something of sort oh ah yes know tell man who be attending attending why do mother be ladyship yes what medical attendant what doctor why there be greyson in london greyson doctor looked a though name so medicinally humble have never before struck tympanum of ear yes greyson then down at what be name of place there be thorne greshamsbury yes greshamsbury thorne did hit off so since that have have one will be at hill in course of morning said dr fillgrave rather may say will be there at once will take in way having thus resolved gave order that post horse must make such detour a must enable to visit boxall hill on road be impossible said to must be twice treated in such manner in same house be not however altogether in comfortable frame of mind a be driven up to hall door must not remember smile of triumph with enemy have regarded in hall must not think how have returned fee le to barchester how little have gained in medical world by rejecting lady scatcherd bank note however also have have triumph since that have smiled scornfully at dr thorne when have seen in greshamsbury street have be able to tell at twenty house through county how lady arabella have at last be obliged to place in hand triumphed again when found really standing by sir louis scatcherd bedside a for lady scatcherd did not even show kept in own little room sending out hannah to ask up stair only just got peep at through door a heard medical creak of shoe a again descended need say little of visit to sir louis mattered nothing now whether be thorne greyson fillgrave dr fillgrave knew that mattered nothing have skill at least for heart enough also to feel that must fain have be relieved from task must fain have left patient in hand even of dr thorne name joe have given to master illness be certainly not false one did find sir louis in horror if father have son whose besetting sin be passion for alcohol let take child to room of drunkard when possessed by horror nothing will cure if not will not disgust reader by attempting to describe poor wretch in misery sunken yet glaring eye emaciated cheek fallen mouth parched sore lip face now dry hot then suddenly clammy with drop of perspiration shaking hand palsied limb worse than fearful mental effort struggle for drink struggle to be often necessary to give way dr fillgrave soon knew what be to be man fate did what might to relieve there in one big best bedroom looking out to north lay sir louis scatcherd dying wretchedly there in other big best bedroom looking out to south have died other baronet about twelvemonth since victim to same sin to have come prosperity of house of scatcherd then dr fillgrave went on to greshamsbury be long day work for horse then triumph of being dragged up avenue compensated for expense labour always put on sweetest smile a came near hall door rubbed hand in most complaisant manner of knew be seldom that saw of family lady arabella then desired to see none other when left in good humour be quite content to take glass of sherry eat lunch by on occasion however servant at once asked to go into dining room there found in presence of frank gresham fact be that lady arabella having at last decided have sent for dr thorne have become necessary that one must be entrusted with duty of informing dr fillgrave that one must be squire frank lady arabella must doubtless have preferred messenger more absolutely friendly to own side of house such messenger there be none must not send mr gazebee to see doctor so of two evil chose least dr fillgrave said frank shaking hand with very cordially a came up mother be so much obliged to for care anxiety on behalf so indeed be doctor shook hand with very warmly little expression of family feeling on behalf be more gratifying a have always thought that male of greshamsbury family be still wedded to pseudo doctor that apothecary who lived in village have be awfully troublesome to coming over way be sure indeed money must not pay for mother feel that must cut up time so much not at mr gresham not at said barchester doctor rising up on toe proudly a spoke person of mother importance know must be happy to go distance to see ah dr fillgrave can not allow mr gresham mention oh yes must said frank who thought that have done enough for civility be now anxious to come to point fact be doctor that be very much obliged for what have done for future mother think can trust to such assistance a can get here in village frank have be particularly instructed to be very careful how mentioned dr thorne name therefore cleverly avoided get what assistance wanted in village what word be that heard mr gresham eh hem perhaps completely yes ala have completely understood what frank have meant that must understand frank desired to be civil have idea of beating unnecessarily about bush on occasion a be by sir omicron advice dr fillgrave see man here nodded head towards doctor house being still anxious not to pronounce hideous name have known mother constitution for so many year oh mr gresham of course if be wished yes dr fillgrave be wished lunch be coming directly frank rang bell nothing thank mr gresham do take glass of sherry nothing at be very much obliged to wo let horse get oat will return at once if please mr gresham doctor did return taking with on occasion fee be offered to experience have at rate taught so much though frank must do for lady arabella must not receive dr thorne on bitterness of interview have to be borne by messenger have be sent for be upstairs with ladyship while rival be receiving conge downstairs have two object to accomplish if might be possible have found that high word with doctor be of avail might be possible that frank must be saved by humiliation on part if humbled before man must consent to acknowledge that niece be not fit bride for heir of greshamsbury doctor entered room where be lying on sofa walking up to with gentle yet not constrained step took seat beside little table just a have always be accustomed to do a though there have be no break in intercourse well doctor see have come back to said with faint smile rather have come back to believe lady arabella be very happy to do so there need be excuse be doubtless right to try what other skill must do hope have not be tried in vain have meant to have be so condescending now be put quite beyond power be not easy to be condescending to doctor have be trying life have never succeeded have have sir omicron pie said so be glad to hear sir omicron be clever man have good name always recommend sir omicron sir omicron return compliment said smiling gracefully for recommends told mr gresham be very foolish to quarrel with best friend so now be friend again be not see how selfish be put out hand to doctor took hand cordially assured that bore ill will that fully understood conduct that have never accused her of selfishness be very well very gracious nevertheless lady arabella felt that doctor kept upper hand in sweet forgiveness whereas have intended to keep upper hand at least for while so that humiliation might be more effective when did come then doctor used surgical lore a well knew how to use there be assured confidence about air seemed to declare that really knew what be doing be very comfortable to patient be wanting in dr fillgrave when have completed examination question have completed little detail made answer certainly be more at ease than have be since doctor have last left go yet for moment said have one word to say to declared that be not least in hurry desired nothing better said than to sit there talk to owe most sincere apology lady arabella sincere apology said becoming little red be going to say anything about mary be going to own that mary frank have be wrong yes indeed ought not to have brought sir louis scatcherd here ought to have known that must have disgraced oh doe not signify said ladyship in tone almost of disappointment have forgotten mr gresham have more inconvenience than have be unfortunate wretched man most unfortunate with immense fortune can never live to posse who will money go to doctor be question for dr thorne be hardly prepared go to repeated oh member of family believe there be plenty of nephew niece yes will be divided go to one probably to one think sir roger have strong idea of leaving in one hand if must happen to be girl thought lady arabella what excellent opportunity must be for frank to marry money now doctor want to say one word to considering very long time that have known other be better must be open with estrangement between dear mary have given so much pain can not do anything to put end to well what can say lady arabella depends so wholly on if depends on will be done at once doctor bowed though must hardly be said to do so stiffly did coldly bow seemed to say certainly if choose to make proper amende can be done think be very unlikely that will do so beatrice be just going to be married know that doctor doctor said that did know will be so pleasant that mary must make one of poor beatrice know what have suffered yes said doctor there have be suffering be sure suffering on side can not wonder that must be so anxious about frank dr thorne only son heir to estate have be so very long in family lady arabella put handkerchief to eye a though fact be in melancholy not to be thought of by mother without soft tear now wish must tell what view be in friendly manner between ourselves wo find unreasonable view lady arabella yes doctor about niece know must have view of sort be of course occurs to that perhaps be in dark together if so little candid speaking between may set right lady arabella career have not hitherto be conspicuous for candour a far a dr thorne have be able to judge of be reason why must not respond to so very becoming invitation on part have objection to little candid speaking at least so declared a to view with regard to mary be merely that must make a happy comfortable a must while remained with that must give blessing for have nothing else to give when left if ever must do so now will be said that doctor be not very candid in not more so perhaps than be lady arabella when one be specially invited to be candid one be naturally set upon one guard who by disposition be most open be apt to become crafty when so admonished when man say to let be candid with other feel instinctively that desire to squeeze without giving drop of water yes about frank said lady arabella about frank said doctor with innocent look ladyship must hardly interpret what mean be can give word that young people intend to do anything rash one word like from will set mind quite at rest then must be so happy together again ah who be to answer for what rash thing young man will do said doctor smiling lady arabella got up from sofa pushed away little table man be false hypocritical cunning nothing must be made of be in conspiracy together to rob of son to make marry without money what must do where must turn for advice counsel have nothing more to say to doctor perceiving that be case took leave little attempt to achieve candour have not succeeded dr thorne have answered lady arabella a have seemed best to on spur of moment be by mean satisfied with a walked away through garden bethought whether must be better for party if must bring to be really candid must not be better for at once to tell squire be future prospect of niece let father agree to marriage not agree to a might think fit then if so if did do must not in fact say there be niece there be girl of whom have be talking for last twelvemonth indifferent to what agony of mind may have occasioned to there be probable heiress may be worth son while to wait little time not cast off till will know whether be heiress if will turn out that be rich let take if not why can desert then a well a now must not bring to put niece into position a be anxious enough that must be frank gresham wife for loved frank gresham be anxious enough also that must give to husband mean of saving property of family frank though might find rich be bound to take while be poor then also doubted whether must be justified in speaking of will at almost hated will for trouble vexation have given constant stress have laid on conscience have spoken of a yet to one thought that be resolved not to do so while sir louis must yet be in land of living on reaching home found note from lady scatcherd informing that dr fillgrave have once more be at boxall hill on occasion have left house without anger know what have said about louis added for to tell truth doctor be afraid to see come again to morrow then will be braver fear that poor boy be in bad way chapter xli doctor thorne wo interfere at period there be a be truce to ordinary little skirmish have be so customary between lady arabella squire thing have so fallen out that of have much spirit for contest moreover on point at present moment be most thought of by of be strangely in unison for of be anxious to prevent threatened marriage of only son must moreover be remembered that lady arabella have carried great point in ousting mr yates umbleby putting management of estate into hand of own partisan then squire have not done le in getting rid of fillgrave reinstating dr thorne in possession of family invalid loss therefore have be equal victory equal there be mutual object must be confessed also that lady arabella taste for grandeur be on decline misfortune be coming too near to to leave much anxiety for gaiety of london season thing be not faring well with when eldest daughter be going to marry man of fortune member of parliament have thought nothing of demanding thousand pound so for extraordinary expense incident to occasion now beatrice be to become wife of parish parson even be thought to be fortunate event have therefore heart for quieter can do better wrote to countess sister father wanted to give at least thousand pound mr gazebee have told confidentially that literally can not be done at present moment ah dear rosina how thing have be managed if one two of girl will come over will take a favour beatrice must think very kind of think of asking amelia amelia be always grandest of de courcy family being almost on equality with nay in respect superior to countess of course be before day of nice place in surrey such so humble being present temper of lady of greshamsbury will not be thought surprising that mr gresham must at last come together in effort to reclaim son at first lady arabella urged upon squire duty of being very peremptory very angry do a other father do in such case make understand that will have allowance to live on understands that well enough said mr gresham threaten to cut off with shilling said ladyship with spirit have shilling to cut off with answered squire bitterly lady arabella soon perceived that line must not do a mr gresham confessed own sin against son have be too great to allow of taking high hand with besides mr gresham be not man who must ever be severe with son whose individual conduct have be so good a frank marriage be in view misfortune to be averted if possible to be averted by possible mean a far a frank be concerned be to be regarded rather a monomania than crime did feel so certain that must have succeeded with miss dunstable said mother almost cry thought impossible at age twelvemonth knocking about world must cure said father never heard of boy being so obstinate about girl said mother be sure did get from de courcys then again talked over in bearing what be to live upon said lady arabella appealing a be to impersonation of reason be what want to tell be to live upon wonder whether de courcy must get into embassy said father doe talk of profession what with girl asked lady arabella with horror alarmed at idea of such appeal being made to noble brother before marries might be broken of way nothing will break said wretched mother nothing nothing for part think that be possessed why be brought here oh dear oh dear why be ever brought into house last question mr gresham did not think necessary to answer that evil have be done must be useless to dispute will tell what will do said will speak to doctor be not slightest use said lady arabella will not assist indeed firmly believe be own doing oh nonsense really be nonsense love very well mr gresham what say be always nonsense know have always told so yet see how thing have turned out knew how must be when be first brought into house assertion be rather stretch on part of lady arabella well be nonsense to say that frank be in love with girl at doctor bidding think know mr gresham mean that what say be dr thorne finding what easy fool frank be think be at easy love certainly be not fool very well have own way will not say word more be struggling to do best be browbeaten on side god know be not in state of health to bear lady arabella bowed head into pocket handkerchief think dear if be to see mary might do good said squire when violence of wife grief have somewhat subsided what go call upon girl yes can send beatrice to give notice know never be unreasonable think that must find so must tell know oh must know very well what to tell mr gresham yes love be sure must nobody better what mean be that if be to do good must be kind in manner mary thorne have spirit that can not break may perhaps lead nobody can drive a scheme originated with husband lady arabella must not of course confess that there be much in nevertheless determined to attempt thinking that if anything must be efficacious for good in present misfortune must be own diplomatic power be therefore at last settled between that must endeavour to talk over doctor that must do same with mary then will speak to frank said lady arabella a yet have never have audacity to open mouth to about mary thorne though believe declares love openly to one else in house will get oriel to speak to said squire think patience might do more good did once think be getting fond of patience be quite unhappy about then ah dear must be almost pleased at now thus be arranged that artillery of greshamsbury be to be brought to bear at once on frank love so a to crush a be by very weight of metal may be imagined that squire must have le scruple in addressing doctor on matter than wife must feel that part of present joint undertaking be le difficult than hers for doctor have ever be friend at heart nevertheless did feel much scruple a with stick in hand walked down to little gate opened out near doctor house feeling be so strong that walked on beyond door to entrance thinking of what be going to do then back again seemed to be fate to be depending always on clemency consideration of dr thorne at moment doctor be imposing only obstacle be offered to sale of great part of estate sir louis through lawyer be pressing doctor to sell lawyer be loudly accusing doctor of delaying to do so have management of property said mr finnie manages in interest of own friend be quite clear will expose by mean said sir louis be d d shame will be exposed of squire be aware when reached doctor house be shown into drawing room found mary there alone have always be habit to kiss forehead when chanced to meet about house at greshamsbury have be younger more childish then even now be child to so kissed a have be wont to do blushed slightly a looked up into face said oh mr gresham be so glad to see here again a looked at must not acknowledge that be natural that frank must love have never before seen that be attractive have never have opinion about have grown up a child under eye a have not have name of being especially pretty child have never thought on subject now saw before woman whose feature be full of spirit animation whose eye sparkled with more than mere brilliancy whose face be full of intelligence whose very smile be eloquent be to be wondered at frank must have learned to love miss thorne wanted one attribute many consider essential to feminine beauty have brilliancy of complexion pearly whiteness vivid carnation indeed did posse dark brilliance of brunette there be speaking earnestness in face expression of mental faculty squire now for first time perceived to be charming then knew how good be knew well what be nature how generous how open how affectionate yet how proud pride be fault even be not fault in eye out of own family there be one whom have loved must love a loved felt acknowledged that man must have better wife yet be there with express object of rescuing son from such marriage be looking very well mary said almost involuntarily be answered smiling be very nice at rate to be complimented uncle never pay compliment of sort in truth be looking well must say to herself over over again from morning to night that frank love for must be must be unfortunate must not lead to happiness nevertheless did make happy have before return made up mind to be forgotten be so sweet to find that have be so far from forgetting girl may scold man in word for rashness in love heart never scold for offence a have not be slighted heart therefore still rose buoyant within breast doctor entered room a squire visit have be expected by have of course not be out of house now suppose must go said mary for know be going to talk about business uncle mr gresham say be looking very well why have not be able to find out be dear good girl said squire a door shut behind dear good girl doctor must not fail to see that eye be filled with tear think be said quietly then sat silent a though be waiting to hear whether other have anything more to say on subject doctor at rate have nothing more to say have come here specially to speak to about said squire about mary yes doctor about frank something must be done arrangement made if not for sake at least for theirs what arrangement squire ah be question take for granted that frank mary have told that have engaged to other frank told so twelve month since have not mary told not exactly that never mind have believe secret from though have said little to think know well what then doctor shook head put up hand have nothing to say proposition to make arrangement to suggest thing be so seemed to say that a far a be concerned there be end of squire sat looking at hardly knowing how to proceed seemed to that fact of young man young lady being in love with other be not thing to be left to arrange particularly seeing rank of life in be placed doctor seemed to be of different opinion dr thorne there be man on god earth who know affair a well a do in knowing mine know be do think possible that must marry other possible yes be possible mean will be prudent well take in way must not be most imprudent at present certainly must be have never spoken to of on subject presume think of thing for present doctor squire be certainly taken aback by coolness of doctor manner after squire be mr gresham of greshamsbury generally acknowledged to be first commoner in barsetshire after frank be heir in process of time must be mr gresham of greshamsbury crippled a estate be there must be something left rank at rate remained a to mary be not even doctor daughter be not only penniless nameless fatherless worse than motherless be incredible that dr thorne with generally exalted idea a to family must speak in cold way a to projected marriage between heir of greshamsbury brother bastard child doctor repeated squire doctor put one leg over other began to rub calf squire said think know that must say that mean like to say because must not wish to pain by alluding to mary birth independently of must live on said squire energetically birth be great thing very great thing think exactly alike about so need have dispute be quite a proud of ullathorne a be of greshamsbury might be if belonged to be be use arguing putting that aside altogether what must live on if be to marry what must do where must go know what lady arabella think of such thing must be possible that must live up at house with besides what life must be for of must live here must that be well for squire looked at doctor for answer still went on rubbing calf mr gresham therefore be constrained to continue expostulation when be dead there will still hope be something something left for poor fellow lady arabella girl must be better off perhaps than now sometimes wish for frank sake that time have come doctor must not now go on rubbing leg be moved to speak declared that of event be one must be furthest from frank heart know son said who love father more dearly than doe do believe said squire do believe yet can not feel be in way squire no be in one way will find happy with son yet proud of proud of wife too hope so think so do indeed must not say so squire will have many happy day yet together when will talk of thing over dining room fire at greshamsbury squire felt kind in doctor that must thus endeavour to comfort must not understand did not inquire on basis golden hope be founded be necessary however to return to subject have come to discus must doctor assist in preventing marriage be now one thing necessary to be kept in view doctor about young people of course can not marry be aware of know exactly well doctor must say thought must feel feel what squire situated a be ought not to marry be quite question have said nothing about to to anybody else truth be squire have never interfered in matter one way other have wish to do so now must not interfere be not mary same to a own child dr thorne hardly knew how to answer be aware that argument about not interfering be in fact absurd mary must not marry without interference have be case that be in danger of making improper marriage of course must interfere meaning be that must not at present moment express opinion must not declare against match might turn out to be in way desirable if spoke in favour of must give reason for doing so under circumstance must have wished to say nothing must that only have be possible a be not possible a must say something answered squire last question by asking what be objection squire objection why what on earth must live on then understand that if difficulty be over must not refuse consent merely because of mary birth be manner in squire have by mean expected to have affair presented to seemed so impossible that sound minded man must take view of case that have not prepared for argument there be objection to son marrying miss thorne fact of having income between did certainly justify in alleging that first difficulty ca be got over doctor know however that must be cause of grief to to see frank marry much beneath station be mean in family must not press to say for know that love mary dearly dear friend be necessary wound sometimes must be opened in order that may be healed what mean be squire be sure need not say to that hope for honest answer be mary thorne heiress have for instance such wealth a miss dunstable that hear of in case must object to match when doctor declared that expected honest answer squire listened with ear question when finished seemed to have bearing on present case come squire speak mind faithfully there be talk once of frank marrying miss dunstable did mean to object to match miss dunstable be legitimate at least presume so oh mr gresham have come to miss dunstable then must have satisfied idea of high birth mr gresham be rather posed regretted at moment allusion to miss dunstable presumed legitimacy soon recovered said must not be willing to admit a have admitted before that undoubted advantage arising from wealth be taken by world a atoning for what otherwise must be mesalliance admit that do acknowledge that a conviction on subject yes squire be going on to explain propriety of opinion doctor uncivilly must not hear then squire will not interfere in matter one way other how on earth can such opinion pray excuse mr gresham mind be now quite made up be very nearly so before will hing to encourage frank will say anything to discourage mary be most singular resolution that man of sense like ever came to ca help squire be resolution what have miss dunstable fortune to do with can not say that have anything in matter will not interfere squire went on for time be to purpose at last left house considerably in dudgeon only conclusion to must come be that dr thorne have thought chance on niece behalf too good to be thrown away have therefore resolved to act in very singular way must not have believed of though barsetshire have told said to a entered great gate went on repeating same word till found in own room no not if barsetshire have told did not however communicate ill result of visit to lady arabella chapter xlii what can give in return in spite of family trouble be happy day for beatrice so seldom happens that young lady on eve of marriage have future husband living near happiness be hers mr oriel made most of be constantly being coaxed down to parsonage by patience in order that might give opinion in private a to domestic arrangement piece of furniture new carpet privacy be always invaded what mr be parishioner did in halcyon day will not ask morning service however have be altogether given up have provided with very excellent curate one grief did weigh heavily on beatrice continually heard mother say thing made feel that must be more than ever impossible that mary must be at wedding yet have promised brother to ask frank have also repeated threat that if mary be not present must absent beatrice did what most girl do in case what must do who be worth anything asked lover advice oh frank ca be in earnest said lover of course will be at wedding know caleb be so changed that one hardly must know ca conceive how much in earnest be how determined resolute then must like to have mary so much if mamma must let come ask lady arabella said caleb well suppose must do know what will say frank will never believe have done best mr oriel comforted with such little whispered consolation a be able to afford then went away on errand to mother be indeed surprised at manner in prayer be received must hardly falter forth petition when have done so lady arabella answered in wise well dear have objection none least be of course if mary be disposed to behave properly oh mamma of course will said beatrice always did always doe hope will love beatrice when say that will be glad to see of course mean under certain condition never disliked mary thorne if must only let frank understand that will not listen to mad proposal must be delighted to see at greshamsbury just a used to be beatrice must say nothing in answer to felt very sure that mary let intention be what might must not undertake to make frank understand anything at anybody bidding will tell will do dear continued lady arabella will call on mary what at dr thorne house yes why not have be at dr thorne house before now lady arabella must not think of last visit thither strong feeling have a came out that must never again enter door be however prepared to do anything on behalf of rebellious son oh yes know mamma will call upon if can possibly manage will ask to make one of party if so can go to afterwards make own arrangement just write note dear say will call to morrow at twelve might fluster if be to go in without notice beatrice did a be bid with presentiment that good must come of note be certainly unnecessary for purpose assigned by lady arabella a mary be not given to be flustered by such occurrence perhaps be a well that be written a enabled to make up mind steadily a to what information must be given what must not be given to coming visitor on next morning at appointed hour lady arabella walked down to doctor house never walked about village without making little disturbance among inhabitant with squire be quite familiar must appear reappear without creating sensation ladyship have not made equally common in men sight therefore when went in at doctor little gate fact be known through greshamsbury in ten minute before have left house mr umbleby miss gushing have quite settled between be exact cause of very singular event doctor when have heard what be going to happen carefully kept out of way mary therefore have pleasure of receiving lady arabella alone nothing must exceed ladyship affability mary thought that perhaps might have savoured le of condescension then on subject mary be probably prejudiced lady arabella smiled simpered asked after doctor cat janet said everything must have be desired by one le unreasonable than mary thorne now mary will tell why have called mary bowed head slightly a much to say that must be glad to receive information that lady arabella must give on subject of course know beatrice be going to be married very shortly mary acknowledged that have heard so much yes think will be in september early in september be coming very soon now poor girl be anxious that must be at wedding mary turned slightly red merely said that somewhat too coldly that be much indebted to beatrice for kindness can assure mary that be very fond of a much so a ever so indeed be of be so know that mr gresham be always friend yes always be be grateful to mr gresham answered mary be well for lady arabella that have temper under command for have spoken mind out there must have be very little chance left for reconciliation between mary yes indeed be think did what little must to make welcome at greshamsbury mary till unpleasant occurrence took place what occurrence lady arabella beatrice be so very anxious on point said ladyship ignoring for moment mary question two have be so much together that feel can not be quite happy if be not near when be being married dear beatrice said mary warmed for moment to expression of genuine feeling came to yesterday begging must waive objection might have to being there have made answer yet what answer do think ought to make mary be astounded at question hesitated in reply what answer ought to make said yes mary what answer do think ought to give wish to ask question a be person most concerned mary considered for while then did give opinion on matter in firm voice think must tell beatrice that a can not at present receive cordially in house will be better that must not be called on to receive at be certainly not sort of answer that lady arabella expected be now somewhat astounded in turn mary said must be delighted to receive cordially if must do so seems can not lady arabella so there must be end of oh know that smiled sweetest smile know want to put end to ill feeling if can depends upon one thing know doe lady arabella yes upon one thing wo be angry if ask question eh mary at least think will be there truth in what hear about being engaged to frank mary made immediate answer to sat quite silent looking lady arabella in face not that have made up mind a to what answer must give exact word failed at moment of course must have heard of such rumour continued lady arabella oh yes have heard of yes have noticed must say very properly when went to boxall hill before with miss oriel to aunt thought behaved extremely well mary felt glow with indignation began to prepare word must be sharp decisive nevertheless people talk frank who be still quite boy mary indignation be not softened by allusion to frank folly seems to have got nonsense in head grieve to say feel in justice bound to do so that in matter have not acted a well a have done now therefore merely ask whether there be truth in report if tell that there be none will be quite contented be altogether true lady arabella be engaged to frank gresham engaged to be married to yes engaged to be married to what be to say do now nothing must be more plain more decided le embarrassed with doubt than mary declaration a made looked visitor full in face blushing indeed for cheek be now suffused a well a forehead boldly a be with defiance tell so to face miss thorne why not did not ask question must have answer with falsehood be engaged to a must put question to what other answer must make truth be that be engaged to decisive abruptness with mary declared own iniquity almost took away ladyship breath have certainly believed that be engaged have hardly hoped that mary must deny have not expected that crime must be acknowledged at rate if acknowledged that confession must be made without show of shame on lady arabella must have worked there be such expression be there slightest hesitation be engaged to frank gresham having so said mary looked visitor full in face then be indeed impossible that must be received at greshamsbury at present quite so no doubt in saying so lady arabella only repeat answer made to first question can now go to greshamsbury only in one light of mr gresham accepted daughter in law be perfectly out of question altogether out of question now for ever will not dispute with about a said before being at beatrice wedding be not to be thought of lady arabella sat for while silent that might meditate if possible calmly a to what line of argument have now better take must be foolish in thought to return home having merely expressed anger have now opportunity of talking to mary might not again occur difficulty be in deciding in what special way must use opportunity must threaten must entreat to do justice must be stated that did actually believe that marriage be impossible did not think that must take place engagement might be ruin of son prospect seeing how have before one imperative one immediate duty that of marrying money having considered a well a hurry must allow determined first to reason then to entreat lastly if necessary to threaten be astonished can not be surprised at miss thorne be astonished at hearing so singular confession made do think confession singular be fact of being engaged to son will pas over for present do let ask do think possible say possible that frank must be married oh certainly quite possible of course know that have not shilling in world have lady arabella will have be to do anything so utterly hostile to father wish property be aware be altogether at mr gresham disposal be aware of nothing about property can say nothing about except that have not be will not be inquired after by in matter if marry frank gresham will not be for property be sorry to make such apparent boast force to do on what then be to live be too old for love in cottage suppose not at too old frank know be betill quite boy impudent hussy forward ill conditioned saucy minx such be epithet rose to lady arabella mind politely suppressed miss thorne subject be of course to very serious very ill adapted for jesting look upon marriage a absolutely impossible know what mean by impossible lady arabella mean in first place that two must not get yourselves married oh yes mr oriel must manage for be parishioner must be bound to do beg pardon believe that under circumstance must be illegal mary smiled said nothing may laugh miss thorne think will find that be right there be still law to prevent such fearful distress a must be brought about by such marriage hope that nothing will do will bring distress on family ah must know that must think of miss thorne think of frank state of father state know enough of be sure to be well aware that frank be not in condition to marry without money think of position mr gresham only son must hold in county think of old name pride have in have lived among enough to understand think of thing then say whether be possible such marriage must take place without family distress of deepest kind think of mr gresham if truly love son must not wish to bring on misery ruin mary now be touched for there be truth in what lady arabella said have power of going back troth be plighted nothing that human being must say must shake from if indeed chose to repent must be thing lady arabella said have nothing to say in favour of engagement except that wish be that reason mary to be not only reason law have given promise will keep promise even to own ruin hope not engagement unless will choose to break off must necessarily be long one time will come what when mr gresham be dead before hope there be probability of because be headstrong who have always have credit for so much sense will hold to mad engagement lady arabella will not hold to anything to doe not wish to be held nothing that can say will move nothing that anybody can say will induce to break promise to word from will do one look will be sufficient let give to understand in way that love for be injurious to that have learnt to think so then will renounce part in engagement a quickly a must wish there be much in promise still not so much a lady arabella wished to get mary knew be obstinate yet reasonable frank thought be obstinate unreasonable might be possible to work on mary reason quite impossible to touch frank irrationality so persevered foolishly miss thorne be mary for still wish to be thought friend will tell truth lady arabella for considerable time past have not thought so then have wronged will go on with what be saying quite acknowledge that be foolish affair acknowledge such thing something very much like have not word in defence not to choose to be put on defence by know who have more right however promise that if frank wish will release from engagement release be for to release be if wish very well at rate give permission to do so will not be more honourable for to begin think not ah must if in position must be first to speak first to suggest that affair between be foolish one must people say must say truth what must say nothing what must think of ah that know be according a may be that will will not act at bidding exactly because know to be high minded because think that having so much to give will not break word to to who have nothing to give in return be therefore that say that first step must be taken by be that noble then mary rose from seat for be no longer possible for to speak what be in to say sitting there leisurely on sofa lady arabella worship of money have not hitherto be so brought forward in conversation a to give unpardonable offence now felt that must no longer restrain indignation to who have nothing to give in return have not given that possessed have not emptied store into lap that heart of hers beating with such genuine life capable of such perfect love throbbing with so grand pride have not given that be not that between more than twenty greshamsburys nobler than pedigree to who have nothing to give indeed to who be so ready to give everything lady arabella said think that understand that be not likely that must if so further talking will be worse than useless have taken account of what will be given between son in sense of word giving have professed to to love a spoke still looked on lady face eyelash for moment screened eye colour be little heightened have acknowledged that also love so be engaged to promise be sacred will not be threatened into breaking if however will wish to change mind can do so will not upbraid will not if can help think harshly of so much may tell if suit will not listen to calculation a to how much how little of may have to give to other be still standing when finished speaking so continued to stand eye be fixed on lady arabella position seemed to say that sufficient word have be spoken that be time that ladyship must go so lady arabella felt gradually also rose slowly tacitly acknowledged that be in presence of spirit superior to own so took leave very well said in tone be intended to be grandiloquent failed grievously will tell that have permission to think second time on matter doubt that will do so mary must not condescend to answer curtsied low a visitor left room so interview be over interview be over mary be alone remained standing a long a heard footstep of frank mother on stair not immediately thinking of what have passed still buoying up with hot indignation a though work with lady arabella be not yet finished when footfall be no longer heard sound of closing door told that be in truth alone sank back in seat covering face with hand burst into bitter tear doctrine about money be horrible to insolent pretence that have caught at frank because of worldly position made ferocious lady arabella have not le spoken much be true did think of position heir of greshamsbury must hold in county of fact that marriage must mar position so vitally did think of old name old gresham pride did think of squire deep distress be true that have lived among long enough to understand thing to know that be not possible that marriage must take place without deep family sorrow then asked whether in consenting to accept frank hand have adequately considered be forced to acknowledge that have not considered have ridiculed lady arabella for saying frank be still boy be not true that offer have be made with boy energy rather than man forethought if so if have be wrong to accede to offer when made must not be doubly wrong to hold to now that saw error be doubtless true that frank must not be first to draw back what must people say of must now calmly ask question have so angered when asked by lady arabella if must not do if nevertheless behoved to break off match by whom be to be done if not by be not lady arabella right throughout right in conclusion though so foully wrong in manner of drawing then did think for one moment of herself who have nothing to give in return such have be lady arabella main accusation against be in fact true that have nothing to give maiden love feminine pride very life spirit being be thing nothing be to be weighed against pound sterling per annum when so weighed be ever to kick beam like feather thing have be nothing to when without reflection governed wholly by impulse of moment have first allowed daring hand to lie for instant in own have thought nothing of thing when other suitor came richer far than frank to love whom be a impossible to a be not to love love have be pure from such thought be conscious that ever must be pure from lady arabella be unable to comprehend therefore be lady arabella so utterly distasteful to frank have once held close to warm breast very soul have thrilled with joy to feel that so loved with joy have hardly dared to acknowledge at moment maidenly effort have be made to push off heart have grown to have acknowledged to be master of spirit bosom lord man whom have be born to worship human being to whom be for to link destiny frank acre have be of account have want of acre god have brought two together that must love other that conviction have satisfied have made duty to herself that must love with very soul now be called upon to wrench asunder from because have nothing to give in return well must wrench asunder a far a such wrenching might be done compatibly with solemn promise might be right that frank must have opportunity offered so that might escape from position without disgrace must endeavour to give opportunity so with one deep sigh arose took pen ink paper sat down again so that wrenching might begin then for moment thought of uncle why have not spoken to of why have not warned who have ever be so good to why have now failed so grievously have told everything have have secret from have never answered word also must have known said to herself piteously also must have known must give nothing in return such accusation however availed not at so sat down slowly wrote letter dearest frank began have at first written dear mr gresham heart revolted against such useless coldness be not going to pretend did not love dearest frank mother have be here talking to about engagement generally agree with about such matter have said thing to day can not acknowledge to be true say that marriage must be distressing to father injurious to family ruinous to yourself if be so how can who love wish for such marriage remember promise have kept must not yield to mother when desired to disclaim engagement do think will be more prudent if will consent to forget have passed between not perhaps to forget may not be possible for to let pas by a though have never be if so if think so dear frank have scruple on account what will be best for must be best for think what reflection must ever be to to have be ruin of one love so well let have one word to say that be released from promise will tell uncle that matter between be over will be painful for at first occasional meeting must take place will distress will wear off will always think well of other why must not be friend doubtless can not be done without inward wound such wound be in god hand can cure know what first feeling will be on reading letter answer in obedience to first feeling think over think of father owe of old name old family of what world expects from mary be forced to put hand to eye to save paper from falling tear a found thus repeating nearly word for word argument have be used by lady arabella think of thing coolly if can at rate without passion then let have one word in answer one word will suffice have to add allow to think that heart will ever reproach can not reproach for doing suggest mary logic in be very false be not aware of will never reproach either in word

sorrow so worn with suffering that own heart be racked to see be over friend said be better so much better so seemed at first hardly to understand still regarding with wan face shook head slowly sadly one might have thought that be twenty year older than when dr thorne last saw drew chair to side sitting by took hand in be better so lady scatcherd better so repeated poor lad doom have be spoken be well for for that must be over be gone now said speaking very low gone now oh doctor to be left alone here alone said few word trying to comfort who can comfort widow bereaved of child who can console

impetuously from chair did so suddenly that doctor hand fell beside before knew that have risen table be covered with implement become so frequent about house when severe illness be inhabitant there there be little box apothecary bottle cup saucer standing separate bowl in mess have be prepared with hope of suiting sick man failing appetite there be small saucepan standing on plate curiously shaped glass utensil left by doctor sundry piece of flannel have be used in rubbing sufferer limb in middle of debris stood one black bottle with head erect unsuited to companionship in be found there

interment must be made very quickly a body be already nearly destroyed by alcohol having done sent back horse to greshamsbury with direction clothes for journey might be sent to notice that must not be home for day again returned to lady scatcherd of course must not think much of immense property be now for short time altogether in own hand resolution be soon made to go at once to london consult best lawyer must find best dozen lawyer must such be necessary a to validity of mary claim must be done before said word to to of gresham family must be done instantly so that suspense might be at end a soon a possible must of course remain with lady scatcherd till funeral must be over when office must be complete must start instantly for london in resolving to tell one a to mary fortune till after have fortified with legal warranty made one exception thought rational that must explain to lady scatcherd who be now heir under husband will be more inclined to do so from feeling that news must probably be gratifying to with view have once twice endeavoured to induce to talk about property have be unwilling to do so seemed to dislike allusion to be not till have incidentally mentioned fact that must have to look for home that be able to fix to subject be on evening before funeral on afternoon of day intended to proceed to london may probably be arranged that may continue to live here said doctor wish at said rather sharply wish to have arrangement made must not be indebted to of for anything oh dear if money must make right must have enough of indebted to whom lady scatcherd who do think will be owner of boxall hill indeed then dr thorne much care unless be wo be friend of mine one will care to make friend of be so easy for old woman like to make new friend well certainly wo belong to wish did with heart even then must not live here have have too many trouble here to wish to see more that will be just a like lady scatcherd will be surprised to hear that place will at

have be so good who love so well believe will be sir roger heiress be so that sir roger intended on deathbed in event of poor louis life being cut short if be so will be ashamed to stay here a guest of mary thorne have not be ashamed to be guest lady scatcherd be now too much interested in general tenor of news have heard to care much about house be to inhabit in future mary thorne heiress of boxall hill mary thorne still living child of poor creature who have so nearly died when be afflicted with early grief well there be consolation there be comfort in there be three people left in world that must love foster child frank gresham mary thorne doctor if money went to mary must of course go to frank for now knew that loved other if went to must not doctor have share also such share a might want must have governed matter must have given to frank now must be a well bestowed yes there be consolation in sat up more than night talking over giving receiving explanation if only council of lawyer must not be adverse be now point of suspense doctor before left bade hold peace say nothing of mary fortune to one till right have be absolutely acknowledged will be nothing not to have said doctor must be very bad to hear be hers then to lose on next morning dr thorne deposited remains of sir louis in vault prepared for family in parish church laid son where few month ago have laid father so title of scatcherd became extinct race of honour have not be long after funeral doctor hurried up to london there will leave chapter xliv saturday evening sunday morning must now go back little describe how frank have be sent off on special business to london household at greshamsbury be at time in doleful state seemed to be pervaded from squire down to scullery maid with feeling thing be not going well men woman in spite of beatrice coming marriage be grim visaged dolorous mr mortimer gazebee rejected though have be still went came talking much to squire much also to ladyship a to ill doings be in course of projection by sir louis frank went about house with clouded brow a though finally resolved to neglect one great duty poor beatrice be robbed of half joy over over again brother asked whether have yet seen mary be obliged a often to answer that have not indeed did not dare to visit friend for be hardly possible that must sympathise with other mary be to say least stubborn in pride beatrice though must forgive friend for loving brother must not forgive obstinacy with mary persisted in course a beatrice thought knew to be wrong then mr gazebee came down from town with intimation that behoved squire to go up that might see certain learned pundit be badgered in own person at various dingy dismal chamber in lincoln inn field temple gray inn lane be invitation exactly of sort good many year ago be given to certain duck will will will will come be killed although mr gazebee urged matter with such eloquence squire remained steady to objection swam obstinately about greshamsbury pond in direction save seemed to lead towards london occurred on very evening of friday have witnessed lady arabella last visit to dr thorne house question of squire necessary journey to great fountain of justice be of course discussed between lady arabella mr gazebee occurred to former full a be of frank iniquity of mary obstinacy that if frank be sent up in lieu of father must separate at least for while if must only get frank away without seeing love might yet so work upon by mean of message mary have sent a to postpone if not break off hateful match be inconceivable that youth of twenty three youth a frank must be obstinately constant to girl possessed of great beauty so argued lady arabella to who have wealth birth fashion to recommend thus be at last settled squire being willing party to agreement that frank must go up be badgered in lieu of father at age be possible to make appear thing desirable if not necessary on account of importance conveyed to sit day after day in chamber of messrs slow bideawhile hear musty law talk finger dusty law parchment squire have made many visit to messrs slow bideawhile knew better frank have not hitherto be there on own bottom thus fell easily into trap mr oriel be also going to london be reason for sending frank mr oriel have business of great importance be quite necessary that must execute before marriage how much of business consisted in going to tailor buying wedding ring purchasing other more costly present for beatrice need not here inquire mr oriel be quite on lady arabella side with reference to mad engagement a frank be now fast friend good might be done in way if caution against can hardly withstand said lady arabella to herself matter be broached to frank on saturday evening settled between same night nothing of course be at moment said about mary lady arabella be too full of subject to let go to london without telling that mary be ready to recede if only must allow to do so about eleven o'clock frank be sitting in own room conning over difficulty of situation thinking of father trouble own position when be roused from reverie by slight tap at door come in said somewhat loudly thought be one of sister who be apt to visit at hour for manner of reason though be usually gentle to be not at present exactly in humour to be disturbed door gently opened saw mother standing hesitating in passage can come in frank said oh yes mother by mean then with surprise marked in countenance prepared seat for such visit a from lady arabella be very unusual so much so that have probably not seen in own room since day when first left school have nothing however to be ashamed of nothing to conceal unless be open letter from miss dunstable have in hand when entered somewhat hurriedly thrust into pocket wanted to say few word to frank before start for london about business frank signified by gesture that be quite ready to listen to be so glad to see father putting matter into hand be younger than be then know why somehow father have never be good man of business everything have gone wrong with oh mother say anything against frank will not wish thing have be unfortunate certainly ah little thought when married mean to complain have excellent child ought to be thankful for frank began to fear that good must be coming when mother spoke in strain will do best can said up in town ca help thinking that mr gazebee might have done a well oh dear by mean in such case principal must show besides be right must know how matter stand who be so much interested in a be poor frank so often feel for when think how property have dwindled pray mind mother why must talk of a matter while father be not yet forty five life so to speak be a good a mine can do very well without want be to be allowed to settle to something mean profession yes something of sort be so slow dear frank who speak french so well must think brother might get in a attache to embassy must suit at said frank well will talk about other time came about something else do hope will hear be brow again grew black for knew that mother be about to say something must be disagreeable for to hear be with mary yesterday well mother be angry with frank ca know that fate of only son must be subject of anxiety to mother ah how singularly altered be lady arabella tone since first have taken upon to discus marriage prospect of son then how autocratic have be a sent away bidding with full command to throw into golden embrace of miss dunstable now how humble a came suppliantly to room craving that might have leave to whisper into ear mother anxious fear frank have laughed at stern behest though have half obeyed be touched to heart by humility drew chair nearer to took by hand disengaging hers parted hair from off forehead kissed brow oh frank said have be so proud of be still so proud of will send to grave if see sink below proper position not that will be fault be sure will not be fault only circumstanced a be must be doubly trebly careful if father have not speak against father frank will not will not not word now frank before go on must say one word further a to lady arabella character will probably be said that be consummate hypocrite at present moment be not hypocritical did love son be anxious very very anxious for be proud of almost admired very obstinacy so vexed to inmost soul grief must be to so great a of seeing sink below what conceived to be position be a genuinely motherly in wishing that must marry money a woman might be in wishing to see son bishop a spartan matron who preferred that offspring must return on shield to hearing that have come back whole in limb tainted in honour when frank spoke of profession instantly thought of what lord de courcy might do for if must not marry money might at rate be attache at embassy profession hard work a doctor a engineer must according to idea degrade cause to sink below proper position to dangle at foreign court to make small talk at evening party of lady ambassadress occasionally perhaps to write demi official note containing demi official tittle tattle must be in proper accordance with high honour of gresham of greshamsbury may not admire direction taken by lady arabella energy on behalf of son that energy be not hypocritical now frank looked wistfully into face a addressed a though half afraid to go on begging that must receive with complaisance found forced to say well mother be with mary yesterday yes yes what then know what feeling be with regard to frank wrong have feeling against none indeed none that be not fit to be wife think fit ah yes how fit think of position frank what mean have of keeping think what be father only son heir to greshamsbury if greshamsbury be ever again more than name be that must redeem of men living be least able to marry girl like mary thorne mother will not sell for what call position who asks ask nobody asks want to marry one did think once let pas be now twenty three in ten year time will still be young man only ask to wait if marry now be marry such girl a mary thorne girl where will find such mean a regard money frank know mean that how be to live where be to go then birth oh frank frank birth hate such pretence what be wo talk about tell word be pledged on account will be induced to break ah be just be just point now frank listen to pray listen to patiently for one minute ask much of frank promised that must listen patiently looked anything patient a said so have seen mary a be certainly duty to do can not be angry with for who said be angry mother well have seen must own that though be not disposed to be courteous to personally said much that marked excellent good sense gist of be that a have made promise nothing must turn from promise permission do think wait moment frank listen to confessed that marriage be one must necessarily bring distress on family that be one must probably be ruinous to that be match must not be approved of did indeed confessed that ' have nothing ' said be own word have nothing to say in favour of engagement except that wish ' be what think of 'his wish be not reason law ' said must have desert such girl a that be not deserting frank must not be deserting must be doing that herself approves of feel impropriety of going on can not draw back because of promise to think that can not do even though wish wish oh mother do believe doe because have sense to feel truth of friend say oh frank will go on knee to if will listen to oh mother mother mother must think twice frank before refuse only request mother ever made why do ask why do come to thus be for own sake oh boy darling boy will lose everything in life because love child with whom have played a child whose fault be that be together a child be now more than child look on already a wife be not wife frank know that ought not to be be only because hold to that consent to be so do mean to say that doe not love lady arabella must probably have said also have dared felt that in doing so must be going too far be useless for to say anything must be utterly contradicted by appeal to mary frank mean to say that love what do mean be that be not becoming in to give up everything not only family for love a that mary acknowledges one be of same opinion ask father need not say that must agree with about everything if must will not say de courcys oh de courcys yes be relation know that lady arabella must not quite drop tone of bitterness be natural to in saying ask sister ask oriel whom esteem so much ask friend harry baker frank sat silent for moment two while mother with look almost of agony gazed into face will ask one at last said oh boy boy one can know own heart will sacrifice to love a also whom say that so love what happiness can give a wife oh frank be that only answer will make mother on knee oh mother mother frank will not let ruin will not let destroy promise at least that will think of what have said think of do think of ah think of in earnest will be absent now in london will have business of estate to manage will have heavy care upon hand think of a man not a boy will see to morrow before go frank grant that trifle at rate think upon without seeing proclaim so weak that can not trust to think over what mother say to without asking leave though be in love be childish with have told a coming from be true word for word if be not must soon learn so think now of what have said of what say when come back from london then can decide to so much frank consented after further parley namely that must proceed to london on following monday morning without again seeing mary in meantime be waiting with sore heart for answer to letter be lying be still to lie for so many hour in safe protection of silverbridge postmistress may seem strange in truth mother eloquence have more effect on frank than of father yet with father have always sympathised mother have be energetic whereas father if not lukewarm have at rate be will ask one frank have said in strong determination of heart yet word be hardly out of mouth before bethought that must talk thing over with harry baker not said to have doubt have doubt hate to have world against mother wish to ask harry baker harry be good fellow will ask with resolve betook to bed following day be sunday after breakfast frank went with family to church a be usual there a usual saw mary in dr thorne pew a looked at must not wonder why have not answered letter be still at silverbridge endeavoured to read in face whether be true a mother have told that be quite ready to give up prayer of of be disturbed a be so often case with prayer of other anxious people there be separate door opening from greshamsbury pew out into greshamsbury ground so that family be not forced into unseemly community with village multitude in going to from prayer for front door of church led out into road have connexion with private path be not unusual with frank father to go round after service to chief entrance so that might speak to neighbour get rid of of exclusiveness be intended for on morning squire did so frank walked home with mother sister so that mary saw more of have said that walked home with mother sister rather followed in path be not inclined to talk much at least not to continued asking question whether must be possible that be wrong in remaining true to promise must be that owed more to father mother what chose to call position than did to mary after church mr gazebee tried to get hold of for there be much still to be said many hint to be given a to how frank must speak more especially a to how must hold tongue among learned pundit in about chancery lane must be very wide awake with messrs slow bideawhile said mr gazebee frank must not hearken to just at moment be going to ride over to harry baker so put mr gazebee off till half hour before dinner else half hour after tea on previous day have received letter from miss dunstable have hitherto read once mother have interrupted a be about to refer to now a father nag be being saddled be still prudent in saving black horse again took out miss dunstable have written in excellent humour be in great distress about oil of lebanon said have be trying to get purchaser for last two year lawyer wo let sell because must be purchaser offer

mind to treat for oil of lebanon will give assistance can in cheating lawyer there be not much about mary in still little be said made again declare that father mother must move from resolution will write to say that may send present when plea will run down to malvern for day will do good to see so resolved rode away to mill hill thinking a went how must put matter to harry baker harry be at home need not describe whole interview have frank be asked beforehand must have declared that on possible subject must have have slightest hesitation in asking harry question communicating to tidings when time came found that did hesitate much did not want to ask friend if must be wise to marry mary thorne wise not be determined to do wished to be quite sure that mother be wrong in saying that world must dissuade from miss dunstable at rate did not do so at last seated on stile at back of mill hill stable while harry stood close before with hand in pocket did get story told be by mean first time harry baker have heard about mary thorne be not therefore so surprised a might have be have affair be new to thus standing there in position have described did mr baker junior give utterance to such wisdom a be in on subject see frank there be two side to question a take fellow be so apt to go wrong because be so fond of one side wo look at other there be doubt about lady arabella be very clever

greshamsbury wo affect father at ah will affect very much if be to marry miss thorne to morrow there must at once be end to hope of saving property do mean to say be to be liar to for such reason a why harry must be a bad a moffat only must be ten time more cowardly a have brother must differ from there altogether mind mean to say anything tell that have made up mind to marry will stick to through thick thin if ask advice why must give be quite different affair to of moffat have lot of tin everything must want there must be reason why must not marry except that be snob of whom sister be well quit be very different if a friend be to put to miss thorne what do think must say must say thought best for exactly because be trump say same there can be doubt about frank boy marriage must be very foolish for very foolish nobody can admire miss thorne more than do ought to be marrying man for next ten year unless get fortune if tell truth if be girl take to be will not accuse of being false will peak for while so will old chap others have have to do before have got over so will such be spoken wisdom of harry baker who can say that be wrong frank sat while on rustle seat paring nail with penknife then looking up thus thanked friend be sure mean well harry be much obliged to dare say be right too somehow doe come home to what be more after what have passed must not tell wish to part from must not do besides have sort of feeling that if heard be to marry one else be sure must blow brain out either own well frank may count on for anything except last proposition so shook hand

slept night in house whether frank must have received coffee from sister fair hand have not mr oriel be there may be doubted however loudly asserted that must not have done so when laid claim to great merit for rising in behalf mr oriel have be specially instigated by lady arabella to use opportunity of joint journey for pointing out to frank iniquity a well a madness of course be pursuing have promised to obey ladyship behest mr oriel be perhaps not enterprising man be certainly not presumptuous one did intend to do a be bid when began with object of leading up to subject of frank

must induce to set right can only plead for mercy if be wrong allotting sir roger vast possession in perpetuity to miss thorne alleging also in excuse that course of narrative absolutely demand that will be ultimately recognised a sir roger undoubted heiress such after not immoderate delay be opinion expressed to dr thorne by law adviser such in fact turned out to be case will leave matter so hoping that very absence of defence may serve to protect from severe attack if under will a described a having be made by sir roger mary must not have be heiress will must have be described wrongly be not quite at once that tidings made absolutely certain to dr thorne mind be able to express such opinion when first met frank in london at time mary letter be in frank pocket frank though real

courcy connexion received be nothing that must be feted by de courcys gresham now that be about to do duty by family in so exemplary manner that must be patted on back now that no longer meditated that vile crime have be so abhorrent to mother soul be only natural be hardly worthy of remark there be to be feted person to be made personage blessed human mortal about to do duty by family of gresham in manner deserved must receive lady arabella warmest caress dear mary be indeed not singular that must be prepared to act so well seeing that in early youth have have advantage of education in greshamsbury nursery not on account be le fitting that virtue must be acknowledged eulogised nay worshipped how party at doctor got broken up be not prepared to say frank know stayed dined there

thing have gone so hard with world have become so rough so ungracious so full of thorn want of mean have become evil so keenly felt in hour that can not be wondered at dream night must be of golden elysium wealth be not coming to true chief sorrow have be for son now that son must be only creditor be a though mountain of marble have be taken from off bosom lady arabella dream flew away at once

over over to altered feeling of moment now must pay for goodness pay must be base word base thought payment must be made if god must so grant in many many year to come store such a be must be emptied into lap be soothing to pride that must not hurt by love that must bring injury to old house dear dear frank murmured a waking dream conquered at last by sleep gave way to of fairy world thought not only of frank dreamed not only of have not done for uncle of hers who have be more loving to than father how be too to be paid paid indeed love can only be paid in own coin know of other legal tender well if home be to be greshamsbury at rate must not be separated from what doctor dreamed of one ever knew why uncle think have be asleep said mary to that evening a moved for moment uneasily on sofa

page at least must be devoted to marriage dress seeing also that have only few page to finish everything list of visitor marriage settlement dress included be in vain that mary endeavoured to repress lady arabella ardour for grand doings after be to be married from doctor house not from greshamsbury be doctor who must have invited guest in matter did not choose to oppose ladyship spirit have all own way what can do said to mary have be contradicting in everything for last two year least can do be to let have own way now in trifle like there be one point on mary must let nobody have own way on

almost say impossible scanty hair on poor man head almost stood on end a thought of outrageous manner in heiress prepared to sacrifice will all be same in end said doctor trying to make thing smooth of course joint object will be to put greshamsbury property together again dear sir then for twenty minute lawyer went on proving that must by mean be same thing nevertheless mary thorne did have own
