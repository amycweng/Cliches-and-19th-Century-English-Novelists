acknowledged that be afraid be so with longing lingering eye with eye turned back oh so sadly to great jar left room porter leading way assured that must find by must not leave till have put on to proper passage journey seemed to be longer now even than before a ascended many stair swore to herself that must not even yet be balked of object must husband want comfort for poor throat comfort be there within reach not have counted stair a went up marked turn well be sure now that must know way that must return to room without fault must go back to salon even though man must encounter again

footstep have gone on creeping noiselessly up to very door of room there stood shading candle in hand till thought that man must have wandered away into farthest corner of endless building then turned once more retraced step there be difficulty now a to way knew stair at head of flight stood listened not sound be to be heard then went on again heart beat high with anxious desire to achieve object at same time with fear what might illustration have be explained so easily at first must now be a difficult of explanation at last be in great public vestibule be now visiting for third time of at

accompanied by porter have not feared darkness now there be something in obscurity made dread to walk length of room up to mustard jar paused listened trembled then thought of glory of thompson hall of genial warmth of british christmas of proud legislator who be first cousin with rush made good distance laid hand upon copious delf looked round there be one there sound be heard not distant creak of shoe not rattle from one of thousand door a paused with fair hand upon top of jar while other held white cloth on medicinal compound be to be placed looked like lady macbeth a listened at duncan

commenced to hurry return still there be difficulty thought of have occurred to before candle occupied one hand so that have other for sustenance of treasure have brought plate saucer from salon must have be well a be be obliged to keep eye intent on right hand to proceed very slowly on return journey be surprised to find what aptitude thing have to slip from grasp still progressed slowly be careful not to miss turning at last be safe at chamber door there be chapter ii mr brown failure with eye still fixed upon burden glanced up at number of door have be determined through not to forget that then turned latch crept in chamber also be dark after gaslight on stair be so much better have put out two candle on dressing table before have left husband a be closing door behind paused must hear that be sleeping be well aware that have be long absent quite long enough for man to fall into slumber who be given way must have be gone thought fully hour there have be no end to turning over of napkin have so well known to be altogether vain paused at centre table of room still looking at mustard now delicately dried from off hand have have idea that must have be so difficult to carry so light so small affair there be nothing have be lost took small instrument from washing stand with handle collected flowing fragment into centre then question occurred to whether a husband be sleeping so sweetly must be well to disturb listened again felt that slight murmur of snore with ear be regaled be altogether free from real malady in throat then occurred to that after fatigue perhaps have only made cross bethought how during whole journey have failed to believe in illness what meal have eaten how thoroughly have be able to enjoy full complement of cigar then that glass of brandy against have raised voice slightly in feminine opposition now be sleeping there like infant with full round perfected almost sonorous working of throat who doe not know that sound almost of two rusty bit of iron scratching against other come from suffering windpipe there be semblance of here why disturb when be so thoroughly enjoying that rest more certainly than anything else must fit for fatigue of morrow journey think that after labor must have left pungent cataplasm on table have crept gently into bed beside have not thought suddenly struck of great injury have be doing if be not really ill to send down there in strange hotel wandering among passage in middle of night subject to contumely of one who might meet on commission if be not sanctified by absolute necessity must be so thoroughly objectionable at moment hardly did believe that have ever really be ill let have cataplasm if not a remedy then a punishment must at rate do harm be with idea of avenging rather than of justifying past labor of night that proceeded at once to quick action leaving candle on table so that might steady right hand with left hurried stealthily to bedside even though be behaving badly to must not cause discomfort by waking roughly must do wife duty to a british matron must must not only put warm mixture on neck must sit carefully by for twenty minute so that might relieve from when proper period must have come for removing counter irritation from throat there must doubtless be little difficulty in in collecting mustard after have served purpose have be at home surrounded by own comfort application must have be made with delicate linen bag through pungency of spice must have penetrated with strength sufficient for purpose circumstance of occasion have not admitted have felt done wonder in achieving so much success a have obtained if there must be anything disagreeable in operation must submit to have asked for mustard for throat mustard must have a thought passed quickly through mind leaning over in dark with eye fixed on mixture lest must slip gently raised flowing beard with left hand with other inverted rapidly steadily very softly fixed handkerchief on throat from bottom of chin to spot at collar bone meeting together form orifice of chest covered whole noble expanse there be barely time for glance never have be more conscious of grand proportion of manly throat sweet feeling of pity came upon causing to determine to relieve suffering in shorter space of fifteen minute have be lying on back with lip apart a held back beard hand nearly covered feature of face made violent effort to free from encounter did not even move arm leg simply emitted snore louder than have come before be aware that be not wont to be so loud that there be generally something more delicate perhaps more querulous in nocturnal voice then present circumstance be exceptional dropped beard very softly there on pillow before lay face of stranger have put mustard plaster on wrong man not priam wakened in dead of night not dido when first learned that neas have fled not othello when learned that desdmona have be chaste not medea when became conscious of slaughtered child must have be more struck with horror than be british matron a stood for moment gazing with awe on stranger bed one vain half completed snatching grasp made at handkerchief then drew back hand if be to touch must not wake at once find standing there in bedroom then how must explain by what word must so quickly make know circumstance of strange occurrence that must accept before have said word might offend for moment stood paralyzed after faint ineffectual movement of arm then stirred head uneasily on pillow opened wider lip twice in rapid succession snored louder than before started back couple of pace with body placed between candle with face averted with hand still resting on foot of bed endeavored to think what duty required of have injured man though have done most unwittingly there must be doubt that have injured if for moment must be brave injury might in truth be little how disastrous might be consequence if be now in cowardice to leave who must tell applied for fifteen twenty minute mustard plaster may be salvation of throat ill at ease if left there throughout night upon neck of strong man ailing nothing only too prone in strength to slumber soundly how sad how painful for aught knew how dangerous might be effect surely be error man with heart in bosom might pardon judging from what little have seen of thought that must have heart in bosom be not duty to wake then quietly to extricate from embarrassment have brought upon in doing what word must use how must wake how must make understand goodness beneficence sense of duty before must have jumped from bed rushed to bell have summoned above below to rescue sir sir move stir scream have put mustard plaster on throat thinking that be husband a yet harm have be done let take off then hold peace forever where be man of such native constancy grace of spirit at first moment of waking with shock must hear word from mouth of unknown woman by bedside at once obey to letter must not surely jump from bed with horrid compound falling about from there must be complete relief unless must keep present attitude without motion picture presented to mind a to probable conduct be so terrible that found unable to incur risk then idea presented to mind know how in moment quick thought will course through subtle brain must find that porter send to explain there must be concealment now must tell story must bid to find necessary aid ala a told that must do so knew well that be only running from danger be duty to encounter once again put out hand a though to return along bed then thrice snorted louder than before moved up knee uneasily beneath clothes a though sharpness of mustard be already working upon skin watched for moment longer then with candle in hand fled poor human nature have be old man even middle aged man must not have left to unmerited suffering a be though completely recognized duty knew what justice goodness demanded of must not do there be still left to plan of sending night porter to be not till be out of room have gently closed door behind that began to bethink how have made mistake with glance of eye looked up then saw number on door remarking to herself with briton natural criticism on thing french that horrid foreigner know how to make figure scudded rather than ran along corridor then down stair along passage so that might not be found in neighborhood must poor man in agony rush rapidly from bed in confusion of first escape hardly ventured to look for own passage did in least know how have lost way when came up stair with mustard in hand at present moment chief object be night porter went on descending till came again to vestibule looking up at clock saw that be now past one be not yet midnight when left husband be not at astonished at lapse of time seemed to a though have passed night among misery oh what night there be yet much to be done must find that porter then return to own suffering husband ah what now must say to if must really be ill how must assauge yet how more than ever necessary be that must leave hotel early in morning that must leave paris by very earliest quickest train must take a fugitive from present danger door of salon be open have courage to go in search of second supply must have lacked strength to carry up stair where now oh where be that man from vestibule made way into hall everything seemed to be deserted through glass must see light in court beyond must not bring to endeavor even to open hall door now be very cold chilled to very bone have be done at christmas during such severity of weather a have never before be experienced by living parisian feeling of great pity for gradually came upon what wrong have done that must be so grievously punished why must be driven to wander about in way till limb be failing then so absolutely important a be that strength must support in morning man must not die even though be left there without aid to rid of cataplasm a best might be absolutely necessary that must disgrace must not even procure mean of disgracing if telling story to night porter must have be disgrace did not find at last resolved to make way back to own room without further quest began to think that have done that must do man be ever killed by mustard plaster on throat discomfort at worst must not be worse than hers have be too probably than of poor husband so went back up stair along passage made way on occasion to door of room without difficulty way be so well known to that must not wonder that have failed before now hand have be empty eye have be at full command looked up there

tossed hurled under clothes how strong knee must have worked up down before potent god of sleep must allow to return to perfect consciousness how finger restrained by reason must have trampled over feverish throat scattering everywhere that unhappy poultice then when must have sat up wide awake still in dark with mind eye saw feeling that fire a from infernal region have fallen upon whence must know not how fiercely wild must be working of spirit ah now knew now felt now acknowledged how bound have be to awaken at moment might have be personal inconvenience to herself in position what must

put on wish have said mr jones putting hand up to neck wish have for sake a well a mine for hers poor woman dont know when will get over shock dont know when will have stopped on journey be to have be to night very night christmas eve with young lady be engaged to marry of course couldnt travel extent of injury done nobody can imagine at present have be just a bad to sir be to have be with family

mistake most unfortunate what more can be said mr jones gave up to reflection for few moment before replied to supposed that be bound to believe story a far a went at rate did not know how must say that did not believe seemed to to be almost incredible especially incredible in regard to personal mistake for except have long beard brown beard mr jones thought that there be point of resemblance between mr brown still even that felt must be accepted then why have be left deserted to undergo torment found out mistake at last suppose said oh yes why didnt wake fellow take off again ah cant have

apology told story must bear trouble inconvenience to have subjected still however have own opinion about conduct generally must not be brought to give sign of amity simply bowed when mr brown be hoping to induce to shake hand sent word of pardon to great offender matter however be so far concluded that there be further question of police interference doubt that lady with husband be to be allowed to leave paris by night train nature of accident probably became known to mr brown be interrogated by many though professed to declare that must answer question nevertheless found better to tell clerk something of truth than to allow matter to be shrouded in mystery be to be feared that mr jones who did not once show through day who employed hour in endeavoring to assuage injury done still lived in conviction that lady have played practical joke on subject of such joke never talk about mr jones must not be induced to speak even by friendly adherence of night porter mr brown also clung to seclusion of own bedroom never once stirring from till time came in be to be taken down to omnibus up stair ate meal up stair passed time in packing unpacking in requesting telegram might be sent repeatedly to thompson hall in course of day two such telegram be sent in latter of thompson family be assured that brown must arrive probably in time for breakfast on christmas day certainly in time for church asked more than once tenderly after mr jones welfare must obtain information be very cross thats know about said brown then made remark a to gentleman christian name appeared on card a

wife down thickly veiled there be many stranger a passed through hall ready to look at lady who have done that wonderful thing in dead of night none must see feature of face a stepped across hall be hurried into omnibus there be many eye also on mr jones who followed very quickly for also in spite of suffering be leaving paris on evening in order that might be with english friend on christmas day a went through crowd assumed air of great dignity to perhaps something be added by endeavor a walked to save poor throat from irritation too got into same omnibus stumbling over foot of enemy in dark at station got ticket one close after other then be brought into others presence in waiting room think must be acknowledged that here mr jones be conscious not only of presence of consciousness of presence that assumed attitude a though must have said now do think possible for to believe that mistook for husband be perfectly quiet sat through quarter of hour with face continually veiled mr brown made little overture of conversation to mr jones mr jones though did mutter reply showed plainly enough that have desire for further intercourse then came accustomed stampede awful rush internecine struggle in seat have to be found seat fancy be regularly found even by most tardy always appears that british father british husband be actuated at stormy moment by conviction unless prof very hercules daughter wife will be left desolate in paris mr brown be quite herculean carrying two bag hatbox in own hand besides cloak coat rug stick umbrella when have got wife well seated with face to engine with corner seat for there be mr jones immediately opposite to mr jones a soon a perceived inconvenience of position made scramble for place be too late in contiguity journey a far a calais have to be made poor woman never once took up veil there sat without closing eye stiff a ramrod sometimes showing by little uneasy gesture that trouble at neck be still there never speaking word hardly moving limb crossing from calais to dover lady be of course separated from victim passage be very bad more than once reminded husband how well must have be with now have pursued journey a have intended a though have be detained in paris by fault mr jones a laid down on back gave up to wondering whether man before have ever be made subject to such absolute injustice now again put hand up to own beard began to doubt whether must have be moved a must have be moved without waking what if chloroform have be used many such suspicion crossed mind during misery of passage be again together in same railway carriage from dover to london have now got used to close neighborhood knew how to endure presence of other a yet mr jones have never seen lady face longed to know what be feature of woman who have be so blind if indeed that story be true if be not true of what like be woman who must dare in middle of night to play trick a still kept veil close over face from cannon street brown took departure in cab for liverpool street station whence must be conveyed by eastern county railway to stratford now at rate trouble be over must be in ample time not only for christmas day church for christmas day breakfast will be just same a getting in there last night said mr brown a walked across platform to place wife in carriage for stratford entered first a did so there saw mr jones seated in corner hitherto have borne presence well now must not restrain from little start little scream bowed head very slightly a though acknowledging compliment then down dropped veil when arrived at stratford journey being over in quarter of hour jones be out of carriage even before brown there be uncle john carriage said mr brown thinking now at rate must be able to free from presence of terrible stranger doubt be handsome man to look at on face so sternly hostile have ever before fixed eye did not perhaps reflect that owner of other face have ever be so deeply injured by chapter v
