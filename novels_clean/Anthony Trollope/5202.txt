that must never become wife in opposition to uncle wish have be in earnest might have said something of readiness to attempt at least to overcome father objection have said not word marie a sat upon

dutifully ' said madame voss 'why come see if care for be of marie be thinking ' 'it be of anybody else then ' said madame voss ' never see speak word to of young men one of ever speaking word to ' pondering over michel voss resolved that must have out with niece on following sunday on sunday engaged marie to start with after dinner to place on hillside where be cutting wood be beautiful autumn afternoon in pleasantest of month in year when sun be not too hot air be fresh balmy one be still able to linger abroad loitering in out of shade when midge cease to bite sun no longer scorch glare sweet vestige of summer remain everything without door be pleasant friendly there be gentle unrecognised regret for departing year unconscious feeling that glory be going from to add inner charm of soft melancholy to outer luxury of atmosphere doubt whether michel voss have ever realised fact that september be kindliest of month felt enjoyed leisure of sunday afternoon when must get niece to take stretch with on mountain side on occasion madame voss be left at home with m le cure who liked to linger over little cup of coffee madame voss indeed seldom cared to walk very far from door of own house on sunday to go to church back again be certainly sufficient exercise michel voss said word about adrian urmand a be ascending hill be too wise for that must not have given effect to experience with sufficient eloquence have attempted task while burden of rising ground be upon lung chest turned into saw mill a went up counted scantling of timber have be cut michel looked at cradle to see that worked well to wheel to see that be in good order observed that channel for water required repair said word a to injury have come to because george have left 'perhaps may come back soon ' said marie to made answer continued path up mountain side 'there will be plenty of feed for cow autumn ' said marie bromar 'that be great comfort ' 'plenty ' said michel 'plenty marie knew from tone of voice that be not thinking about grass so held peace want plenty of pasture be generally subject of greatest interest to people of granpere at special time of year one on michel voss be ever ready to speak marie therefore knew that there be something on uncle mind nevertheless inspected timber be cut made remark about work of men be not so careful in barking log a used to be upon whole thought that wood be of worse quality what be there that find to be deteriorating around when consider thing in detail though be willing enough to admit general improvement ' said in answer to remark from marie must take doubt a god give to need not spoil in handling sit down dear want to speak to for few minute then sat down together on large prostrate pine be being prepared to be sent down to saw mill bey dear ' said ' want to speak to about adrian urmand blushed trembled a placed beside hardly noticed be not quite at ease be little afraid of task have undertaken 'adrian tell that asked to take a lover that refused ' 'yes uncle michel ' why dear how be to do better perhaps aunt must have spoken to first told that thought well of match 'it be that uncle knew thought well of at least believed that did ' 'and what be objection marie ' object to m urmand uncle at least not particularly ' 'but say do object must not accept when offered ' 'no did not accept ' 'but will dear if come

for own welfare know be in earnest know that speak for welfare ' 'well well what then of course be only reasonable that must be married day here be young man in better way of business than man old young come into granpere have house in basle money to put in want for matter of marie niece will not go away from empty handed drew closer to took hold of arm pressed looked up into face ' brought nothing with ' said 'and want to take nothing away 'be that ' said speaking rapidly 'let tell then girl that will have nothing earnings fair earnings take trouble about urmand will settle between will go bail there will be unpleasant word a said before girl sha' leave house empty handed lord bless must only be too happy to take in petticoat just a be never saw fellow more in love with girl come marie need not mind saying word to though must not bring to say to ' ' ca say that word uncle to to ' 'and why devil not said michel voss who be beginning to be tired of being eloquent ' must rather stay at home with aunt ' o bother ' beome girl stay at home always girl get married want to be taken to basle ' be nonsense ' said michel getting up 'if be good girl will do a be told ' 'it must not be good to be married to man if love ' 'but why must love be just man that girl always love why love a michel voss asked last question there be tone of anger in voice have allowed niece considerable liberty now be unreasonable marie who in spite of devotion to uncle be beginning to think that be ill used by tone made reply hope have be falling in love with one else ' continued michel ' said marie in low whisper ' do hope be not still thinking of george who have left without casting thought upon do hope that be not such fool a ' marie sat perfectly silent not moving there be frown on brow look of sorrow mixed with anger on face michel voss did not see face looked straight before a spoke be flinging chip of wood to distance in energy 'if be that marie tell have better get quit of at once can come to good here be excellent husband for be good girl say that will accept ' ' must not be good girl to accept man whom love ' thought about george make say so child ' michel paused moment for answer ' continued with almost angry energy 'be because of george that refuse to young man marie paused again for moment then replied 'no be not ' 'it be not ' 'no uncle 'then why will not marry adrian urmand care for why wo let remain with uncle ' be very close to now leaning against throat be half choked with sob eye be full of tear michel voss be soft hearted man inclined to be very soft of heart where marie bromar be concerned on other hand be thoroughly convinced that must be for niece benefit that must marry young trader thought also that be duty a uncle guardian to be round with make understand that a friend wished a young trader wished be duty to do a be desired uncle guardian in place must hardly have consulted girl at between desire to have own way reduce to obedience temptation to put arm round waist kiss away tear be uneasy vacillating gently put hand within arm pressed very close 'wo let remain with uncle love aunt josey ' madame voss be named josephine be generally called aunt josey 'and child must not go away from child like house be sure be of use in house course be of use in house be not that ' 'why then must want to send away ' 'what nonsense talk marie know that young woman like ought to be married day be if can get fitting man to take must neighbour say of if kept at home to drudge for instead of settling out in world properly forget marie have duty to perform must not make so difficult 'but if want to be settled ' said marie care for neighbour if understand other be not that enough ' care for neighbour said michel voss with energy 'and must marry man care bit for because of neighbour uncle michel ' asked marie with something approaching to indignation in voice michel voss perceived that be of use for to carry on argument entertained half formed idea that did not quite understand objection so strongly urged by niece that there be something on mind that must not tell that there might be cruelty in urging matter upon in opposition to there be assured conviction that be duty to provide well comfortably for niece that be duty to obey in acceding to such provision a might make then marriage be undoubtedly good marriage match must make world declare how well michel voss have done for girl whom have taken under protection be marriage that must not bear to see go out of family be not probable that young linen merchant who be so well to do in world who doubt might have choice in larger place than granpere be not probable michel thought that must put up with many refusal girl must lose chance unless by firmness must drive folly out of yet how must be firm when be tempted to throw great arm about swear that must eat of bread drink of cup be unto a daughter till last day of joint existence when crept so close to pressed arm be almost overcome by sweetness of love by tenderness of own heart seems to that understand ' said at last did think that girl a must be so silly ' to made reply then began to walk down hill together have walked half way home stepping little in advance because be still angry with angry rather with in that must not bring to scold properly following close behind shoulder when stopped suddenly asked question came from direction thought be taking at moment be sure said 'that be not doing because expect george to come back to ' 'quite sure said bearing forward moment answering in whisper when spoke word then ca understand ca indeed have urmand done anything to offend ' 'nothing uncle ' 'nor said anything ' word uncle be not offended of course be much obliged to only love ' faith understand indeed be sheer nonsense must get over must be doing duty if did tell that must get over will be here again in ten day must have thought better of by time must indeed marie ' then walked down hill in silence together thinking intently on purpose of other altogether misunderstanding other michel voss be assured a have twice implied a much that be altogether indifferent to son george what might have said done have declared affection for absent lover did not know have not questioned on point though wife have told that marie be ever thinking of george have not believed that be so have reason for disliking marriage between son wife niece when have first thought that be going to be lover under nose without permission going to commence new kind of life between without so much a word spoken to by have found compelled to interfere compelled a father uncle kind of thing must never be allowed to take place in well ordered house without expressed sanction of head of household have interfered rather roughly son have taken at word be sore now at son coldness to be disposed to believe that son cared not at for one at granpere niece be almost a dear to a son much more dutiful therefore must do best must for niece marie declaration that george be nothing to that did not think of be in accordance with own idea wife have be wrong wife be usually wrong when headwork be required there must be no good reason why marie bromar must not marry adrian urmand marie a knew very well have never declared that george voss be nothing to that be forgotten that heart be free have gone from have forgotten be quite sure of must ever hear that be married to one else a be probable that must hear day then must be free again then might take man that if friend wished if must bring to endure proposed marriage at present troth be plighted to george voss where troth be given there be heart also must understand circumstance affecting one of so little importance a herself must be nothing to man like uncle be everything to george have forgotten have wept sorely over want of constancy though telling that certainly be so have declared to herself that must never be untrue till want of truth have be put beyond reach of doubt who doe not know how hope remains when reason have declared that there be longer ground for hoping such have be state of mind hitherto what must be good of entertaining hope even if there be ground for hoping when a be so evident uncle must never permit george to be man wife did not owe everything to uncle be not duty of girl to obey guardian must not all world be against if refused man mind be tormented by thousand doubt when uncle said word to just a be entering village will try think better of will not dear ' be silent 'come marie can say that will try will not try ' 'yes uncle will try ' michel voss went home in good humour for felt that have triumphed poor marie returned broken hearted for be aware that have half yielded knew that uncle be triumphant chapter v when edmond greisse be back at granpere well remembered message have doubt a to expediency of delivering have to reflect in first place whether be quite sure that matter be arranged between marie adrian urmand story have be told to a being certainly true by peter waiter have discussed matter with other young men associate in place among of whom be believed that urmand be certainly about to carry away young woman with whom be more le in love when on return to granpere have asked few more question have found that even peter be now in doubt on point a to have before be so sure began to think that there must be difficulty in giving message be not without little fear of marie hesitated to tell that have spread report about marriage so contented with simply announcing to that george voss intended to visit old home uncle know marie asked 'no be to tell ' said greisse ' be to tell why must tell can tell ' george said be to let know that must tell uncle ' be quite unintelligible to marie be clear to that must make such announcement after conversation have have with uncle be quite out of question that must be first to announce george return when have be twice warned on sunday afternoon not to think of have better let uncle know ' said a walked away young greisse knowing that be already in trouble feeling that might very probably make worse held peace when therefore one morning george voss showed at door of inn father madame voss expected father be kind to mother in law hovered round with demonstration of love gratitude a though much be due to for coming back at 'but expected ' said george 'no indeed ' said father 'we did not expect now more than on other day since left ' ' sent word by edmond greisse ' said george edmond be interrogated declared that have forgotten to give message george be too clever to pursue matter farther when first met marie bromar there be not word said between beyond what might have be said between young person so related after absence of twelve month george voss be very careful to make demonstration of affection for girl who have forgotten who be now a believed betrothed to man marie be determined that certainly sign of old love must first be shown by have come back perhaps just in time have returned just at moment in something must be decided have felt how much there be in little word have spoken to uncle when girl say that will try to reconcile to man overture have almost yielded word have escaped without such meaning on part have be spoken because have feared to continue to contradict uncle in full completeness of positive refusal have regretted a soon a have be spoken must not recall have seen in uncle eye have heard in tone of voice for how much that word have be taken have gone forth from mouth must not now rob of meaning adrian urmand be to be back at granpere in few day in ten day michel voss have said there be ten day for in to resolve what must do now a though sent from heaven george have returned in very interval of time might not be that must help out of difficulty if must only tell to remain single for sake must certainly turn back upon swiss lover let uncle say what might must make engagement with george unless with uncle sanction word look of love must fortify against other marriage george thought have come back man more to be worshipped than ever a far a appearance went what woman must doubt for moment between two such men adrian urmand be doubt pretty man with black hair of be very careful with white hand with bright small dark eye be very close together with thin regular nose small mouth black moustache be always pointing with finger be impossible to deny that be good looking after fashion marie despised in heart be almost bigger than be certainly stronger have aptitude for city niceness point device fastidiousness of such lover george voss have come back not taller than when have left broader in shoulder more of man then have in eye in beaked nose large mouth well developed chin that look of command be peculiar character of father face woman who judge of men by feeling rather than thought always love to see marie if must consent to marry adrian urmand might probably have own way in house in everything whereas be certain enough that george voss wherever might be must desire to have way yet there needed not moment in marie estimation to choose between two george voss be real man whereas adrian urmand tried by comparison be in estimation simply rich trader in want of wife in day two fatted calf be killed went happily between george father walked together up into mountain looked after wood cutting discussed prospect of inn at colmar michel be disposed to think that george have better remain at colmar accept madame faragon offer 'if think that house be worth anything will give few thousand franc to set in order then have better agree to allow so much year for life ' probably felt to be nearly a young man a son then remember too that have other son coming up who must be able to carry on house at granpere when must be past work michel be loving generous hearted man feeling of anger with son be over before have be together two day ca do better george ' said 'you need not always stay away from for twelve month might take turn over mountain get lesson a to how do thing at colmar if ten thousand franc will help will have will make thing go straight with george voss thought sum named must make thing go very straight a reader know have matter near to heart thanked father not in joyous thoroughly contented tone that michel have expected 'be there anything wrong about ' michel said in sharp tone used when something have suddenly displeased 'there be nothing wrong nothing wrong at said george slowly money be much more than must have expected indeed did not expect 'what be then ' ' be thinking of something else tell be true that marie be going to be married to adrian urmand 'what make ask ' ' heard report of ' said george 'be true ' father reflected moment what answer must give did not seem to that george spoke of such marriage a though rumour of have made unhappy question have be asked almost with indifference then young man manner to marie marie manner to during last two day have made certain that have be right in supposing that have forgotten little tenderness of year ago michel have thoroughly made up mind that must be well that marie must marry adrian believed that have already vanquished marie scruple have promised 'to try think better of ' before george return therefore be not justified in regarding matter a almost settled ' think that will be married ' said to son there be something in ' ' o yes there be great deal in urmand be very eager for have asked aunt have consented ' have asked ' 'yes have done that too ' said michel 'and what answer did get ' know that must be fair to tell marie be not girl likely to jump into man arm at first word think there be doubt that will be betrothed before sunday week be to be here again on wednesday ' like then ' ' o yes of course like ' michel voss have not intended to say word be false be anxious to do best in power for son niece thoroughly understood that be duty a father guardian to start well in world to do that must for prosperity to feed want with money a pelican feed young with blood from bosom have known heart of of must have understood marie constancy obstinate silent strength of son disposition must have let adrian urmand with business house at basle seek wife in other quarter where listed must have joined together hand of two whom loved with paternal blessing did not understand thought that saw everything when saw nothing now be deceiving son for be untrue that marie have such 'liking ' for adrian urmand a of george have spoken 'it be a good a settled then said george not showing by tone of voice anxiety with question be asked ' think be a good a settled michel answered before got back to inn george have thanked father for liberal offer have declared that must accede to madame faragon proposition have made father understand that must return to colmar on next monday two day before on urmand be expected at granpere monday came hitherto there have be no word of explanation between george marie one in house knew that be about to return to colmar one in house knew that have be entirely reconciled to father madame voss have asked question about marie have be assured by husband that there be nothing in suspicion ' told from beginning ' said 'that there be nothing of sort only wish that george must think of marrying one now that be to have large house of own over head george have determined dozen time that must dozen time that must not speak to marie about coming marriage changing mind a often a be formed of what use be to speak to must say to then again must resolve that must scorch false heart by one withering word before went chance at last arranged for before started found alone with for moment be almost impossible that must not say something then did speak 'they tell be going to be married marie hope will be happy prosperous ' tell so ' 'it be true at rate suppose ' that know of if uncle aunt choose to dispose of can not help ' 'it be well for girl to be disposed of sometimes save world of trouble ' know what mean by george whether be intended to be ill natured ' 'no indeed why must be ill natured to heartily wish to be well happy daresay m urmand will make good husband good bye marie will be off in few minute will not say farewell to ' george ' 'we used to be friend marie 'yes used to be friend 'and have never forgotten old day will not promise to come to marriage because must not make either of happy will wish well god bless marie ' then put arm round kissed a might have done to sister a be natural that must do to marie bromar regarding a cousin did not speak word more then be gone have be quite unable to tell truth manner in have first addressed made impossible for to tell that be not engaged to marry adrian urmand that be determined if possible to avoid marriage that have love for adrian urmand have done so must in so doing have asked to come back to that must do be impossible yet a left suspicion of truth half formed idea of real state of man mind in reference to flashed across own seemed to feel that be specially unfortunate felt at same time that there be mean within reach of setting thing right be a convinced a ever have be that uncle must never give consent to marriage between george voss a for george left with assured conviction that be promised bride of adrian urmand chapter vi world seemed very hard to marie bromar when be left alone though there be many who loved of whose real affection have doubt there be one to whom must go for assistance uncle in matter be enemy aunt be completely under uncle guidance madame voss spoke to often in day of coming of adrian urmand manner of speaking be such that comfort must be taken from madame voss must risk opinion a to room young man ought to occupy manner in must be fed entertained for be thoroughly understood that be coming on occasion a lover not a trader that be coming a guest of michel voss not a customer to inn suppose can take supper like other people marie said to aunt again when question of wine be mooted be almost saucy 'if be thirsty ' said 'what did for last week will do for next week if be not thirsty have better leave alone ' girl be always allowed to be saucy about lover madame voss did not count for much marie be always thinking of last word have be spoken between george of kiss that have given 'we used to be friend have said then have declared that have never forgotten old day marie be quick intelligent ready to perceive at glance to understand at word a be way with clever woman thrill have gone through a heard tone of young man voice have half told truth have not quite ceased to think of then went without saying other one word must have be needful without even looking truth into face have gone have plainly given to understand that acceded to marriage with adrian urmand how be to read be there more than one way in wounded woman so sore at heart must read have told that though loved still did not suit to trouble with a wife that must throw upon head guilt of having be false to old vow though loved better than world despised for thoughtful treachery in eye be treachery must have known truth what right have to suppose that must be false to who have never known to lie to be not business a man to speak word to ask question by if doubted truth might be made known to woman must ask question must speak word must not renew assurance to till must have asked to renew be false traitor coward be very angry with so angry that be almost driven by anger to throw into adrian arm be more angry because be full sure that have not forgotten old love that heart be not altogether changed have appeared to that sweet word of former day have vanished from memory though have clung to hers that have in truth learned to look upon granpere experience a simple doings of boyhood pride must have be hurt must have be angry with rather than with have not be so respectful silence of sojourn in house have told that be not so tremor in voice a reminded that once have be friend have plainly told that be not so have acknowledged that have be betrothed that plight between be still strong wishing to be quit of have thrown burden of breaking upon be very wretched did not go about house with downcast eye humble

edmond greisse have in truth spoken word to edmond greisse be not angry since ill starred communication of have only given half to aunt be brusque almost ill mannered 'what be matter with marie ' madame voss said to one morning when have be snubbed rather rudely by niece marie in answer shook head shrugged shoulder can not put on better look before m urmand come think will hardly hold to bargain ' said madame voss who be angry 'who want to hold to bargain ' said marie sharply then feeling ill inclined to discus matter with aunt left room madame voss who have be assured by husband that marie have real objection to adrian urmand did not understand ' be sure marie be unhappy ' said to husband when came in at noon day ' said 'it seems strange be so fancy with best of young woman feeling of modesty of bashfulness if will be outraged by being told that be to admit man a lover wo make worse wife on account when get home ' madame voss be not quite sure that husband be right have not before observed young woman to be made savage in daily work by outrage to modesty of acknowledged lover a usual submitted to husband have not done so there must have come that glance from corner of eye curl in lip gentle breath from nostril have become to expression of imperious marital authority nothing must be kinder more truly affectionate than be heart of husband towards niece therefore madame voss yielded comforted by assurance a best be being done for marie need not subject to husband displeasure by contradiction interference michel voss said little nothing to niece at time have yielded to making promise that must endeavour to accede to wish felt that be bound in honour not to trouble farther unless must show to be disobedient when moment of trial came be not at ease be not comfortable at heart because knew that marie be avoiding though must still stand behind chair at supper when for moment must be still did not put hand upon head did speak to more than nature of service required twice tried to induce to sit with at table a though to show that position be altered now that be about to become bride be altogether powerless to effect such change a word must have be spoken must have induced marie to seat at table so well did understand such change in habit must have seemed to imply there be now hardly one person in supper room of hotel who did not instinctively understand reason made michel voss anxious that niece must sit down that other reason made sternly refuse to comply with request so day followed day there be little said between uncle niece though heretofore up to time still within fortnight of present day whole business of house have be managed by little whispered conference between ' think will do so so uncle ' manage ' such such like word have passed morning evening with understanding between full complete now be afraid of other everything be astray marie be still gentle with child when must be with for hour must sit with on lap clustering round kissing saying soft word to even softer in affection than have be wont understood a well a everybody else that something be wrong that there be to be change a to marie perhaps must not be change for better that there be cause for melancholy for close kissing a though such kissing be in preparation for parting for soft stroking with little hand a though marie be to be pitied for be about to come upon 'be somebody coming to take away little michel asked when be quite alone marie have not known how to answer have therefore embraced closely tear fell upon face said ' know somebody be coming to take away will not papa help ' have not spoken for moment have taken courage have resolved that must help herself at day be there on adrian urmand be to come be purpose to travel by mulhouse remiremont michel voss drove over to latter town to fetch be felt by one must not be felt that there be something special in coming arrival now be not like arrival of one else marie with

not generally obtain much credit for clear seeing have clearer insight to state of niece mind than have husband still believed that marie heart be not with adrian urmand attributing perhaps very great importance to young girl heart fancying that knew that in instance young girl heart must not have own way be quite in favour of urmand marriage if be to be married sooner better of have doubt be best to have over always a soon a possible said to husband in private nodding head looking much wiser than usual wo have marie hurried ' said michel 'we have better say day next month dear ' said madame

writing of letter be customary thing with correspondence be not numerous such letter a did write be short always confined to matter concerning trade madame voss have however sent special message to madame faragon a soon a adrian have gone thinking that must be well that in way george must learn truth have be fully arranged by time george voss be to be landlord of hotel at colmar on from first

man with roulage brought word direct from step mother george immediately began to inquire within why stodel man with roulage have not brought word direct to answered question to not altogether incorrectly ' o yes continued madame faragon 'it be quite true on th of october suppose will be going over to wedding ' said in usual whining tone of small complaint signifying thereby how great must be grievance to herself to be left alone at special time ' will not go to wedding ' said george 'they can be married if be to be married without ' 'they be to be married may be quite sure of ' madame faragon grievance now consisted in amount of doubt be being thrown on tidings have be sent direct to 'of course will choose to have doubt because be who tell ' ' doubt at think be very likely be well aware before father wished ' 'of course must wish george how must not wish bromar never have franc of own in life be not to be expected that with family of young child at heel be to give dot 'he will give something will treat a though be daughter think ought not father be always romantic headstrong man at rate there be bar maid a may say in hotel much same a floschen here of course such marriage a be great thing very great thing indeed how must not wish ' ' o if like ' 'like of course will like why must not like young good looking with fine business doe owe sou will be bound with houseful of furniture of course will like suppose there be so much difficulty about ' ' daresay not ' said george ' believe that woman liking go after fashion for most part ' madame faragon not understanding general sarcasm against sex continued expression of opinion about coming marriage ' suppose anybody will think of blaming marie bromar for accepting match when be proposed to of course must do a be bidden must hardly be expected to say that man be above 'he be not above said george in hoarse voice bromar be nothing to george nothing in blood nothing beyond most distant cousin do say that have

shaking head after george voss went about house for hour doing work giving order going through usual routine of day business a did so no one guessed that mind be disturbed madame faragon have not slightest suspicion that matter of marie marriage be cause of sorrow to have felt not unnatural envy of woman mind in such affair must not help expressing although marie bromar be in sort connected with be sure that such arrangement must be regarded a family triumph by george unless indeed must be inclined to quarrel with father for over generosity in matter of dot be lucky that got little bit of money before affair be settled ' said 'it must not have made difference of copper sou ' said george voss a walked angrily out of old woman room be in evening after supper greater part of day have passed since have first heard news up to present moment have endeavoured to shake matter off from declaring to that grief at least outward show of grief must be unmanly unworthy of with strong resolve have fixed mind upon affair of house have allowed to meditate a little a might be possible misery agony have be then present with during hour have be made sharper by endeavour to keep down banish from thought now a went out from madame faragon room having finished that be duty to do strolled into town at once began to give way to thought of course must think about acknowledged that be useless for to attempt to get rid of matter let be a though there be such person in world a marie bromar adrian urmand must think about might so give play to feeling that one must see in moment of wretchedness went out therefore among dark walk in town garden there a paced one alley after in gloom revelled in agony passionate man feel when woman whom love be to be given into arm of a thought of own life during past year fifteen month must not tell that present suffering be due in degree to own fault if really loved girl if have be intention to try win for why have taken father at word gone away from granpere why having left granpere have taken trouble to let know that still loved a asked question be hardly able to understand pride have driven away from old home have kept silent so long have promised that must be true to then have come few word from father mouth word thought father must never have spoken to have gone away telling that must come back fetch a soon a must offer home independently of father if after promise have made to must not wait for without farther word farther vow must not be worth having in going have not precisely told that there must be intercourse between for twelve month silence have maintained continued absence have be consequence of mood of mind tenor of purpose longer have be away from granpere without tidings from one there le possible have be that must send tidings from to old home have not expected message have not expected letter when nothing came told over over again that too must be silent must bide time then edmond greisse have come to colmar brought first rumour of adrian urmand proposal of marriage reader will perhaps remember that george when heard first rumour have at once made up mind to go over to granpere that went went to granpere partly believing partly disbelieving edmond story if be untrue perhaps might say word to must comfort give new hope if be true must have to tell so then must say word to must tear heart if heart be to be reached must never let know that have torn own to rag be pride of manliness yet be so boyish a not to know that must have be for to make overture for renewal of love hoped that marie must make to have gone over to granpere reader will perhaps again remember what have passed then between marie just a be leaving have asked whether be to be married to man have made objection to marriage have spoken word of constancy of own affection in heart there have be anger against because have spoken no such word to a of course there be also in heart against very bitter very hot if wished to be true to why did not say so if have given up why did come there at why did ask question about marriage if on own behalf have statement to make assurance to give what be marriage refusal to be married to be to tell that a have deserted a must not busy to overcome love therefore be minded to wear willow for ever uncle aunt choose to dispose of can not help ' have said then have left have be sure that for early game of love be game altogether played out now a walked along dark path of town garden something of truth came upon made excuse for marie bromar have given vow must have be true to vow so said to dozen time have never be false have shown sign of falseness true of heart have remained away from only till might come claim bring to house that must call own also told dozen time nevertheless there be very agony of remorse weight of repentance in have not striven to make sure of prize when have be at granpere before marriage be settled have loved a ought to have loved have loved a loved there must have be question possible to of marriage with man still repented in that have lost that desired might perhaps have then obtained for strong feeling of breast strongest next to love be desire to be revenged cared little now for father little for personal dignity have intended to return by silence little for pecuniary advantage prudential motif in comparison with strong desire to punish marie for perfidy must go over to granpere fall among like thunderbolt like thunderbolt at rate must fall upon head of marie bromar very word of love promise be still firm in memory must see if also must be made to remember ' will go over to granpere day after to morrow ' said to madame faragon a caught just before retired for night day after to morrow why ' 'well know that can say exactly why will not be at marriage must like to see first will go day after to morrow went to granpere on day fixed chapter xi 'probably one night only wo make promise george have said to madame faragon when asked how long intended to stay at granpere a took one of horse belonging to inn drove seemed to be certain that must not stay long started alone early in morning reached granpere about twelve o'clock mind be full of painful thought a went a little animal ran quickly down mountain road into valley in granpere lie almost wished that foot be not so fleet what be to say when got to granpere to whom be to say when reached angular court along two side of house be built did not at once enter front door none of family be then about place must therefore go into stable ask question two of man who came to meet father man told have gone up early to wood cutting must not probably return till afternoon madame voss be doubt inside a be also marie bromar then man

maiden maiden of granpere have ever before have at foot lover at same time so good looking so wealthy so sagacious so good tempered man declared that adrian be luckiest fellow in world in finding such wife enthusiasm rose to highest pitch when spoke of marie luck in finding such husband there be end to good with must be endowed 'linen said man holding up hand in admiration 'that will last out grandchild at least george listened to smiled said word two be worth while to come way to granpere to throw thunderbolt at girl who have be captivated by promise of chest full of house linen george told man that must go up to wood cutting after father before be out of court changed mind slowly entered house why must go to father what have to say to father about marriage must not be better said down at house after have little ground of complaint against father be marie who have be untrue to be on marie head that wrath must fall doubt father must be angry with when must have thrown thunderbolt must not a thought be hurled effectually without father knowledge need not tell father errand on have come so changed mind went into inn entered house almost dreading to see whom be seeking in what way must first express wrath how must show wreck by inconstancy have made of happiness first word must if possible be spoken to alone yet alone must hardly hope to find feared though be so resolved to speak mind yet feared though intended to fill with remorse yet dreaded effect of word upon knew how strong must be how steadfast though passion told hour be telling day long that be a false a hell yet there be something in of judgment something rather of instinct told also that be not bad that be firm hearted high spirited great minded girl who must have reason to give for thing that be doing went through into kitchen before met one there found madame voss with cook peter immediate explanation have of course to be made a to unexpected arrival question asked suggestion offered 'came in peace came in war have come because have heard of betrothal admitted that be so 'and be glad of ' asked madame voss will congratulate with heart ' will congratulate certainly said george then cook peter began with copious flow of domestic eloquence to declare how great marriage be for lion d'or how pleasing to master how creditable to village how satisfactory to friend how joyous to bridegroom how triumphant to bride doubt will have plenty to eat drink fine clothes to wear excellent house over head ' said george in bitterness will be married to one of most respectable young men in switzerland said madame voss in tone of much anger be already quite clear to madame voss to cook to peter george have not come over from colmar simply to express joyous satisfaction at cousin good fortune soon walked through into little sitting room step mother followed 'george ' said 'you will displease father very much if say anything unkind about marie ' know very well ' said 'that father care more for marie than doe for ' 'that be not so george ' blame for life in house with while live elsewhere be natural that must be more to than be after have sent away have no right to suppose that can have same feeling that have about marriage can not think finest thing in world for of that marie bromar must succeed in getting rich young man for husband who a far a can see never have two idea in head 'he be most industrious young man who thoroughly understands business have heard people say that there be one come to granpere who can buy better than can ' havery likely not 'and at rate be disgrace to be well off ' 'it be disgrace to think more about than anything else never mind be use talking about word wo mend ' 'why then have come here now ' 'because want to see father ' then remembered how false be excuse remembered also how soon falseness must appear 'besides though like match wish to see marie once again before marriage will never see after be reason why have come suppose can give bed o yes there be bed enough after that there be pause madame voss hardly knew how to treat step son at last asked whether must have dinner order be given to peter to prepare something for young master in small room george asked after child in way dreaded subject be for minute laid on one side in mean time information of george arrival have be taken upstairs to marie have often wondered what sign must make when must hear of engagement must send word of affection such customary present a must be usual between two person so nearly connected must come to marriage what must be own feeling too remembered well with absolute accuracy warm delicious heavenly word of love have passed between must feel now pressure of hand warmth of kiss when swore to that must be for ever ever after that have left for year have sent no token then have come again have simply asked whether be engaged to man have asked with cruel indication that at least intended that old childish word must be forgotten now be in house again must have to hear congratulation thought for quarter of hour what have better do then determined to go down to at once sooner first meeting be over better be to remain away from till must be brought together at supper table there must almost be necessity for to explain conduct must go down to treat exactly a might have done have there never be special love between must do so a perfectly a strength might enable if failed in aught must be better to fail before aunt than in presence of uncle when have resolved waited yet minute two then went down stair a entered aunt room george voss be sitting before stove while madame voss be in accustomed chair peter be preparing table for young master dinner george arose from seat at once then came look of pain across face marie saw at once almost loved more because suffered ' be so glad to see george ' said ' be so glad that have come have offered hand of course have taken 'yes ' said ' thought best just to run over will be very busy at hotel before long 'does that mean to say that be not to be here for marriage ' said with sweetest smile making effort in power to give gracious tone to voice be better knew to plunge at subject at once 'no said ' will not be here then ' 'ah father will miss so much if can not be be very good of to come now there must have be something sad in going away from old house without seeing once more though colmar basle be very near will not be same a in dear old home will george ' there be touch about voice a called by name that nearly killed at moment hatred be strongest against adrian why have upstart a puny miserable creature come between only thing that have ever seen in guise of woman must touch heart turned round with back to table face to stove said nothing be able when no longer saw when voice be not sounding in ear to swear that thunderbolt must be hurled same journey to granpere must not be made for nothing ' must go now said presently will see at supper will not george when uncle will be with uncle michel will be so delighted to find will tell of new doings at hotel good bye for present george then be gone before have spoken word eat dinner smoked cigar about yard then said that must go out meet father did go out did not take road by knew that father be to be found strolled off to ravine came back only when be dark meeting between father be kindly there be special word spoken thus sat down to supper chapter xii became necessary a george voss sat at supper with father madame voss that must fix time of return to colmar did so for early morning of next day one have told madame faragon that expected to stay at granpere one night felt however after arrival that might be difficult for to get away on following day therefore told that must sleep two night at lion d'or then start early so a to reach colmar inn by mid day suppose find old lady rather fidgety george ' said michel voss in high good humour george found easier to talk about madame faragon hotel at colmar than did of thing at granpere therefore became communicative a to own affair michel too preferred subject of new doings at house on other side of vosges wife have given slight hint doing best like good wife discreet manager to prevent ill humour hard word 'he feel little sore know be always sure there be something be wise of to come see will go off in way ' michel swore that george have right to be sore that if son did not take pride in such family arrangement a must no longer be son of allowed to be counselled by wife soon talked into pleasant mood discussing madame faragon horse belonging to hotel de la poste colmar affair in general there be certain important ground for satisfaction between everybody agreed that george voss have shown to be steady man of business in affair of inn at colmar marie bromar in mean while went on with usual occupation round room now again came stood at uncle elbow joining in conversation asking question two about madame faragon there be perhaps something of guile of serpent joined to dove like softness asked question listened to answer not that in present state of mind must bring to take deep interest in affair of madame faragon hotel because suited that there must be subject of easy conversation between george be absolutely necessary now that george must be nothing more to than cousin acquaintance be well that must be not enemy must be well too that must know that must think that knew that be disturbed by remembrance of word have once passed between at last trusted to remark perhaps must not have made have serpent guile be more perfect of kind beurely must get wife george a soon a house be own course will get wife ' said father hope will get good one ' said madame voss after short pause however have be long enough to make feel necessary to say something george said never word lifted glass finished wine marie at once perceived that subject be one on must not venture to touch again indeed saw farther than became aware that must be inexpedient for to fall into special minute conversation with cousin during short stay at granpere 'you will go up to wood with tomorrow eh george ' said father son of course assented be hardly possible that must not assent whole day moreover must not be wanted for purpose of throwing thunderbolt if must get thrown must be well that must be a far away from marie a possible for remainder of visit will start early marie have bit of breakfast before go will six be too early for george with town way george said that six must not be too early a made engagement for morning resolved that must if possible throw thunderbolt night bearie will get cup of coffee sausage marie be always up by time ' marie smiled promised that must not be compelled to start upon walk with empty stomach from fault of hers if hot breakfast at six o'clock in morning must put cousin into good humour certainly must not be wanting in two hour after supper george be with father michel be so full of happiness so confidential that son found very difficult to keep silence about own sorrow have not be that with half obedience to wife hint michel said little about adrian there must have be explosion endeavoured to confine to george prospect a to expressed thoroughly pleased 'you see ' said ' be so strong of year that if wished for shoe there be knowing how long might be kept waiting ' 'it must have be too long ' said george 'ah well believe must have be impatient to put old fellow under sod must have be impatient must have be unhappy might have have wood to be sure be hardly enough of business alone besides young man be always more own master away from father can understand that only thing be george take drive over see sometimes ' be very well be not quite so well when began to speak of marie 'it terrible loss going know george will feel sadly ' ' can understand ' said george 'but of course have duty to do to girl have to see that must be well settled will be well settled there be comfort in be there george george must not bring to reply to with good humoured zeal there came for moment cloud between father son michel be wise swallowed wrath in minute two returned to colmar madame faragon at about half past nine george escaped from father returned to house have be sitting in balcony run round billiard room on side of court opposite to front door returned to house caught marie in one of passage up stair a be completing work for day caught close to door of own room asked to come in might speak word to english reader will perhaps remember that among vosges mountain there be le of sense of privacy attached to bedroom than be case with here in england marie knew immediately then that cousin have not come to granpere for nothing have not come with innocent intention of simply pleasing father have not come to say ordinary word of farewell to before marriage there be to be something of scene though must not tell of nature scene might be knew however that own conduct have be right therefore though must have avoided scene have be possible must not fear went into room when closed door smiled did not a yet tremble bearie said ' have come here on purpose to say word two to ' there be smile on face a spoke now intention to be savage be written there a plainly a purpose be ever written on man countenance marie read writing without missing letter be to be rebuked sternly rebuked rebuked by man who have taken heart then left rebuked by man who have crushed hope made absolutely necessary for to give up sweet poetry of life to forget dream to abandon wished for prettiness of existence confine to duty to thing material who have so sinned against be about to rid of burden of sin by endeavouring to cast upon so much understood yet did not understand be to come must hear rebuke a quietly a might in interest of others must do so must not fear must say quiet word in defence of own sex if there must be need such be purport of mind a stood opposite to in room ' hope will be kind word said 'as be to part so soon there must be none unkind spoken know much about kindness ' replied then paused tried to think how best thunderbolt might be hurled 'there be hardly room for kindness where there be once so much more than kindness where there be so much more pretence of ' then waited again a though expected that must speak must not speak at if have aught to say let say marie have in truth forgotten promise once made ' though be direct question must not answer word to must be a few a possible time for such word have not come a yet 'it suit doubt to forget now can not forget have be false to have broken heart have be false to when only joy on earth be in believing in truth vow be for ever ever within one

have be hurled fell a thunderbolt what have expected have not be at like to have known that must rebuke feeling strong in own innocence own purity knowing thinking that knew that fault have be not believing having got rid of belief that still loved have fancied that rebuke must be unjust cruel bearable nay have thought that must almost triumph over with short word of reply have expected from reproach not love there be reproach indeed came with expression of passion of have not known to be capable stood before telling that have broken heart a told so word be half choked by sob reminded her of promise declaring that own to have ever remained in full force told that to whom have looked for joy have become curse to blight upon life there be thought feeling too beyond crowded upon heart

stood against world have not seemed to that evidence of cousin indifference be complete have not that evidence be complete at point must have be impossible to to think of becoming wife of man now evidence on matter have seemed to to be so sufficient be blown to wind be true have feeling be guided by reason only might have be a strong a ever in truth have not sinned against in truth have not sinned at have not done that have desired have not be anxious for wealth ease position have after painful thought endeavoured to shape conduct by wish of others by idea of duty a duty have be taught to o how willingly must have remained a servant to uncle have allowed m urmand to carry rich gift of linen chest to foot of other damsel have believed to be free to choose have there be passion in heart must now have known to be strong in duty must have be able to have answered to have borne rebuke of old lover passion be there hot within aiding word a spoke giving strength to complaint telling of that have lost telling of have taken from forgot to remember now that have be silent for year forgot now to think of tone in have asked about marriage when such marriage be in mind remembered well promise have made word of 'your vow be for ever ever ' when heard word repeated from lip heart too be broken idea of holding before a one injured ready to forgive be gone from if by falling at foot owning to be vile mansworn might get pardon be ready now to lie there on ground before ' o george ' said ' o george be use of now ' replied turning away from have thrown thunderbolt have nothing more to say have seen that have not thrown quite in vain must have be contented to be away back at colmar what more be there to be said came to very gently very humbly just touched arm with hand mean george that have continued to care for always ' 'care for know not what call caring did not swear to must love for ever ever that must be own did not leave house go away till must earn for one must be

near to with face averted 'and whom do love now asked again 'be be adrian urmand must not answer though have said enough in passionate sorrow to make answer to such question unnecessary a far a knowledge on subject might be required might suit view that must confess truth in so many word for other purpose answer have be full enough 'this be very sad ' said bead indeed thought that must have be firmer ' chide again george ' be to purpose 'you said that be curse to ' ' o marie have hoped have so hoped that must have be blessing ' beay that be not curse to george ' must make answer to

upon brow have inherited from father angry fire in eye heart be in truth once more becoming soft tender towards be beginning to understand how have be with have told just now that did not believe when assured that have thought that be forgotten now did believe there arose in breast feeling that be due to that must explain change in mind ' suppose did think ' said suddenly 'think what george ' be vain empty false tongued fellow whose word be worth reliance ' thought evil of george except that be changed to when came said nothing to do not remember ' came because be told that be to be married

love be not yet marie husband need never become so if marie must only be sufficiently firm in resisting influence of friend priest must marry without own consent george must have to face enmity of with whom be connected be sure that father having be party to betrothal must never consent to breach of promise to urmand madame voss madame faragon priest protestant pastor must all be against must be a be outcast from own family george voss sitting there on bedside thought that must go through if only must induce marie bromar to bear brunt of world displeasure with a got into bed determined that must begin upon matter to father during morning walk father must be full of wrath wrath must have to be endured sooner later chapter xiii on next morning michel voss son met in kitchen found marie already there 'well girl ' said michel a patted marie shoulder kissed forehead have be up getting rare breakfast for fellow see ' marie smiled made good humoured reply one must have told by face that there be anything amiss with 'it last favour of kind will ever have at hand continued michel 'and yet doe seem to be half grateful george stood with back to kitchen fire did not say word be impossible for even to appear to be pleasant when such thing be being said marie be better hypocrite though said little be able to look a though must sympathise with uncle pleasant mirth two men have soon eaten breakfast be gone then marie be left alone with thought must george say anything to father of what have passed up stair on previous evening two men started when be alone together a long a michel abstained from talking about marie prospect george be able to converse freely with father when left house morning be just dawning air be fresh sharp 'we will soon have frost here now ' said michel then there will be no more grass for cattle suppose can have out on low land till end of november always used ' 'yes can have out having out having food for be different thing people here have so much stock now directly growth be checked by frost land becomes almost bare forget old saying half stocking whole profit whole stocking half profit then too think winter be earlier here than used to be will have to go back to swiss plan fancy carry food to cattle in house may be old fashioned a say doubt whether fodder doe not go farther so ' then a began to ascend mountain got on to subject of own business george prospect 'the due to commune be so heavy ' said 'that in fact there be little nothing to be made out of timber look like business because many men be employed be kind of thing spread bear looking at leaf nothing behind ' be not quite so bad a hope ' said george word then be not much better boy when have charged with interest on money spent on mill there be not much to boast about be bound to replant yard strip yet commune expects a high rent a when there be planting to be done at must get only that men like myself have money in mill ca well get out of trade think 'd like to give up father no give exercise something to do woman manage most of down at house there must be change when marie have gone have hardly looked in face yet know there must be change have grown up among till have at finger end tell what george be girl in hundred girl in hundred be going to marry rich man so much signify if married poor man must be a good a fortune to 'd make fortune for man be belief there be nothing doe know nothing doe understand ' why did father tell george thought of day on father have a be accustomed to say to turned out of house because wanted to marry girl who be 'as good a fortune ' to man have then be imprudent in allowing to love girl must there be good reason why father must have wished that 'fortune ' in way so desirable must go out of family will have nothing to do of sort if go to basle ' said george moodily 'that be more than can say ' replied father ' woman married to man of business can always find share in if plea with one a adrian urmand side of house will not be least considerable ' suppose be little better than fool ' said george ' fool be not fool at if be to see buying must not call fool be very far from fool 'it may be so know much of ' 'you must not be so prone to think men fool till find so especially who be to be so near to yourself be not fool by mean will know that have got clever wife will not be ashamed to make use of george be unwilling to contradict father at present moment a have made up mind to tell whole story about marie before returned to house have not slightest idea that by doing so must be able to soften father heart be sure on contrary be to do so father must go back to hotel a enemy be quite resolved that story must be told sooner later must be told before day fixed for wedding if be to be told by what occasion must be so fitting a present if be to be done on morning must be unwise to harass father by small previous contradiction be now up among scattered prostrate log have again taken up question of business of wood cutting george must never have done for not a mainstay thought of giving up to once knew that must make poor man of ' ' wish have ' said george who be unable to repress feeling of heart 'why do say that what fool must be if think there be nothing may not do where be have got into own hand with little outlay rent be nothing business be there ready made for in position if find hotel be not enough there be nothing can not take up have now seated on trunk of pine tree michel voss having drawn pipe from pocket filled be lighting a sat upon wood boy ' continued will have better life of than father doubt after town be better than country there be more to be seen more to be learned complain lord have be very good to have have enough of everything have be able to keep head up feel little sad when look forward marie will be gone stepmother friend m le cure gondin doe not make much society for sometimes think when be smoking pipe up here alone that be best of will be when marie have gone ' if father thus thought of why did send marie away if thus thought of why have sent son away have not already be within power to keep of there together under roof tree have insisted on dividing dismissing from granpere one in one direction other in then complained of being alone surely father be altogether unreasonable 'and now one ca even get tobacco be worth smoking ' continued michel in melancholy tone 'there used to be good tobacco know where have gone can send over little prime tobacco from colmar father ' wish must george be foul stuff sometimes think will give up what be use of man sits smoke smoke nothing come of feed clothe leaf nothing behind except stink 'you be little down in mouth father must talk of giving up smoking ' ' be down in mouth terribly down in mouth till be settled did not know how much must feel marie going of course have to be make old man of there will be nothing left of course there be stepmother a good woman a ever lived child marie be somehow soul of give light george be blessed if can keep fire in pipe at 'and thought george 'be in truth state of father mind there be three of concerned who be equally dear to other father marie bromar there be not one of who doe feel that presence of others be necessary to happiness here be father declaring that world will no longer have savour for because be away in one place marie be to be away in there be not slightest real reason on earth why must have be separated yet alone have done be to break heart over rather have not done be about to do sacrifice be not yet made yet must be made because father be so unreasonable that one will dare to point out to where lie way to own happiness to happiness of love be thus that george voss thought of a listened to father wailing though be hot in temper be slow at least deliberate in action did not even now speak out at once when father pipe be finished suggested that must go on to certain run for fir log george voss have made steep grooved inclined plane by timber when cut in part must be sent down with rush to close neighbourhood of saw mill below went inspected slide discussed question of putting new wood into groove michel with melancholy tone have prevailed with morning spoke of matter a though money spent in mending must be thrown away there be moment in life of most of in seems to that there will never be more cake ale george however talked of child reminded father that in matter of business nothing be so ruinous a ruin 'if have got to get money out of thing must always be in working order ' said michel acknowledged truth of rule again declared that there be money to be got out of thing yielded however promised that repair must be made then went down to mill be going at time george a stood by watched man boy adjusting log to cradle listened to apparently self acting saw a did work observed perfection of simple machinery have adjusted smelt sweet scent of newly made sawdust listened to music of little stream when between while rattle of mill must cease for minute george a stood in silence looking at listening to sound smelling perfume thinking how much sweeter be than little room in madame faragon sat at colmar in be at rate for present duty to submit account to from time to time resolved that must at once make effort knew father temper well might not be that though there must be quarrel for time everything must come right at last a for adrian urmand george did not believe told that did not believe that cur a must suffer much because hope of bride be not fulfilled stayed for hour at saw mill michel in spite of that have said about tobacco smoked pipe while be there george though mind be full of other matter continued to give father practical advice about business how new wheel must be supplied here lately invented improvement introduced there of at moment be care laden with special thought of own nevertheless a men of business knew that hour be precious used to saunter into wood hing be not at in accordance with michel usual mode of life though hummed hawed doubted grumbled took note of son said be quite of mind to make use of son wit ' will be over at epinal day after tomorrow said a left mill will see if can get new crank there ' will be sure to have at heinman ' said george a began to descend hill from spot on have be standing walk down to granpere must take more than hour might well be that might make affair of two three hour if went up to other timber cutting on route george be sure that a soon a began to tell story father must make way straight for home must be too much moved to think of timber too angry to desire to remain minute longer than must help in company with son looking at circumstance a carefully a must george thought that have better begin at once 'as feel be going so much ' said ' wonder that be so anxious to send away ' 'that be poor argument george one must not have expected from be to keep here life doing good for simply because like to have here be in course of thing that must be married be duty to see that marries well ' 'that be quite true father why do talk to about sending away send away urmand come take away did same when be young now be old have to be left behind be way of nature ' doe want to be taken away ' said george rushing at once at subject 'what do mean by ' 'just what say father consent to be taken away doe not wish ' ' know what mean have be talking to have be complaining ' ' have be talking to came over from colmar when heard of marriage on purpose might talk to have at rate right to do ' 'right to do what know that have right if have be trying to do mischief in house george will never forgive never ' ' will tell whole truth father then will say whether have be trying to do mischief will say also whether will forgive will remember when told that be not to think of marie bromar for ' ' do remember 'well have thought of if wanted to prevent that be too late ' 'you be boy girl together be ' tell story father then will judge before have spoken to at marie have given troth ' 'let at least tell story have done so have given mine when told to go went not quite knowing then what might be best that must do feeling very sure that must at least be true to ' 'truth to such folly a must be very wicked ' rate did nothing remained there month after month meaning to do something when be settled meaning to do something when be settled then there came sort of rumour to that marie be to be urmand wife did not believe thought must come see ' 'it be true ' be not true then came over be very angry because be cold to must not promise that there must be such engagement there be none then see will tell everything a occurred ' behe be at rate engaged to adrian urmand now for sake be bound not to interfere ' 'but yet must tell story went back to colmar then after while there came tidings true tidings that be engaged to man came over again yesterday determined may blame if will father listen to determined to throw falsehood in teeth 'then will protect from ' said michel voss turning upon son a though meant to strike with staff 'ah father ' said george pausing standing opposite to innkeeper 'but who be to protect from if have found that be doing be making happy must have spoken mind indeed must have shown once once only what have done to how have destroyed then must have gone troubled none of more 'you have better go now bring more trouble be trouble worst trouble will still cling to have found that be so have taken man not because love because have bidden behe have taken will marry ' ' can not say that have be right father deserves such punishment a must make wretched woman for ever because have done wrong in striving to obey ' have not done wrong in striving to obey have done right believe word of 'you can ask ' ' will ask nothing except that will not speak to farther about have come here wilfully minded to disturb ' be unjust ' say be true be contented happy before came love man be ready to marry on day fixed of course will marry must not have go back from word now 'certainly must if be man tell that repents if tell truth of course will give back troth must do so to woman that only hinted that wished ' 'no such hint will be given will hear nothing of will not speak to marie on subject except to desire to have farther converse with will speak of again to unless wish to bid go from altogether will not mention matter again ' so saying michel voss strode on must not even turn eye in direction of son strode on making way down hill at fastest pace that must achieve now then raising hat wiping perspiration from brow though have spoken of marie departure a loss must be very hard to bear very idea that anything must be allowed to interfere with marriage have planned be unendurable what after have be said done consent that there must be marriage between niece rich young merchant never did not stop for moment to think how much of truth there might be in son statement must not even allow to remember that have forced adrian urmand a suitor upon niece have have qualm of conscience upon matter be possible that might return to must not stop now to look at side of question young people be betrothed marriage be thing settled must be celebrated have never broken faith to man must not break to adrian urmand strode on down mountain there be not word more said between son till reached inn door understand ' said then 'not word more to marie ' after that went up at once to wife chamber desired that marie might be sent to there during rapid walk home have made up mind a to what must do must not be severe to niece must simply ask one question bey dear ' said striving to be calm telling by countenance a plainly a word must have done have passed between son dear take for granted there be nothing to to to interrupt plan 'in what way uncle ' asked merely wanting to gain moment for thought 'in way in way just say that there be nothing wrong will be sufficient stood silent not having word to say to 'you know what mean marie intend to marry adrian urmand suppose so ' said marie in low whisper 'look here marie if there be doubt about will part for ever will never look upon face again honour be pledged yours then hurried out of room down into kitchen without staying there moment went out into yard walked through to stable passion have be so strong uncontrollable that have be unable to remain with niece exact promise from george when saw father go through to stable entered house have already made up mind that must return at once to colmar without waiting to have more angry word such word must serve not at must if possible see marie must also tell stepmother that be about to depart found together at once very abruptly declared that be to start immediately have quarrelled with father george ' said madame voss ' hope not hope that have not quarrelled with be better must go 'what be george hope be nothing serious madame voss a said looked at marie marie have turned face away george also looked at must not see countenance did not dare to ask to give interview alone have quite determined what must say to if be together bearie said madame voss know what be about ' wish have died ' said marie 'before have come into house have made hatred bitterness between who must love other better than world then madame voss be able to guess what have be cause of quarrel bearie said george very slowly 'if will only ask own heart what ought to do be true to what tell there be reason even yet that must be sorry that came to granpere if marry man whom love will sin against against against against god ' then took up hat went out in courtyard met father 'where be going now george ' said father 'to colmar be better must go at once good bye father offered hand to parent spoken to marie ' mother will tell have said have spoken nothing in private said anything about marriage ' 'yes have told that must not honestly marry man did not love ' right have sir ' said michel nearly choked with wrath 'to interfere in affair of household have better go go at once if return again before be married will tell servant to put off place george voss made answer having found horse gig drove off to colmar chapter xiv george voss a drove back to colmar thought of what have be done during last twenty four hour did not find that have much occasion for triumph have indeed consolation of knowing that girl loved in there be certain amount of comfort a have ever be thinking about since have left granpere so also have be thinking of father have told that have be no more than child when parted have ridiculed idea that affection formed so long back at so early age must have lasted have lasted be now a strong in marie breast a be in own have learned at rate by journey to granpere there be something of consolation in knowledge nevertheless did not find that must triumph marie have be weak enough to yield to father once must yield to thought yet again woman in respect a told be different from men be taught by whole tenor of life to submit unless must conquer by underhand unseen mean by little art by coaxing by tear marie did not doubt have tried have failed father purpose have be too strong for have yielded having submitted once of course must submit again there be about father spirit of masterfulness be sure marie must not be able to withstand then there must be strong against interest george thought that feeling so natural to woman a world have be told of coming marriage must be bound to go through with idea of have become familiar to have conquered repugnance must at first have felt have made accustomed to regard man a future husband then there must be madame voss against m le cure of whom must think infinitely better for marie future welfare that must marry roman catholic a be urmand than protestant such a be george voss then money even if must bring to believe that money be nothing to marie must be so much to by whom marie must be surrounded that must be impossible that must be preserved from influence be not often that young people really know other george certainly did not know marie bromar in first place though have learned from secret of heart have not taught to understand how own sullen silence have acted upon knew now that have continued to love did not know how natural have be that must have believed that have forgotten must not therefore understand how different must now be feeling in reference to marriage with adrian from what have be when have believed to be utterly deserted then did not comprehend how thoroughly unselfish have be how have struggled to do duty to others let cost be what might to herself have plighted to adrian urmand not because there have seemed to to be brightness in prospect future promised to because did verily believe circumstanced a be must be better that must submit to friend george voss did not understand have thrown thunderbolt have seen that have be efficacious efficacy have be such that wrath have be turned into tenderness have be so changed in purpose that have be induced to make appeal to father at cost of father enmity that appeal have be in vain a thought of told that on appointed day marie bromar must become wife of adrian urmand knew well enough that girl betrothed be girl already half married be very wretched a drove horse along though there be solace in thought that memory of have still remained in marie heart there be feeling akin to despair in also very tenderness towards be more unendurable than must have be wrath pity of pity of be that made sore of heart faint of spirit if must have reproached a cold mercenary unworthy heartless even though have still loved must have supported by anger against unworthiness a be there be such support for though have be in fault virtue towards be greater than fault still loved still loved though must not be wife then thought of adrian urmand of man success wealth general prosperity in world what if must go over to basle take adrian urmand by throat choke what if must at least half choke successful man make well understood that other half must come unless successful man must consent to relinquish bride george though did not expect success for be fully purposed that urmand must not succeed without interference from by mean of choking otherwise must find way of making disagreeable if be only by speaking mind thought that must speak in way that basle merchant must not like must tell urmand in first place that marie be won not at by affection not in least by personal regard for suitor altogether by feeling of duty towards uncle must point out to suitor how dastardly thing must be to take advantage of girl so placed planned speech two a drove along thought that even urmand thick skinned a believed to be must dislike to hear 'you may have perhaps must say to 'as so much good that must buy because be a thing in uncle hand to be bought belief to be duty a being altogether dependent to be disposed of a uncle may choose will go to a must to other man who might make purchase a for loving even believe that love will keep house for will never love will keep house for unless indeed must find to be so intolerable to that must be forced to leave be in way that will have if be so low thing a to be willing to take so planned various speech of such nature not intending to trust entirely to speech to proceed to attempt at choking afterwards if must be necessary marie bromar must not become adrian urmand wife without effort on part so resolving drove into yard of hotel at colmar a soon a entered house madame faragon began to ask question about wedding when be to be george thought for moment then remembered that have not even heard day named 'why answer george ' said old woman angrily 'you must know when be going to be ' know that be going to be at said george 'not going to be at why not there be not anything wrong be there be not betrothed why tell george ' 'yes be betrothed 'and be cry off must have thought michel voss be man to strangle if did that ' 'and be man to strangle if ' said george walking out of room knew that have be silly absurd knew also that be so moved a to have hardly control over in few word that have now said to madame faragon have a felt told story of own disappointment yet have not in least intended to take old woman into confidence have not meant to have said word about quarrel between father now have told everything when saw again in evening of course asked farther question said ' be afraid thing be not going pleasantly at granpere ' altogether answered suppose marriage will go on ' to made answer shook head showing how impatient be at being thus questioned 'you ought to tell ' said madame faragon plaintively 'considering how interested must be in that concern ' ' have nothing to tell 'but be marriage to be put off again demanded madame faragon with extreme anxiety that know of madame faragon will not ask whether be to be put off not ' 'but have quarrelled with m urmand nobody have quarrelled with m urmand ' there george ' 'what with be not there with have never seen man since first left granpere to come here ' then george voss began to think what might have happened have adrian urmand be at hotel while be there after what must have said to adrian urmand what must have done to have written have to say that be off bargain ' poor madame faragon be almost pathetic in anxiety to learn what have really occurred at lion d'or 'certainly not have not written at what be george ' ' suppose be marie bromar care nothing for ' 'but so rich a be say too such good looking young man 'it be wonderful be not be next to miracle that there must be girl deaf blind to such charm nevertheless believe be so will probably make marry whether like not ' be betrothed to of course will marry ' there will be end of ' said george there be one other question madame faragon longed to ask be almost too much afraid of young friend to put into word at last plucked up courage did ask question after ambiguous way 'but suppose be nothing to george ' 'nothing at nothing on earth ' said 'how must be anything to ' then hesitated for while pausing to think whether not must tell truth to madame faragon knew that there be one on earth setting aside father marie bromar to whom be really so dear a be to old woman must probably do more for if might possibly be in power to do anything than other of friend moreover did not like idea of being false to even on subject a 'it be only to ' said 'that have promised to be wife before have ever mentioned urmand name to ' o george 'and why must not have promised george during time have never mentioned ' 'there be thing madame faragon one doe mention know why must have mentioned at understand about now of course will marry man be not likely that father must fail to have own way with girl who be dependent on ' m urmand must give up if knew must not ' to george made instant answer idea be there in mind that linen merchant might perhaps be induced to abandon purpose if must be made to understand marie wished 'if have touch of manhood about must do so said 'and what will do george 'do will hing what must do father have turned out of house be whole of know that there be anything to be done then went out there be nothing more said upon question for next three four day there be nothing said a went in out madame faragon must look at with anxious eye questioning how far such feeling of love might in truth make young man forlorn wretched a far a must judge by manner be very forlorn very wretched did work indeed be busy about place a be wont there be look of pain in face made old heart grieve by degree good wish for object seemed to be so much to became eager hot 'be there nothing to be done asked at last putting out fat hand to take hold of in sympathy 'there be nothing to be done said george who however hated because be doing nothing still thought occasionally of plan of choking rival be to go to basle see man must say to if did see after be not that can blame have just ground of quarrel with have done nothing be not fair why must not love if suit unless be to fight indeed ' ' o george let there be fighting ' 'it must do good fear ' 'none none none ' said 'if be to kill must not be wife then 'no certainly not 'and if wounded must make like perhaps if be to kill indeed there might be comfort in ' after madame faragon made farther suggestion that young friend must go to basle chapter xv during remainder of day on george have left granpere hour did not fly very pleasantly at lion d'or michel voss have gone to niece immediately upon return from walk intending to obtain renewed pledge from that must be true to engagement have be so full of passion so beside with excitement so disturbed by that have heard that have hardly waited with marie long enough to obtain such pledge to learn from that refused to give have only be able to tell that if hesitated about marrying adrian must never look upon face again then without staying for reply have left have be in such tremor of passion that have be unable to demand answer after when george be gone kept away from during remainder of morning once twice said few word to wife counselled to take farther outward notice of anything george have said to 'it will come right if will only be little calm with madame voss have said have tossed head declared that be calm calmest man in lorraine then have come to wife again have again given good practical advice ' put into head that there be to be doubt ' said madame voss ' have put into head ' answered angrily dear allow to suppose that anybody else can put there let matter go on will see thing bought for wedding when remembers that have allowed to come into house without remonstrating will be quite unable to object give opportunity of objecting ' michel voss again shook head a though wife be unreasonable woman swore that be not who have given marie such opportunity made up mind to do a wife recommended bepeak softly to dear ' said madame voss ' always speak softly ' said turning sharply round upon spouse made attempt to speak softly when met marie about house just before supper put hand upon shoulder smiled murmured word of love be by mean crafty in what did craft indeed be not strong point of character took rough hand kissed looked up lovingly beseechingly into face knew that be asking to consent to sacrifice knew that be imploring to spare be not what madame voss have meant by speaking softly must have be allowed to dilate upon own conviction have be able adequately to express own idea must have begged that there might be sentiment romance kissing of hand looking into other face half murmured tone of love madame voss believed strongly that day work of world be done better without of glancings glimmering of moonshine then husband be by nature of fervid temperament given to influence of unexpressed poetic emotion thus subject in spite of strength of will to much weakness of purpose madame voss perhaps condemned husband in matter more because romantic disposition never showed in intercourse with must kiss marie hand press marie wrist hold dialogue by eye with marie with wife speech be not exactly yea yea nay nay yes yes be not unnatural therefore that must specially dislike weakness of came from emotional temperament must just let thing go a though there be nothing special at said again to before supper in whisper 'and so do what must have say ' mind petting just be a must be other day be a must be other day replied however knew that wife be right be in certain way aware that if must only change be sort of man might manage matter better must be fiercely angry caressingly affectionate be unable to adopt safe golden mean wife recommended must not keep from interchanging piteous glance two with marie at supper put great deal too much unction into caress to please madame voss when marie came to kiss before went to bed in mean time marie be quite aware that be incumbent on to determine what must do may be a well to declare at once that have determined have determined fully before uncle george have started for walk up to wood cutting when be giving breakfast that morning mind be fully made up have have night to lie awake upon to think over to realise george have told have come to a quite new thing that man whom worshipped worshipped too while believed that nobody else loved when must tell that fate be nothing to anybody a long a have seemed to that world for must be cold hard material so long must reconcile to herself after painful dubious fashion idea of being wife of adrian urmand of other man kind of servitude be needful if uncle be decided that must be banished from house kind of servitude be proposed to at basle must do a well a when have learned truth truth so unexpected then such servitude became impossible to on morning when came down to give men breakfast have quite determined that let consequence be what might must never become wife of adrian urmand madame voss have told husband that when marie saw thing purchased for wedding coming into house very feeling that good have be bought must bind to engagement marie have thought of also be aware that must lose time in making purpose known so that article must be unnecessary might not be purchased on very morning while men have be up in mountain have sat with aunt hemming sheet intended a addition to already overflowing stock possessed by m urmand be with difficulty that have brought to do telling however that a linen be there must be hemmed when there have come question of marking sheet have evaded task not without raising suspicion in bosom of madame voss be a knew absolutely necessary that uncle must be informed of purpose when have come to after walk demanded of whether still intended to marry adrian urmand have answered falsely ' suppose so ' have said question question a be have be put to too abruptly to admit of true answer on spur of moment falsehood almost stuck in throat be misery to till must set right by clear declaration of truth have yet to determine what must do how must tell truth in what way must insure to herself power of carrying out purpose mind reader must remember be somewhat dark in matter be betrothed to man have always heard that betrothal be marriage yet knew of instance in marriage have be broken off after betrothal quite a ceremonious a own have be broken off without scandal special censure from church aunt indeed m le cure have ever since plighting of troth to m urmand spoken of matter in presence a though wedding be thing already nearly done not suggesting by tenor of speech that one must wish in case to make change pointing out incidentally that change be now out of question marie have be sharp enough to understand perfectly gist of aunt manoeuvre of priest incidental information thing must be done know feared one in doing of except uncle did fear that if simply told that must be done must have power over that must not succeed in what way must do first then tell afterwards at last determined that must write letter to m urmand show copy of letter to uncle when post must have taken so far out of granpere on way to basle a to make impossible that uncle must recall much of day after george departure much of night be spent in preparation of letter marie bromar be not so well practised in writing of letter a will be majority of young lady who may perhaps read history be difficult thing for to begin letter difficult thing for to bring to end letter be written sent post left granpere at about eight in morning taking letter by way of remiremont on day following george departure post took marie bromar letter to m urmand when be gone state of mind be very painful then be necessary that must show copy to uncle have posted letter between six seven with own hand have then come trembling back to inn fearful that uncle must discover what have done before letter must be beyond reach when saw mail conveyance go by on route to remiremont then knew that must begin to prepare for uncle wrath thought that have heard that letter be detained time at remiremont before went on to epinal in one direction to mulhouse in other looked at railway time table be hung up in one of passage of inn saw hour of departure of diligence from remiremont to catch train at mulhouse for basle when hour be passed conveyance of letter be insured then must show copy to uncle came into house about twelve eat dinner with wife in little chamber marie who be in out of room during time must not sit down with when pressed to do so by uncle declared that have eaten lately be not hungry be seldom that must sit down to dinner therefore gave rise to special remark a soon a meal be over michel voss got up to go out about business a be usual with then marie followed into passage michel ' said ' want to speak to for moment will come with ' 'what be about marie ' will come will show behow what will show ' be letter uncle michel come up stair will see ' then followed up stair in long public room be at hour deserted took out of pocket copy of letter to adrian urmand put into uncle hand 'it be letter uncle michel have written to m

promised to be wife can not be know have behaved very badly must be worse if be to go on deceive before knew have come to be fond of man find now though have struggled hard to do what uncle wish must not promise to love be wife have not told uncle michel yet will a soon a letter be gone ' be very very sorry for trouble have given did not mean to be bad hope that will forget try to forgive one know better than do how bad have be 'your most humble servant 'with greatest respect bearie bromar ' letter have taken long to write took uncle long to read before came to end of did not get through line without sundry interruption arose from determination to contradict at once assertion made 'you can not prevent coming ' said 'and will not be prevented 'of course have promised to be wife must be 'nonsense about deceiving be not deceived at be not fond of man be nonsense 'you must do what uncle wish must now must of course will love why ca let come a doe with others 'letter gone yes indeed now

eloquence upon niece endeavour to induce to authorise to contradict own letter appealed first to affection then to duty after having failed in appeal poured forth full vial of wrath upon head be ungrateful obstinate false unwomanly disobedient irreligious sacrilegious idiot in fury of anger there be hardly epithet of severe rebuke spared yet a cruel word left mouth assured that must all be taken to mean nothing if must only now tell that might nullify letter though have deserved bad thing have spoken of must be regarded a having deserved none of must again be accepted a having in point done duty if must only even now be obedient be not to be shaken have at last formed resolution uncle word have effect towards turning from 'uncle michel ' said at last speaking with much seriousness of purpose dignity of person be by mean thrown away upon 'if be what say have better go away from house know have be bad be bad to say must marry m urmand will not defend nothing on earth will make

of eye must not went at last off on road to colmar basle gnashing teeth in anger chapter xvi nothing be said to marie about sin on afternoon after uncle have started on journey everything in hotel be blank sad gloomy there be at rate negative comfort of silence marie be allowed to go about house do work without rebuke observed that cure m le cure gondin sat much with aunt during evening did not doubt that iniquity made subject of discourse m le cure gondin a be generally called at granpere being always so spoken of with full name title by large protestant portion of community be man very much respected by neighbourhood be respected by protestant because never interfered with never told behind back before face that must be damned a heretic never tried hopeless task of converting in intercourse with dropped subject of religion altogether a philologist entomologist will drop grammar insect in intercourse with to whom grammar insect be matter of indifference be respected by catholic of sort by who did not by who did adhere with strictness to letter of law of religion with former did duty perhaps without much enthusiasm preached to if must come listen to christened confessed absolved from sin of course after due penitence lived with too in friendly way pronouncing anathema against because be not a attentive to religious exercise a might have be with who took comfort in sacred thing who liked to go to early mass in cold weather to be punctual at ceremony to say rosary a surely a evening came who knew performed intricacy of fasting a ordered by bishop down to refinement of egg more le in whole lent absence of butter from day cookery with have that enthusiasm such people like to encounter in priest may say therefore that be wise man probably on whole good man that did good service in parish helped people along in life not inefficiently be small man with dark hair very closely cut with tonsure be visible not more than visible with black beard be shaved tuesday friday saturday evening be very black indeed on tuesday friday morning always wore black gown of office must go about parish with ordinary soft slouch hat thus subjecting appearance to absence of ecclesiastical trimness perhaps most enthusiastic of friend regretted madame voss certainly must have wished that must have have shaved at rate other day that must have abstained from showing in street of granpere without clerical hat though be very intimate with cure have conferred upon much material kindness have never dared to express opinion to upon matter during much of afternoon m le cure sat with madame voss not word be said to marie about disobedience by by nevertheless marie felt that sin be being discussed that lecture be coming have never quite liked m le cure not having special reason for disliking regarding a man who be perhaps little deficient in spirit perhaps trifle too mindful of creature comfort m le cure took great deal of snuff marie did not like snuff taking uncle smoked great deal of tobacco that thought very nice proper in man have uncle taken snuff priest smoked tobacco must probably have equally approved of uncle practice disapproved that of priest because loved one did not love other have thought probable that might be sent for during evening have therefore made for immensity of household work performance of on very evening interest of lion d'or must imperatively demand work be done message from aunt josey summoned marie into little parlour nevertheless marie have be quite right in judgment on following morning between eight nine m le cure be again in house have cup of coffee taken to in little parlour marie who felt angry at return must not take sent in by hand of peter veque peter veque returned in few minute with message to marie saying that m le cure wished to see 'tell that be very busy ' said marie beay that uncle be away that there be deal to do ask if day wo suit a well ' knew when sent message day must not suit a well must have known also that uncle absence made difference in work peter came back with request from madame voss that marie must go to at once marie pressed lip together clenched fist walked down into room without delay of instant dear ' said madame voss be le cure wish to speak to will leave for few minute there be nothing for to listen marie must not refuse to be lectured by priest told that having have courage to resist uncle certainly be out of question that one else must have power to move bey dear marie began cure aunt have be telling of little difference between affianced husband wo sit down marie because will be able so to talk more comfortably ' want to talk about at said marie sat down a be bidden dear be needful that friend must talk to be sure that have too much sense to think that young woman like must refuse to hear friend marie have almost on tongue to tell priest that only friend to whom chose to listen be uncle aunt thought that might perhaps be better that must remain silent 'of course dear young person like must know that must walk by advice be sure must feel that one can give more fittingly than own priest then took large pinch of snuff 'if be anything to do with church yes ' said 'and have to do with church very much indeed know how of duty in life can not have to do with church there can be duty omitted a to must not acknowledge that be necessary that must get absolution from priest ' must be in church said marie not quite knowing how to make good point 'whether be in church out of be just same if be sick in bed must priest be nothing to then ' 'but be quite well father gondin ' 'well in health sick in spirit a be sure must own must explain to dear that be matter in religious duty be specially in question have be betrothed know to m urmand ' 'but people betrothed be very often not married ' said marie quickly 'there be annette lolme at saint die be betrothed to jean stein at pugnac be only last winter then there be something wrong about money betrothal went for nothing father carrier said be all right if be right for annette lolme must be right for a far a betrothing go ' story marie told so clearly be perfectly true m le cure gondin knew that be true wished now to teach marie that if certain circumstance must occur after betrothal must make marriage inexpedient in eye of parent of young people then authority of church must not exert to insist on sacred nature of pledge that if pledge be to be called in question simply at instance of capricious young woman then church must have full power object in short be to insist on parental authority giving to parental authority little additional strength from own sacerdotal recognition of sanctity of betrothing promise feared that marie must be too strong for if not also too clear headed 'you can not mean to tell ' said 'that think solemn promise a have given to young man taking one from a solemn in return be to go for nothing ' be very sorry that promised very sorry indeed can not keep promise ' 'you be bound to keep especially a friend wish marriage think that will be good for annette be friend wished not to marry be duty to tell marie that if break faith to m urmand will commit very grievous sin will commit with eye open ' annette lolme might change mind because lover have not got a much money a people wanted be sure may change mine because love man 'annette did what friend advised ' 'then girl must always do what friend tell if marry m urmand sha' be wicked for breaking promise for disobeying uncle michel 'you will be wicked in way ' said priest m le cure if have married m urmand know must be wicked to leave must do best to live with make good wife have found out in time ca love therefore be sure ought not to marry wo ' there be much more said between m le cure gondin be not able to prevail in least tried to cajole tried to persuade by threat tried to conquer by gratitude affection towards uncle must not prevail at 'it be of use staying here longer m le cure said at last 'because be quite sure that nothing on earth will induce to consent be very sorry for what have done if tell have sinned will repent confess have repented be very very sorry know now be very wrong ever to think possible must be wife ca make think that be wrong in then left a soon a be gone madame voss returned to hear priest report a to success in mean time michel voss have reached basle arriving there five hour before marie letter in ignorance of law have made futile attempt to intercept letter before reached hand of m urmand be with urmand when letter be delivered endeavoured to persuade young friend not to open in doing be obliged to explain to certain extent what be nature of letter be obliged to say so much about a to justify unhappy lover in asserting that must be better for that must know content rate will promise not to believe ' said michel did succeed in obtaining from m urmand sort of promise that must not regard word of letter a in truth expressing marie real resolution know be such queer cattle said michel 'they think about manner of thing then know what be thinking ' 'but who be other man demanded adrian a soon a have finished letter one judging from countenance when asked question must have imagined that in spite of promise believed word have be written to face be picture of blank despair voice be low hoarse 'you must know whom mean ' added when michel did not at once reply 'yes know whom mean ' be then m voss ' 'it be george of course ' replied innkeeper did not know ' said poor adrian urmand never spoke dozen word to other man in life a for have hardly seen for last eighteen month have come over said something to like traitor have reminded of childish promise old vow something said when be child meaning nothing so have frightened ' be never told that there be anything between ' said urmand beginning to think that must become to be indignant 'there be nothing to tell literally nothing ' must have be writing to other ' 'never line on word a man be just a tell when george went from home there have be fooling a thought between be glad that must go did think meant anything ever must ' a michel voss said there did occur to idea perhaps after have be wrong to interfere in first instance that there have then be really valid reason why george must not have married marie bromar did not in least influence judgment a to what might be expedient to do now be still a sure a ever that a thing stood now be duty to do in power to bring about marriage between niece adrian urmand since there have be nothing ' continued 'absolutely nothing ask will tell so be romantic idea of hers that ought to stick to first promise now that have be reminded of ' did not convince adrian urmand who for while expressed opinion that must be better for to take marie refusal thus to let matter drop must be very bitter to because basle have now heard of proposed marriage whole shower of congratulation have already fallen upon from fellow townspeople thought that must be more bitter to be rejected again in person by marie bromar then to be stared at by native of granpere acknowledged that george voss be traitor must have be ready to own marie be have michel voss given encouragement in direction michel throughout whole morning be closeted together for hour declared that poor marie be more sinned against than sinning if adrian be once more over at granpere must be made right at last michel voss prevailed persuaded young man to return with to lion d'or started early on following morning travelled to granpere by way of colmar mountain father thus passed twice through colmar on occasion did call upon son chapter xvii there have be very little said between michel voss urmand on journey towards granpere till be at top of vosges on mountain road at place have to leave little carriage bait horse indeed michel have be asleep during almost entire time on night one before have not be in bed at having reached basle after midnight having passed hour morning visit to urmand house in futile endeavour to stop poor marie letter departure of traveller from basle on morning have be very early so that poor innkeeper have be robbed of proper allowance of natural rest have slept soundly in train to colmar have afterwards slept in little caleche have taken to top of mountain urmand have sat silent by side by mean anxious to disturb companion because have determined plan ready to communicate once twice before reached colmar have thought that must go back again have be felt badly treated though be very fond of marie must be better for perhaps to wash hand of whole affair be so thinking whole way to colmar be afraid of michel voss when got out upon platform there have resolution ready to be declared a fixed then have hired little carriage michel voss have slept again have slept all through munster up steep mountain be not thoroughly awake till be summoned to get out at wonderfully fine house for refreshment late emperor caused to be built at top of hill here went into restaurant a michel voss be known to man who kept ordered bottle of wine 'what terrible place to live in winter said a looked down through window right into deep valley below from spot on house be built can see broken wooded ground of steep descent then broad plain stretch away to valley of rhine 'there be nothing snow here after christmas ' continued michel 'and perhaps not christian over road for day together must like know may be very well just now ' adrian urmand be altogether inattentive to scenery now before to prospect of mountain innkeeper winter life knew that two hour half must take down mountain into granpere when there must be at once necessary that must begin task idea of be by mean pleasant to be quite sure now that wished have remained at basle that have accepted marie letter a final told again again that must not make marry if chose to change mind what be to say what be to do when got to granpere place almost wished that have never seen in spite of profitable linen buying now when michel voss began to talk to about scenery what man up in mountain did in winter at moment when terrible trouble be so very near felt to be insult at least cruelty can do from december till april except smoke drink ' asked michel voss ' care what doe ' said urmand turning away ' only know wish 'd never come here ' 'take glass of wine friend ' said michel 'the mountain air have made chill ' urmand took glass of wine did not cheer much 'we will have right before day be over ' continued michel ' think will ever be all right ' said other 'and why not fact be understand young woman a how must seeing that have not have to manage do a tell just be round with tell that desire change after what have passed ca allow to think of thing speak a though have downright claim a have will come right be not that care for know must remember that have never even said word of kind have doubt on mind a to really like best be that stupid promise way that george have have of making believe that be bound by first word ever spoke to young man be only nonsense of course must get over ' then be summoned out horse having finished meal be rattled down hill into granpere without many more word between one other word be spoken that word be hardly pleasant in tone urmand at least did not relish ' will go away at once if doe treat a ought ' said just a be entering village michel be silent for moment before answered 'you will behave be sure a man ought to behave to young woman whom intends to make wife ' word be civil enough there be tone in innkeeper voice flame in eye made urmand almost feel that have be threatened then drove into space in front of door of lion d'or michel have made for plan whatsoever led way at once into house urmand followed hardly daring to look up into face of person around be of soon in presence of madame voss marie bromar be not there marie have be sharp enough to perceive who be coming before be out of carriage be already ensconced in safer retreat up stair in must meditate on plan of campaign lively get something to eat ' said michel meaning to be cheerful possessed 'we left basle at five have not eaten mouthful since be now nearly four o'clock bread cheese have be served with wine on top of mountain have of course gone for nothing madame voss immediately began to bustle about calling cook peter veque to assistance nothing for while be said about marie urmand trying to look a though be possessed stood with back to stove whistled for few minute during bustling about table went on michel be wrapped in thought said nothing at last have made up mind spoke 'we might a well make dash at at once said 'where be marie ' one answered 'where be marie bromar asked again angrily knew that behoved now to take upon at once real authority of master of house behe be up stair said peter who be straightening table cloth 'tell to come down to ' said uncle peter departed immediately for while there be silence in little room adrian urmand felt heart to palpitate disagreeably indeed manner in must appear that innkeeper proposed to manage business be distressing enough to seemed a though be intended that must discus little difficulty with marie in presence of whole household stood ground sounded one more ineffectual little whistle in few minute peter returned said nothing 'where be marie bromar again demanded michel in angry voice told to come down ' said peter 'well think be coming ' said peter 'what did say ' word only bade go down then michel walked into kitchen a though be about to fetch recusant stopped asked wife to go up to marie madame voss did go up after return there be whispering between husband behe be upset by excitement of return ' michel said at last 'and must give little grace come will eat dinner ' in mean time marie be sitting on bed up stair in most unhappy plight really loved uncle almost feared did fear with sort of fear be produced by reverence habit of obedience when softened by affection hardly make known a fear except on troublous occasion be oppressed by remembrance of be due from to to aunt feeling a be natural that must do in compliance with manner habit of people that owed duty of obedience in matter of marriage though have be able to hold own against priest have be quite firm in opposition to aunt who be in truth woman much le strong by nature than dreaded farther dispute with uncle must not bear to think that must be enabled to accuse with justice of ingratitude have be great pleasure to be true to have answered truth by perfect confidence have given charm to life now must all be over must be driven again to beg to send away that might become household drudge elsewhere now that very moment of agony have come that man to whom have given promise be there to claim how be to go down say what have to say before world be perfectly clear to that in accordance with reception of urmand at first moment of meeting so must be continued conduct towards till must leave else take away with must not smile on shake hand with cut bread for pour out wine after letter a have written to without signifying thereby that letter be to go for nothing now let what might happen letter be not to go for nothing letter be to remain true fact true letter ' ca go down aunt josey indeed ca ' said ' be not well must drop pray tell uncle michel with best love with duty that ca go to now ' sat still upon bed not weeping clasping hand trying to see way out of misfortune dinner be eaten in grim silence after dinner michel still grimly silent sat with friend on bench before door smoked cigar while be smoking michel said never word be thinking of difficulty have to overcome be thinking also at odd moment whether own son george be not after better sort of lover for young woman than young man who be seated by side never occurred to that might find solution of difficulty by encouraging second idea urmand during time be telling that behoved to be man that sitting there in silence be hardly proof of manliness knew that be being ill treated that must do something to redress own wrong if only knew how to do be quite determined that must not be coward that must stand up for own right if young woman wo marry man man ca make do so either by scolding by fighting of friend in case young lady friend be on side weight of half hour of silence of michel gloom be intolerable to at last got up declared must go see old woman who must have linen to sell 'as be here might a well do stroke of work ' said striving to be jocose 'do said michel 'and in mean time will see marie bromar ' whenever michel voss be heard to call niece marie bromar using two name be understood by who heard about hotel that be not in good humour a soon a urmand be gone rose slowly from seat with heavy step went up stair in search of refractory girl went straight to own bedroom there found still sitting on bedside jumped up a soon a be in room running up to took by arm michel ' said 'pray pray be good to pray spare ' be good to ' said ' try to be good to ' 'you know that love do not know that love ' then paused made answer to be surer of nothing in world than be of affection did not suit to acknowledge at moment ' must do anything for must do uncle michel pray ask to do ' then clasped tightly hung upon put up face to be kissed must not kiss 'ah said 'you mean to be hard to then must go then must go then must go 'that be nonsense marie can not go till go to husband where must go to 'it matter not where go to now ' bearie be betrothed to man must consent to become wife say that will consent nonsense will be forgotten did not say that must consent did not say that must not thought that might persuade if must speak to a ought doubted might be most efficacious affection severity have assured that must be duty to be very severe before gave up point might be possible a be so sweet with so loving so gracious that affection might prevail if so how much easier must task be to so put arm round stooped down kissed ' o uncle michel ' said 'dear dear uncle michel say that will spare be on side be good to ' bey darling girl be for own good for good of that must marry man do not know must not tell so if be not true can not be more good to than ' ' can not uncle michel ' why now what be have anybody be bringing tale to ' 'nobody have brought tale 'be there anything amiss with ' 'it be not that be not at be sure be excellent young man wish with heart have better wife than can ever be ' 'he think will be quite good enough for ' ' be not good for anybody be very bad ' 'leave to judge of ' 'but can not do uncle michel can never be adrian urmand wife ' why why why ' repeated michel who be beginning to be again angered by own want of success 'you have said that dozen time have never attempted to give reason will tell reason be because love george with heart with soul be so dear to must always be thinking of must not help must always have in heart must be right uncle michel if be married to man ' why did accept other man there be nothing changed since then ' be wicked then ' think be wicked at at rate did did think anything about having george in heart then be very hard for to answer for moment two be silenced at last found reply thought everything be dead within then that did signify since have be here have told ' wish have stayed where be with heart did not want here ' said innkeeper in anger did come uncle michel did not send for did come ' 'yes came have disturbed everything have arranged so happily look here marie lay command upon a uncle guardian may say also a best staunchest friend to be true to solemn engagement have made with young man will not hear answer from now leave with command urmand have come here at request because told that must be obedient if make fool of of of will be impossible must forgive will see evening will trust to good sense to receive with propriety ' then michel voss left room descended with ponderous step indicative of heavy heart marie when be alone again seated on bedside of course must see adrian urmand be quite aware that must not encounter now with half saucy independent air have come to quite naturally before have accepted must willingly humble in dust before if by so doing must induce to relinquish suit if must not do so if must not talk over uncle to be on what called side then what must do uncle entreaty to joined to too evident sorrow have upon effect so powerful that must hardly overcome have a thought resolved most positively that nothing must induce to marry adrian urmand have of course be very firm in resolution when wrote letter now now be almost shaken when thought only of must almost task to believe that after did not much matter what of happiness of unhappiness might befall if allowed to be taken to new home at basle must still work eat drink working eating drinking must wait till unhappiness must be removed be sufficiently wise to understand that a became middle aged woman with perhaps child around sorrow must melt into soft regret must be at least endurable what did signify after how much one being a herself might suffer world must go on in same way small trouble must be of little significance work must save from utter despondence when thought of george word in have expressed constancy of own love shipwreck must fall upon if be untrue to then again must become strong in determination uncle have threatened with lasting displeasure have said that must be impossible that must forgive must be unbearable yet when thought of george told that must be borne before hour of supper came aunt have be with have promised to see suitor alone there have be doubt on point between michel wife madame voss thinking that husband ought to be present michel have prevailed ' care what people may say replied ' know own girl know also what have right to expect ' so be settled marie understood that adrian be to come to in little brightly furnished sitting room upstairs on occasion took notice of hotel supper at be to be hoped that peter veque proved equal to occasion at about nine be seated in appointed place madame voss brought lover up into room 'here be m urmand come to speak to ' said 'your uncle think that have better see alone be sure will bear in mind what be that wish ' then closed door adrian marie be left together need hardly tell ' said 'what be feeling when uncle came to yesterday morning when opened letter read must hardly believe that have come from ' 'yes m urmand did come from 'and why what have done last word have spoken to be to declare that must be loving wife ' that m urmand never that when thought be to be so told must do best to do duty by ' beay that once more will be right never promised must love must not promise be very wicked to allow to give troth ca think worse of than think of ' 'but marie why must not love be sure must love ' 'listen to m urmand listen to be generous to think can be generous to poor girl who be very unhappy love say must not have loved if have be first why must not girl love be above in way rich well spoken of life have be le rough poor than mine be not have be proud what be there can be proud of except uncle trust in george voss have come to before have made promise must love do love how can help if wished to help o m urmand can not be generous think how little be that will lose adrian urmand did not like to be told of girl love for man generosity must almost have be more easily reached have told of george love for people have assured since be engaged that marie bromar be handsomest girl in lorraine alsace felt to be injury that handsome girl must prefer one a george voss to marie with woman sharpness perceived accurately bemember said have hardly seen when george be when became such friend 'your uncle doe want to marry son ' will never become george wife without consent never what must be use of giving way ' asked urmand 'he must never consent ' paused for moment before replied save ' said 'from living with woman who can not love to save from living with man can not love 'and be to be answer will give ' 'it be request have to make to ' said marie 'then have better go down to uncle went down to michel voss leaving marie bromar again alone chapter xviii people of colmar think colmar to be considerable place far be from to hint that be not so be be in day when alsace be french chief town of department of haut rhine bristle with barrack be busy with cotton factory have be accustomed to presence of prefet be doubt important be not so large that people going in out of can pas without attention take to be really true line of demarcation between big town little one have michel voss adrian urmand passed through lyon strasbourg on journey to granpere one must have noticed acquaintance in of city must not have be bit wiser be not probable that must leave train at colmar station hire daniel bredin caleche for mountain journey thence to granpere without fact of case coming to ear of madame faragon when have heard news of course told to george voss have interested very keenly in affair of george love partly because have soft heart of own loved ray of romance to fall in upon a sat fat helpless in easy chair partly because thought that future landlord of hotel de la poste at colmar ought to be regarded a bigger man better match than swiss linen merchant in world ' ca think what be that father mean have said 'when be young used not to be so fond of people of basle did think so much then of peddling buyer of sheeting shirting madame faragon be rather fond of alluding to past time of hinting to george that in early day have be willing might have be mistress of lion d'or at granpere instead of poste at colmar george never quite believed boast a knew that madame faragon be at least ten year older than father 'he used to think ' continued madame faragon 'that there be nothing better than good house in public line with well spirited woman inside to stand ground hold own everything be changed now since railroad came up pedlar become merchant respectable old shopkeeper must go to wall george must hear in silence though knew that old friend be endeavouring to comfort by making little of basle linen merchant now when madame faragon learned that michel voss adrian urmand have gone through colmar back from basle on way to granpere immediately foresaw what be to happen marie marriage be to be hurried on george be to be thrown overboard pedlar pack be to be triumphant over sign of innkeeper be george must dash in among at once said madame faragon george be silent for minute two leaving room returning to before made answer then declared that must dash in among at granpere 'it will be better to go over see settled said george wo quarrel ' do mean by quarrelling suppose that man can be very dear friend when meet other 'you wo have fighting o george if thought there be going to be fighting must go to prevent ' madame faragon doubt be sincere in desire that there must be fighting nevertheless there be life reality about little affair have gratifying effect upon 'if thought must do good really must go said again afterwards george did not encourage to make attempt more be said about early on following morning in truth long before morning have dawned george have started upon journey following father m urmand in route over mountain be third time have gone to granpere in course of present autumn on time have gone without invitation without warning yet previous to have remained above year at colmar without taking notice of family knew that father must not make welcome almost doubted whether must be proper for to drive direct to door of hotel father have told when be last parting from other that be nothing trouble be trouble ' father have said to then father have threatened to have turned from door by servant if must come to house again before marie adrian be married be not afraid of father felt that have right to treat lion d'or a own home unless be prepared to obey father knew nothing a to marie purpose have learned from be left to herself must give with heart to must not be left to herself only knew now that adrian urmand be being taken back to granpere of course with intention that marriage must be at once perfected madame faragon have doubt be right in advice a to dashing in among at once be to be done must be done now be by mean clear to how be to carry on war when found among at granpere be now october morning on mountain be very dark cold have started from colmar between three four so that have passed through munster be ascending hill before six stopped too fed horse at emperor house at top fortified with tumbler of wine hunch of bread meant to go into granpere claim marie a own must go to priest to pastor if necessary forbid authority to lend countenance to proposed marriage must speak mind plainly must accuse father of extreme cruelty must call upon madame voss to save niece must be very savage with marie hoping that might thereby save from herself defying to say before man god that loved man whom be about to make husband a to adrian urmand still thought must worst come to worst must try process of choking upon adrian urmand use of personal violence must be distasteful to contrary to nature be not man who in ordinary way of life must probably lift hand against such liftings of hand on part of other men regarded a falling back to truculence of savage life men must manage coerce other with tongue with money with law according to theory of life on such occasion a found obliged to acknowledge that if worst must come to worst attempt at choking enemy must be made must be made for marie sake if not for own in mood of mind drove down to granpere not knowing where else to stop drew up horse in middle of road before hotel stable servant who be hanging about immediately came to there be father standing alone at door of house be now ten o'clock have expected that father must have be away from home a be custom at hour innkeeper mind be at present too full of trouble to allow of going off to woodcutting to farm adrian urmand after failure with marie on preceding evening have not again gone down stair have taken at once to bedroom have remained there gloomy unhappy very angry with marie bromar if possible more angry with michel voss knowing a must have known how land lay why have innkeeper brought from basle to granpere found to have be taken in from first to last by whole household must at moment have be glad to obliterate granpere altogether from among valley of vosges so went to bed in wrath michel madame voss sat below waiting for above hour madame voss more than once proposed that must go up see what be happening be impossible declared that must be talking together that time husband have stayed 'whatever have to say let say out ' seemed to that marie must be giving way if submitted to so long interview when at last madame voss did go up stair learned from maid that m urmand have be in bed ever so long on going to marie chamber found sitting where have sat before 'yes aunt josey will go to bed at once said 'give uncle love ' then aunt josey have returned to husband of have be able to extract comfort from affair of evening early on following morning m le cure be called to consultation be very distasteful to michel voss because be protestant having lived life with protestant son two roman catholic woman in house have come to feel that father gondin religion be religion for weaker sex troubled very little with doctrinal difference having slightest touch of idea that be to be saved because be protestant that be in peril because be roman catholic indeed be there such idea on side prevalent in valley what m le cure may have believed who can say never taught parishioner that protestant uncle wife child be to be damned michel voss be averse to priestly assistance now submitted to hardly knew how far betrothal be binding ceremony felt strongly that have committed to marriage that did not become to allow that son have be right also that if marie must only marry man must find quite happy in new home so m le cure be called in there be consultation m le cure be quite a hot in favour of marriage a be other person concerned be in first place infinitely preferable in eye that young parishioner must marry roman catholic be not able to undertake to use special thunder of church must tell young woman what be duty have done so if guardian wished must do so again very strongly did not know how be to do more then priest told story of annette lolme pointing out how well marie be acquainted with bearing of case consented to break off in case ' said michel be singular to observe how cruel have become against girl whom so dearly loved cure explained to again that church law must interfere to make marry m urmand might be explained to that must commit sin requiring penitence absolution if did not marry church must go farther than such be

people brought up together when began a fancied to be foolish elderly man be so apt to look upon own son a boy on girl who have grown up under nose a little more than child then george in day have have business of own must not have thought of such thing in way mind of michel voss have be forced into strong hostility against idea of marriage between marie son have filled with spirit of partisan on side of adrian urmand now a thing have gone have be made very unhappy by state of own mind consequently be beginning to feel great dislike for merchant from basle stupid mean little fellow with white pocket handkerchief scent black greasy hair have made way into house have destroyed comfort pleasure be light in michel be now disposed to regard previously honoured guest when made comparison between adrian george must not acknowledge that girl of spirit sense must prefer son be very proud of son proud even of lad disobedience to on subject feeling added to discomfort have twice seen marie

have said crossly 'if tell know will go at once said marie michel have muttered something about marie illness impossibility of doing anything at present again have left room then marie began to take heart of grace to think that victory might yet be on side how be george to know that be firmly determined to throw odious betrothal to wind feeling to be absolutely incumbent on to convey to knowledge wrote few word servant conveyed to lover making promise in regard to simply assuring that must never never never become wife of other man early on following morning michel voss went off by must not stay in bed must not hang about house did not know how to demean to of young men when met must not be cordial a ought to be with urmand must be austere to george with austerity felt must have be

effeminate wanted spirit smelt of hair grease michel have discovered none of defect have perhaps regarded characteristic a meritorious rather than otherwise while have be hotly in favour of marriage then hair grease rest of have in eye simply be sign of civilisation of town a contrasted with rusticity of country be then great thing in eye that marie must marry man so polished though much of polish may have come from pomade now idea be altered a sat alone upon log continued to turn up nose at poor m urmand how be to be rid of if not of be to do then be to let authority go by board allow two young people to marry although whole village heard how have pledged in matter a be sitting there suddenly son came upon frowned went on smoking though at heart felt grateful to george for having found out followed be altogether tired of being alone worse than of being left together with adrian urmand overture for general reconciliation must not come first from must be entertained without at

spirit than have be expected on part by enemy at lion d'or 'why must be betrothed to ' said michel 'of course be betrothed to see what be use of talking so much about ' 'it be first time have said word on subject since have be here ' said urmand be true a michel be continually thinking of betrothal imagined that everybody be always talking to of matter marie have now managed to get hand free have retired into kitchen michel followed stood meditative with back to large stove a happened there be one else present there at moment 'tell to go back to basle ' whispered marie to uncle michel only shook head groaned ' think be at well treated here among ' said adrian urmand to george a soon a be alone 'any special friendship from can hardly expect ' said george 'as to father rest of if ill

left colmar have not looked forward to welcome must induce to remain at granpere course of thing have be different from have expected be much too good general to think of returning now have friend in house who knew how to supply with what be most necessary to nobody have asked to stay father have not uttered word of welcome did stay michel must have be very much surprised indeed if have heard that have gone man in stable have ventured to suggest that old mare must not be wanted to go over mountain day to george assented made special request that old mare might receive gentle treatment so day passed away marie who have recovered health be busy a usual about house george urmand though did not associate be rarely long out of other sight one other found much opportunity for pressing suit george probably felt that there be not much need to do so urmand must have known that pressing of suit in ordinary way must be of avail innkeeper tried to make work for about place have carriage out washed inspected horse gave order a to future slaughter of certain pig everybody about house nevertheless down to smallest boy attached to inn knew that landlord mind be pre occupied with love affair of two men there be hardly inhabitant of granpere who did not understand what be going on have be custom of place to make bet on such matter very long odds must have be wanted before one must have backed adrian urmand yet two day ago be considered to be sure of prize m le cure gondin be good deal at hotel during day perhaps be staunchest supporter of swiss aspirant endeavoured to support madame voss having that strong dislike to yield inch in practice in doctrine be indicative of order strove hard to make madame voss understand that if only must be firm cause husband to be firm also marie must of course yield at last have ever so many young woman just in same way ' said cure must have thought be going to break heart a soon a ever have be married have forgotten ' madame voss must have be quite contented to comply with priest counsel must have seen way with husband have become almost manifest even to with cure to support that star of adrian urmand be on wane felt from word that marie spoke to that marie be confident of success may be said of madame voss that although have be forced by michel into kind of enthusiasm on behalf of swiss marriage have very eager wish of own on subject marie be own niece be dear to girl be sure of well to do husband whichever way war went what aunt need desire more for most favourite niece than well to do husband day went by supper be eaten cigar be smoked then went to bed nothing more have be settled that obstinate young man m adrian urmand though have talked of lawyer have said not word of going back to basle chapter xx be probable that concerned in matter who slept at lion d'or night made up mind that on following day power of establishment must come to decision be not right that young woman must have to live in house with two favoured lover a regarded young men be right that must be allowed to go on glaring at other michel madame voss feared that must do more than glare seeing that be so like two dog with one bone between who in emergency will generally fight urmand be quite alive to necessity of putting end to present exceptionally disagreeable position be very angry very angry naturally with marie who have thought treated villainously why have made little soft languid promise to when be last at granpere if have not then loved of course be angry with george voss what unsuccessful lover fails of being angry with happy rival then george have behaved with outrageous impropriety urmand be beginning now to have clear insight of circumstance george marie have be lover then george having be sent away have forgotten love for year more when girl have be accommodated with lover then thrust forward disturbed everybody arrangement conduct must have be worse than nevertheless urmand anger be hottest against michel voss have be left alone at basle have be allowed to receive marie letter act upon in accordance with own judgment must never have made ridiculous by appearing at granpere a discomfited lover innkeeper have come dragged away from home have misrepresented everything have carried away a be by force to scene of disgrace now threw over at rate michel voss must a adrian urmand felt very bitterly have be true constant michel whose face must not lie word might do be clearly a anxious to be rid of young friend a be of others in hotel urmand must have be very glad to be back at basle have come to regard farther connection with inn at granpere a extremely undesirable voss family be low have found that out during present visit how be to get away not look a be going like dog with tail between leg have so clear right to demand marie hand that must not bring to bear to be robbed of claim yet have come to perceive how very foolish marriage must be have be told that must do better of course must do better how must be rid of bargain without submitting to ill treatment if michel have not come fetched away from home ill treatment must have be by comparison slight of normal kind to young men be accustomed to be brought over to house then to be deserted by everybody in house how o how be to get out of house such be reflection a sat solitary in long public room drinking coffee eating omelet with peter veque have supplied have in truth be cooked for very carefully by marie bromar in present frame of mind marie must have cooked ortolan for have wished for while urmand be eating omelet thinking of wrong michel voss son be standing together at stable door michel have be there time before son have joined when george came up to put out hand almost furtively george grasped instantly then there came tear into innkeeper eye ' have brought little of tobacco be talking of ' said george taking small packet out of pocket ye george thank ye doe not much matter now what smoke thing be going wrong get satisfaction out of anything ' say that father ' can help saying look at fellow up there what be to do with what be to say to mean to stay there till get wife ' will never get wife here if stay till house fall on ' ' can see now what be to say to how be to get rid of there be denying know that have be treated badly among ' 'must take little money father ' be not so bad a ' ' must not have thought so only talked to about lawyer ' did that in anger by george if be in position must try raise very devil talk of giving money george be not bad in way ' 'he must have said anything about lawyer ' wait till be placed a be will find that will say anything come uppermost what be to do with george ' then matter be discussed in utmost confidence in bearing george offered to have carriage pair of horse got ready for remiremont then to tell young man that be expected to get into go away michel felt that there must be more ceremonious treatment than george then suggested that cure must give message michel again objected message felt must be given by doing must be very bitter to because must be necessary that must humble before scented shiny head of little man michel knew that must be so urmand have be undoubtedly ill treated among apology for ill treatment must be made by chief of family ' suppose might a well go to alone ' said michel groaning yes must say so replied son beoonest begun soonest over suppose might a well order horse to latter suggestion father made reply went slowly into house turned for moment into marie little office stood there hesitating whether must tell mission a be to be made happy why must not know two have got better of among ' said two uncle michel 'which two why george what be to do with gentleman upstairs pass to think thank heaven will be great many year before flos want husband flos be little daughter up stair who be a yet more than five year old hope uncle michel will never have anybody else a naughty troublesome a have be ' said marie pressing close to be indescribably happy be to be saved from lover whom did not want be to have lover whom did want over above spirit of kind feeling full sympathy existed once more between dear friend a offered advice in regard to disposal of gentleman up stair michel be obliged to go upon painful duty trusting to own wit in long room up stair found adrian urmand sitting at closed window looking out at duck who be paddling in temporary pool made by late rain have be painfully in want of something to do so much so that have more than once almost resolved to put thing into bag leave house without saying word of farewell to one have there be mean for to escape from granpere without saying word must have done so at granpere there be railway only public conveyance in out of place started from door of lion d'or started morning with much ceremony so that be impossible for to fly unobserved there be watching duck when michel entered room very much disposed to quarrel with one who approached `` m afraid find rather dull here ' said michel beginning conversation be dull very dull indeed 'that be worst of be dull people here in country have not distraction town folk can always find there be not much to do nothing to look at ' little to look at be worth trouble of looking ' said urmand there be malignity of satire intended in for young man in wrath with full conviction of what be coming upon have intended to include betrothed in catalogue of thing of granpere not worthy of inspection michel voss did not at follow so far a ' never saw place continued urmand 'there be soul even to play game of billiards with ' now michel voss although for purpose have be willing to make little of own village did in truth consider that granpere be at rate a good place to live in a basle felt that though might abuse granpere be very uncourteous in adrian urmand to do so think much of playing billiards in morning must own ' said ' daresay not ' said urmand still looking at duck michel have made no progress a yet so sat down scratched head more thought of larger difficulty seemed to be be quite aware now that be own unfortunate journey to basle have brought so heavy burden on be a yet more than three four day since have taken upon to assure young man that by own authority must make everything right now be forced to acknowledge that everything be wrong be urmand said at last 'it have be very great grief to very great grief indeed that must have found thing so uncomfortable ' 'what thing do mean ' said urmand 'well everything about marie know when went over to basle other day did think how be going to turn out did indeed ' how be going to turn out ' ca make young woman consent know ' said innkeeper tell m voss must have young woman a call

anything against of woman who live in may abuse a much a please george too if will do good there have be mistake made owe something ' 'by heaven yes do ' 'but sha' take out in saying anything against marie bromar not in hearing ' what will do ' drive to do anything m urmand if there be compensation possible course there must be compensation ' 'what be will take be money ' beoney a for money be better off than of 'what be then want girl ' 'no certainly not must not take if came knelt to ' 'what can do then if will only say ' want want know what want have be cruelly ill used made fool of before everybody never heard of such case before never have be so generous honest to did not ask for franc of dot now come offer money think man ever be so badly used anywhere ' on saying adrian urmand in very truth burst into tear innkeeper heart be melted at once be so true between have treated very badly then there have be so many unfortunate unavoidable mistake when young man talked of compensation what be michel voss to think son have be led into exactly same error nevertheless repented bitterly in that have said anything about money be prepared to make most abject apology adrian urmand have fallen into chair michel voss came seated close beside ' beg pardon urmand do indeed ought not to have mentioned money when spoke of compensation 'it be that be that be feeling then white cambric handkerchief be taken out used with considerable vehemence from moment innkeeper goodwill towards urmand returned though of course be quite aware that there be place for in family there be anything can do will do ' said michel piteously 'it have be unfortunate know have be very unfortunate did mean to be untrue have only left alone when be at home ' said unfortunate young man who be still sobbing bitterly two remained in long room together for considerable time during of michel voss be a gentle a though urmand have be child did poor rejected lover again have recourse to violence of abuse though must over over again repeat opinion that surely since lover be first known in world betrothal of marriage first made one have ever be so ill used a be soon became clear to michel that great grief did not come from loss of wife from feeling that everybody must know that have be ill used there be shopkeeper in own town said who have heard of approaching marriage what be to say when went back 'just say that found so rough rustic ' said michel voss urmand knew well that such saying on part must be believed think will go to lyon said 'and stay there for six month what be business
