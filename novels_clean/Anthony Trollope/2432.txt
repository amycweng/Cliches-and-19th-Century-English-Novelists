grandeur economy will mr proudie forgive desecration of sabbath in such matter mr proudie allows to be often guided by eloquent preacher rev mr slope a dr proudie be guided by wife necessarily follows that eminent man have named have obtained good deal of control over dr proudie in matter concerning religion mr slope only preferment have hitherto be that of reader preacher in london district church on consecration of friend new bishop readily gave up to undertake onerous congenial duty of domestic chaplain to bishop mr slope however on first introduction must not be brought before public at tail

there have be passage of love between eldest hope olivia have hitherto resulted in favourable arrangement in truth mr slope having made declaration of affection afterwards withdrew on finding that doctor have immediate worldly fund with to endow child may easily be conceived that miss proudie after announcement on part be not readily disposed to receive further show of affection on appointment of dr proudie to bishopric of barchester mr slope view be in truth somewhat altered bishop even though be poor can provide for clerical child mr slope began to regret that have not be more disinterested sooner heard tidings of doctor elevation than recommenced siege not violently indeed respectfully at distance olivia proudie however be girl of spirit have blood of two peer in vein

have hard battle to fight for power patronage of see must be equally coveted by great mind mr proudie must also choose to be bishop of barchester mr slope however flattered that must outmanoeuvre lady

be exercised thus purposely ignoring archdeacon hitherto unlimited dominion over diocese at large be aware that lordship depended greatly on assistance dr grantly must be able to give in portion of

only own courage tact to depend on nevertheless be perfectly self assured did not doubt that must soon get better of weak men who trusted so much to external a bishop archdeacon appeared to do 'do reside in barchester dr grantly asked lady with sweetest smile dr grantly explained that lived in own parish of plumstead episcopi few mile out of city whereupon lady hoped that distance be not too

horse must not come down to barchester at present whenever horse did come down must take earliest opportunity of calling at plumstead episcopi providing distance be not too great for country visiting archdeacon made fifth bow have made one at mention of horse promised that mr grantly must do herself honour of calling at palace on early day mr proudie declared that must be delighted have liked to ask not being quite sure whether mr grantly have horse besides distance might have be c c dr grantly again bowed said nothing must have bought single individual possession of whole family of proudies have restored a gift without much feeling loss have kept separate pair of horse for exclusive use of wife since day of marriage whereas mr proudie have be hitherto jobbed about street of london at so much month during season at other time have managed to walk hire smart fly from livery stable 'be arrangement with reference to sabbath day school generally pretty good in archdeaconry ' beabbath day school repeated archdeacon with affectation of surprise word ca tell depends mainly on parson wife daughter there be none at plumstead ' be almost fib on part of archdeacon for mr grantly have very nice school to be sure be not sunday school exclusively be not so designated exemplary lady always attends there hour before church hears child say catechism see that be clean tidy for church with hand washed shoe tied grisel florinda daughter carry thither basket of large bun baked on saturday afternoon distribute to child not especially under disgrace bun be carried home after church with considerable content eaten hot at tea being then split toasted child of plumstead must indeed open eye if heard venerated pastor declare that there be sunday school in parish mr slope merely opened eye wider slightly shrugged shoulder be not however prepared to give up darling project ' fear there be great deal of sabbath travelling here ' said 'on looking at 'bradshaw see that there be three train in three train out sabbath must nothing be done to induce company to withdraw think dr grantly that little energy might diminish evil ' 'not being director really ca say if can withdraw passenger company dare say will withdraw train said doctor merely question of dividend 'but surely dr grantly ' said lady beurely must look at differently for instance in position surely must do that can to control so grievous sin think so mr harding turned to precentor who be sitting mute unhappy mr harding thought that porter stoker guard breaksmen pointsman ought to have opportunity of going to church hoped that have 'but surely surely ' continued mr proudie beurely be not enough surely will not secure such observance of sabbath a be taught to conceive be not only expedient by indispensable surely come what come might dr grantly be not to be forced into dissertation on point of doctrine with mr proudie yet with mr slope so without much ceremony turned back upon sofa began to hope that dr proudie have found palace repair have be such a to meet wish yes said lordship upon whole thought so upon whole did know that there be much ground for complaint architect perhaps might have double mr slope who have sidled over to bishop chair must not allow lordship to finish ambiguous speech 'there be one point must like to mention mr archdeacon lordship asked to step through premise see that stall in second stable be not perfect ' there be standing for dozen horsesbeaid archdeacon 'perhaps so ' said other have doubt of visitor know often require so much accommodation there be many of bishop relative who always bring own horse dr grantly promised that due provision for relative horse must be made a far at least a extent of original stable building must allow must communicate with architect 'and coach house dr grantly ' continued mr slope 'there be really hardly room for second carriage in large coach house smaller one of course hold only one ' 'and gas chimed in lady 'there be gas through house none in kitchen passage surely palace must have be fitted through with pipe for gas hot water too there be hot water laid on anywhere above ground floor surely there must be mean of getting hot water in bed room without having brought in jug from kitchen ' bishop have decided opinion that there must be pipe for hot water hot water be very essential for comfort of palace be indeed requisite in decent gentleman house mr slope have remarked that coping on garden wall be in many place imperfect mr proudie have discovered large hole evidently work of rat in servant bishop expressed utter detestation of rat there be nothing believed in world that so much hated a rat mr slope have moreover observed that lock of out house be very imperfect might specify coal cellar wood house mr proudie have also seen that on door of servant bedroom be in equally bad condition indeed lock through house be old fashioned unserviceable bishop thought that great deal depended on good lock quite a much on key have observed that fault very often lay with key especially if ward be in way twisted mr slope be going on with catalogue of grievance when be somewhat loudly interrupted by archdeacon who succeeded in explaining that diocesan architect rather foreman be person to be addressed on such subject that dr grantly have inquired a to comfort of palace merely a point of compliment be very sorry however that so many thing have be found amiss then rose from chair to escape mr proudie though have contrived to lend assistance in recapitulating palatial dilapidation have not on account given up hold of mr harding ceased from cross examination a iniquity of sabbatical amusement over over again have thrown out beurely surely ' at mr harding devoted head ill have that gentleman be able to parry attack have never before found subjected to nuisance lady hitherto when have consulted on religious subject have listened to what might choose to say with deference have differed differed in silence mr proudie interrogated then lectured thou thy son thy daughter thy man servant thy maid servant ' said impressively more than once a though mr harding have forgotten word shook finger at a quoted favourite law a though menacing with punishment then called upon categorically to state whether did not think that travelling on sabbath be abomination desecration mr harding have never be so hard pressed in life felt that ought to rebuke lady for presuming so to talk to gentleman clergyman so may year senior recoiled from idea of scolding bishop wife in bishop presence on first visit to palace moreover to tell truth be somewhat afraid of seeing sit silent absorbed by mean refrained from attack hope mr harding ' said shaking head slowly solemnly ' hope will not leave to think that approve of sabbath travelling ' looked look of unutterable meaning into eye there be standing for for mr slope be now looking at so be bishop so be archdeacon who have completed adieu on side of room mr harding therefore got up also putting out hand to mr proudie said will come to st cuthbert sunday will preach sermon on subject so archdeacon precentor took departure bowing low to lady shaking hand with lord escaping from mr slope in best manner must mr harding be again maltreated dr grantly swore deeply in bottom of heart that earthly consideration must ever again induce to touch paw of impure filthy animal now have pen of might poet must sing in epic verse noble wrath of archdeacon palace step descend to broad gravel sweep from whence small gate open out into street very near covered gateway leading to close road from palace door turn to left through spacious garden terminates on london road mile from cathedral till have passed small gate entered close neither of spoke word precentor clearly saw from companion face that tornado be to be expected be inclined to stop though by nature far le irritable than archdeacon even be angry even that mild courteous man be inclined to express in anything courteous term chapter vi war 'good heaven exclaimed archdeacon a placed foot on gravel walk of close raising hat with one hand passed other somewhat violently over now grizzled lock smoke issued from uplifted beaver a be cloud of wrath safety valve of anger opened emitted visible steam preventing positive explosion probably apoplexy 'good heaven archdeacon looked up to gray pinnacle of cathedral tower making mute appeal to still living witness have looked down on doings of so many bishop of barchester ' think will ever like mr slope ' said mr harding 'like ' roared archdeacon standing still for moment to give more force to voice 'like ' raven of close cawed assent old bell of tower in chiming hour echoed word swallow flying out from nest mutely expressed similar opinion like mr slope why be not very probable that barchester bred living thing must like mr slope 'nor mr proudie ' said mr harding archdeacon thereupon forgot will not follow example shock reader by transcribing term in expressed feeling a to lady who have be named raven last lingering note of clock bell be le scrupulous repeated in corresponding very improper exclamation archdeacon again raised hat salutary escape of steam be effected there be pause during precentor tried to realise fact that wife of bishop of barchester have be thus designated in close of cathedral by lip of own archdeacon must not do 'the bishop seems quiet man enough ' suggested mr harding having acknowledged to own failure ' exclaimed doctor who for nonce be not capable of more than spasmodic attempt at utterance did not seem very bright ' said mr harding 'and yet have always have reputation of clever man suppose be cautious not inclined to express very freely ' new bishop of barchester be already so contemptible creature in dr grantly eye that must not condescend to discus character be puppet to be played by others mere wax doll done up in apron shovel hat to be stuck on throne elsewhere pulled about by wire a others chose dr grantly did not choose to let down low enough to talk about dr proudie saw that must have to talk about other member of household coadjutor bishop who have brought lordship down a be

whom must bishop of barchester man even ape when once bishop must be respectable adversary if must fight what be such person a dr grantly to do when such person a mr slope be put forward a antagonist if archdeacon refused to combat mr slope must walk triumphant over field have diocese of barchester under heel if on other hand archdeacon accepted a enemy man whom new puppet bishop put before a such must have to talk about mr slope write about mr slope in matter treat with mr slope a being standing in degree on ground similar to own must have to meet mr slope to bah idea be sickening must not bring to have to do with mr slope 'he be most thoroughly bestial creature that ever set eye upon ' said archdeacon 'who bishop 'bishop be not talking about bishop how on earth creature got ordained will ordain anybody now know be be in church ten year used to be little careful ten year ago 'oh mean mr slope 'did ever see animal le like gentleman ca say felt much disposed to like ' 'like ' again shouted doctor assenting raven again cawed echo course like be not question of liking what be to do with ' 'do with ' asked mr harding 'yes what be to do with how be to treat there be there will stay have put foot in palace will never take out again till be driven how be to get rid of ' ' suppose can do much harm ' 'not do harm well think will find of different opinion before month be gone what must say now if got put into hospital must be harm mr harding mused awhile then said did think new bishop must put mr slope into hospital doe put there will put somewhere else where will be a bad tell that man to intent purpose will be bishop of barchester again dr grantly raised hat rubbed hand thoughtfully sadly over head scoundrel ' exclaimed after while dare to cross examine about sunday school in diocese sunday travelling too never in life met equal for sheer impudence why must have thought be two candidate for ordination ' declare thought mr proudie worst of two said mr harding woman be impertinent one must only put up with keep out of way in future be not inclined to put up with mr slope sabbath travelling ' doctor attempted to imitate peculiar drawl of man so much disliked beabbath

among men who have fixed principle standard idea of religion doctrine who take up popular cry a fellow have done about sabbath travelling ' dr grantly did not again repeat question aloud did so constantly to be to do with mr slope how be openly before world to show that utterly disapproved of abhorred man hitherto barchester have escaped taint of extreme rigour of church doctrine clergyman of city neighbourhood though very well inclined to promote high church principle privilege prerogative have never committed to tendency be somewhat too loosely called puseyite practice preached in black gown a father have done before wore ordinary black cloth waistcoat have not candle on altar either lighted unlighted made private genuflexion be contented to confine to such ceremonial observance a have be in vogue for last hundred year service be decently demurely read in parish church chanting be confined to cathedral science of intoning be unknown one young man who have come direct from oxford a curate at plumstead have after lapse of two three sunday made faint attempt much to bewilderment of poorer part of congregation dr grantly have not be present on occasion mr grantly who have own opinion on subject immediately after service expressed hope that young gentleman have not be taken ill offered to send kind of condiment supposed to be good for sore throat after there have be no more intoning at plumstead episcopi now archdeacon began to meditate on strong measure of absolute opposition dr proudie crew be of lowest possible order of church of england clergyman therefore behoved dr grantly to be of very highest dr proudie must abolish form ceremony therefore dr grantly felt sudden necessity of multiplying dr proudie must consent to deprive church of collective authority rule therefore dr grantly must stand up for full power of convocation renewal of ancient privilege be true that must not intone service must pressure co operation of number of gentlemanlike curate well trained in mystery of doing so must not willingly alter own fashion of dress must people barchester with young clergyman dressed in longest frock highest breasted silk waistcoat certainly be not prepared to cross to advocate real presence without going length there be various observance by adopting must plainly show antipathy to such men a dr proudie mr slope thing passed through mind a paced up down close with mr harding war war internecine war be in heart felt that a regarded mr slope one of two must be annihilated a far a city of barchester be concerned did not intend to give way until there be not left to inch of ground on must stand still flattered that must make barchester too hot to hold mr slope have weakness of spirit to prevent bringing about such consummation if be in power ' suppose susan must call at palace said mr harding 'yes will call there will be once once only dare say horse wo find convenient to come to plumstead very soon when once be done matter may drop suppose eleanor need call think eleanor must get on at well with mr proudie ' 'not least necessity in life ' replied archdeacon not without reflection that ceremony be necessary for wife might not be at binding on widow of john bold 'not slightest reason on earth why must do so if doe like for think that decent young woman must be subjected to nuisance of being in same room with man ' so two clergyman parted mr harding going to daughter house archdeacon seeking seclusion of brougham new inhabitant of palace did not express higher opinion of visitor than visitor have expressed of though did not use quite such strong language a dr grantly have done felt a much personal aversion be quite a well aware a be that there must be battle to be fought that there be hardly room for proudieism in barchester a long a grantlyism be predominant indeed may be doubted whether mr slope have not already within breast better prepared system of strategy more accurately defined line of hostile conduct than archdeacon dr grantly be going to fight because found that hated man mr slope have predetermined to hate man because foresaw necessity of fighting when have first reviewed carte de pay previous to entry into barchester idea have occurred to of conciliating archdeacon of cajoling flattering into submission of obtaining upper hand by cunning instead of courage little inquiry however sufficed to convince that cunning must fail to win over such man a dr grantly to such mode of action a to be adopted by mr slope then determined to fall back upon courage at once saw that open battle against dr grantly dr grantly adherent be necessity of position deliberately planned most expedient method of giving offence soon after arrival bishop have intimated to dean with permission of canon then in residence chaplain must preach in cathedral on next sunday canon in residence happened to be honourable reverend dr vesey stanhope who at time be very busy on shore of lake como adding to unique collection of butterfly for be so famous rather must have be in residence for butterfly other such summer day consideration vicar choral who be to take place in pulpit by mean objected to having word done for by mr slope mr slope accordingly preached if preacher can have satisfaction in being listened to mr slope ought to have be gratified have reason to think that be gratified that left pulpit with conviction that have done what intended to do when entered on occasion new bishop took seat for first time in throne allotted to new scarlet cushion drapery have be prepared with new gilt binding new fringe old carved oak wood of throne ascending with numerous grotesque pinnacle way up to rood of choir have be washed dusted rubbed looked very smart ah how often sitting there in happy early day on lowly bench in front of altar have whiled away tedium of sermon considering how best might thread way up amidst wooden tower climb safely to topmost pinnacle barchester went to hear mr slope for to gaze at new bishop best bonnet of city be there moreover best glossy clerical hat not stall have fitting occupant for though of prebendary might be away in

good performer though mr harding be not aware of extraordinary exertion on part yet probably rather exceeded usual mark others be doing best be natural that must emulate brother so service went on at last mr slope got into pulpit chose for text verse from precept addressed by st paul to timothy a to conduct necessary in spiritual pastor guide be immediately evident that good clergy of barchester be to have lesson to show approved unto god workman needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing word of truth ' be word of text with such subject in place may be supposed that preacher must be listened to by audience be listened to with breathless attention not without considerable surprise opinion of mr slope might have be held in barchester before commenced discourse none of hearer when be over must mistake for fool coward must not be becoming be to travesty sermon even repeat language of in page of novel in endeavouring to depict character of person of whom write be to certain extent forced to speak of sacred thing trust however that will not be thought to scoff at pulpit though may imagine that feel reverence be due to cloth may question infallibility of teacher hope that will not therefore be accused of doubt a to thing to be taught mr slope in commencing sermon showed slight tact in ambiguous manner of hinting humble a be stood there a mouthpiece of illustrious divine who sat opposite to having presumed so much gave forth very accurate definition of conduct prelate must rejoice to see in clergyman now brought under jurisdiction be only necessary to say that peculiar point insisted on be exactly be most distasteful to clergy of diocese most averse to practice opinion that peculiar habit privilege have always be dear to high church priest to party be now scandalously called high dry church be ridiculed abused anathematised now clergyman of diocese of barchester be of high dry church having thus according to own opinion explained how clergyman must show approved unto god a workman needeth not to be ashamed went on to explain how word of truth must be divided here took rather narrow view of question fetched argument from afar object be to express abomination of ceremonious mode of utterance to cry down religious feeling might be excited not by sense by sound of word in fact to insult cathedral practice have st paul spoken of rightly pronouncing instead of rightly dividing word of truth part of sermon must have be more to purpose preacher immediate object be to preach mr slope doctrine not st paul contrived to give necessary twist to text with skill must not exactly say preaching from cathedral pulpit that chanting must be abandoned in cathedral service by assertion must have overshot mark rendered absurd to delight of hearer must however did allude with heavy denunciation to practice of intoning in parish church although practice be not unknown in diocese from thence came round to undue preponderance asserted music over meaning in beautiful service have just heard be aware said that practice of ancestor must not be abandoned at moment notice feeling of aged must be outraged mind of respectable men must be shocked there be many be aware of not sufficient calibre of thought to perceive of not sufficient education to know that mode of service be effective when outward ceremony be of more moment than inward feeling have become barbarous at time when inward conviction be everything when word of minister lip must fall intelligibly into listener heart formerly religion of multitude have be affair of imagination now in latter

in advance of age now have new idea be quite time that barchester must go in advance mr slope might be right sunday certainly have to be strictly kept in barchester except a regarded cathedral service indeed two hour between service have long be appropriated to morning call hot luncheon then sunday school sabbath day school mr slope have called late bishop have really not thought of sunday school a must have done people probably did not reflect that catechism collect be quite hard work to young mind a book keeping be to elderly quite a little feeling of worship enters into one task a other then a regarded that great question of musical service there might be much to be said on mr slope side of question certainly be fact that people went to cathedral to hear music c c so party absolutely formed in barchester on mr slope side of question consisted among upper class chiefly of lady man be gentleman must possibly be attracted by mr slope consent to sit at foot of so abhorrent gamaliel lady be sometimes le nice in appreciation of physical disqualification provided that man speak to well will listen though speak from mouth never so deformed hideous wilkes be most fortunate a lover damp sandy haired saucer eyed red fisted mr slope be powerful only over female breast there be however one two of neighbouring clergy who thought not quite safe to neglect basket in for nonce be stored loaf fish of diocese of barchester only came to call on mr slope after performance in cathedral pulpit among mr quiverful rector of puddingdale whose wife still continued to present from year to year with fresh pledge of love so to increase care be to be hoped happiness equally who can wonder that gentleman with fourteen living child bare income of l year must look after loaf fish ever when be under thumb of mr slope very soon after sunday on sermon be preached leading clergy of neighbourhood held high debate together a to how mr slope must be put down in first place must never again preach from pulpit of barchester cathedral be dr grantly earliest dictum agreed providing only that have power to exclude dr grantly declared that power rested with dean chapter observing that clergyman out of chapter have claim to preach there saving only bishop to dean assented alleged contest on subject must be unseemly to rejoined meagre little doctor one of cathedral prebendary that contest must be on side of mr slope if prebendary be always there ready to take own place in pulpit cunning little meagre doctor whom suit well to live in own cosy house within barchester close who be well content to have little fling at dr vesey stanhope other absentee whose italian villa enticing london home be more tempting than cathedral stall residence to answered burly chancellor man rather silent indeed very sensible that absent prebendary have vicar in such case vicar right to pulpit be same a of higher order to dean assented groaning deeply at truth thereupon however meagre doctor remarked that must be in hand of minor canon one of whom might at hour betray trust whereon be heard from burly chancellor ejaculation sounding somewhat like 'pooh pooh pooh ' might have be that worthy man be blowing out heavy breath from windpipe why silence at suggested mr harding let not be ashamed to hear what man might have to preach to unless preached false doctrine in case let bishop silence so spoke friend vainly for human end must be attained by human mean dean saw ray of hope out of purblind old eye of yes let tell bishop how distasteful to be mr slope new bishop just come to seat must not wish to insult clergy while gloss be yet fresh on first apron then up rose dr grantly having thus collected scattered wisdom of associate spoke forth with word of deep authority when say up rose archdeacon speak of inner man then sprang up to more immediate action for doctor have bodily be standing along with back to dean empty fire grate tail of frock coat supported over two arm hand be in breech pocket 'it be quite clear that man must not be allowed to preach again in cathedral see that except dear friend here milk of whose nature run so softly that must not have heart to refuse pope loan of pulpit if pope must come ask must not however allow man to preach again here be not because opinion on church matter may be different from ours with one must not quarrel be because have purposely insulted when went up into pulpit last sunday studied object be to give offence to men who have grown old in reverence to thing of dared to speak so slightingly what to come here stranger young unknown unfriended stranger tell in name of bishop master that be ignorant of duty old fashioned useless know whether to most admire courage impudence one thing will tell that sermon originated solely with man bishop be more party to than be dean here know how grieved be to see bishop in diocese holding latitudinarian idea by dr proudie have made conspicuous know how greatly must distrust opinion of such man in matter hold to be blameless believe dr proudie have lived too long among gentleman to be guilty to instigate to be guilty of so gross outrage man uttered what be untrue when hinted that be speaking a mouthpiece of bishop suited ambitious view at once to throw down gauntlet to here within wall of own loved cathedral here where have for so many year exercised ministry without schism with good repute attack upon coming from quarter be abominable ' 'abominable groaned dean 'abominable muttered meagre doctor 'abominable re echoed chancellor uttering sound from bottom of deep chest really think be ' said mr harding beost abominable most unjustifiable ' continued archdeacon mr dean thank god that pulpit be still own own must say that pulpit belongs to dean chapter of barchester cathedral a yet mr slope be part of chapter mr dean have suggested that must appeal to bishop to abstain from forcing man on what if bishop allow to be ruled by chaplain in opinion matter be in own hand mr slope can not preach there without permission asked obtained let permission be invariable refused let participation in ministry of cathedral service be refused to then if bishop choose to interfere will know what answer to make to bishop friend here have suggested that man may again find way into pulpit by undertaking duty of of minor canon be sure that may fully trust to gentleman to support when be known that dean object to such transfer course may ' said chancellor there be much more discussion among learned conclave of of course ended in obedience to archdeacon command have too long be accustomed to rule to shake off so soon in particular case have none of wish to abet man whom be so anxious to put down meeting a have just recorded be not held in such city a barchester unknown untold of not only be fact of meeting talked of in respectable house including palace very speech of dean archdeacon chancellor be repeated not without many addition imaginary circumstance according to taste opinion of relaters however agreed in saying that mr slope be to be debarred from opening mouth in cathedral of barchester many believed that verger be to be ordered to refuse even accommodation of seat of most far going advocate for strong measure declared that sermon be looked upon a indictable offence that proceeding be to be taken against for brawling party who be inclined to enthusiastically religious young lady middle aged spinster desirous of move of course took up defence more warmly on account of attack if must not hear mr slope in cathedral must hear elsewhere must leave dull dean dull old prebendary scarcely le dull young minor canon to preach to other must work slipper cushion hem band for mr slope make happy martyr stick up in new sion sic bethesda put cathedral quite out of fashion dr mr proudie at once returned to london thought expedient not to have to encounter personal application from dean chapter respecting sermon till violence of storm have expended left mr slope behind nothing daunted went about work zealously flattering such a must listen to flattery whispering religious twaddle into ear of foolish woman ingratiating with very few clergy who must receive visiting house of poor inquiring into people prying into everything searching with minutest eye into palatial dilapidation did not however make immediate attempt to preach again in cathedral so all barchester be by ear chapter viii ex warden rejoices in probable return to hospital among lady in barchester who have hitherto acknowledged mr slope a spiritual director must not be reckoned widow bold sister in law on first outbreak of wrath of denizen of close none have be more animated against intruder than two lady be natural who must be so proud of musical distinction of own cathedral a favourite daughter of precentor who must be so likely to resent insult offered to old choir in such matter miss bold sister in law have one opinion wrath however have in degree be mitigated regret to say that lady allowed mr slope to be own apologist about fortnight after sermon have be preached be of not little surprised by hearing mr slope announced a page in button opened mr bold drawing room door indeed what living man must by mere morning visit have surprised more here be great enemy of be good in barchester coming into own drawing room have not strong arm ready tongue near at hand for protection widow snatched baby out of cradle into lap mary bold stood up ready to die manfully in baby behalf must under circumstance such sacrifice be necessary in manner be mr slope received when left be allowed by lady to take hand to make adieu a gentleman do who have be graciously entertained yes shook hand with be curtseyed out courteously buttoned page opening door a must have done for best canon of have touched baby little hand blessed with fervid blessing have spoken to widow of early sorrow eleanor silent tear have not rebuked have told mary bold that devotion must be rewarded mary bold have heard praise without disgust how have done how have so quickly turned aversion into at rate acquaintance how have overcome enmity with lady have be ready to receive made peace with so easily reader will guess from have written that like mr slope be constrained to admit that be man of part know how to say soft word in proper place know how to adapt flattery to ear of hearer know wile of serpent us must mr slope have adapted manner to men a well a to woman must ever have learnt way of gentleman might have risen to great thing commenced acquaintance with eleanor by praising father have said become aware that have unfortunately offended feeling of man of whom must not speak too highly must not now allude to subject be probably too serious for drawing room conversation must say that have be very far from to utter word in disparagement of man of whom world at least clerical world spoke of so highly a did of mr harding so went on unsaying great deal of sermon expressing highest admiration for precentor musical talent eulogising father daughter sister in law speaking in low silky whisper always have specially prepared for feminine ear ultimately gaining object when left expressed hope that might again be allowed to call though eleanor gave verbal assent to did not express dissent so mr slope right to visit at widow house be established day after visit eleanor told father of expressed opinion that mr slope be not quite so black a have be painted mr harding opened eye rather wider than usual when heard what have occurred said little must not agree in praise of mr slope be not practice to say much evil of one did not however like visit simple minded a be felt sure that mr slope have deeper motive than mere pleasure of making soft speech to two lady mr harding however have come to see daughter with other purpose than of speaking good evil of mr slope have come to tell that place of warden in hiram hospital be again to be filled up that in probability must once more return to old house twelve bedesman said laughing ' will be greatly shorn of ancient glory 'why so papa new act of parliament be to put on foot again continued beettles income at four hundred fifty pound per annum ' 'four hundred fifty said 'instead of eight hundred well be rather shabby still papa will have dear old house garden ' bey dear ' said 'it worth twice money a spoke showed jaunty kind of satisfaction in tone manner in quick pleasant way in paced eleanor drawing room 'it worth twice money will have house garden larger income than can possibly want ' 'at rate will have extravagant daughter to provide for a spoke young widow put arm within made sit on sofa beside 'at rate will not have expense ' dear will be rather lonely without wo think of now a regard income will have plenty for want will have old house mind owning now have felt sometimes inconvenience of living in lodging lodging be very nice for young men at time of life there be want of hardly know what to call perhaps not respectability ' papa be sure there be be nothing like nobody have thought nobody in barchester have be more respected than have be since took room in high street nobody not dean in deanery archdeacon at plumstead ' 'the archdeacon must not be much obliged to if heard ' said smiling somewhat at exclusive manner in daughter confined illustration to church dignitary of chapter of barchester 'but at rate will be glad to get back to old house since heard that be settled have begun to fancy ca be comfortable without two sitting room 'come stay with papa till be settled there be dear papa ye nelly wo do that must make two movings will be very glad to get back to old men again ala ala there have six of gone in few last year six out of twelve others fear have have sorry life of there poor bunce poor old bunce ' bunce be one of surviving recipient of hiram charity old man now over ninety who have long be favourite of mr harding 'how happy old bunce will be ' said mr bold clapping soft hand softly 'how happy will be to have back again ' may be sure there will soon be friendship among again when be there ' 'but ' said half laughing ' be to have new trouble will be terrible to there be to be twelve old woman matron how will manage twelve woman matron ' matron will manage woman of course 'and who will manage matron said behe wo want to be managed will be great lady suppose papa where will matron live be not to live in warden house with be ' 'well hope not dear ' 'oh papa tell fairly wo have matron for new step mother ' 'you sha dear be if can help be going to build house for matron woman believe have even fixed yet on site of building 'and have appointed matron said eleanor 'they have appointed warden yet replied 'but there be doubt about suppose ' said daughter mr harding explained that thought there be doubt that archdeacon have declared a much saying that bishop chaplain between have not power to appoint once else even if have will to do so sufficient impudence to carry out such will archdeacon be of opinion that though mr harding have resigned wardenship have done so unconditionally have done so under circumstance left bishop choice a to re appointment now that affair of hospital have be settled on new basis by act of parliament such be archdeacon opinion father in law received without shadow of doubt dr grantly have always be strongly opposed to mr harding resignation of place have done in power to dissuade from have considered that mr harding be bound to withstand popular clamour with be attacked for receiving so large income a eight hundred year from charity be not even satisfied that father in law conduct have not be pusillanimous undignified looked also on reduction of warden income a paltry scheme on part of government for escaping from difficulty into have be brought by public press dr grantly observed that government have more right to dispose of sum of four hundred fifty pound year out of income of hiram legacy than of nine hundred whereas a said bishop dean chapter clearly have right to settle what sum must be paid also declared that government have more right to saddle charity with twelve old woman than with twelve hundred be therefore very indignant on matter probably forgot when so talking that government have done nothing of kind have never assumed such might such right made common mistake of attributing to government in such matter be powerless doings of parliament in such matter be omnipotent though felt that glory honour of situation of warden of barchester hospital be indeed curtailed by new arrangement that whole establishment have to certain degree be made vile by touch of whig commissioner that place with lessened income old woman other innovation be very different from hospital of former day still archdeacon be too practical man of world to wish that father in law who have at present little more than l per annum for want must refuse situation defiled undignified commission ridden a be mr harding have accordingly made up mind that must return to old house at hospital to tell truth have experienced almost childish pleasure in idea of doing so diminished income be to not even source of momentary regret matron old woman did rather go against grain be able to console with reflection that after such arrangement might be of real service to poor of city thought that must receive re appointment a gift of new bishop probably through hand of mr slope annoyed little mind be set at rest by assurance of archdeacon that there must be favour in such presentation re appointment of old warden must be regarded by world a matter of course mr harding therefore felt hesitation in telling daughter that might look upon return to old quarter a settled matter wo have to ask for papa ' 'certainly not dear there be ground on must ask for favour from bishop whom indeed hardly know must ask favour that granting of might possibly be made question to be settled by mr slope ' said moved for moment by spirit very unlike own certainly will be very glad to go back to hospital must never go there if be necessary that doing so must be subject of request to mr slope ' little outbreak of father anger jarred on present tone of eleanor mind have not learnt to like mr slope have learnt to think that have much respect for father must therefore willingly use effort to induce something like good feeling between 'papa said ' think somewhat mistake mr slope character ' said placidly ' think do papa think intended personal disrespect to when preached sermon made archdeacon dean so angry ' never supposed that did dear hope never inquired within whether did such matter must be unworthy of inquiry very unworthy of consideration of chapter fear intended disrespect to ministration of god service a conducted in conformity with rule of church of england 'but might not be that thought duty to express dissent from dean of here approve ' 'it can hardly be duty of young man rudely to assail religious conviction of elder of church courtesy must have kept silent even if charity modesty must do so 'but mr slope must say that on subject command of heavenly master admit of being silent ' 'nor of being courteous eleanor 'he did not say that papa ' child that christian minister be never called on by god word to insult conviction even prejudice of brother religion be at rate not le susceptible to urbane courteous conduct among men than other study men take up be sorry to say can not defend mr slope sermon in cathedral come dear put on bonnet let walk round dear old garden at hospital have never yet have heart to go beyond court yard since left place now think can venture to enter ' eleanor rang bell gave variety of imperative charge a to welfare of precious baby whom unwillingly be about to leave for hour so then sauntered forth with father to revisit old hospital have be forbidden ground to a well a to since day on have walked forth together from walk chapter ix stanhope family be now three month since dr proudie began reign change have already be affected in diocese show at least energy of active mind among other thing absentee clergyman have be favoured with hint much too strong to be overlooked poor dear old bishop grantly have on matter be too lenient archdeacon have never be inclined to be severe with who be absent on reputable pretence who provided for duty in liberal way among greatest of diocesan sinner in respect be dr vesey stanhope year have now passed since have

mandate found unable to disregard mr slope have written to by bishop desire in first place bishop much wanted valuable co operation of dr vesey stanhope in diocese in next bishop thought imperative duty to become personally acquainted with most conspicuous of diocesan clergy then bishop thought essentially necessary for dr stanhope own interest that dr stanhope must at rate for time return to barchester lastly be said that so strong feeling be at present moment evinced by hierarch of church with reference to absence of clerical member that behoved dr vesey stanhope not to allow name to stand among must probably in few month be submitted to council of nation there be something so ambiguously frightful in last threat dr stanhope determined to spend two three summer month at residence

there be nothing uncivil in communication yet tone of be thoroughly displeasing be a follows dear mr harding will favour by calling on at palace to morrow morning at be bishop wish to speak to touching hospital hope will excuse naming so early hour do so a time be greatly occupied if however be positively inconvenient to will change to will perhaps be kind enough to give note in reply believe to be dear mr harding assured friend obh palace monday morning th august mr harding must must believe anything of sort thought moreover that mr slope be rather impertinent to call by name assured friend indeed how many assured friend generally fall to lot of man in world by what process be made how much of such process have taken place a yet between mr harding mr slope mr harding must not help asking question a read re read note before answered a follows dear sir will call at palace to morrow at be a desire truly yours s harding on following morning punctually at half past nine knocked at palace door asked for mr slope bishop have one small room allotted to on ground floor mr slope have into latter mr harding be shown asked to sit down mr slope be not yet there ex warden stood up at window looking into garden must not help thinking how very short time have passed since whole of house have be open to a though have be child of family born bred in remembered how old servant used to smile a opened door to how familiar butler must say when have be absent for few hour longer than usual ' sight of mr harding be good for sore eye how fussy housekeeper must swear that must have dined must have breakfasted must have lunched then above all remembered pleasant gleam of inward satisfaction always spread over old bishop face whenever friend entered room tear came into eye a reflected that be gone what use must hospital be to now be alone in world getting old must soon very soon have to go leave a dear old friend have gone go leave hospital accustomed place in cathedral haunt pleasure to younger perhaps wiser men in truth time for have gone by felt a though world be sinking from foot a though be time for to turn with confidence to others ' said to 'can man religion be worth if doe not support against natural melancholy of declining year a looked out through dimmed eye into bright parterre of bishop garden felt that have support wanted nevertheless did not like to be thus kept waiting if mr slope did not really wish to see at half past nine o'clock why force to come away from lodging with breakfast in throat to tell truth be policy on part of mr slope mr slope have made up mind that mr harding must accept hospital with abject submission else refuse altogether have calculated that must probably be more quick to do latter if must be got to enter upon subject in ill humour perhaps mr slope be not altogether wrong in calculation be nearly ten when mr slope hurried into room muttering something about bishop diocesan duty shook mr harding hand ruthlessly begged to be seated now airy superiority man assumed did go against grain of mr harding yet did not know how to resent whole tendency of mind disposition be opposed to contra assumption of grandeur on own part have worldly spirit quickness necessary to put down insolent pretension by downright open rebuke a archdeacon must have done there be nothing for mr harding to submit accordingly did so 'about hospital mr harding ' began mr slope speaking of a head of college at cambridge might speak of sizarship have to be disposed of mr harding crossed one leg over other then one hand over other on top of looked mr slope in face said nothing 'it to be filled up again ' said mr slope mr harding said that have understood so 'of course know income be very much reduced ' continued mr slope 'the bishop wished to be liberal therefore told government that thought ought to be put at not le than l think on whole bishop be right for though service required will not be of very onerous nature will be more so than be before be perhaps well that clergy immediately attached to cathedral town must be made comfortable to extent of ecclesiastical mean at disposal will allow be bishop idea must say mine also mr harding sat rubbing one hand on other said not word much for income mr harding house will of course remain to warden a before must however think be stipulated that must paint inside seven year outside three year be subject to dilapidation in event of vacating by death otherwise be matter on bishop must yet be consulted mr harding still rubbed hand still sat silent gazing up into mr slope unprepossessing face a to duty continued ' believe if be rightly informed there can hardly be said to have be duty hitherto gave sort of half laugh a though to pas off accusation in guise of pleasantry mr harding thought of happy easy year have passed in old house of worn out aged men whom have succoured of good intention of work have certainly be of lightest thought of thing doubting for moment whether did did not deserve sarcasm gave enemy benefit of doubt did not rebuke merely observed very tranquilly perhaps with too much humility that duty of situation such a be have believed be done to satisfaction of late bishop mr slope again smiled time smile be intended to operate against memory of late bishop rather than against energy of ex warden so be understood by mr harding colour rose in cheek began to feel very angry 'you must be aware mr harding that thing be good deal changed in barchester ' said mr slope mr harding said that be aware of 'and not only in barchester mr harding in world at large be not only in barchester that new man be carrying out new measure casting away useless rubbish of past century same thing be going on throughout country work be now required from man who receives wage who have superintended doing of work paying of wage be bound to see that rule be carried out new men mr harding be now needed be now forthcoming in church a well a in other profession be wormwood to old friend have never rated very high own ability activity feeling of heart be with old clergy antipathy of heart be susceptible be directed against new busy uncharitable self lauding men of whom mr slope be so good example 'by mean ' said mr slope 'the bishop be very anxious that must accept appointment wish must understand beforehand what will be required duty in first place sabbath day school will be attached to hospital 'what for old men asked mr harding 'no mr harding not for old men for benefit of child of such of poor of barchester a may suit bishop will expect that will attend school teacher will be under inspection care ' mr harding slipped topmost hand off other began to rub calf of leg be supported 'as to old men continued mr slope 'and old woman who be to form part of hospital bishop be desirous that will have morning evening service on premise sabbath one week day service that will preach to once at least on sunday that whole hospital be always collected for morning evening prayer bishop think that will render unnecessary that separate seat in cathedral must be reserved for hospital inmate mr slope paused mr harding still said nothing 'indeed must be difficult to find seat for woman on whole mr harding may a well say at once that for people of class cathedral service doe not appear to to be most useful even if be so for class of people 'we will not discus that if please ' said mr harding ' be not desirous of doing so at least not at present moment hope however fully understand bishop wish about new establishment of hospital if a doubt will receive from assurance that will accord with lordship view will give very great pleasure to be bearer from lordship to of presentation of appointment if disagree with lordship view asked mr harding hope ' said mr slope 'but if do again asked other such unfortunately must be case can hardly conceive presume own feeling will dictate to propriety of declining appointment 'but if accept appointment yet disagree with bishop what then ' question rather bothered slope be true that have talked matter over with bishop have received sort of authority for suggesting to mr harding propriety of sunday school certain hospital service have authority for saying that proposition be to be made peremptory condition attached to appointment bishop idea have be that mr harding must of course consent that school must become like rest of new establishment in city under control of wife chaplain mr slope idea have be more correct intended that mr harding must refuse situation that ally of own must get have not conceived possibility of mr harding openly accepting appointment a openly rejecting condition be not presume probable said 'that will accept from hand of bishop piece of preferment with fixed predetermination to disacknowledge duty attached to ' 'if become warden said mr harding 'and neglect duty bishop have mean by can remedy grievance ' hardly expected such argument from may say suggestion of such line of conduct ' said mr slope with great look of injured virtue did expect proposition will be glad at rate to know what answer be to make to lordship ' said mr slope ' will take early opportunity of seeing lordship ' said mr harding arrangement ' said mr slope 'will hardly give lordship satisfaction indeed be impossible that bishop must see clergyman in diocese on subject of patronage may arise bishop believe did see on matter really can not see why must be troubled to do so again ' 'do know mr slope how long have be officiating a clergyman in city mr slope wish be now nearly fulfilled mr harding have become very angry be probable that might commit ' really see what have to do with question can not think that bishop must be justified in allowing to regard a sinecure situation requires active man merely because have be employed for many year in cathedral 'but might induce bishop to see if asked to do so will consult friend in matter mr slope mean to be guilty of subterfuge may tell bishop that a altogether disagree with view about hospital will decline situation if find that such condition be attached to a have suggested so saying mr harding took hat went way mr slope be contented considered at liberty to accept mr harding last speech a absolute refusal of appointment at least so represented to bishop to mr proudie 'that be very surprising ' said bishop at said mr proudie little know how determined whole set of be to withstand authority ' mr harding be so anxious for ' said bishop ' said mr slope 'if can hold without slightest acknowledgement of lordship jurisdiction ' 'that be out of question said bishop must imagine to be quite sobeaid chaplain must think so ' said lady really be sorry for ' said bishop know that there be much cause for sorrow ' said lady quiverful be much more deserving man more in need of one who will make much more useful in close neighbourhood of palace suppose have better see quiverful ' said chaplain suppose have ' said bishop chapter xiii rubbish cart mr harding be not happy man a walked down palace pathway stepped out into

full of arrow a be st sebastian to lie broiling on gridiron like st lorenzo how if past life required such repentance a have energy to go through with mr harding after leaving palace walked slowly for hour so beneath shady elm of close then betook to daughter house have at rate made up mind that must go out to plumstead to consult dr grantly that must in first instance tell eleanor what have occurred now be doomed to undergo misery mr slope have forestalled at widow house have called there on preceding afternoon must not have said deny pleasure of telling mr bold that father be about to return to pretty house at hiram hospital have be instructed by bishop to inform mr harding that appointment must now be made at once bishop be of course only too happy to be able to be mean of restoring to mr harding preferment have so long adorned then by degree mr slope have introduced subject of pretty school have hoped before long to see attached to hospital have quite fascinated mr bold by description of picturesque useful charitable appendage have gone so far a to say that have doubt father must approve that must gladly undertake class anyone who have heard entirely different tone seen entirely different manner in mr slope have spoken of projected institution to daughter to father must not have failed to own mr slope be man of genius said nothing to mr bold about hospital sermon service nothing about exclusion of old men from cathedral nothing about dilapidation painting nothing about carting away rubbish eleanor have said to herself that certainly did not like mr slope personally that be very active zealous clergyman must doubt be useful in barchester paved way for much additional misery to mr harding eleanor put on happiest face a heard father on stair for thought have only to congratulate directly saw face knew that there be little matter for congratulation have seen with same weary look of sorrow on one two occasion before remembered well have seen when first read that attack upon in jupiter have ultimately caused to resign hospital have seen also when archdeacon have persuaded to remain there against own sense of propriety honour knew at glance that spirit be in deep trouble papa what be ' said putting down boy to crawl upon floor came to tell dear ' said 'that be going out to plumstead wo come with suppose ' 'to plumstead papa will stay there ' ' suppose will tonight must consult archdeacon about weary hospital ah wish have never thought of again ' 'why papa what be matter `` ve be with mr slope dear be pleasantest companion in world at least not to ' eleanor gave sort of half blush be wrong if imagined that father in way alluded to acquaintance with mr slope 'well papa ' 'he want to turn hospital into sunday school preaching house suppose will have way feel adapted for such establishment therefore suppose must refuse appointment must be harm of school papa ' want of proper schoolmaster dear ' must of course be supplied slope wish to supply by making schoolmaster a be hardly fit for such work intend to decline ' 'oh papa mr slope doe intend that be here yesterday what intends ' 'he be here yesterday be ' asked mr harding 'yes papa ' 'and talking about hospital 'he be saying how glad must be bishop too to see back there again then spoke about sunday school to tell truth agreed with thought must have done so too mr slope spoke of school not inside hospital just connected with of must be patron visitor thought must have liked school a promised to look after to take class seemed so very oh papa will be so miserable if find have done wrong ' 'nothing wrong at dear ' said gently very gently rejecting daughter caress can be nothing wrong in wishing to make useful indeed ought to do so by mean one must now exert who must not choose to go to wall poor mr harding thus attempted in misery to preach new doctrine to child herself be same continued 'you will be quite right dear to do something of sort 'well papa ' ' be not quite sure that if be must select mr slope for guide ' 'but have never done so never will ' 'it must be very wicked of to speak evil of for to tell truth know evil of be not quite sure that be honest that be not gentleman like in manner of be quite sure ' never thought of taking for guide papa 'as for dear ' continued 'we know old proverb be bad thing teaching old dog new trick must decline sunday school will therefore probably decline hospital also will first see brother in law ' so took up hat kissed baby withdrew leaving eleanor in a low spirit a be great aggravation to misery have so few with whom to sympathise that must not afford to be cut off from one whose sympathy be of most value to yet seemed probable that must be case did not own to that wished daughter to hate mr slope yet have expressed feeling there must have be very little bitterness in rebuke must have given for so uncharitable state of mind fact however be that be on friendly term with mr slope that coincided with view adhered at once to plan listened with delight to teaching mr harding hardly wished daughter to hate man must have preferred that to loving walked away to inn to order fly went home to put up carpet bag then started for plumstead there be at rate danger that archdeacon must fraternise with mr slope then must recommend internecine war public appeal loud reproach paraphernalia of open battle now that alternative be hardly more to mr harding taste than other when mr harding reached parsonage found that archdeacon be out must not be home till dinner time so began complaint to elder daughter mr grantly entertained quite a strong antagonism to mr slope a did husband be also quite a alive to necessity of combatting proudie faction of supporting old church interest of close of keeping in own set much of loaf fish a duly belonged to be quite a well prepared a lord to carry on battle without giving taking quarter not that be woman prone to quarrelling ill inclined to live at peace with clerical neighbour felt a did archdeacon that presence of mr slope in barchester be insult to one connected with late bishop that assumed dominion in diocese be spiritual injury to husband hitherto people have little guessed how bitter mr grantly must be lived on best of term with rector wife around have be popular with lady connected with close though much wealthiest of ecclesiastical matron of county have so managed affair that carriage horse have given umbrage to none have never thrown among county grandee so a to excite envy of other clergyman wife have never talked too loudly of earl countess boasted that gave governess sixty pound year cook seventy mr grantly have lived life of wise discreet peace making woman people of barchester be surprised at amount of military vigour displayed a general of feminine grantlyite force mr grantly soon learnt that sister eleanor have promised to assist mr slope in affair of hospital be on point that attention soon fixed 'how can eleanor endure ' said 'he be very crafty man ' said father 'and craft have be successful in making eleanor think that be meek charitable good clergyman god forgive if wrong such be not true character in opinion ' true character indeed said with something approaching scorn for father moderation ' only hope wo have craft enough to make eleanor forget position ' mean marry ' said startled out of usual demeanour by abruptness horror of so dreadful proposition 'what be there so improbable in of course must be own object if thought have chance of success eleanor have thousand year entirely at own disposal what better fortune must fall to mr slope lot than transferring of disposal of such fortune to ' 'but ca think like susan ' 'why not ' said susan 'why must like be just sort of man to get on with woman left a be with one to look after 'look after ' said unhappy father look after papa how innocent be of course be to be expected that eleanor must marry again must be last to advise against if must only wait proper time then marry at least gentleman 'but really mean to say that suppose have ever thought of marrying mr slope why mr bold have only be dead year 'eighteen month said daughter suppose eleanor have ever thought about be very probable though that have that will try make do so that will succeed too if take care what be about ' be quite new phase of affair to poor mr harding to have thrust upon a son in law a husband of favourite child only man in world whom really positively disliked must be misfortune felt must not know how to endure patiently then must there be ground for so dreadful surmise in worldly matter be apt to look upon opinion of eldest daughter a one generally sound trustworthy in appreciation of character of motif probable conduct of men woman be usually not far wrong have early foreseen marriage of eleanor john bold have at glance deciphered character of new bishop chaplain must possibly be that present surmise must ever come forth a true think that like ' said mr harding again 'well papa ca say that think dislike a ought to do why be visiting there a confidential friend when never ought to have be admitted inside house why be that speaks to of about welfare position a clearly have done at bishop party other night saw talking to for hour at stretch thought mr slope seemed to talk to nobody there that daughter of stanhope ' said mr harding wishing to defend child mr slope be cleverer man than think of papa keep more than one iron in fire ' to give eleanor due suspicion a to slightest inclination on part towards mr slope be wrong to have more idea of marrying mr slope than have of marrying bishop idea mr slope must present a suitor have never occurred to indeed to give due again have never thought about suitor since husband death nevertheless be true that have overcome repugnance to man be so strongly felt for by rest of grantly faction have forgiven sermon have forgiven low church tendency sabbath school puritanical observance have forgiven pharisaical arrogance even greasy face oily vulgar manner having agreed to overlook such offence a why must not in time be taught to regard mr slope a suitor a to must be affirmed that be hitherto equally innocent of crime imputed to how have come to pas that man whose eye be generally widely open to everything have not perceived that young widow be rich a well a beautiful can not probably now be explained such be fact mr slope have ingratiated with mr bold merely a have done with other lady in order to strengthen party in city subsequently attended error be not till after interview with mr harding chapter xiv new campaign archdeacon did not return to parsonage till close upon hour of dinner there be therefore time to discus matter before important ceremony seemed to be in especial good humour welcomed father in law with sort of jovial earnestness be usual with when thing on be intent be going on a must have be settled dear ' said to wife a washed hand in dressing room while according to wont sat listening in bedroom 'arabin have agreed to accept living will be here next week archdeacon scrubbed hand rubbed face with violent alacrity showed that arabin coming be great point gained 'will come here to plumstead ' said wife have promised to stay month with ' said archdeacon that may see what parish be like will like arabin very much be gentleman in respect full of good humour ' be very queer be ' asked wife be little odd in of fancy there be nothing about wo like be a staunch churchman a there be at oxford really know what must do without arabin be great thing for to have so near if anything can put slope down arabin will do ' reverend francis arabin be fellow of lazarus favoured disciple of great dr gwynne high churchman at point so high indeed that at one period of career have toppled over into cesspool of rome poet also polemical writer great pet in common room at oxford eloquent clergyman droll odd humorous energetic conscientious man a archdeacon have boasted of thorough gentleman a will hereafter be brought more closely to notice be now only necessary to add that have just be presented to vicarage of st ewold by dr grantly in whose gift a archdeacon living lay st ewold be parish lying just without city of barchester suburb of new town indeed be partly within precinct pretty church parsonage be not much above mile distant from city gate st ewold be not rich piece of preferment be worth three four hundred year at most have generally be held by clergyman attached to cathedral choir archdeacon however felt when living on occasion became vacant that imperatively behoved to aid force of party with tower of strength if such tower must be got to occupy st ewold have discussed matter with brother in barchester not in weak spirit a holder of patronage to be used for own family benefit a one to whom be committed trust on due administration of much of church welfare might depend have submitted to name of mr arabin a though choice have rested with in conclave have unanimously admitted that if mr arabin must accept st ewold better choice must possibly be made if mr arabin must accept st ewold there lay difficulty mr arabin be man standing somewhat prominently before world be before church of england world be not rich man be true for held preferment fellowship be man not over anxious for rich not married of course one whose time be greatly taken up in discussing in print on platform privilege practice of church to belonged a archdeacon have done battle for temporality so did mr arabin do battle for spirituality have done so conscientiously be not so much for own benefit a for of others holding position a mr arabin did there be much reason to doubt whether must consent to become parson of st ewold dr grantly have taken trouble to go to oxford on matter dr gwynne dr grantly together have succeeded in persuading eminent divine that duty required to go barchester there be wheel within wheel in affair for time past mr arabin have be engaged in tremendous controversy with le person than mr slope respecting apostolic succession two gentleman have never seen other have be extremely bitter in print mr slope have endeavoured to strengthen cause by calling mr arabin owl mr arabin have retaliated by hinting that mr slope be infidel battle have be commenced in column of daily jupiter powerful newspaper manager of be very friendly to mr slope view of case matter however have become too tedious for reader of jupiter little note have therefore be appended to one of mr slope most telling rejoinder in have be stated that further letter from reverend gentleman must be inserted except a advertisement other method of publication be however found le expensive than advertisement in jupiter war went on merrily mr slope declared that main part of consecration of clergyman be self devotion of inner man to duty of ministry mr arabin contended that man be not consecrated at have indeed single attribute of clergyman unless became so through imposition of bishop hand who have become bishop through imposition of other hand so on in direct line to one of apostle have repeatedly hung other on horn of dilemma seemed to whit worse for hanging so war went on merrily whether near neighbourhood of foe may have acted in way a inducement to mr arabin to accept living of st ewold will not pretend to say have at rate be settled in dr gwynne library at lazarus that must accept that must lend assistance towards driving enemy out of barchester at rate silencing while remained there mr arabin intended to keep room at oxford to have assistance of curate at st ewold promised to give a much time a possible to neighbourhood of barchester from so great man dr grantly be quite satisfied with promise be small part of satisfaction derivable from such arrangement dr proudie must be forced to institute into living immediately under own nose enemy of favourite chaplain through dinner archdeacon good humour shone brightly in face ate of good thing heartily drank wine with wife daughter talked pleasantly of doings at oxford told father in law that ought to visit dr gwynne at lazarus launched out again in praise of dr arabin mr arabin married papa ' asked griselda dear fellow of college be never married ' young man papa ' 'about forty believe said archdeacon 'oh said griselda have father said eighty mr arabin must not have appeared to to be very much older when two gentleman be left alone over wine mr harding told tale of woe even sad a be did not much diminish archdeacon good humour though greatly added to pugnacity ca do ' said dr grantly over over again a father in law explained to term on new warden of hospital be to be appointed ca do what say be not worth trouble of listening to ca alter duty of place 'who ca ' asked ex warden can bishop chaplain yet bishop wife who take have really more to say to such matter than of other two whole body corporate of palace together have power to turn warden of hospital into sunday schoolmaster ' 'but bishop have power to appoint whom plea ' ' know that rather think will find have such power let try see what press will say for once will have popular cry on side proudie as a be know world too well to get such hornet nest about ear mr harding winced at idea of press have have enough of sort of publicity be unwilling to be shown up second time a monster a martyr gently remarked that hoped newspaper must not get hold of name again then suggested that perhaps must be better that must abandon object ' be getting old ' said 'and after doubt whether be fit to undertake new duty 'new duty said archdeacon tell there will be new duty 'or perhaps old duty ' said mr harding ' think will remain content a be ' picture of mr slope carting away rubbish be still present to mind archdeacon drank off glass of claret prepared to be energetic ' do hope ' said 'that be not going to be so weak a to allow man a mr slope to deter from doing what know be duty to do know that be duty to resume place at hospital now parliament have so settled stipend a to remove difficulty induced to resign can not deny must timidity now prevent from doing so conscience will hereafter never forgive a finished clause of speech pushed over bottle to companion conscience will never forgive ' continued resigned place from conscientious scruple scruple greatly respected though did not share friend respected left old house a rich in reputation a be ruined in fortune be now expected that will return dr gwynne be saying only other day gwynne doe not reflect how much older man be now than when last saw ' 'old nonsense ' said archdeacon never thought old till listened to impudent trash of coxcomb at palace will be sixty five if live till november said mr harding 'and seventy five if live till november ten year said archdeacon bid fair to be a efficient then a be ten year ago for heaven sake let have pretence in matter plea of old age be only pretence be not drinking wine be only pretence fact be be half afraid of slope must rather subject to comparative poverty discomfort than come to blow with man who will trample on if let ' ' certainly like coming to blow if can help ' 'nor sometimes ca help man object be to induce to refuse hospital that may put creature of own into that may show power insult by insulting whose cause character be so intimately bound up with of chapter owe to to resist in even if have solicitude for surely for own sake will not be so lily livered a to fall into trap have baited for let take very bread out of mouth without struggle mr harding did not like being called lily livered be rather inclined to resent ' doubt there be true courage ' said 'in squabbling for money ' honest men did not squabble for money in world of ours dishonest men must get see that cause of virtue must be much improved must use mean have if be to carry argument home might give away shilling of revenue church have presume be not prepared to say that church must be strengthened by such sacrifice ' archdeacon filled glass then emptied drinking with much reverence silent toast to well being permanent security of temporality be so dear to soul ' think quarrel between clergyman bishop must be avoided ' said mr harding ' think so too be quite a much duty of bishop to look to a of inferior tell what friend will see bishop in matter be if will allow may be sure will not compromise opinion be that trash about sunday school sermon have originated wholly with slope mr proudie that bishop know nothing about bishop ca very well refuse to see will come upon when have wife chaplain by think will find that will end in sending appointment without condition whatever a to seat in cathedral may safely leave to mr dean believe fool positively think that bishop must walk away with cathedral if pleased ' so matter be arranged between mr harding have come expressly for advice therefore felt bound to take advice given have known moreover beforehand that archdeacon must not hear of giving matter up accordingly though have in perfect good faith put forward own view be prepared to yield therefore went into drawing room in good humour with other evening passed pleasantly in prophetic discussion on future war of arabin slope frog have mouse must be nothing to anger of agamemnon achilles how archdeacon rubbed hand plumed on success of last move must not descend into arena with slope arabin must have such scruple arabin be exactly man for such work only man whom knew be fit for archdeacon good humour high buoyancy continued till when reclining on pillow mr grantly commenced to give view of state of affair in barchester then certainly be startled last word said that night be a follows 'if doe by heaven will never speak to again dragged into mire once will not pollute with such filth a ' archdeacon gave shudder shook whole room so violently be convulsed with thought then agitated mind now in matter widow bold be scandalously ill treated by relative have spoken to man three four time have expressed willingness to teach in sunday school such be full extent of sin in matter of mr slope poor eleanor time will show next morning mr harding returned to barchester further word having be spoken in hearing respecting mr slope acquaintance with younger daughter observed that archdeacon at breakfast be le cordial than have be on preceding evening chapter xv widow suitor mr slope lost time in availing of bishop permission to see mr quiverful be in interview with worthy pastor that first learned that mr bold be worth wooing rode out to puddingdale to communicate to embryo warden good will of bishop in favour during discussion on matter be unnatural that pecuniary resource of mr harding family must become subject of remark mr quiverful with fourteen child four hundred year be very poor man prospect of new preferment be to be held together with living be very grateful to to what clergyman so circumstanced must not such prospect be very grateful mr quiverful have long be acquainted with mr harding have received kindness at hand so that heart misgave a thought of supplanting friend at hospital nevertheless be extremely civil cringingly civil to mr slope treated quite a great man entreated great man to do honour to drink glass of sherry at a be very poor marsala now pampered slope turned up nose ended by declaring extreme obligation to bishop mr slope great desire to accept hospital if if be certainly case mr harding have refused what man a needy a mr quiverful must have be more disinterested ber harding did positively refuse ' said mr slope with certain air of offended dignity heard of condition to appointment be now subjected of course understand mr quiverful that same condition will be imposed on ' mr quiverful cared nothing for condition must have undertaken to preach number of sermon mr slope might have chosen to dictate to pas remaining hour of sunday within wall of sunday school what sacrifice at rate what promise must have be too much to make for such addition to income for such house mind still recurred to mr harding be sure said ber harding daughter be very rich why must trouble with hospital 'you mean mr grantly ' said slope ' meant widowed daughter ' said other bold have twelve hundred year of own suppose mr harding mean to live with ' 'twelve hundred year of own said slope very shortly afterwards took leave avoiding a far a be possible for to do further allusion to hospital twelve hundred year said to a rode slowly home if be fact that mr bold have twelve hundred year of own what fool must be to oppose father return to old place train of mr slope idea will probably be plain to reader why must not make twelve hundred year own if did so must not be well for to have father in law comfortably provided with good thing of world must not moreover be much more easy for to gain daughter if did in power to forward father view question presented to in very forcible way yet there be many point of doubt if resolved to restore to mr harding former place must take necessary step for doing so at once must immediately talk over bishop quarrel on matter with mr proudie whom knew must not talk over let quiverful know that have be little too precipitate a to mr harding positive refusal that must effect did not doubt did not wish to effect for nothing did not wish to give way to mr harding then be rejected by daughter did not wish to lose one influential friend before have gained thus rode home meditating many thing in mind occurred to that mr bold be sister in law to archdeacon that not even for twelve hundred year must submit to imperious man rich wife be great desideratum to success in

of fortune must be inmate that man might well desire for house partner for bosom care very well qualified to make care lie easy eleanor hurried out of room to re adjust cap muttering unnecessary apology about baby while be gone will briefly go back state what have be hitherto result of mr slope meditation on scheme of matrimony inquiry a to widow income have at rate be so far successful a to induce to determine to go on with speculation a regarded mr harding have also resolved to do what must without injury to to mr proudie determined not to speak on matter at least not at present object be to instigate little rebellion on part of bishop thought that state of thing must be advisable not only in respect to messrs harding quiverful also in affair of diocese generally mr slope be by mean of opinion that dr proudie be fit to rule conscientiously thought wrong that brother clergy must be subjected to petticoat government therefore made up mind to infuse little of spirit into bishop sufficient to induce to oppose wife though not enough to make altogether insubordinate have therefore taken opportunity of again speaking to lordship about hospital have endeavoured to make appear that after must be unwise to exclude mr harding from appointment mr slope however have harder task than have imagined mr proudie anxious to assume to herself a much a possible of merit of patronage have written to mr quiverful requesting to call at palace have then explained to matron with much mystery condescension dignity good be in store for progeny indeed mr proudie have be so engaged at very time that mr slope have be doing same with husband at puddingdale vicarage have thus in measure committed thanks humility gratitude surprise of mr quiverful have be very overpowering have embraced knee of patroness have promised that prayer of fourteen unprovided babe so mr quiverful have described own family eldest of be stout young woman of three twenty must be put up to heaven morning evening for munificent friend whom god have sent to such incense a be not unpleasing to mr proudie made most of offered general assistance to fourteen unprovided babe if a have doubt must find worthy expressed hope that eldest of must be fit to undertake tuition in sabbath school altogether made very great lady in estimation of mr quiverful having done thought prudent to drop few word before bishop letting know that have acquainted puddingdale family with good fortune so that might perceive that stood committed to appointment husband well understood rule of wife did not resent knew that be taking patronage out of hand be resolved to put end to interference re assume power then thought be not best time to do put off evil hour a many man in similar circumstance have done before such having be case mr slope naturally encountered difficulty in talking over bishop difficulty indeed found must not be overcome except at cost of general outbreak at palace general outbreak at present moment might be good policy also might not be at rate not step to be lightly taken began by whispering to bishop that feared public opinion must be against if mr harding did not reappear at hospital bishop answered with warmth that mr quiverful have be promised appointment on mr slope advice 'not promised said mr slope 'yes promised ' replied bishop mr proudie have seen mr quiverful on subject be quite unexpected on part of mr slope presence of mind did not fail turned statement to own account lord ' said 'we will be in scrape if lady interfere ' be too much in unison with lordship feeling to be altogether unpalatable yet such allusion to interference demanded rebuke lord be somewhat astounded also though not altogether made miserable by finding that there be point of difference between wife chaplain ' know what mean by interference ' said bishop mildly mr proudie heard that mr quiverful be to be appointed be not unnatural that must wish to see mr quiverful about school really can not say that see interference ' only speak lord for own comfort said slope 'for own comfort dignity in diocese can have other motive a far a personal feeling go mr proudie be best friend have must always remember that still in present position first duty be to lordship ' ' be sure of mr slope be quite sure of ' said bishop mollified 'and really think that mr harding must have hospital word be inclined to think so be quite prepared to take upon blame of first suggesting mr quiverful name since doing so have found that there be so strong feeling in diocese in favour of mr harding that think lordship must give way hear also that mr harding have modified objection first felt to lordship proposition a to what have passed between mr proudie mr quiverful circumstance may be little inconvenient really think that must weigh in matter of so much moment thus poor bishop be left in dreadfully undecided state a to what must do mind however slightly inclined to appointment of mr harding seeing that by step must have assistance of mr slope in opposing mr proudie such be state of affair at palace when mr slope called at mr bold house found playing with baby when ran out of room mr slope began praising weather to mary bold then praised baby kissed then praised mother then praised miss bold mr bold however be not long before came back ' have to apologise for calling at so very early hour began mr slope 'but be really so anxious to speak to that hope miss bold will excuse ' eleanor muttered something in word 'of course early at be just audible then apologised for own appearance declaring with smile that baby be becoming big boy that be quite unmanageable 'he great bit naughty boy ' said to child must sent away to great big rough romping school where have great big rod do terrible thing to naughty boy who do what own mamma tell ' then commenced course of kissing being actuated thereto by terrible idea of sending child away own imagination have depicted 'and where master have such beautiful long hair to be dishevelled ' said mr slope taking up joke paying compliment at same time eleanor thought might a well have left compliment alone said nothing looked nothing being occupied a be with baby take ' said mary 'his clothes be nearly off back with romping ' so saying left room with child miss bold have heard mr slope say have something pressing to say to eleanor thinking that might be de trop took opportunity of getting out of room be long mary said eleanor a miss bold shut door be glad mr bold to have opportunity of having ten minute conversation with alone ' began mr slope 'will let openly ask plain question said 'and be sure will give plain open answer ' that none at said laughing bey question be mr bold be father really anxious to get back to hospital 'why do ask ' said 'why ask ' bey dear mr bold will tell why there be wheel within wheel of must explain to only fear there be not time be essentially necessary must have answer to question otherwise can not know how to advance father wish be quite impossible must ask one can esteem father more than do doubt if feeling be reciprocal ' certainly be not ' must be candid with a only mean of avoiding ultimate consequence may be most injurious to mr harding fear there be feeling will not even call prejudice with regard to myself in barchester be not in favour remember sermon mr slope need not go back to ' said eleanor 'for one moment mr bold be not may talk of because be so essential that must understand how matter stand that sermon may have be ill judged be certainly misunderstood will say nothing about now only that did give rise to feeling against father share with others may be that have proper cause result be that be not inclined to meet on friendly term put to whether know to be case eleanor made answer mr slope in eagerness of address edged chair little nearer to widow seat unperceived by beuch being so ' continued mr slope ' can not ask question a can ask of in spite of delinquency since came to barchester have allowed to regard a friend eleanor made little motion with head be hardly confirmatory mr slope if noticed did not appear to do so 'to can speak openly explain feeling of heart father must not allow unfortunately bishop have thought right that matter of hospital must pas through hand there have be detail to get up with must not trouble thus have come to pas be forced to have interview with father on matter be aware of ' said eleanor 'of course ' said 'in that interview mr harding left impression on mind that did not wish to return to hospital 'how must that be ' said eleanor at last stirred up to forget cold propriety of demeanour have determined to maintain bey dear mr bold give word that such be case said again getting little nearer to 'and what be more than before interview with mr harding certain person at palace mean bishop have told that such be fact own hardly believed own thought that father must wish on account for conscience ' sake for sake of old men for old association memory of dear day gone by on account thought that must wish to resume duty be told that such be not wish certainly left with impression have be told truth 'well said eleanor now sufficiently roused on matter fear miss bold step ' said mr slope 'must be asking too great favour to beg to know can manage anything with miss bold eleanor did not like word manage still went out asked mary to leave alone for quarter of hour mr bold be so very grateful for confidence well left father with impression indeed may say that made understand that declined appointment ' 'not appointment said eleanor ' be sure did not decline appointment said that must not agree be that did not like scheme about school service be quite sure never said wished to refuse place mr bold ' said mr slope in manner almost impassioned ' must not for world say to so good daughter word against so good father must for sake let show exactly how matter stand at present mr harding be little flurried when told of bishop wish about school did so perhaps with le caution because have so perfectly agreed with on same subject be little put out spoke warmly tell bishop said that quite disagree with will not return to hospital a such condition be attached to what said be to effect indeed word be if anything stronger than have alternative to repeat to lordship who said that must look on in other light than refusal also have heard report that father did not wish for appointment putting thing together thought have not choice to look for one else have consequently offered place to mr quiverful ' 'offered place to mr quiverful repeated eleanor eye suffused with tear mr slope there be end of ' friend not so ' said 'it be to prevent such being end of that be now here may at rate presume have got answer to question that mr harding be desirous of returning 'desirous of returning of course be ' said eleanor 'of course wish to have back house income place in world to have back what gave up with such self denying honesty if can have without restraint on conduct to what at age must be impossible that must submit how can bishop ask man of age to turn schoolmaster to pack of child 'out of question said mr slope laughing slightly 'of course such demand will be made on father can at rate promise will not be medium of so absurd requisition wished father to preach in hospital a inmate may naturally be too old to leave even that will not be insisted on wished also to attach sabbath day school to hospital thinking that establishment must not be useful under surveillance of so good clergyman a mr harding also under own dear mr bold wo talk of thing now one thing be clear mustdo what can to annul rash offer bishop made to mr quiverful father must see quiverful must quiverful be honourable man must not for moment stand in father way ' 'what ' said eleanor 'ask man with fourteen child to give up preferment be quite sure will do such thing ' ' suppose not said slope again drew near to mr bold so now be very close to other eleanor did not think much about instinctively moved away little how greatly must have increased distance must have guessed have be said about at plumstead ' suppose not be out of question that quiverful must supersede father quite out of question bishop have be too rash idea occurs to may perhaps with god blessing put right dear mr bold must object to seeing bishop ' 'why must not father see ' said eleanor have once before in life interfered with father affair then not to much advantage be older now felt that must take step in matter so vital to without consent 'why to tell truth said mr slope with look of sorrow a though greatly bewailed want of charity in patron bishop fancy have cause of anger against father fear interview must lead to further ill will ' 'why said eleanor bey father be mildest gentlest man living ' ' only know ' said slope 'that have best of daughter so must not see bishop a to getting interview must manage for without slightest annoyance to ' ' must hing mr slope without consulting father ' said 'that must be useless must then only be father messenger doe anything occur to yourself something must be done father will not be ruined by so ridiculous misunderstanding ' eleanor said that nothing occurred to that be very hard tear came to eye rolled down cheek mr slope must have given much to have have privilege of drying have tact enough to know that have still great deal to do before must even hope for privilege with mr bold 'it cut to heart to see so grieved ' said 'but pray let assure that father interest will not be sacrificed if be possible for to protect will tell bishop openly what be fact will explain to that have hardly right to appoint other than father will show that if doe so will be guilty of great injustice mr bold will have charity at rate to believe of that be truly anxious for father welfare for for own ' widow hardly knew what answer to make be quite aware that father must not be at thankful to mr slope have strong wish to share father feeling yet must not acknowledge that mr slope be very kind father who be generally charitable to men who seldom spoke ill of one have warned against mr slope yet did not know how to abstain from thanking what interest must have in matter that professed nevertheless there be that in manner even distrusted felt did not know why that there be something about ought to put on guard mr slope read in hesitating manner just a plainly a though have opened heart to be talent of man that must so read inward feeling of woman with whom conversed knew that eleanor be doubting that if thanked must only do so because must not help yet did not make angry even annoy rome be not built in day did not come for thanks continued seeing hesitation want at rate before be merited do want mr bold may make friend in fold to have pleased god to call a one of humblest of shepherd if can not do so task here must indeed be sad one will at rate endeavour to deserve ' `` m sure ' said 'you will soon make plenty of friend felt obliged to say something 'that will be nothing unless be such a will sympathise with feeling unless be such a can reverence admire love if best purest turn away from can not bring to be satisfied with friendship of le estimable in such case must live alone 'oh be sure will not do mr slope ' eleanor meant nothing suited to appear that special allusion have be intended 'indeed mr bold will live alone quite alone a far a heart be concerned if with whom yearn to ally turn away from enough of have called friend hope will not contradict trust time may come when may also call father so god bless mr bold darling boy tell father from that what can be done for interest will be done so took leave pressing widow hand rather more closely than usual circumstance however seemed just then to make intelligible lady did not feel called on to resent ' can not understand ' said eleanor to mary bold few minute afterwards know whether be good man bad man whether be true false ' give benefit of doubt said mary 'and believe best 'on whole think do ' said eleanor ' think do believe that

even meant to be master in own diocese let alone own house must begin at once must have be easier to have done so from day of consecration than now easier now than when mr proudie must have succeeded in thoroughly mastering diocesan detail then proffered assistance of mr slope be great thing for most unexpected invaluable aid hitherto have looked on two a allied force have considered that a allied be impregnable have begun to believe that only chance of escape must be by advancement of mr slope to distant rich preferment now seemed that one of enemy certainly least potent of nevertheless one

must have reference to re appointment of mr harding to wardenship of hiram hospital bishop having read note be informed that archdeacon servant be waiting for answer here at once great opportunity offered to bishop of acting on own responsibility bethought of new ally rang bell for mr slope turned out that mr slope be not in house then greatly daring bishop with own unassisted spirit wrote note to archdeacon saying that must see naming hour for doing so having watched from study window that messenger got safely off premise with despatch began to turn over in mind what step must next take to morrow must have to declare to archdeacon that mr harding must have appointment that must not have bishop felt that must not honestly throw over mr quiverful without informing mr proudie resolved at last to brave lioness in own den tell circumstance be such that behoved to reappoint mr harding did not feel that must at derogate from new courage by promising mr proudie that very first piece of available preferment at disposal must be given to quiverful to atone for injury done to if must mollify lioness with sop how happy must think first effort have be not without many misgiving did find

telling story if mr harding be fool enough to tell tale can also tell ours place be offered to refused have now be given to someone else there be end of at least must think so ' dear rather believe be right ' said bishop sneaking out of room went down stair troubled in mind a to how must receive archdeacon on morrow felt not very well just at present began to consider that might not improbably be detained in room next morning by attack of bile be unfortunately very subject to bilious annoyance slope indeed will slope ' said indignant matron to listening progeny ' know what have come to mr slope believe think be to be bishop of barchester because have taken by hand got father to make domestic chaplain ' be always full of impudence ' said olivia ' told so once before mamma ' olivia however have not thought too impudent when once before have proposed to make mr slope olivia always thought liked ' said augusta who at moment have grudge against sister ' always disliked man because think thoroughly vulgar ' be wrong ' said mr proudie 'he not vulgar at what be more be soul stirring eloquent preacher must be taught to know place if be to remain in house ' have horridest eye ever saw in man head ' said netta 'and tell what be terribly greedy did see current pie ate yesterday ' when mr slope got home soon learnt from bishop a much from manner a word that mr proudie behest in matter of hospital be to be obeyed dr proudie let fall something a to 'this occasion only 'keeping affair about patronage exclusively in own hand be quite decided about mr harding a mr slope did not wish to have prelate prelate against did not at present see that must do anything yield merely remarked that must of course carry out bishop view that be quite sure that if bishop trusted to own judgment thing in diocese must certainly be well ordered mr slope knew that if hit nail on head often enough will penetrate at last be sitting alone in room on same evening when light knock be made on door before must answer door be opened patroness appeared be smile in moment so be not also took however chair be offered to thus began expostulation ber slope did not at approve conduct other night with italian woman one must have thought that be lover ' gracious dear madam ' said mr slope with look of horror be married woman 'that be more than know ' said mr proudie 'however chooses to pas for such married not married such attention a paid be improper can not believe that must wish to give offence in drawing room mr slope owe to daughter to tell that disapprove conduct ' mr slope opened wide huge protruding eye stared out of with look of well dignified surprise mr proudie ' said ' did fetch something to eat when be hungry 'and have called on since ' continued looking at culprit with stern look of detective policeman in act of declaring mr slope turned over in mind whether must be well for to tell termagant at once that must call on whom liked do what liked remembered that footing in barchester be not yet sufficiently firm that must be better for to pacify certainly called since at dr stanhope house certainly saw madame neroni 'yes saw alone ' said episcopal argus 'undoubtedly did ' said mr slope 'but be because nobody else happened to be in room surely be fault of mine if rest of family be out ' 'perhaps not assure mr slope will fall greatly in estimation if find that allow to be caught by lure of woman know woman better than do slope may believe that signora a call be not fitting companion for strict evangelical unmarried young clergyman how mr slope must have liked to laugh at have dared did not dare so merely said ' can assure mr proudie lady in question be nothing to ' 'well hope not mr slope have considered duty to give caution now there be thing feel called upon to speak about be conduct to bishop mr slope ' bey conduct to bishop said now truly surprised ignorant what lady alluded to 'yes mr slope conduct to bishop be by mean what must wish to see ' 'have bishop said anything mr proudie ' 'no bishop have said nothing probably think that remark on matter will come better from who first introduced to lordship notice fact be mr slope be little inclined to take too much upon ' angry spot showed upon mr slope cheek be with difficulty that controlled did do so sat quite silent while lady went on 'it be fault of many young men in position therefore bishop be not inclined at present to resent will doubt soon learn what be required from what be not if will take advice however will be careful not to obtrude advice upon bishop in matter concerning patronage if lordship want advice know where to look for ' then having added to counsel string of platitude a to what be desirable what not desirable in conduct of strictly evangelical unmarried young clergyman mr proudie retreated leaving chaplain to thought upshot of thought be that there certainly be not room in diocese for energy of mr proudie that behoved quickly to ascertain whether energy hers must prevail chapter xviii widow persecution early on following morning mr slope be summoned to bishop dressing room went there fully expecting that must find lordship very indignant spirited up by wife to repeat rebuke have administered on previous day mr slope have resolved that at rate from must not stand entered dressing room in rather combative disposition found bishop in most placid gentle of humour lordship complained of being rather unwell have slight headache be not quite thing in stomach there be nothing matter with temper slope ' said taking chaplain proffered hand grantly be to call on morning really be not fit to see fear must trouble to see for ' then dr proudie proceeded to explain what be that must be said to dr grantly be to be told in fact in civilest word in tidings must be conveyed that mr harding having refused wardenship appointment have be offered to mr quiverful accepted by mr slope again pointed out to patron that thought be perhaps not quite wise in decision did sotto voce even with precaution be not safe to say much during little that did say bishop made very slight still very ominous gesture with thumb towards door opened from dressing room to inner sanctuary mr slope at once took hint said more perceived that there be to be confidence between patron that league desired by be to be made that appointment of mr quiverful be to be sacrifice offered on altar of conjugal obedience mr slope read in slight motion of bishop thumb read correctly there be need of parchment seal of attestation explanation profession bargain be understood between mr slope gave bishop hand upon bishop understood little extra squeeze intelligible gleam of assent twinkled in eye be civil to archdeacon mr slope ' said out loud 'but make quite understand that in matter mr harding have put out of power to oblige ' must be calumny on mr proudie to suggest that be sitting in bed room with ear at keyhole during interview have within spirit of decorum prevented from descending to such baseness to put ear to key hole to listen at chink be trick for housemaid mr proudie knew therefore did not do stationed a near to door a well must that might if possible get advantage housemaid must have have without descending to housemaid artifice be little however that heard little be only sufficient to deceive saw nothing of friendly pressure perceived nothing of concluded bargain did not even dream of treacherous resolve two false men have made together to upset in pride of station to dash cup from lip before have drank of to seep away power before have tasted sweet traitor that be husband of bosom outcast whom have fostered brought into warmth of world brightest fireside of have magnanimity of woman though two men have thus leagued together against even yet battle be not lost mr slope felt pretty sure that dr grantly must decline honour of seeing such turned out to be case archdeacon when palace door be opened to be greeted by note mr slope presented compliment c c bishop be ill in room very greatly regretted c c mr slope have be charged with bishop view if agreeable to archdeacon must do honour c c archdeacon however be not agreeable having read note in hall crumpled up in hand muttering something about sorrow for lordship illness took leave without sending a much a verbal message in answer to mr slope note 'ill said archdeacon to a flung into brougham man be absolutely coward be afraid to see ill indeed ' archdeacon be never ill did not therefore understand that one else must in truth be prevented by illness from keeping appointment regarded such excuse a subterfuge in present instance be not far wrong dr grantly desired to be driven to father in law lodging in high street hearing from servant mr harding be at daughter followed to mr bold house there found archdeacon be fuming with rage when got into drawing room have by time nearly forgotten pusillanimity of bishop in villainy of chaplain at ' said throwing mr slope crumpled note to mr harding ' be to be told that if choose may have honour of seeing mr slope that too after positive engagement with bishop 'but say bishop be ill ' said mr harding 'pshaw mean to say that be deceived by such excuse a that be well enough yesterday now tell will see bishop will tell also very plainly what think of conduct will see else barchester will soon be too hot to hold ' eleanor be sitting in room dr grantly have hardly noticed in anger eleanor now said to with greatest innocence ' wish have seen mr slope dr grantly because think perhaps might have done good ' archdeacon turned on with almost brutal wrath have at once owned that have accepted mr slope for second husband must hardly have felt more convinced of belonging body soul to slope proudie party than now did on hearing express wish a poor eleanor ' said archdeacon glaring at 'and why be be called on to lower in world esteem own by coming in contact with man a have hitherto lived among gentleman mean to be dragged into other company by anybody ' poor mr harding knew well what archdeacon meant eleanor be a innocent a own baby must not understand how archdeacon must consider to be dragged into bad company by condescending to speak to mr slope for few minute when interest of father might be served by doing so ' be talking for full hour yesterday with mr slope ' said with little assumption of dignity 'and did not find to be lowered by ' 'perhaps not ' said 'but if will be good enough to allow will judge for in such matter tell eleanor will be much better for if will allow to be guided also by advice of who be friend if will be apt to find have friend left who can advise ' eleanor blushed up to root of hair even now have not slightest idea of what be passing in archdeacon mind thought of love making love receiving have yet found way to heart since death of poor john bold if be possible that thought must spring there man must be far different from mr slope must give birth nevertheless eleanor blushed deeply for felt be charged with improper conduct did so with more inward pain because father did not instantly rally to side that father for whose sake love have submitted to be receptacle of mr slope confidence have given detailed account of have passed to father though have not absolutely agreed with about mr slope view touching hospital yet have said nothing to make think that have be wrong in talking to be far too angry to humble before brother in law indeed have never accustomed to be very abject before have never be confidential ally in least understand what mean dr grantly ' said ' know that can accuse of doing anything that friend must disapprove mr slope called here expressly to ask what papa view be about hospital a believe called with friendly intention told ' 'friendly intention sneered archdeacon believe greatly wrong mr slope ' continued eleanor have explained to papa already a seem to approve of what say dr grantly will with permission leave papa together so saying walked out of room made mr harding very unhappy be quite clear that archdeacon wife have made up mind that eleanor be going to marry slope mr harding must not really bring to think that must do so yet must not deny that circumstance made appear that man company be not disagreeable to be now constantly seeing yet received visit from other unmarried gentleman always took part when conduct be canvassed although be aware how personally objectionable be to friend then again mr harding felt that if must choose to become mr slope have nothing that must justly against doing so have full right to please a father must not say that must disgrace by marrying clergyman who stood so well before world a mr slope did a for quarrelling with daughter on account of such marriage separating from a archdeacon have threatened to do with mr harding must be out of question if must determine to marry man must get over aversion a best must eleanor own old companion in old happy home must still be friend of bosom child of heart let who must cast off must not if be fated that must have to sit in old age at same table with man whom of men disliked most must meet fate a best might anything to must be preferable to loss of daughter such being feeling hardly knew how to take part with eleanor against archdeacon with archdeacon against eleanor will be said that must never have suspected ala never must have done so mr harding be by mean perfect character indecision weakness proneness to be led by others want of self confidence be very far from being perfect then must be remembered that marriage a archdeacon contemplated with disgust who know mr slope so well must regard with equal disgust did not appear so monstrous to mr harding because in charity did not hate chaplain a archdeacon did a do be however very unhappy when daughter left room have recourse to old trick of be customary to in time of sadness began playing slow tune upon imaginary violoncello drawing one hand slowly backwards forward a though held bow in modulating unreal chord with other will marry man a sure a two two make four ' said practical archdeacon ' hope not hope not ' said father 'but if doe what can say to have right to object to ' 'no right ' exclaimed dr grantly 'no right a father be in own profession for aught know good man ' to archdeacon must by mean assent be not well however to argue case against eleanor in own drawing room so walked forth discussed matter in bearing under elm tree of close mr harding also explained to son in law what have be purport at rate alleged purport of mr slope last visit to widow however stated that must not bring to believe that mr slope have real anxiety such a that have pretended ' can not forget demeanour to ' said mr harding 'and be not possible that idea must have changed so soon ' ' see ' said archdeacon sly tartufe think to buy daughter by providing for father mean to show how powerful be how good be how much be willing to do for beau yeux yes see now will be too many for yet mr harding ' said turning to companion with gravity pressing hand on other arm 'it must perhaps be better for to lose hospital than get on such term 'lose ' said mr harding 'why have lost already want have made up mind to do without will withdraw altogether will just go write line to bishop tell that withdraw claim altogether nothing must have pleased better than to be allowed to escape from trouble difficulty in such manner be now going too fast for archdeacon 'no will do such thing ' said dr grantly 'we will still have hospital hardly doubt that will have not by mr slope assistance if be necessary will lose will have spite of teeth if can arabin will be at plumstead to morrow must come over talk to ' two now turned into cathedral library be used by clergyman of close a sort of ecclesiastical club room for writing sermon sometimes letter also for reading theological work sometimes magazine newspaper theological work be not disturbed perhaps quite a often a from appearance of building outside public might have be led to expect here two ally settled on course of action archdeacon wrote letter to bishop strongly worded still respectful in put forward father in law claim to appointment expressed own regret that have not be able to see lordship when called of mr slope made mention whatsoever be then settled that mr harding must go to plumstead on following day after considerable discussion on matter archdeacon proposed to ask eleanor there also so a to withdraw if possible from mr slope attention week two ' said beay teach what be while be there will be out of harm way mr slope wo come there after eleanor be not little surprised when brother in law came back very civilly pressed to go out to plumstead with father instantly perceived that father have be fighting battle for behind back felt thankful to for sake must not show resentment to archdeacon by refusing invitation must not said go on morrow have invitation to drink tea at stanhope have promised to accept must added go with father on next day if must wait must follow stanhope said dr grantly ' did not know be so intimate with ' ' did not know ' said 'till miss stanhope called yesterday however like very much have promised to go play chess with of 'have party there ' said archdeacon still fearful of mr slope 'oh ' said eleanor beiss stanhope said there be to be nobody at have that mary have left for few week have learnt from one play chess so came over on purpose to ask to go in ' 'well be very friendly ' said ex warden certainly do look more like foreigner than english people dare say be none worse for ' archdeacon be inclined to look upon stanhope with favourable eye have nothing to object on matter be therefore arranged that mr harding must postpone visit to plumstead for one day then take with eleanor baby nurse mr slope be certainly becoming of importance in barchester chapter xix barchester by

even barchester close be better than world at large be most irregular in hour father be generally earliest in breakfast parlour charlotte must soon follow give coffee others breakfasted anywhere anyhow at time on morning after archdeacon futile visit to palace dr stanhope came down stair with ominously dark look about eyebrow white lock be rougher than usual breathed thickly loudly a took

english world 'if man arrest ' said 'he must go through court be thus thou great family of sidonia be thus that gentile treat thee when in most extreme need thou thine have aided with mountain of gold a big a lion occasionally with wine warrant order for dozen of dressing case 'what become insolvent ' said doctor that already ' said charlotte wishing always to get over difficulty 'what condition said doctor 'for son of clergyman of church of england see why clergyman son must pay debt more than other young men said charlotte 'he have a much from since left school a be held sufficient for eldest son of many nobleman said angry father 'well sir ' said charlotte 'give chance ' 'what ' said doctor mean that be to pay jew ' 'oh must pay must take chance if worst come to worst bertie must go abroad want to be civil to bertie let remain here a long a stop have plan in head may put on foot after ' just at moment door opened bertie came in whistling doctor immediately devoted to egg allowed bertie to whistle round to sister side without noticing charlotte gave little sign to with eye first glancing at father then at letter corner of peeped out from under tea tray bertie saw understood with quiet motion of cat abstracted letter made acquainted with content doctor however have seen deep a appeared to be mersed in egg shell said in harshest voice 'well sir do know that gentleman ' 'yes sir ' said bertie ' have sort of acquaintance with none can justify in troubling if will allow sir will answer ' 'at rate sha ' said father then added after pause 'be true sir that owe man l ' 'well said bertie ' think must be inclined to dispute amount if be in condition to pay such of a really do owe ' bill for l ' said father speaking very loudly very angrily 'well believe have ' said bertie money ever got from be l ' what became of l sir commission be l so took remainder in paving stone rocking horse 'paving stone rocking horse said doctor 'where be ' 'oh sir suppose

like to see paving stone `` ll tell what ' said 'if take care will find loose upon world without even house over head know a well a do be very angry ' bertie stroked big beard sipped tea chatted over misfortune in half comic half serious tone ended by promising sister that must do very best to make agreeable to widow bold then charlotte followed father to own room softened down wrath persuaded to say nothing more about jew bill discounter at rate for few week even went so far a to say must pay l at rate settle bill if saw certainty of son securing for anything like decent provision in life nothing be said openly between about poor eleanor father daughter understood other met together in drawing room at nine o'clock in perfect good humour with other about hour mr bold be announced have never be in house before though have of course called now felt strange to find there in usual evening dress entering drawing room of stranger in friendly unceremonious way a though have known life in three minute made at home charlotte tripped downstairs took bonnet from bertie came to relieve from shawl signora smiled on a must smile when chose to be gracious old doctor shook hand with in kind benedictory manner went to heart at once made feel that must be good man have not be seated for above five minute when door again opened mr slope be announced felt rather surprised because be told that nobody be to be there be very evident from manner of of mr slope be unexpected still there be not much in in such invitation bachelor two more le be always spoken of a nobody there be reason why mr slope must not drink tea at dr stanhope a well a eleanor however be very much surprised not very much gratified at finding that own embryo spouse made one of party have come there to gratify by gazing on madame neroni beauty listening to returning flattery though have not owned a much to still felt that if spent evening a have intended to do might probably not thereby advance suit with mr bold signora who have idea of rival received mr slope with usual mark of distinction a took hand made confidential communication to in low voice declaring that have plan to communicate to after tea be evidently prepared to go on with work of reducing chaplain to state of captivity poor mr slope be rather beside thought that eleanor must not have learnt from demeanour that be admirer of own have also flattered that idea be not unacceptable to what must think of if now devoted to married woman eleanor be not inclined to be severe in criticism on in respect felt annoyance of kind when found seated between bertie charlotte stanhope have not suspicion of mr slope intention have suspicion even of suspicion of other people still felt well pleased not to have mr slope too near to be not ill pleased to have bertie stanhope near be rarely indeed that failed to make agreeable impression on stranger with bishop indeed who thought much of own dignity be possible that might fail hardly with young lady pretty woman possessed tact of becoming instantly intimate with woman without giving rise to fear of impertinence have about somewhat of propensity of tame cat seemed quite natural that must be petted caressed treated with familiar good nature that in return must purr be sleek graceful above never show claw like other tame cat however have claw sometimes made dangerous when tea be over charlotte went to open window declared loudly that full harvest moon be much too beautiful to be disregarded called to look at to tell truth there be one there who cared much about moon beauty that one be not charlotte knew how valuable aid to purpose chaste goddess might become must easily create little enthusiasm for purpose of moment eleanor bertie be soon with doctor be now quiet in arm chair mr stanhope in hers prepared for slumber 'be whewellite brewsterite t'othermanite mr bold ' said charlotte who knew little about everything have read about third of of book to alluded 'oh said eleanor ' have not read of book feel sure that there be one man in moon at least if not more ' 'you believe in pulpy gelatinous matter ' said bertie ' heard about ' said eleanor 'and really think be almost wicked to talk in such manner how can argue about god power in other star from law have given for role in one indeed ' said bertie 'why must there be race of salamander in venus even if there be nothing fish in jupiter why must fish there be a wide awake a men woman here ' 'that must be saying very little for ' said charlotte ' be for dr whewell for think that men woman be worth being repeated in such countless world there may be soul in other star doubt having body attached to come mr bold let put bonnet on walk round close if be to discus sidereal question will do so much better under tower of cathedral than stuck in narrow window mr bold made objection party be made to walk out charlotte stanhope well knew rule a to three being company have therefore to induce sister to allow mr slope to accompany mr slope ' said `` m sure will join will be in again in quarter of hour madeline ' madeline read in eye that have to say knew object a have to depend on sister for so many of amusement felt that must yield be hard to be left alone while others of own age walked out to feel soft influence of bright night must be harder still without sort of sanction charlotte gave to flirtation intrigue charlotte eye told that must give up just at present for good of family so madeline obeyed charlotte eye said nothing of sort to mr slope have objection at to tete tete with signora departure of other three must allow gently whispered to ' will not leave alone ' 'oh yes said 'go pray go pray go for sake think that be so selfish be understood that nobody be kept within for will understand too when know better pray join mr slope when come in speak to for five minute before leave ' mr slope understood that be to go therefore joined party in hall must have have objection at to arrangement if must have secured mr bold arm be of course out of question indeed fate be very soon settled for sooner have reached hall door than miss stanhope put hand within arm bertie walked off with eleanor just a naturally a though be already own property so sauntered forth first walked round close according to avowed intent then went under old arched gateway below st cuthbert little church then turned behind ground of bishop palace so on till came to bridge just at edge of town from passer by can look down into garden of hiram hospital charlotte mr slope who be in advance stopped till other two came up to mr slope knew that gable end old brick chimney stood up so prettily in moonlight be of mr harding late abode must not have stopped on spot in such company if must have avoided miss stanhope must not take hint tried to give 'this be very pretty place mr bold ' said charlotte 'by far prettiest place near barchester wonder father gave up ' be very pretty place now by deceitful light of moon looked twice larger twice prettier twice more antiquely picturesque than must have done in truth telling daylight who doe not know air of complex multiplicity mysterious interesting grace moon always lends to old gabled building half surrounded a be hospital by fine tree a seen from bridge on night of be speaking mr harding late abode did look very lovely though eleanor did not grieve at father having left felt at moment intense wish that might be allowed to return 'he be going to return to immediately be not ' asked bertie eleanor made immediate reply much question passed unanswered without notice of questioner such be not now case remained silent a though expecting to reply after moment two charlotte said ' believe be settled that mr harding return to hospital be not ' ' think anything about be settled yet said eleanor 'but must be matter of course ' said bertie 'that be if father wish who else on earth must hold after what have occurred ' eleanor quietly made companion to understand that matter be one must not discus in present company then passed on charlotte said must go short way up hill out of town so a to look back on tower of cathedral a eleanor leant upon bertie arm for assistance in walk told how matter stood between father bishop ' said bertie pointing on to mr slope 'what part doe take in ' eleanor explained how mr slope have at first endeavoured to tyrannize over father how have latterly come round done must to talk bishop over in mr harding favour father ' said 'be hardly inclined to trust say be so arrogant to old clergyman of city word for ' said bertie 'your father be right if be not very much mistaken man be arrogant false ' strolled up top of hill then returned through field by footpath lead by small wooden bridge rather plank with rustic rail to over river to other side of cathedral from at have started have thus walked round bishop ground through river run round cathedral adjacent field be past eleven before reached doctor door 'it be very late ' said eleanor 'it will be shame to disturb mother at hour ' said charlotte laughing 'you wo disturb mamma dare say be in bed by time madeline must be furious if come in see come bertie take mr bold bonnet from went up stair found signora alone reading looked somewhat sad melancholy not more so perhaps than be sufficient to excite additional interest in bosom of mr slope be soon deep in whispered intercourse with happy gentleman who be allowed to find resting place on sofa signora have way of whispering be peculiarly own be exactly reverse of prevails among great tragedian great tragedian hiss out positive whisper made with bated breath produced by inarticulate tongue formed sound yet be audible through whole house signora however used hiss produced word in clear silver tone must only be heard by ear into be poured charlotte hurried skurried about room hither thither doing pretending to do many thing then saying something about seeing mother ran up stair eleanor be then left alone with bertie hardly felt hour fly by to give bertie due credit must not have played card better did not make love to sigh look languishing be amusing familiar yet respectful when left eleanor at own door at one o'clock did by bye with assistance of now jealous slope thought be one of most agreeable men stanhope decidedly most

conversation about barchester there be not much sisterly confidence between mr grantly be ten year older than eleanor have be married while eleanor be yet child have never therefore poured into other ear hope love now that one be wife other widow be not probable that must begin to do so lived too much asunder to be able to fall into kind of intercourse make confidence between sister almost necessity moreover that be so easy at eighteen be often very difficult at twenty eight mr grantly knew did not therefore expect confidence from sister yet longed to ask whether in real truth mr slope be agreeable to be by mean difficult to turn conversation to mr slope that gentleman have become so famous at barchester have so much to do with clergyman connected with city be so specially concerned in affair of mr harding that must have be odd if mr harding daughter have not talked about mr grantly be soon abusing did with whole heart mr bold be nearly a eager to defend positively disliked man must have be delighted to learn that have taken off so that must never see again have indeed almost fear of yet constantly found taking part abuse of other people abuse of nature that felt to be unjust imposed that necessity on at last made mr slope defence habitual course of argument with from mr slope conversation turned to stanhope mr grantly be listening with interest to eleanor account of family when dropped out that mr slope be one of party ' said lady of rectory mr slope there too ' eleanor merely replied that such have be case eleanor must be very fond of think seems to follow everywhere ' even did not open eleanor eye merely laughed said that imagined mr slope found other attraction at dr stanhope so parted mr grantly felt quite convinced that odious match must take place mr bold a convinced that unfortunate chaplain disagreeable a must be allowed to be be more sinned against than sinning archdeacon of course heard before dinner that eleanor have remained day before at barchester with view of meeting mr slope that have so met remembered how have positively stated that there be to be guest at stanhope did not hesitate to accuse of deceit moreover fact rather presumed fact of being deceitful on matter spoke too plainly in evidence against a to imputed crime of receiving mr slope a lover be afraid that anything can do will be too late ' said archdeacon own be fairly surprised never liked sister taste with regard to men still did not give credit for ugh 'and so soon too ' said mr grantly who thought more perhaps of sister indecorum in having lover before have put off weed than bad taste in having lover a mr slope dear will be sorry to be harsh to do anything can hurt father positively that man wife will come within door mr grantly sighed then attempted to console lord by remarking that after thing be not accomplished yet now that eleanor be at plumstead much might be done to wean from fatal passion poor eleanor evening passed off without anything to make remarkable mr arabin discussed parish of st ewold with archdeacon mr grantly mr harding who knew parsonage of parish joined in eleanor also knew spoke little mr arabin did not apparently take much notice of be not in humour to receive at time with special grace special favourite of brother in law first idea on reaching bedroom be that much more pleasant family party might be met at dr stanhope than at rectory began to think that be getting tired of clergyman respectable humdrum wearisome mode of living that after people in outer world who have lived in italy london elsewhere need not necessarily be regarded a atrocious abominable stanhope have thought be giddy thoughtless extravagant set of people have seen nothing wrong about have on other hand found that thoroughly knew how to make house agreeable be thousand pity thought that archdeacon must not have little of same savoir vivre mr arabin a have said did not apparently take much notice of yet did not go to bed without feeling that have be in company with very pretty woman a be case with most bachelor married men regarded prospect of month visit at plumstead in pleasanter light when learnt that very pretty woman be to share with before retired be settled that whole party must drive over on following day to inspect parsonage at st ewold three clergyman be to discus dilapidation two lady be to lend assistance in

mr arabin be therefore in manner forced into conversation with be soon on comfortable term together have thought about must have thought that in spite of black cloth mr arabin must not have be bad addition to stanhope family party now that archdeacon be away must trifle mr harding began by telling in most innocent manner imaginable old legend about mr arabin new parish there be said in day of yore illustrious priestess of st ewold famed through whole country for curing manner of disease have well a priestess have ever have well be extant to day shared in mind of many of people sanctity belonged to consecrated ground of parish church mr arabin declared that must look on such tenet on part of parishioner a anything orthodox mr grantly replied that so entirely disagreed with a to think that parish be in proper estate have not priestess a well a priest duty be never well done ' said 'unless be so divided ' suppose papa said eleanor 'that in oldest time priestess bore sway mr arabin perhaps think that such might be too much case now if sacred lady be admitted within parish think at rate ' said 'that be safer to run such risk priestly pride have ever exceeded that of sacerdotal female very lowly curate might perhaps essay to rule curate must be sure to get better of ' 'there be certainly example of such accident happening ' said mr grantly 'they do say that there be priestess at barchester who be very imperious in thing touching altar perhaps fear of fate a be before eye when be joined by archdeacon on gravel before vicarage descended again to grave dullness not

for battling with clergyman of own church mahometan must make against for battling with error of priest of rome yet surely must not be inclined to say must be wrong to do battle with such a pagan too with multiplicity of god must think equally odd that christian mahometan must disagree 'ah wage war about trifle so bitterly ' 'wars about trifle said 'be always bitter especially among neighbour when difference be great party comparative stranger men quarrel with courtesy what combatant be ever so eager a two brother 'but such contention bring scandal on church scandal must fall on church if there be such contention have one way to avoid that of acknowledging common head of church whose word on point of doctrine will be authoritative such termination of difficulty be alluring enough have charm

submissively in small matter of cellar kitchen grate found obliged to oppose reform might be of nature too expensive for pocket 'but seems to archdeacon ca very well lengthen room without pulling down wall if pull down wall must build up again then if throw out bow on side must do same on other then if do for ground floor must carry up to floor above will be putting new front to house will cost

nothing must be easier than adding six foot to front of dining room without touching other of house such irregularity of construction in small country house be said rather graceful than otherwise offered to pay for whole thing out of own pocket if cost more than forty pound mr arabin however be firm although archdeacon fussed fumed about must not give way forty pound said be matter of serious

be shy must not conceive that miss thorne surrounded a must be by peasant of ullathorne few of poorer inhabitant of suburb of barchester must in way affect composure of man well accustomed to address learned congregation of st mary at oxford laughed accordingly at idea of mr arabin modesty thereupon mr arabin commenced to subtilise change said from st mary to st ewold be quite a powerful on spirit a must be that from st ewold to st mary must not peer who by chance of fortune might suddenly be driven to herd among navvy be a afraid of jeer of companion a must navvy suddenly exalted to seat among peer whereupon archdeacon declared with loud laugh that must tell miss thorne that new minister have likened to navvy eleanor however pronounced such conclusion unfair comparison might be very just in proportion did not at assimilate thing compared mr arabin went in subtilising regarding archdeacon raillery eleanor defence young lady said must execute with most perfect self possession difficult

somewhat elevated among be affair of education at forty found difficult to educate now eleanor dissented on matter of box averred must speak very well about dress baby leg of mutton from box provided be big enough for to stand upon without fear even though friend be listening to archdeacon be sure must not be able to say word proved nothing in favour of mr arabin mr arabin said that must try question out with mr bold get on box day when rectory might be full of visitor to eleanor assented making condition that visitor must be of own set archdeacon cogitated in mind whether by condition be intended that mr slope must be included resolving also that if so trial must certainly never take place in rectory drawing room at plumstead so arguing drove up to iron gate of ullathorne court mr miss thorne be standing ready dressed for church in hall greeted clerical visitor with cordiality archdeacon be old favourite be clergyman of old school recommended to lady have always be opponent of

good churchwarden be ' 'not very severe hope ' said mr arabin two ecclesiastical officer touched hat made leg in approved rural fashion assuring vicar that be glad to have honour of seeing adding that weather be very good for harvest mr stile being man somewhat versed in town life have impression of own dignity did not quite like leaving pastor under erroneous idea that being churchwarden kept child in order during church time 't be thus understood mr arabin allusion to severity hastened to put matter right by observing that beexton clodheave looked to younguns perhaps sometimes there maybe

near grave can teach duty can explain to that so imperfectly understand that year of study may have made so plain to have newly acquired privilege a one of god minister imparted to a yet fitness for wonderful work of preacher must be supposed that such idea do occur to young clergyman yet overcome apparently with ease difficulty to appears to be insurmountable have never be subjected in way of ordination to power of bishop hand may be that there be in something sustains spirit banishes natural modesty of youth for must own that deep affection dominie sampson felt for young pupil have not

may be good one though necessity for hardly come home to general understanding forbearance on part of youth must be much more appreciated if be extended likewise to sermon only danger must be that congregation must be too anxious to prevent young clergyman from advancing to rank of ministry clergyman who must not preach must be such blessing that must be bribed to adhere to incompetence mr arabin however have not modesty of youth to impede succeeded with sermon even better than with lesson took for text two verse out of second epistle of st john trangresseth abideth not in doctrine of christ hath not god abideth in doctrine of christ hath father son if there come unto bring not doctrine receive not into house bid god speed ' told that house of theirs to alluded be church in now

ullathorne a soon a be in hall miss thorne took mr arabin hand assured that received into house into temple said in worshipped bade god speed with heart mr arabin be touched squeezed spinster hand without uttering word in reply then mr thorne expressed hope that mr arabin found church easy to fill mr arabin having replied that have doubt must do so a soon a have learnt to pitch voice to building sat down to good thing before miss thorne took special care of mr bold eleanor still wore widow weed therefore have about that air of grave sad maternity be lot of recent widow opened soft heart of miss thorne made look on young guest a though too much must not be done for heaped chicken ham upon plate poured out for full bumper of port wine when eleanor who be not sorry to get have drunk little of miss thorne at once essayed to fill again to eleanor objected in vain miss thorne winked nodded whispered saying that be proper thing must be done that knew about so desired mr bold to drink up mind body 'it be duty know to support ' said into ear of young mother 'there be more than depending on ' thus coshered up eleanor with cold fowl port wine how be that poor men wife who have cold fowl port wine on to be coshered up nurse child without difficulty whereas wife of rich men who eat drink everything be good can not do so will for present leave to doctor mother to settle between then miss thorne be great about teeth little johnny bold have be troubled for last few day with first incipient masticator with freemasonry exists between lady miss thorne became aware of fact before eleanor have half finished wing old lady prescribed at once receipt have be much in vogue in young day of grandmother warned eleanor with solemn voice against fallacy of modern medicine 'take

got coral how can expect that must cut teeth have got be elixir ' eleanor explained that have not have not be ordered by mr rerechild barchester doctor whom employed then young mother mentioned shockingly modern succedaneum mr rerechild new light have taught to recommend miss thorne looked awfully severe 'take care dear ' said 'that man know what be about take care doe destroy little boy

best teeth in county carried to grave with at eighty have heard say be carrot juice must bear barchester doctor even poor dr bumpwell did please clearly never occurred to miss thorne that fifty year

arabin in paying so much attention to madame neroni be a infallible that madeline must displease irritate woman a must charm captivate men one result followed naturally on other be quite true that mr arabin have be charmed thought very clever very handsome woman thought also that peculiar affliction entitled to sympathy of have never said met so much suffering joined to such perfect beauty so clear mind 't be thus spoke of signora coming home in archdeacon carriage eleanor by mean liked to hear praise be however exceedingly unjust of to be angry with mr arabin a have spent very pleasant evening with bertie stanhope who have taken down to dinner have not left side for one moment after gentleman came out of dining room be unfair that must amuse with bertie yet begrudge new friend licence of amusing with bertie sister yet did so be half angry with in carriage said something about meretricious manner mr arabin did not understand way of woman very well else might have flattered that eleanor be in love with eleanor be not in love with how many shade there be between love indifference how little graduated scale be understood have now be nearly three week in same house with mr arabin have received much of attention listened daily to conversation have usually devoted at least portion of evening to exclusively at dr stanhope have devoted exclusively to doe not require that woman must be in love to be irritated at doe not require that must even acknowledge to herself that be unpleasant to eleanor have such self knowledge thought in own heart be only on mr arabin account that regretted that must condescend to be amused by signora thought have more mind ' said to herself a sat watching baby cradle on return from party believe mr stanhope be pleasanter man of two ala for memory of poor john bold eleanor be not in love with bertie stanhope be in love with mr arabin devotion to late husband be fast fading when must revolve in mind over cradle of infant fault failing of other aspirant to favour will one blame heroine for let rather thank god for goodness for mercy endureth for ever eleanor in truth be not in love neither be mr arabin indeed be bertie stanhope

little bit of crimped white crape that sits so jauntily on back of head be a dissimilar to first huge mountain of woe disfigured face of weeper a state of hindoo be to jointure of english dowager let be clearly understood that eleanor be in love with one that one be in love with eleanor under circumstance anger against mr arabin did not last long before two day be over be a good friend a ever must not like for hour spent in company be spent pleasantly yet must not quite like for there be always apparent in conversation certain feeling on part that hardly thought worth while to be in earnest be almost a though be playing with child knew well enough that be in truth sober thoughtful man who in matter on occasion must endure agony of earnestness yet to be always gently playful must have seen brow once clouded might have learnt to love so thing went on at plumstead on whole not unpleasantly till huge storm darkened horizon came down upon inhabitant of rectory with fury of water spout be astonishing how in few minute whole face of heaven be changed party broke up from breakfast in perfect harmony fierce passion have arisen before evening did not admit of sitting at same board for dinner to explain will be necessary to go back little will be remembered that bishop expressed to mr slope in dressing room determination that mr quiverful must be confirmed in appointment to hospital that lordship requested mr slope to communicate decision to archdeacon will also be remembered that archdeacon have indignantly declined seeing mr slope have instead written strong letter to bishop in demanded situation of warden for mr harding to letter archdeacon received immediate formal reply from mr slope in be stated that bishop have received must give best consideration to archdeacon letter archdeacon felt somewhat checkmated by reply what must do with man who must neither see argue with by letter who have undoubtedly power of appointing clergyman pleased have consulted with mr arabin who have suggested propriety of calling in aid of master of lazarus 'if said 'you dr gwynne formally declare intention of waiting upon bishop bishop will not dare to refuse to see if two such men a see together will probably not leave without carrying point ' archdeacon did not quite like admitting necessity of being backed by master of lazarus before must obtain admission into episcopal palace of barchester still felt that advice be good resolved to take wrote again to bishop expressing hope that nothing further must be done in matter of hospital till consideration promised by lordship have be given then sent off warm appeal to friend master imploring to come to plumstead assist in driving bishop into compliance master have rejoined raising difficulty not declining archdeacon again pressed point insisting on necessity for immediate action dr gwynne unfortunately have gout must therefore name immediate day still agreed to come if must be finally found necessary so matter stood a regarded party at plumstead mr harding have friend fighting battle for quite a powerful a master of lazarus be mr slope though bishop have so pertinaciously insisted on giving way to wife in matter of hospital mr slope did not think necessary to abandon object have thought daily more more reason to imagine that widow must receive overture favourably must not feel that mr harding at hospital placed there by mean must be more likely to receive a son in law than mr harding growling in opposition disappointment under archdeacon wing at plumstead moreover to give mr slope due credit be actuated by greater motif even than wanted wife wanted money wanted power more than have fully realised fact that must come to blow with mr proudie have desire to remain in barchester a chaplain sooner than do so must risk loss of whole connection with diocese what be to feel within possession of ordinary talent be to know to be courageous firm in matter where conscience did not interfere unscrupulous yet be contented to be working factotum of woman prelate mr slope have higher idea of own destiny mr proudie must go to wall now have come time when must try must be bishop have declared that mr quiverful must be new warden a mr slope went down stair prepared to see archdeacon if necessary fully satisfied that such necessity must arise declared to that mr harding must be warden with object of carrying

then thought of comfortable house in barchester of comfortable income of boy sent to school of girl with book in hand instead of darning needle of wife face again covered with smile of daily board again covered with plenty thought of thing do thou also reader think of then wonder if thou canst mr slope have appeared to to posse good gift must grace bishop chaplain 'how beautiful upon mountain

for chaplain who be beneath notice be cruel in man so circumstanced to set world against father of fourteen child because be anxious to obtain for honourable support mr quiverful have not asked for wardenship have not even accepted till have be assured that mr harding have refused how hard then that must be blamed for doing not to have done must have argued most insane imprudence thus in matter of hospital poor mr quiverful have trial have also consolation on whole consolation be more vivid of two stern draper heard of coming promotion wealth of warehouse be at mr quiverful disposal coming

what father mean when talk so much of what be due to mr harding ' said to eldest daughter 'does think that mr harding must give l out of fine feeling what signifies when offends a long a get place doe not expect anything better pass to think how father can be so soft while everybody around be so griping ' while rest of world be accusing mr quiverful of rapacity for promotion disregard for honour inner world of own household be falling foul of with equal vehemence for willingness to sacrifice interest to false feeling of sentimental pride be astonishing how much difference point of view make in aspect of that look at such be feeling of different member of family at puddingdale on occasion of mr slope second visit mr quiverful a soon a saw horse coming up avenue from vicarage gate hastily packed up huge basket of needlework hurried daughter out of room in be sitting with husband 'it mr slope said be come to settle with about hospital do hope will now be able to move at once hastened to bid maid of work to go to door so that welcome great man might not be kept waiting mr slope thus found mr quiverful alone mr quiverful went off to kitchen back settlement with anxious beating heart almost dreading that there might be slip between cup of happiness lip of fruition yet comforting with reflection that after what have taken place such slip must hardly be possible mr slope be smile a shook brother clergyman hand said that have ridden over because thought right at once to put mr quiverful in possession of fact of matter regarding wardenship of hospital a spoke poor expectant husband father saw at glance that brilliant hope be to be dashed to ground that visitor be now there for purpose of unsaying what on former visit have said there be something in tone of voice something in glance of eye told tale mr quiverful knew at once maintained self possession however smiled with slight unmeaning smile merely said that be obliged to mr slope for trouble be taking have be troublesome matter from first to last ' said mr slope 'and bishop have hardly known how to act between ourselves mind of course must go farther mr quiverful ' mr quiverful said of course that must not 'the truth be that poor mr harding have hardly known own mind remember last conversation doubt mr quiverful assured that remembered very well indeed 'you will remember that told that mr harding have refused to return to hospital mr quiverful declared that nothing must be more distinct in memory 'and acting on refusal suggested that must take hospital continued mr slope understood to say that bishop have authorised to offer to ' 'did did go so far a well perhaps may be that in anxiety on behalf did commit further than must have done so far a own memory serf think did go quite so far a own be very anxious that must get may have said more than be quite prudent 'but ' said mr quiverful in deep anxiety to prove case wife received a distinct promise from mr proudie a one human being must give to ' mr slope smiled gently shook head meant that smile for pleasant smile be diabolical in eye of man be speaking to bers proudie ' said 'if be to go to what pass between lady in matter will really be in nest of trouble from will never extricate mr proudie be most excellent lady kind hearted charitable pious in way estimable dear mr quiverful patronage of diocese be not in hand mr quiverful for moment sat panic stricken silent 'be to understand then have received promise said a soon a have sufficiently collected thought will allow will tell exactly how matter rest certainly did receive promise conditional on mr harding refusal be sure will do justice to remember that declared that must accept appointment on other condition than knowledge that mr harding have declined ' 'yes

quiverful suppose mean to throw over having held out hand to man in position with large family pressing claim be not now going to draw back again only want to act with fairly honestly ' 'whatever do will endeavour at rate to act fairly ' said poor man feeling that have to fall back for support on spirit of martyrdom within ' be sure will ' said other be sure have wish to obtain possession of income belongs by right to man know better than do mr harding history can better appreciate character mr harding be very desirous of returning to old position bishop feel that be at present moment somewhat hampered though of course be not bound by conversation took place on matter between ' 'well said mr quiverful dreadfully doubtful a to what conduct under such circumstance must be fruitlessly striving to harden nerve with of instinct of self preservation made wife so bold 'the wardenship of little hospital be not only thing in bishop gift mr quiverful be by many degree best lordship be not

not be taken a formal promise that bishop will not allow to be poorer man than must have be have become warden mr quiverful sat in arm chair silent gazing at vacancy what be to say came from mr slope be so true mr harding have right to hospital bishop have great many good thing to give away bishop mr slope must be excellent friend terrible enemy to man in position then have proof of promise must not force bishop to appoint 'well mr quiverful what do say about ' 'oh of course think mr slope be great disappointment very great disappointment wo deny be very poor man mr slope ' 'in end mr quiverful will find that will have be better for ' interview ended in mr slope receiving full renunciation from mr quiverful of claim might have to appointment in question be only given verbally

tragic queen deep despair of bereaved mother doubting yet hardly fearing what might have be tenor of mr slope discourse rushed back to husband a soon a front door be closed behind visitor be well for mr slope that have so escaped anger of such woman at moment must have cowed even a general rule be highly desirable that lady must keep temper woman when storm always make ugly usually ridiculous also there be nothing so odious to man a virago though theseus loved amazon showed love roughly from time of theseus downward man ever wished to have wife remarkable rather for forward prowess than

about than jemima doe jemima be two year old 'and if will take advice will lose time in going over seeing ' soft however a mr quiverful might be must not allow to be talked out of opinion on occasion proceeded with much minuteness to explain to wife tone in mr slope have spoken of mr proudie interference in diocesan matter a did so new idea gradually instilled into matron head new course of action presented to judgement what if after mr proudie knew nothing of visit of mr slope in case might not be possible that lady must still be staunch to in matter still stand friend perhaps possibly carry through in opposition to mr slope mr quiverful said nothing a vague hope occurred to listened with more than ordinary patience to what husband have to say while be still explaining that in probability

legion of episcopal servant force if need be into presence of lady who have so wronged have shame about mauvaise honte dread of archdeacon must a declared to husband make wail heard in market place if did not get redress justice might be very well for unmarried young curate to be shamefaced in such matter might be right that smug rector really in want of nothing still looking for better preferment

say monster who do such thing there be wife may not rather say slave who put up with such usage dr mr proudie be not among number bishop with beating about bush made lady understand that very much wished to go lady without beating about bush made bishop understand that must hear of must be useless here to repeat argument be used on side needle to record result who be married will understand very well how battle be lost won who be single will never understand till learn lesson experience alone can give when mr quiverful be shown into mr proudie room that lady have only returned few minute from lord before left have seen answer to archbishop note written sealed wonder that face be wreathed with smile a received mr quiverful instantly spoke of subject be so near heart of visitor mr quiverful ' said 'be decided yet when be to move to barchester ' 'that woman a have hour two since be called became instantly re endowed with grace can adorn bishop wife mr quiverful immediately saw that business be to be piteous that nothing be to be gained by indignation nothing indeed unless must be indignant in company with patroness mr proudie ' began ' fear be not to move to barchester at ' 'why not ' said lady sharply dropping at moment notice smile condescension turning with sharp quick way to business saw at glance be important then mr quiverful told tale a progressed in history of wrong perceived that heavier leant upon mr slope blacker became mr proudie brow that such blackness be not injurious to own cause when mr slope be at puddingdale vicarage that morning have regarded a creature of lady bishop now perceived that be enemy admitted mistake to herself without pain humiliation have one feeling be confined to family cared little how twisted turned among new comer at bishop palace a long a must twist husband into warden house cared not be friend be enemy if only must get preference so sorely wanted told tale mr proudie listened to almost in silence told how mr slope have cozened husband into resigning claim have declared that be bishop will that none mr harding must be warden mr proudie brow became blacker blacker at last started from chair begging mr quiverful to sit wait for return marched out of room mr proudie be for fourteen child for fourteen child such be burden fell on ear a closed door behind chapter xxvi mr proudie take fall be hardly hour since mr proudie have left husband apartment victorious yet so indomitable be courage that now returned thither panting for combat be greatly angry with what thought be duplicity have so clearly given promise on matter of hospital have be already so absolutely vanquished on point mr proudie began to feel that if affair be to be thus discussed battled about twice even thrice work of diocese must be too much even for without knocking at door walked quickly into husband room found seated at office table with mr slope opposite to between finger be very note have written to archbishop in presence be open yes have absolutely violated seal have be made sacred by approval be sitting in deep conclave be too clear that purport of archbishop invitation have be absolutely canvassed again after have be already debated decided on in obedience to behest mr slope rose from chair bowed slightly two opposing spirit looked other fully in face knew that be looking at enemy 'what be bishop about mr quiverful ' said coming to end of table standing there mr slope did not allow bishop to answer replied ' have be out to puddingdale morning ma'be have seen mr quiverful mr quiverful have abandoned claim to hospital because be now aware that mr harding be desirous to fill old place under circumstance have strongly advised lordship to nominate mr harding ' ber quiverful have not abandoned anything ' said lady with very imperious voice lordship word have be pledged to must be respected ' bishop still remained silent be anxiously desirous of making old enemy bite dust beneath foot new ally have told that nothing be more easy for than to do so ally be there now at elbow to help yet courage failed be so hard to conquer when prestige of former victory be against one be so hard for cock who have once be beaten out of yard to resume courage again take proud place upon dunghill ought not to interfere ' said mr slope 'but yet 'certainly ought not ' said infuriated dame yet continued mr slope not regarding interruption have thought imperative duty to recommend to bishop not to slight mr harding claim ber harding must have known own mind ' said lady mr harding be not replaced at hospital lordship will have to encounter much ill will not only in diocese in world at large besides taking higher ground lordship a understood feel to be duty to gratify in matter so very worthy man so good clergyman a mr harding ' 'and what be to become of sabbath day school of sunday service in hospital said mr proudie with something very nearly approaching to sneer on face ' understand that mr harding make objection to sabbath day school ' said mr slope 'and a to hospital service that matter will be best discussed after appointment if have personal objection then fear matter must rest 'you have very easy conscience in such matter mr slope ' said ' must not have easy conscience ' rejoined 'but conscience very far from being easy if anything said done by must lead bishop to act unadvisedly on matter be clear that in interview have with mr harding misunderstood ' 'and be equally clear that have misunderstood mr quiverful ' said not at top of wrath 'what business have at with interview who desired to go to mr quiverful morning who commissioned to manage affair will answer sir who sent to mr quiverful morning ' there be dead pause in room mr slope have risen from chair be standing with hand on back of looking at first very solemn now very black mr proudie be standing a have at first placed at end of table a interrogated foe struck hand upon with almost more than feminine vigour bishop be sitting in easy chair twiddling thumb turning eye now to wife now to chaplain a took up cudgel how comfortable must be if must fight out between without necessity of interference on part fight out so that one must kill other utterly a far a diocesan life be concerned so that bishop might know clearly by whom behoved to be led there must be comfort of quiet in case if bishop have wish a to might prove victor that wish be certainly not antagonistic to mr slope 'better devil know than devil know ' be old saying perhaps true one bishop have not yet realised truth of 'will answer sir ' repeated instructed to call on mr quiverful morning ' there be pause intend to answer sir ' think mr proudie that under circumstance will be better for not to answer question said mr slope mr slope have many tone in voice duly under command among be sanctified low tone sanctified loud tone now used former anyone send sir ' bers proudie ' said mr slope ' be quite aware how much owe to kindness be aware also what be due by courtesy from gentleman to lady there be higher consideration than of hope will be forgiven if now allow to be actuated solely by duty in matter be to lordship can admit of questioning from have approved of what have done must excuse if say that having approval own want none other what horrid word be greeted ear of mr proudie matter be indeed too clear there be premeditated mutiny in camp not only have ill conditioned mind become insubordinate by fruition of little power bishop have not yet be twelve month in chair rebellion have already reared hideous head within palace anarchy misrule must quickly follow unless took immediate strong measure to put down conspiracy have detected ber slope ' said with slow dignified voice differing much from that have hitherto used slope will trouble if please to leave apartment wish to speak to lord alone mr slope also felt that everything depended on present interview must bishop now be repetticoated thraldom must be complete for ever present moment be peculiarly propitious for rebellion bishop have clearly committed by breaking seal of answer to archbishop have therefore fear to influence mr slope have told that consideration ought to induce to refuse archbishop invitation have therefore hoped to influence have accepted mr quiverful resignation therefore dreaded having to renew matter with wife have be screwed up to pitch of asserting will of own might possibly be carried on till by absolute success must have be taught how possible be to succeed now be moment for victory rout be now that mr slope must make master of diocese else resign place begin search for fortune again saw plainly after what have taken place compromise between lady be impossible let once leave room at bidding leave bishop in hand might at once pack up portmanteau bid adieu to episcopal honour mr bold signora neroni yet be not so easy to keep ground when be bidden by lady to go to continue to make third in party between husband wife when wife expressed wish for tete tete with husband slope ' repeated ' wish to be alone with lord ' lordship have summoned on most important diocesan business ' said mr slope glancing with uneasy eye at dr proudie felt that must trust something to bishop yet trust be so woefully misplaced bey leaving at present moment be fear impossible bandy word with ungrateful man ' said bey lord will do favour to beg mr slope to leave room lord scratched head for moment said nothing be a much a mr slope expected from be on whole for active exercise of marital right lord ' said lady mr slope to leave room be ' here mr proudie made false step must not have alluded to possibility of retreat on part must not have expressed idea that order for mr slope expulsion must be treated otherwise than by immediate obedience in answer to question bishop naturally said in own mind that be necessary that one must leave room perhaps might be a well that mr proudie did so did say so in own mind externally again scratched head again twiddled thumb mr proudie be boiling over with wrath ala ala must have kept temper a enemy did must have conquered a have ever conquered divine anger got better of a have done of other heroine fell bey lord ' said 'be to be vouchsafed answer be not at last broke deep silence proclaimed slopeite dear ' said ber slope be very busy ' be there be nothing more necessary have gone to battle field stood dust heat of day encountered fury of foe won victory how easy be success to who will only be true to mr slope saw at once full amount of gain turned on vanquished lady look of triumph never forgot never forgave here be wrong must have looked humbly at with meek entreating eye have deprecated anger must have said by glance that asked pardon for success that hoped forgiveness for stand have be forced to make in cause of duty so might perchance have somewhat mollified that imperious bosom prepared way for future term mr slope meant to rule without term ah forgetful inexperienced man can cause little trembling victim to be divorced from woman who posse can provide that will be separated at bed board be not flesh of flesh bone of bone must not so continue be very well now for to stand ground triumph a be driven ignominiously from room can be present when curtain be drawn when awful helmet of proof have be tied beneath chin when small remnant of bishop prowess will be cowed by tassel above head can then intrude when wife wish speak to lord alone for moment mr slope triumph be complete for mr proudie without further parley left room did not forget to shut door after then followed close conference between new ally to be said much astonished slope to say bishop to hear yet one said other heard without ill will there be mincing of matter now chaplain plainly told bishop that world gave credit for being under governance of wife that credit character in diocese be suffering that must surely get into hot water if allowed mr proudie to interfere in matter be not suitable for woman power in fact that must become contemptible if did not throw off yoke under groaned bishop at first hummed hawed affected to deny truth of what be said denial be by silence quickly broke down soon admitted by silence state of vassalage pledged with mr slope assistance to change course mr slope did not make out bad case for explained how grieved to run counter to lady who have always be patroness who have befriended in so many way who have in fact recommended to bishop notice a stated duty be now imperative held situation of peculiar confidence be immediately especially attached to bishop person in such situation conscience required that must regard solely bishop interest therefore have ventured to speak out bishop took for what be worth mr slope only intended that must do so gilded pill mr slope have to administer bishop thought must be le bitter than other pill have be so long taking lord ' have immediate reward like good child be instructed to write at once did write note to archbishop accepting grace invitation note mr slope more prudent than lady took away posted with own hand thus made sure that act of self jurisdiction must be a nearly a possible fait accompli begged coaxed threatened bishop with view of making also write at once to mr harding bishop though temporarily emancipated from wife be not yet enthralled to mr slope said probably said truly that such offer must be made in official form that be not yet prepared to sign form that must prefer seeing mr harding before did so mr slope might however beg mr harding to call upon not disappointed with achievement mr slope went way first posted precious note have in pocket then pursued other enterprise in must follow in other chapter mr proudie having received such satisfaction a be to be derived from slamming husband door did not at once betake to mr quiverful indeed for first few moment after repulse felt that must not again see that lady must have to own that have be beaten to confess that diadem have passed from brow sceptre from hand must send message to with promise of letter on next day day after thus resolving betook to bed room here again changed mind air of sacred enclosure restored courage gave heart a achilles warmed at sight of armour a don quixote heart grew strong when grasped lance so did mr proudie look forward to fresh laurel a hey fell on husband pillow must not despair having so resolved descended with dignified mien refreshed countenance to mr quiverful scene in bishop study took longer in acting than in telling have not perhaps have whole of conversation at rate mr quiverful be beginning to be very impatient be thinking that farmer subsoil must be tired of waiting for when mr proudie returned oh who can tell palpitation of maternal heart a suppliant looked into face of great lady to see written there promise of house income comfort future competence else doom of continued ever increasing poverty poor mother poor wife there be little there to comfort quiverful ' thus spoke lady with considerable austerity without sitting down ' find that husband have behaved in matter in very weak foolish manner mr quiverful immediately rose upon foot thinking disrespectful to remain sitting while wife of bishop stood be desired to sit down again made to do so so that mr proudie might stand preach over be generally considered offensive thing for gentleman to keep seat while be kept standing before presume same law hold with regard to lady often be so felt be inclined to say that never produce discomfort feeling of implied inferiority be shown by great man who desire visitor to be seated while speaks from leg solecism in good breeding when construed into english mean accepted rule of courtesy in world require must offer seat if did not do so must bring charge against in world of being arrogant ill mannered will obey world nevertheless will not put on equality with may sit down wo sit with sit therefore at bidding will stand talk to be just what mr proudie meant to say mr quiverful though be too anxious too flurried thus to translate full meaning of manoeuvre did not fail to feel effect be cowed uncomfortable second time essayed to rise from chair be seated mr quiverful pray keep seat husband say have be most weak most foolish be impossible mr quiverful to help people who will not help much fear that can now hing for in matter ' mr proudie say so ' said poor woman again jumping up 'pray be seated mr quiverful much fear that can hing further for in matter husband have in most unaccountable manner taken upon to resign be empowered to offer a matter of course bishop expects that clergy will know own mind what may ultimately do what may finally decide on doing can not say knowing extent of family ' 'fourteen child mr proudie fourteen of hardly bread barely bread be hard for child of clergyman be hard for one

however did gain access mr proudie proved woman whether be fourteen child with probable bare bread possible bare back respectability of father work mingled dust tear on mother face will not pretend to say mr proudie be touched did not show a other woman might have done did not give mr quiverful eau de cologne order glass of wine did not take her to toilet table offer use of brush comb towel water did not say soft little speech coax kindly with equanimity mr quiverful despite rough appearance must have be a amenable to such little tender care a lady in land none such be forthcoming instead of mr proudie slapped one hand upon other declared not with oath for a lady sabbatarian bishop must not swear with adjuration that behe must have done ' meaning of be that must have mr quiverful promised appointment cozened away by treachery of mr slope weakness of husband meaning very soon explained to mr quiverful 'why be husband fool ' said now dismounted from high horse sitting confidentially down

by dr mr grantly at plumstead will be remembered that mr slope when leaving billet doux with mr bold have be informed that must be sent out to at plumstead afternoon archdeacon mr harding have in fact come into town together in brougham have be arranged that must call for eleanor parcel a left on way home accordingly did so call maid a handed to coachman small basket large bundle carefully neatly packec gave in at carriage window mr slope archdeacon who be sitting next to window took immediately recognised hand writing of enemy left ' said ber slope called with reverence ' said girl be very anxious that missus must have to day ' so brougham drove off letter be left in archdeacon hand looked at a though held basket of adder must not have thought worse of document have read discovered to be licentious atheistical did moreover what so many wise people be accustomed to do in similar circumstance immediately condemned person to whom letter be written a though be necessarily particeps criminis poor mr harding though by mean inclined to forward mr slope intimacy with daughter must have given anything to have kept letter from son in law be now impossible there be in hand looked a thoroughly disgusted a though be quite sure that contained rhapsody of favoured lover very hard on ' said after while 'that must go on under roof ' now here archdeacon be certainly most unreasonable having invited sister in law to house be natural consequence of must receive letter there if mr slope chose to write to letter must a matter of course be sent after moreover very fact of invitation to one house implies confidence on part of inviter have shown that thought mr bold to be fit person to stay with by making to do so be most cruel to that must complain of violating sanctity of roof tree when laches committed be none of committing mr harding felt felt also that when archdeacon talked thus about roof what said be most offensive to a eleanor father if eleanor did receive letter from mr slope what be there in to pollute purity of dr grantly household be indignant that daughter must be so judged so spoken of made up mind even a mr slope must be dearer to than other creature on god earth almost broke out said a much for moment restrained 'here ' said archdeacon handing offensive missile to father in law ' be not going to be bearer of love letter be father may do a think fit with ' by doing a thought fit with archdeacon certainly meant that mr harding must be justified in opening reading letter taking step might in consequence be necessary to tell truth dr grantly did feel rather stronger curiosity than be justified by outraged virtue to see content of letter of course must not open wished to make mr harding understand a eleanor father must be fully justified in doing so idea of such proceeding never occurred to mr harding authority over eleanor ceased when became wife of john bold have not slightest wish to pry into correspondence consequently put letter into pocket only wished that have be able to do so without archdeacon knowledge sat silent during journey home then dr grantly said 'perhaps susan have better give to can explain to sister better than can do how deep be disgrace of such acquaintance ' think be very hard upon eleanor ' replied mr harding ' will not allow that have disgraced do think likely that will do so have right to correspond with whom plea will not take upon to blame because get letter from slope suppose ' said dr grantly 'you wish to marry man suppose will admit that must disgrace if did so ' wish to marry ' said perplexed father ' like think must make good husband if eleanor decides to do so will certainly not think that have disgraced ' 'good heaven exclaimed dr grantly threw back into corner of brougham mr harding said nothing more commenced playing dirge with imaginary fiddle bow upon imaginary violoncello for there did not appear to be quite room enough in carriage continued tune with sundry variation till arrived at rectory door archdeacon have be meditating sad thing in mind hitherto have always looked on father in law a true partisan though knew to be man devoid of combative qualification for character have felt no fear that mr harding must go over to enemy though have never counted much on ex warden prowess in breaking battle rank now however seemed that eleanor with wile have completely trepanned bewildered father cheated out of judgement robbed of predilection taste of life caused to be tolerant of man whose arrogance vulgarity must in few year since have be unendurable to that whole thing be a good a arranged between eleanor mr slope there be longer room to doubt that mr harding knew that such be case even must hardly be doubted be too manifest that at rate suspected be prepared to sanction to tell truth such be case mr harding disliked mr slope a much a be in nature to dislike man have daughter wished to do worst to displease by second marriage must hardly have succeeded better than by marrying mr slope a said to now very often what right have to condemn if did nothing be really wrong if liked slope be affair be indeed miraculous to that woman with mind so educated so refined so nice in taste must like man then asked whether be possible that did so ah thou weak man most charitable most christian weakest of men why couldst thou not have asked be not daughter of thy loin child of thy heart most beloved of thee of humanity have not proved to thee by year of closest affection truth goodness filial obedience yet groping in darkness hearing name in strain wounded thy loving heart being unable to defend a thou shouldst have done mr harding have not believed did not believe that daughter meant to marry man feared to commit to opinion if did do there must be then mean of retreat wish of heart be first that there must be truth in archdeacon surmise in wish must have fain trusted entirely have dared to do so secondly that match might be prevented if unfortunately have be contemplated by eleanor thirdly must be so infatuated a to marry man might justify conduct declare that cause existed for separating from wanted to believe incapable of such marriage wanted to show that so believed of wanted also to be able to say hereafter that have done nothing amiss if must unfortunately prove to be different from what thought to be nothing affection must justify such fickleness affection did justify there be little of roman about mr harding must not sacrifice lucretia even though must be polluted by accepted address of clerical tarquin at palace if tarquin must be prevented well good if not father must still open heart to daughter accept a present tarquin dr grantly mind be of stronger calibre be by mean deficient in heart loved with honest genuine love wife child friend loved father in law be quite prepared to love eleanor too if must be one of party if must be on side if must regard slope proudies a enemy of mankind acknowledge feel comfortable merit of gwynnes arabins wished to be what called safe with whom have admitted to penetralia of house heart must luxuriate in society be deficient in certain feeling of faithful staunch high churchism to be tantamount to freemasonry be not strict in line of definition endured without impatience many different shade of anglo church conservatism with slope proudies must not go on four be wanting in moreover perhaps must be more correct to say be not troubled by womanly tenderness be so peculiar to mr harding feeling towards friend be that while stuck to must stick to that must work with shoulder to shoulder that must be faithful to faithful knew nothing of beautiful love can be true to false friend thus two men miserable enough in own way returned to plumstead be getting late when arrived there lady have already gone up to dress nothing more be said a two parted in hall a mr harding passed to own room knocked at eleanor door handed in letter archdeacon hurried to own territory there to unburden heart to faithful partner what colloquy took place between marital chamber adjoining dressing room will not be detailed reader now intimate with person concerned can well imagine whole tenor of also might be read in mr grantly be brow a came down to dinner eleanor when received letter from father hand have idea from whom came have never seen mr slope handwriting if so have forgotten did not think of a twisted letter a people do twist letter when immediately recognise correspondent by writing seal be sitting at glass brushing hair rising other minute to play with boy who be sprawling on bed who engaged pretty nearly whole attention of maid a well a of mother at last sitting before toilet table broke seal turning over leaf saw mr slope name first felt surprised then annoyed then anxious a read became interested be so delighted to find that obstacle to father return to hospital be apparently removed that did not observe fulsome language in tidings be conveyed merely perceived that be commissioned to tell father that such be case did not realise fact that commission must not have be made in first instance to by unmarried young clergyman felt on whole grateful to mr slope anxious to get on dress that might run with news to father then came to allusion to own pious labour said in heart that mr slope be affected as then went on again be offended by boy being called mr slope darling be nobody darling own at rate not darling of disagreeable stranger like mr slope lastly arrived at tress felt qualm of disgust looked up in glass there be before long silken certainly very beautiful will not say that knew to be so felt angry with brushed roughly carelessly crumpled letter with angry violence resolved almost without thinking of that must not show to father must merely tell content of then comforted again with boy dress fastened went down to dinner a tripped down stair began to ascertain that there be difficulty in situation must not keep from father news about hospital must comfortably confess letter from mr slope before grantlys father have already gone down have heard step upon lobby resolved therefore to take aside tell little bit of news poor girl have idea how severely unfortunate letter have already be discussed when entered drawing room whole party be there including mr arabin whole party looked glum sour two girl sat silent apart a though be aware that something be wrong even mr arabin be solemn silent eleanor have not seen since breakfast have be whole day at st ewold such having be case be natural that must tell how matter be going on there did nothing of kind however remained solemn silent be solemn silent eleanor knew in heart that have be talking about heart misgave a thought of mr slope letter at rate felt to be quite impossible to speak to father alone while matter be in state dinner be soon announced dr grantly a be wont gave eleanor arm did so a though doing be outrage on feeling rendered necessary by sternest necessity with quick sympathy eleanor felt hardly put finger on coat sleeve may be guessed in what way dinner hour be passed dr grantly said few word to mr arabin mr arabin said few word to mr grantly said few word to father tried to say few word to eleanor felt that have be tried found guilty of something though knew not what longed to say out to 'well what be have done out with let know crime for heaven sake let hear worst of ' must not must say nothing sat there silent half feeling that be guilty trying in vain to pretend even to eat dinner at last cloth be drawn lady be not long following when be gone gentleman be somewhat more sociable not much so must not of course talk over eleanor sin archdeacon have indeed so far betrayed sister in law a to whisper into mr arabin ear in study a met there before dinner hint of what feared did so with gravest saddest of fear mr arabin became grave apparently sad enough a heard opened eye mouth said in sort of whisper ber slope ' in same way a might have said cholera have friend told that horrid disease be in nursery ' fear so fear so ' said archdeacon then together left room will not accurately analyse mr arabin feeling on receipt of such astounding tidings will suffice to say that be surprised vexed sorrowful ill at ease have not perhaps thought very much about eleanor have appreciated influence have felt that close intimacy with in country house be pleasant to also beneficial have spoken highly of intelligence to archdeacon have walked about shrubbery with carrying boy on back when mr arabin have called johnny darling eleanor be not angry thus three men sat over wine thinking of same subject unable to speak of to other so will leave follow lady into drawing room mr grantly have received commission from husband have undertaken with unwillingness have desired to speak gravely to eleanor to tell that if persisted in adherence to mr slope must no longer look for countenance of present friend mr grantly probably knew sister better than doctor did assured that must be in vain to talk to only course likely to be of service in opinion be to keep eleanor away from barchester perhaps might have added for have very keen eye in such thing that there might be ground for hope in keeping eleanor near mr arabin of however said nothing archdeacon must not be talked over spoke much of conscience declared that if mr grantly must not do must so instigated lady undertook task stating however full conviction that interference must be worse than useless so proved a soon a be in drawing room mr grantly found excuse for sending girl away then began task knew well that must exercise very slight authority over sister various mode of life distance between residence have prevented very close confidence have hardly lived together since eleanor be child eleanor have moreover especially in latter year resented in quiet sort of way dictatorial authority archdeacon seemed to exercise over father on account have be unwilling to allow archdeacon wife to exercise authority over 'you got letter just before dinner believe ' began eldest sister eleanor acknowledged that have done so felt that turned red a acknowledged must have given anything to have kept colour more tried to do so more signally failed 'be not from mr slope ' eleanor said that letter be from mr slope 'be regular correspondent of yours eleanor ' 'not exactly said already beginning to feel angry at cross examination determined why must be difficult to say that nothing must induce to tell sister susan what be subject of letter mr grantly knew be instigated by archdeacon must not plead to arraignment made against by 'but eleanor dear why do get letter from mr slope at knowing a do be person so distasteful to papa to archdeacon indeed to friend 'in first place susan get letter from in next place a mr slope wrote one letter have got a only received must not very well help doing a papa handed to think have better ask mr slope instead of ' be letter about eleanor ' ' can not tell ' said 'because be confidential be on business respecting third person 'it be in way personal to yourself then ' wo exactly say that susan ' said getting more more angry at sister question must say be rather singular ' said mr grantly affecting to laugh 'that young lady in position must receive letter from unmarried gentleman of will not tell content be ashamed to show sister ' ' be not ashamed ' said eleanor blazing up ' be not ashamed of anything in matter only choose to be cross examined a to letter by one ' 'well dear ' said other can not tell that think that mr slope proper correspondent for ' 'if be ever so improper how can help having written to be prejudiced against to extent that must be kind generous in man be odious impudent in hate religion teach one to be so onesided to one charity ' be sorry eleanor that hate religion find here surely must remember that in such matter archdeacon must know more of world than do ask to respect comply with although be unfortunately so many year senior surely in such matter a might consent to be guided by archdeacon be most anxious to be friend if will let ' 'in such matter a what ' said eleanor very testily 'upon word know what be about 'we want to drop mr slope ' want to be illiberal a yourselves that will never be see harm in mr slope acquaintance will not insult man by telling do have thought necessary to write to want archdeacon advice about letter if did must ask ' 'then eleanor be duty to tell now spoke with tremendous gravity 'that archdeacon think that correspondence be disgraceful that can not allow to go on in house ' eleanor eye flashed fire a answered sister jumping up from seat a did so 'you may tell archdeacon wherever be will receive what letter please from whom please a for word disgraceful if dr grantly have used of have be unmanly inhospitable ' walked off to door papa come from dining room will thank to ask to step up to bed room will show mr slope letter will show to one else so saying retreated to baby have conception of crime with be charged idea that must be thought by friend to regard mr slope a lover have never flashed upon conceived that be prejudiced illiberal in persecution of therefore must not join in persecution even though greatly disliked man eleanor be very angry a seated in low chair by open window at foot of child bed 'to dare to say have disgraced ' repeated to herself more than once 'how papa can put up with man arrogance will certainly not sit down to dinner in house again unless begs pardon for word ' then thought struck that mr arabin might perchance hear of 'disgraceful ' correspondence with mr slope turned crimson with pure vexation oh if have known truth if must have conceived that mr arabin have be informed a fact that be going to marry slope have not be long in room before father joined a left drawing room mr grantly took husband into recess of window told how signally have failed ' will speak to before go to bed ' said archdeacon do such thing ' said 'you can do good will only make unseemly quarrel in house have idea how headstrong can be ' archdeacon declared that a to that be quite indifferent knew duty must do mr harding be weak in extreme in such matter must not have hereafter on conscience that have not done that in lay to prevent so disgraceful alliance be in vain that mr grantly assured that speaking to eleanor angrily must only hasten such crisis render certain if at present there be doubt be angry self willed sore fact that lady in household have received letter from mr slope have wounded pride in sorest place nothing must control mr harding looked worn woebegone a entered daughter room sorrow worried sadly felt that if be continued must go to wall in manner so kindly prophesied to by chaplain knocked gently at daughter door waited till be distinctly bade to enter then appeared a though not be suspected criminal eleanor arm be soon within have soon kissed forehead caressed not with joyous with eager love papa ' said ' do so want to speak to have be talking about downstairs to night know have papa ' mr harding confessed with sort of murmur that archdeacon have be speaking of will hate dr grantly soon ' dear ' will can not help be so uncharitable so unkind so suspicious of everyone doe not worship then be so monstrously arrogant to other people who have right to opinion a well a have to own 'he be earnest eager man dear never mean to be unkind 'he be unkind papa most unkind there got that letter from mr slope before dinner be who gave to there pray read be for must have be addressed to know how have be talking about downstairs know how behaved to at dinner since dinner susan have be preaching to till must not remain in room with read papa then say whether be letter need make dr grantly so outrageous ' mr harding took arm from daughter waist slowly read letter expected to see countenance lit up with joy a learnt that path back to hospital be made so smooth be doomed to disappointment a have once be case before on somewhat similar occasion first feeling be one of unmitigated disgust mr slope must have chosen to interfere in behalf have be anxious to get back to hospital must have infinitely sooner resigned pretension to place than have owned in manner to mr slope influence in favour then thoroughly disliked tone of mr slope letter be unctuous false unwholesome like man saw eleanor have failed to see that much more have be intended than be expressed appeal to eleanor pious labour a separate from own grated sadly against feeling a father then when came to 'darling boy ' beilken tress slowly closed folded letter in despair be impossible that mr slope must so write unless have be encouraged be impossible that eleanor must have received letter received without annoyance unless be willing to encourage so at least mr harding argued to how hard be to judge accurately of feeling of others mr harding a came to close letter in heart condemned daughter for indelicacy made miserable to do so be not responsible for what mr slope might write true then expressed disgust at have rather expressed approval of letter a whole have given to to read a vindication for herself also for father spirit sank within a felt that must not acquit yet be true feminine delicacy of eleanor mind brought on condemnation listen to lady beseech to acquit thought of man lover of whom be so unconscious exactly a father did exactly a grantlys did at least esteemed personally a did believed to be in main honest man one truly inclined to assist father felt bound after what have passed to show letter to mr harding thought necessary that must know what mr slope have to say did not think necessary to apologise for condemn even allude to vulgarity of man tone arose a doe vulgarity from ignorance be nauseous to to have such man like mr slope commenting on personal attraction did not think necessary to dilate with father upon what be nauseous never supposed must disagree on subject must have be painful for to point out painful to to speak strongly against man of whom on whole be anxious to think speak well in encountering such man have encountered what be disagreeable a might do in walking street in such encounter never thought necessary to dwell on disgusted mr harding slowly folded letter handed back to kissed forehead bade god bless then crept slowly away to own room a soon a have left passage knock be given at eleanor door mr grantly very demure own maid entering on tiptoe wanted to know must mr bold be so kind a to speak to archdeacon for two minute in archdeacon study if not disagreeable archdeacon compliment must detain two minute eleanor thought be very disagreeable be tired fagged sick at heart present feeling towards dr grantly be anything of affection be however coward therefore promised to be in study in five minute so arranged hair tied on cap went down with palpitating heart chapter xxix serious interview there be people who delight in serious interview especially when to appertain part of offering advice administering rebuke perhaps archdeacon be one of yet on occasion did not prepare for coming conversation with much anticipation of pleasure might be fault be not inhospitable man almost felt that be sinning against hospitality in upbraiding eleanor in own house then also be not quite sure that must get best of wife have told that decidedly must not usually gave credit to what wife said be however so convinced of what considered to be impropriety of eleanor conduct so assured also of own duty in trying to check that conscience must not allow to take wife advice go to bed quietly eleanor face a entered room be not much a to reassure a rule be always mild in manner gentle in conduct there be that in eye made not easy task to scold in truth have be little used to scolding one since childhood have tried archdeacon have generally failed when did try have never done so since marriage now when saw quiet easy step a entered room almost wished have taken wife advice began by apologising for trouble be giving begged not to mention assured that walking down stair be trouble to at then took seat waited patiently for to begin attack dear eleanor said ' hope believe when assure that have sincerer friend than be ' to eleanor answered nothing therefore proceeded 'if have brother of own must not probably trouble with what be going to say a be can not think that must be comfort to to know that have near one who be a anxious for welfare a brother of own must be ' never have brother ' said ' know never have be therefore speak to ' ' never have brother repeated 'but have hardly felt want papa have be to father brother ' 'your father be fondest most affectionate of men be fondest most affectionate of men best of counsellor while life can never want advice ' rather put archdeacon out must not exactly contradict what sister in law said about father yet did not at agree with wanted to understand that tendered assistance because father be soft good natured gentleman not sufficiently knowing in way of world must not say to so have to rush into subject matter of proffered counsel without acknowledgement on part that must need must be grateful for beusan tell that received letter evening from mr slope 'yes papa brought in brougham did not tell ' 'and susan say that objected to let know what be about ' think asked have done so must not have told think nice to be asked about one letter if one wish to show one doe so without being asked ' 'true quite so what say be quite true be not fact of receiving letter from mr slope wish to show to friend circumstance must excite surprise suspicion beuspicion ' said not speaking above usual voice speaking still in soft womanly tone yet with indignation beuspicion who suspect of what ' then there be pause for archdeacon be not quite ready to explain ground of suspicion dr grantly did not choose to show mr slope letter to susan must not show to one till papa have seen if have wish to read now can do so handed letter to over table be amount of compliance have not at expected rather upset in tactic however took letter perused carefully then refolding kept on table under hand to appeared to be in almost respect letter of declared lover seemed to corroborate worst suspicion fact of eleanor showing to be tantamount to declaration on part that be pleasure to receive love letter from mr slope almost entirely overlooked real subject matter of epistle so intent be on forthcoming courtship marriage `` ll thank to give back please dr grantly took hand held up made immediate overture to return mr harding have seen ' said 'of course have ' said 'it be written that might see refers solely to business of course showed to ' 'and eleanor do think that be proper letter for for person in condition to receive from mr slope ' proper letter ' said speaking perhaps little out of obstinacy probably forgetting at moment objectionable mention of silken curl 'then eleanor be duty to tell wholly differ from ' beo suppose ' said instigated now by sheer opposition determination not to succumb 'you think mr slope be messenger direct from satan think be industrious well meaning clergyman be pity that differ a do a do differ have probably better not talk about ' here undoubtedly eleanor put in wrong might probably have refused to talk to dr grantly on matter in dispute without impropriety having consented to listen to have business to tell regarded mr slope a emissary from evil one be justified in praising mr slope seeing that in heart of heart did not think well of be however wounded in spirit very angry bitter have be subjected to contumely cross questioning ill usage through whole evening one not even mr arabin not even father have be kind to attributed to prejudice conceit of archdeacon therefore resolved to set bound to antagonism to must neither give take quarter have greatly presumed in daring to question about correspondence be determined to show that thought so 'eleanor be forgetting ' said looking very sternly at 'otherwise must never tell that conceive man to be messenger from satan 'but do ' said 'nothing be too bad for give that letter if please ' stretched out hand took from have be doing best to serve papa doing more than of papa friend must do yet because be chaplain of bishop whom like speak of a though have right to usage of gentleman 'he have done nothing for father ' believe that have done great deal a far a be concerned be grateful to judge people by act a far a can see be good then paused for moment have nothing further to say will be obliged by being permitted to say good night be very tired ' dr grantly have a thought done best to be gracious to sister in law have endeavoured not to be harsh with have striven to pluck sting from rebuke did not intend that must leave without hearing ' have something to say eleanor fear must trouble to hear profess that be quite proper that must receive from mr slope such letter a that have in hand susan think very differently be of course own mistress much a must grieve must anything separate from have power to prevent from taking step may lead to separation if be so wilful a to reject counsel of friend must be allowed to cater for be worth while to break away from have loved from who love for sake of mr slope know what mean dr grantly know what be talking about want to break away from anybody ' will do so if connect with mr slope eleanor must speak out to must choose between sister friend mr slope friend say nothing of father a may probably understand feeling better than do 'what do mean dr grantly what be to understand never heard such wicked prejudice in life ' 'it be prejudice eleanor have known world longer than have done mr slope be altogether beneath ought to know feel that be so pray pray think of before be too late ' late if will not believe ask susan can not think be prejudiced against even consult father be not prejudiced against ask mr arabin 'you have spoken to mr arabin about ' said jumping up standing before 'eleanor world in about barchester will be speaking of soon ' 'but have spoken to mr arabin about mr slope ' 'certainly have quite agrees with ' 'agree with what ' said ' think be trying to drive mad ' agrees with susan that be quite impossible must be received at plumstead a mr slope ' not being favourite with tragic muse dare to attempt description of eleanor face when first heard name of mr slope pronounced a must must might at time appertain to herself look such a be dr grantly did not soon forget for moment two must find word to express deep anger deep disgust indeed at conjuncture word did not come to very freely dare be so impertinent ' at last said then hurried out of room without giving archdeacon opportunity of uttering word be with difficulty that contained till reached own room then locking door threw on bed sobbed a though heart must break even yet have conception of truth have idea that father sister have for day past conceived in sober earnest idea that be going to marry man did not even then believe that archdeacon thought that must do so by manoeuvre of brain attributed origin of accusation to mr arabin a did so anger against be excessive vexation of spirit almost unendurable must not bring to think charge be made seriously appeared to most probable that archdeacon mr arabin have talked over objectionable acquaintance with mr slope that mr arabin in jeering sarcastic way have suggested odious match a being severest way of treating with contumely acquaintance with enemy that archdeacon taking idea from thought proper to punish by allusion whole night lay awake thinking of what have be said appeared to be most probable solution reflection that mr arabin must have in way mentioned name in connection with of mr slope be overpowering spiteful ill nature of archdeacon in repeating charge to made wish to leave house almost before day have broken one thing be certain nothing must make stay there beyond following morning nothing must make sit down in company with dr grantly when thought of man whose name have be linked with own cried from sheer disgust be only because must be thus disgusted thus pained shocked cut to quick that archdeacon have spoken horrid word wanted to make quarrel with mr slope therefore have outraged by abominable vulgarity determined that at rate must know that appreciated be archdeacon bit better satisfied with result of serious interview than be gathered from a indeed must hardly fail to do be very angry with thought that be thus angry not because be suspected of intention to marry mr slope because such intention be imputed to a crime dr grantly regarded supposed union with disgust never occurred to that eleanor be outraged because looked at exactly in same light returned to wife vexed somewhat disconsolate nevertheless confirmed in wrath against sister in law whole behaviour ' said 'have be most objectionable handed love letter to read a though be proud of be proud of be proud of having slavering greedy man at foot will throw john bold money into lap will ruin boy disgrace father be wretched miserable woman spouse who be sitting at toilet table continued avocation making answer to have known that archdeacon must gain nothing be interfering be too charitable to provoke by saying so while be in such deep sorrow come of man making will a of bold ' continued 'eleanor be more fitted to be trusted with amount of money in own hand than be charity school girl ' still mr grantly made reply have done duty can hing further have told plainly that can not be allowed to form link of connection between man from henceforward will not be in power to make welcome at plumstead can not have mr slope love letter coming here think have better let understand that a mind on subject seems to be irrevocably fixed will be better for party that must return to barchester now mr grantly be angry with eleanor nearly a angry a husband have idea of turning sister out of house therefore at length spoke out explained to archdeacon in own mild seducing way that be fuming fussing fretting very unnecessarily declared that thing if left alone must arrange much better than must arrange at last succeeded in inducing to go to bed in somewhat le inhospitable state of mind on following morning eleanor maid be commissioned to send word into dining room that mistress be not well enough to attend prayer that must breakfast in own room here be visited by father declared to intention of returning immediately to barchester be hardly surprised by announcement household seemed to be aware that something have gone wrong one walked about with subdued foot people shoe seemed to creak more than usual there be look of conscious intelligence on face of woman men attempted in vain to converse a though nothing be matter have weighed heavily on heart of mr harding when eleanor told that immediate return to barchester be necessity merely sighed piteously said that must be ready to accompany here objected strenuously have great wish said to go alone great desire that might be seen that father be not implicated in quarrel with dr grantly to at last gave way not word passed between about mr slope not word be said not question asked a to serious interview on preceding evening there be indeed very little confidence between though of knew why must be so eleanor once asked whether must not call upon bishop answered rather tartly that did not know did not think must must not say just at present so parted be miserably anxious for show of affection for return of confidence for sign of feeling usually bound together none be given father must not bring to question daughter about supposed lover daughter must not sully mouth by repeating odious word with dr grantly have aroused wrath so parted there be trouble in arranging method of eleanor return begged father to send for postchaise when mr grantly heard of objected strongly if eleanor must go away in dudgeon with archdeacon why must let servant neighbourhood know that have done so so at last eleanor consented to make use of plumstead carriage a archdeacon have gone out immediately after breakfast be not to return till dinner time also consented to postpone journey till after lunch to join family at time a to subject of quarrel not word be said by one affair of carriage be arranged by mr harding who acted a mercury between two lady when met kissed other very lovingly then sat down to crochet work a though nothing be amiss in world chapter xxx love scene there be visitor at rectory whose feeling in unfortunate matter must be somewhat strictly analysed mr arabin have heard from friend of probability of eleanor marriage with mr slope with amazement not with incredulity have be said that be not in love with eleanor up to period certainly have be true a soon a heard that loved one else began to be very fond of did not make up mind that wished to have for wife have never thought of did not know how to think of in connection with experienced inward indefinable feeling of deep regret gnawing sorrow unconquerable depression of spirit also specie of self abasement that mr arabin have not done something to prevent that other that vile whom so thoroughly despised from carrying off sweet prize man may have reached age of forty unmarried without knowing something of such feeling must have be very successful else very cold hearted mr arabin have never thought of trimming sail of bark so that might sail a convoy to rich argosy have seen that mr bold be beautiful have not dreamt of making beauty own knew that mr bold be rich have more idea of appropriating wealth than of dr grantly have discovered that mr bold be intelligent warm hearted agreeable sensible in fact that man must wish wife to be higher be attraction greater claim to consideration le have imagined that might possible become possessor of such have be instinct rather than thought so humble so diffident now diffidence be to be rewarded by seeing woman whose beauty be to eye perfect whose wealth be such a to have deterred from thinking of whose widowhood must have silenced have not be so deterred by seeing become prey of obadiah slope on morning of mr bold departure got on horse to ride over to st ewold a rode kept muttering to line from van artevelde how little flattering be woman love then strove to recall mind to think of other affair parish college creed thought must revert to mr bold flemish chieftain when think upon how little flattering be woman love given commonly to whosoe'er be nearest propped with most advantage be not that mr bold must marry one have not put forward a suitor that must marry mr slope so repeated over over again outward grace inward light be needful day by day men wanting be mated with best loftiest of god feminine creation whose love take distinction of gender ridicule very name of choice so went on troubled much in mind have uneasy ride of that morning little good did do at st ewold necessary alteration in house be being fast completed walked through room went up down stair rambled through garden must not wake to much interest about stood still at window to look out think upon mr slope at almost window have before stood chatted with eleanor mr grantly have be there continually while mr grantly have be giving order seeing that order have be complied with eleanor have conversed on thing appertaining to clergyman profession thought how often have laid down law to how sweetly have borne with somewhat dictatorial decree remembered listening intelligence gentle quick reply interest in concerned church in concerned then struck riding whip against window sill declared to that be impossible that eleanor bold must marry mr slope yet did not really believe a must have done that be impossible must have known well enough to feel that be truly impossible must have be aware that eleanor have that within must surely protect from such degradation like so many others be deficient in confidence in woman said to over over again that be impossible that eleanor bold must become mr slope yet believed that must do so so rambled about must do think of nothing be thoroughly uncomfortable thoroughly ill at ease cross with body else feeding in heart on animosity towards mr slope be not a must be a knew felt must not help in truth mr arabin be now in love with mr bold though ignorant of fact be in love though forty year old be in love without being aware of fumed fretted did not know what be matter a youth might do at one twenty so having done good at st ewold rode back much earlier than be usual with instigated by inward unacknowledged hope that might see mr bold before left eleanor have not passed pleasant morning be irritated with one not least with felt that have be hardly used felt also that have not played own card well must have held so far above suspicion a to have received sister innuendo archdeacon lecture with indifference have not done have shown angry sore be now ashamed of own petulance yet unable to discontinue greater part of morning have spent alone after while father joined have fully made up mind that come what might nothing must separate from youngest daughter be hard task for to reconcile to idea of seeing at head of mr slope table got through mr slope a argued to be respectable man clergyman a eleanor father have right even to endeavour to prevent from marrying one longed to tell how have determined to prefer to world how be prepared to admit that be not wrong how thoroughly differed from dr grantly must not bring to mention mr slope name there be yet chance that be wrong in surmise being thus in doubt must not bring to speak openly to on subject be sitting with in drawing room with arm round waist saying now then little soft word of affection working hard with imaginary little fiddle bow when mr arabin entered room immediately got up two made trifle remark to other thinking of what be saying eleanor kept seat on sofa mute moody mr arabin be included in list of against whom anger be excited too have dared to talk about acquaintance with mr slope too have dared to blame for not making enemy of enemy have not intended to see before departure be now little inclined to be gracious there be feeling through whole house that something be wrong mr arabin when saw eleanor must not succeed in looking in speaking a though knew nothing of must not be cheerful positive contradictory with a be wont have not be two minute in room before felt that have done wrong in return moment heard voice thoroughly wished back at st ewold why indeed must have wished to have aught further to say to future wife of mr slope be sorry to hear that be too leave so soon ' said striving in vain to use ordinary voice in answer to muttered something about necessity of being in barchester betook industriously to crochet work then there be little more trite conversation between mr arabin mr harding trite hard vapid senseless neither of have anything to say to other yet at moment liked to remain silent at last mr harding taking advantage of pause escaped from room eleanor mr arabin be left together 'your going will be great break up to party ' said again muttered something be inaudible kept eye fixed upon work have have very pleasant month ' said 'at least have be sorry must be so soon over ' have already be from home longer than intended said 'and be time must return 'well pleasant hour pleasant day must come to end be pity so few of be pleasant perhaps rather be pity certainly that men woman do so much to destroy pleasantness of day said interrupting 'it be pity that there must be so little charity abroad 'charity must begin at home ' said be proceeding to explain that a clergyman must not be what must call charitable at expense of principle considered duty to teach when remembered that must be worse than vain to argue on matter with future wife of mr slope 'but be just leaving ' continued 'and will not weary last hour with lecture a be fear have given too many 'you must practise a well a preach mr arabin ' 'undoubtedly must so must of who presume to teach be bound to do utmost towards fulfilling own lesson thoroughly allow deficiency in doing so quite know now to what allude have special reason for telling now must practise a well a preach ' eleanor made answer longed to let know cause of anger to upbraid for speaking of disrespectfully then at last forgive so part friend felt that must be unhappy to leave in present frame of mind yet must hardly bring to speak to of mr slope how must allude to innuendo thrown out by archdeacon thrown out a believed at instigation of mr arabin wanted to make know that be wrong to make aware that have ill treated in order that sweetness of forgiveness might be enhanced felt that liked too well to be contented to part with in displeasure yet must not get over deep displeasure without explanation acknowledgement on part assurance that must never again so sin against 'why do tell must practise what preach ' continued 'all men must do so 'certainly be a be understood acknowledged say so to men to clergyman advice good a be be not given except in allusion to special deficiency if will tell special deficiency will endeavour to profit by advice paused for while then looking full in face said 'you be not bold enough mr arabin to speak out to openly plainly yet expect woman to speak openly to why did speak calumny of to dr grantly behind back ' 'calumny ' said whole face became suffused with blood calumny if have spoken calumny of will beg pardon to whom spoke god pardon also what calumny have spoken of to dr grantly also blushed deeply must not bring to ask whether have not spoken of a man wife 'you know best ' said 'but ask a man of honour if have not spoken of a must not have spoken of own sister rather will not ask ' continued finding that did not immediately answer ' will not put to necessity of answering such question dr grantly have told what said ' 'dr grantly certainly asked for advice gave asked ' ' know did mr arabin asked whether must be doing right to receive at plumstead if continued

confess mr arabin that from expected different sort of usage a spoke with difficulty restrained tear did restrain have given way sobbed about a in such case woman must do must have melted at once implored pardon perhaps knelt at foot declared love everything must have be explained eleanor must have gone back to barchester with contented mind how easily must have forgiven forgotten archdeacon suspicion have heard whole truth of from mr arabin then where must have be novel did not cry mr arabin did not melt 'you do injustice ' said bey advice be asked by dr grantly be obliged to give ' 'dr

seen so excited have never seen look so beautiful ' utterly deny ' said 'dr grantly have sort of jurisdiction over do forget be not altogether alone in world do forget have father dr grantly believe always have forgotten ' 'from mr arabin continued ' must have listened to advice because must have expected to have be given a one friend may advise not a schoolmaster give order to pupil might have differed from on matter must have done so have spoken to in usual manner with usual freedom must not have be angry now be manly of mr arabin to speak of in way so disrespectful so can not bring to repeat what said must understand what feel be just of to speak of in way to advise sister husband to turn out of sister house because chose to know man of whose doctrine disapprove ' have alternative left to mr bold said standing with back to fire place looking down intently at carpet pattern speaking with slow measured voice 'but to tell plainly what did take place between dr grantly 'well said finding that paused for moment be afraid that what may say may pain ' 'it can not well do so more than what have already done ' said 'dr grantly asked whether thought must be prudent for to receive in house a wife of mr slope told that thought must be imprudent believing to be utterly impossible that mr slope 'thank mr arabin be sufficient want to know reason said speaking with terribly calm voice

conclude be to marry rather conclude so rational man must really come to outrageous conclusion without better ground have not thought so a be in position in accusation must be peculiarly painful be made in order may be terrified into hostility against enemy of yours a finished speaking walked to drawing room window stepped out into garden mr arabin be left in room still occupied in counting pattern on carpet have however distinctly heard accurately marked word that have spoken be not clear from what have said that archdeacon have be wrong in imputing to attachment to mr slope be not clear that eleanor be still free to make choice may seem strange that must for moment have have doubt yet did doubt have not absolutely denied charge have not expressly said that be untrue mr arabin understood little of nature of woman feeling must have known how improbable be that must make clearer declaration than have done few men do understand nature of woman heart till year have robbed such understanding of value be well that must be so men must triumph too easily mr arabin stood counting carpet unhappy wretchedly unhappy at hard word have be spoken to yet happy exquisitely happy a thought that after woman whom so regarded be not to become wife of man whom so much disliked a stood there began to be aware that be in love forty year have passed over head a yet woman beauty have never given uneasy hour present hour be very uneasy not that remained there for half quarter of time in spite of what eleanor have said mr arabin be in truth manly man having ascertained that loved woman having now reason to believe that be free to receive love at least if pleased to do so followed into garden to make such wooing a must be not long in finding be walking to fro beneath avenue of elm stood in archdeacon ground skirting churchyard what have passed between mr arabin have not ala tended to lessen acerbity of spirit be very angry more angry with than with one how must have so misunderstood have be so intimate with have allowed such latitude in what have chosen to say to have complied with idea cherished view fostered precept cared for comfort made much of in way in pretty woman can make much of unmarried man without committing feeling have be doing while have be doing have regarded a affianced wife of man a passed along avenue now then unbidden tear must force on cheek a raised hand to brush away stamped with little foot upon sward with very spite to think that have be so treated mr arabin be very near to when first saw that turned short round retraced step down avenue trying to rid cheek of trace of tell tale tear be needle endeavour for mr arabin be in state of mind hardly allowed to observe such trifle followed down walk overtook just a reached end of have not considered how must address have not thought what must say have only felt that be wretchedness to to quarrel with that must be happiness to be allowed to love that must not lower by asking for pardon have done no wrong have not calumniated not injured a have accused of doing must not confess sin of have not be guilty must only let past be past ask a to hope for future hope be not to part a enemy said 'there will be enmity on part ' said eleanor ' endeavour to avoid enmity must be hollow pretence be to say that there can be true friendship between after what have just past people can not make friend of whom despise ' 'and be despised ' must have be so before must have spoken of a did be deceived cruelly deceived believed that thought well of believed that esteemed ' 'thought of well esteemed ' said 'in justifying before must use stronger word than paused for moment eleanor heart beat with painful violence within bosom a waited for to go on have esteemed do esteem a never esteemed woman think well of never thought to think so well so much of human creature speak calumny of insult wilfully injure wish be privilege to shield from calumny insult injury calumny ah 'twere almost better that be so better than to worship with sinful worship sinful vain also then walked along beside with hand clasped behind back looking down on grass beneath foot utterly at loss to express meaning eleanor walked beside determined at least to give assistance ' uttered at last speaking rather to than to 'ah plumstead walk be pleasant enough if one must have heart ease without that dull

very pleasant party a long a have remained in good humour with one mr grantly have felt house to be gayer brighter than have be for many long day archdeacon have be aware that month have passed

by necessity of conversing with sister maintaining appearance of parting with on good term when carriage reached own door while be in act of giving last kiss to sister niece mary bold ran out exclaimed 'oh eleanor have heard oh mr grantly have heard what have happened poor dean 'good heaven said mr grantly 'what what have happened ' 'this morning at nine have fit of apoplexy have not

unconscious dying man from whom sense have fled must have heard in distant chamber spring of lock be now so carefully handled 'indeed indeed be so bad ' said meagre little prebendary turning over in

into close archdeacon went down to confirm news have heard before by pm train sir omicron pie did arrive in course of night sort of consciousness returned to poor old dean whether be due to sir omicron pie be question on may be well not to offer opinion dr fillgrave be very clear in own mind sir omicron be thought to have differed from learned doctor at rate sir omicron expressed opinion that dean have day to live for eight ten next day accordingly poor dean remained in same state half conscious half comatose attendant clergy began to think that new appointment must be necessary for few month to come chapter xxxii new candidate for ecclesiastical dean illness occasioned much mental turmoil in other place besides deanery adjoining library idea occurred to meagre little prebendary about mr slope did not occur to alone bishop be sitting listlessly in study when news reached of dean illness be brought to by mr slope who of course be not last person in barchester to hear be also not slow in finding way to mr proudie ear may be presumed that there be not just much friendly intercourse between two rival claimant for lordship obedience indeed though living in same house have not met since stormy interview between in bishop study on preceding day on occasion mr proudie have be defeated that from standard be subject of great sorrow to militant lady though defeated be not overcome felt that might yet recover lost ground that might yet hurl mr slope down to dust from have picked force sinning lord to sue for pardon in sackcloth ash on memorable day memorable for mutiny rebellion against high behest have carried way with high hand have really begun to think possible that day of slavery be counted have begun to hope that be now about to enter into free land land delicious with milk might quaff honey must not tantalise by being only honey to eye when mr proudie banged door a left room felt inch bishop to be sure spirit have be little cowed by chaplain subsequent lecture on whole be highly pleased with flattered that worst be over 'ce n'est que le premier pa qui coute ' reflected now that first step have be so magnanimously taken rest must follow easily met wife a matter of course at dinner where little nothing be said that must ruffle bishop happiness daughter servant be present protected made one two trifling remark on subject of projected visit to archbishop in order to show to concerned that intended to have own way very servant perceiving change transferred little of reverence from mistress to master master perceived so also did mistress mr proudie bided time after dinner returned to study where mr slope soon found there have tea together planned many thing for few minute bishop be really happy a clock on chimney piece warned that stilly hour of night be drawing on a looked at chamber candlestick knew that must use heart sank within again be a ghost whose power of wandering free through upper region cease at cock crow rather be opposite of ghost for till cock crow must again be serf must be must trust to come down to breakfast free man in morning be nearly hour later than usual when betook to rest rest what rest however took couple of glass of sherry mounted stair far be from to follow thither there be thing novelist historian must attempt few scene in life drama even poet must dare to paint let that passed between dr proudie wife on night be understood to be among came down following morning sad thoughtful man be attenuated in appearance one might almost say emaciated doubt whether now grizzled look have not palpably become more grey than on preceding evening at rate have aged materially year make man old gradually at even pace look through world see if be not so always except in rare case in human being life dy without joy without sorrow like vegetable man will be possessed of florid youthful blooming health till matter not what age thirty forty fifty then come nipping frost period of agony robs fibre of body of succulence hale hearty man be counted among old came down breakfasted alone mr proudie being indisposed took coffee in bed room daughter waited upon there ate breakfast alone then hardly knowing what did betook to usual seat in study tried to solace with coming visit to archbishop that effort of own free will at rate remained to a enduring triumph somehow now that have achieved did not seem to care so much about be ambition have prompted to take place at arch episcopal table ambition be now quite dead within be thus seated when mr slope made appearance with breathless impatience bey lord dean be dead ' heaven exclaimed bishop startled out of apathy by announcement so sad so sudden 'he be dead now dying have have apoplectic fit be told that there be not slightest hope indeed doubt that by time be more bell be rung servant be immediately sent to inquire in course of morning bishop leaning on chaplain arm called at deanery door mr proudie sent to miss trefoil manner of offer of assistance miss proudies sent also there be immense sympathy between palace deanery answer to inquiry be unvaried dean be just same sir omicron pie be expected there by pm train then mr slope began to meditate a others also have done a to who might possibly be new dean occurred to a have also occurred to others that might be possible that must be new dean then question a to twelve hundred fifteen hundred two thousand ran in mind a have run through of other clergyman in cathedral library whether might be two thousand of fifteen twelve hundred must in case undoubtedly be great thing for if must get gratification to ambition must be greater even than of covetousness how glorious to out top archdeacon in own cathedral city to sit above prebendary canon have cathedral pulpit cathedral service altogether at own disposal might be easier to wish for than to obtain slope however be not without mean of forwarding view at rate did not let grass grow under foot in first place thought not vainly that must count upon what assistance bishop must give immediately changed view with regard to patron made up mind that if became dean must hand lordship back to wife vassalage thought possible that lordship might not be sorry to rid of one of mentor mr slope have also taken step towards making name known to other men in power there be certain chief commissioner of national school who at present moment be presumed to stand especially high in good grace of government big wig with mr slope have contrived to establish sort of epistolary intimacy thought that might safely apply to sir nicholas fitzhiggin felt sure that if sir nicholas chose to exert promise of piece of preferment must be have for asking for then also have press at bidding flattered that have so daily jupiter have taken part in very thorough manner in polemical contest of with mr arabin have on more than one occasion absolutely have interview with gentleman on staff of paper who if not editor be a good a editor have long be in habit of writing telling letter with initial sent to editorial friend with private note signed in own name indeed mr tower such be name of powerful gentleman of press with whom be connected be generally very amiable with other mr slope little production be always printed occasionally commented upon thus in small sort of way have become literary celebrity public life have great charm for though certainly also have drawback on one occasion when speaking in presence of reporter have failed to uphold praise swear by special line of conduct have be upheld praised sworn by in jupiter then have be much surprised at moment not little irritated to find lacerated most unmercifully by old ally be quizzed bespattered made fool of just a though rather than if have be constant enemy instead of constant friend have hitherto not learnt that man who aspires to be on staff of jupiter must surrender individuality ultimately little castigation have broken no bone between friend mr tower mr slope be one of who understood world too well to show angry with potentate a jupiter have kissed rod scourged now thought that might fairly look for reward determined that must at once let mr tower know that be candidate for place be about to be become vacant more than one place of preferment have lately be given away much in accordance with advice tendered to government in column of jupiter be in incumbent on mr slope first to secure bishop specially felt that behoved to do before visit to archbishop be made be really quite providential that dean must have fallen ill just at very nick of time if dr proudie must be instigated to take matter up warmly might manage good deal while staying at archbishop palace feeling very strongly mr slope determined to sound bishop out that very afternoon be to start on following morning to london therefore not moment must be lost with safety went into bishop study about five o'clock found still sitting alone might have be supposed that have hardly moved since little excitement occasioned by walk to dean door still wore on face that dull dead look of half unconscious suffering be doing nothing reading nothing thinking of nothing simply gazing on vacancy when mr slope for second time day entered room 'well slope ' said somewhat impatiently for to tell truth be not anxious just at present to have much conversation with mr slope 'your lordship will be sorry to hear that a yet poor dean have shown sign of amendment ' ah have poor man be sure be very sorry suppose sir omicron have not arrived yet ' 'no not till pm train ' wonder did have special say dr trefoil be very rich ' rich believe said mr slope 'but truth be doctor in london can do good other good than to show that possible care have be taken poor dr trefoil be not long for world lord ' ' suppose not suppose not ' 'oh indeed best friend must not wish that must outlive shock for intellect can not possibly survive ' 'poor man poor man ' said bishop will naturally be matter of much moment to lordship who be to succeed ' said mr slope must be great thing if must secure appointment for person of own way of thinking on important point party hostile to be very strong here in barchester much too strong ' yes if poor dr trefoil be to go will be great thing to get good man in place ' 'it will be everything to lordship to get man on whose co operation can reckon only think what trouble might have if dr grantly dr hyandry of way of thinking be to get ' 'it be not very probable that lord will give to of school why must ' 'no not probable certainly not be possible great interest will probably be made if might venture to advise lordship must suggest that must discus matter with grace next week have doubt that wish if made known backed by grace must be paramount with lord ' know that lord have always be very kind to very kind be unwilling to interfere in such matter unless asked indeed if asked know whom at moment must recommend mr slope even mr slope felt at present rather abashed hardly knew how to frame little request in language sufficiently modest have recognised acknowledged to necessity of shocking bishop in first instance by temerity of application difficulty be how best to remedy that by adroitness eloquence ' doubted ' said 'whether lordship must have one immediately in eye be on account venture to submit to idea have be turning over in own mind if poor dr trefoil must go really see why with lordship assistance must not hold preferment ' 'you exclaimed bishop in manner mr slope must hardly have considered complimentary ice be now broken mr slope became fluent enough have be thinking of looking for if lordship will press matter on archbishop doubt that will succeed see will count upon assistance from public press name be known may say somewhat favourably known to portion of press be now most influential with government have friend also in government be from hand must most willingly receive benefit must ever be chief consideration in such matter must know better than other person whatsoever what qualification posse ' bishop sat for while dumfounded mr slope dean of barchester idea of such transformation of character must never have occurred to own unaided intellect at first went on thinking why for what reason on what account mr slope must be dean of barchester by degree direction of thought changed began to think why for what reason on what account mr slope must not be dean of barchester a far a bishop be concerned must well spare service of chaplain little idea of using mr slope a counterpoise to wife have well nigh evaporated have acknowledged futility of scheme if indeed must have slept in chaplain bed room instead of wife there might have be something in thus a mr slope a speaking bishop began to recognise idea that gentleman might become dean of barchester without impropriety not moved indeed by mr slope eloquence for did not follow tenor of speech led thereto by own cogitation need not say ' continued mr slope 'that must be chief desire to act in matter connected with cathedral a far a possible in accordance with view know lordship so well hope know well enough to have same feeling that be satisfied that being in position must add materially to own comfort enable to extend sphere of useful influence a said before be not desirable that there must be one opinion among dignitary in same diocese doubt much whether must accept such appointment in diocese in must be constrained to differ much from bishop in case there must be delightful uniformity of opinion mr slope perfectly well perceived that bishop did not follow word that said nevertheless went on talking knew be necessary that dr proudie must recover from surprise knew also that must give opportunity of appearing to have be persuaded by argument so went on produced multitude of fitting reason tending to show that one on earth must make so good dean of barchester a that government public must assuredly coincide in desiring that mr slope must be dean of barchester that for high consideration of ecclesiastical polity must be especially desirable that piece of preferment must be so bestowed through instrumentality of bishop of diocese really know what must do in matter said bishop must mention to archbishop if must tell grace that consider appointment very desirable that have much at heart with view of putting end to schism in diocese if did with usual energy must probably find difficulty in inducing grace to promise that must mention to lord of course must let archbishop know that be not looking for preferment solely through intervention that exactly require to ask a favour that expect will get through other source a be indeed case that be very anxious that grace must express approval of such arrangement to lord ' ended by bishop promising to do a be told not that so promised without stipulation 'about hospital ' said in middle of conference ' be never so troubled in life ' be about truth have spoken to mr harding since saw ' mr slope assured patron that have not 'ah well then think upon whole will be better to let quiverful have have be half promised to have large family be very poor think on whole will be better to make out nomination for mr quiverful ' lord ' said mr slope still thinking be bound to make fight for own view on matter remembering that still behoved to maintain lately acquired supremacy over mr proudie lest must fail in view regarding deanery lord be really much afraid bemember mr slope ' can hold out not sort of hope to in matter of succeeding poor dr trefoil will certainly speak to archbishop a wish can not think ' lord ' said mr slope fully understanding bishop in turn interrupting 'perhaps lordship be right about mr quiverful have doubt can easily arrange matter with mr harding will make out nomination for signature a direct ' slope think will be best may be sure that little can do to forward view will be done so parted mr slope have now much business to handle have to make daily visit to signora common prudence must have now induced to omit be infatuated must not bring to be commonly prudent determined therefore that must drink tea at stanhope determined also thought that determined that having done so must go thither no more have also to arrange matter with mr bold be of opinion that eleanor must grace deanery a perfectly a must chaplain cottage thought moreover that eleanor fortune must excellently repair dilapidation curtailment in dean stipend might have be made by ruthless ecclesiastical commission touching mr bold hope now soared high mr slope be one of numerous multitude of swain who think that be fair in love have accordingly not refrained from using service of mr bold own maid from have learnt much of what have taken place at plumstead not exactly with truth for 'own maid ' have not be able to divine exact truth with sort of similitude to have be told that archdeacon mr grantly mr harding mr arabin have quarrelled with beissus for having received letter from mr slope that beissus have positively refused to give letter up that have received from archdeacon option of giving up mr slope letter society of plumstead rectory that beissus have declared with much indignation that behe did care straw for society of plumstead rectory that must give up mr slope for of considering source from whence came be not quite so untrue a might have be expected showed pretty plainly what have be nature of conversation in servant hall coupled a be with certainty of eleanor sudden return appeared to mr slope to be so far worthy of credit a to justify in thinking that fair widow must in human probability accept offer work have therefore to be done be desirable thought that must make offer before be known that mr quiverful be finally appointed to hospital in letter to eleanor have plainly declared that mr harding be to have appointment must be very difficult to explain away be to write letter to eleanor telling truth throwing blame on bishop must naturally injure in estimation determined therefore to let that matter disclose a must to lose time in throwing at foot then have to solicit assistance of sir nicholas fitzwhiggin mr tower went directly from bishop presence to compose letter to gentleman a mr slope be esteemed a adept at letter writing will be given in full 'palace barchester sept 'private bey dear sir nicholas hope that intercourse have be between will preclude from regarding present application a intrusion can not imagine have yet heard that poor dear old dr trefoil have be seized with apoplexy be subject of profound grief to one in barchester for have always be excellent man excellent a man a clergyman be however full of year life must not under circumstance have be much longer spared may probably have known 'there be appears probable chance of recovery sir omicron pie be believe at present with at rate medical men here have declared that one two day more must limit tether of mortal coil sincerely trust that soul may wing flight to haven where may for ever be at rest for ever be happy 'the bishop have be speaking to about preferment be anxious that must be conferred on confess can hardly venture at age to look for such advancement be so far encouraged by lordship that believe will be induced to do so lordship go to london tomorrow be intent on mentioning subject to archbishop know well how deservedly great be weight with present government in matter touching church preferment must of course be listened to now that matter have be put into head be of course anxious to be successful if can assist by good word will confer on one additional favour have better add that lord can not a yet know of piece of preferment having fallen in rather of certainty of falling for poor dear dr trefoil be past hope must lord first hear from might probably bee thought to give fair claim to express opinion course grand object be that must be of one opinion in church matter be most desirable at barchester be make good bishop so anxious about may probably think expedient to point out to lord if will be in power to oblige by mentioning subject to lordship dear sir nicholas 'your most faithful servant obadiah slope ' letter to mr tower be written in quite different strain mr slope conceived that completely understood difference in character position of two men whom addressed knew that for man a sir nicholas fitzwhiggin little flummery be necessary that might be of easy everyday description accordingly letter to sir nicholas be written currente calamo with very little trouble to man a mr tower be not so easy to write letter must be effective yet not offensive must carry point without undue interference be not difficult to flatter dr proudie sir nicholas fitzwhiggin very difficult to flatter mr tower without letting flattery declare however have to be done moreover letter must in appearance at least be written without effort be fluent unconstrained demonstrative of doubt fear on part of writer therefor epistle to mr tower be studied recopied elaborated at cost of so many minute that mr slope have hardly time to dress reach dr stanhope that evening when dispatched ran a follows sept purposely omitted allusion to 'palace thinking that mr tower might not like great man

there a mr slope have not be included in invitation to palace signora whose impudence never deserted asked permission of miss thorne to bring permission miss thorne gave having other alternative did so with trembling heart fearing mr arabin must be offended immediately on return apologised almost with tear so dire enmity be presumed to rage between two gentleman mr arabin comforted by assurance that must meet mr slope with greatest pleasure imaginable made promise that must introduce to other triumph of mr slope be not so agreeable to eleanor who since return to barchester have done best to avoid must not give way to plumstead folk when so ungenerously accused of being in love with odious man nevertheless knowing that be so accused be fully alive to expediency of keeping out of way dropping by degree have seen very little of since return servant have be instructed to say to visitor that be out must not bring to specify mr slope particularly in order to order to avoid have thus debarred from friend have excepted charlotte stanhope by degree few others also once have met at stanhope a rule mr slope visit there have be made in morning hers in evening on one occasion charlotte have managed to preserve from annoyance be very good natured on part of charlotte a eleanor thought also very sharp witted a eleanor have told friend nothing of reason for wishing to avoid gentleman fact however be that charlotte have learnt from sister that mr slope must probably put forward a suitor for widow hand be consequently sufficiently alive to expediency of guarding bertie future wife from danger in quarter nevertheless stanhope be pledged to take mr slope with to ullathorne arrangement be therefore necessarily made be very disagreeable to eleanor dr stanhope with charlotte mr slope be to go together bertie be to follow with sister madeline be clearly visible to eleanor face that assortment be very disagreeable to charlotte who be much encouraged thereby in own little plan made thousand apology see like dear ' said 'but must not manage otherwise bertie must give eye to go with madeline can not possibly go without must possibly put mr slope madeline in same carriage without anyone else 'd be ruined for ever know not admitted inside ullathorne gate must imagine after such impropriety 'of course must do ' said eleanor 'but must go in carriage with signora brother ' 'impossible said charlotte 'when be there there be only room for two ' signora in truth did not care to do travelling in presence of stranger then ' said eleanor 'you be so kind charlotte so good to that be sure wo be offended think will not go at ' go at what nonsense indeed will ' have be absolutely determined in family council that bertie must propose on very occasion can take fly ' said eleanor 'you know that be not embarrassed by so many difficulty a young lady can go alone 'nonsense dear think of thing after be only for hour so to tell truth know what be dislike so thought mr slope be great friend what be dislike ' 'oh nothing particular said eleanor 'only thought must be family party ' 'of course must be much nicer much more snug if bertie must go with be be badly treated can assure be much more afraid of mr slope than be see madeline can not go without poor creature go out so seldom be sure begrudge though vagary doe knock about own party little ' of course eleanor made thousand protestation uttered thousand hope that madeline must enjoy of course have to give way undertake to go in carriage with mr slope in fact be driven either to so to explain why must not do so now must not bring to explain to charlotte stanhope have passed at plumstead be to sore necessity thought of thousand little scheme for avoiding must plead illness not go at must persuade mary bold to go although not asked then make necessity of having carriage of own to take sister in law anything in fact must do rather than be seen in same carriage with mr slope however when momentous morning came have scheme matured then mr slope handed into dr stanhope carriage following step sat opposite to bishop returned on eve of ullathorne party be received at home with radiant smile by partner of care on arrival crept up to dressing room with somewhat of palpitating heart have overstayed allotted time by three day be not without fear of penalty nothing however must be more affectionately cordial than greeting received girl came out kissed in manner be quite soothing to spirit mr proudie arm almost in word called dear darling good pet little bishop be very pleasant surprise mr proudie have somewhat changed tactic not that have seen cause to disapprove of former line of conduct have now brought matter to such point that calculated that might safely do so have got better of mr slope now thought well to show husband that when allowed to get better of everybody when obeyed by permitted to rule over others must take care that must have reward mr slope have not chance against not only must stun poor bishop by midnight anger must assuage soothe if so willed by daily indulgence must furnish room for turn out a smart bishop a on bench give good dinner warm fire easy life must do if must be quietly obedient if not to speak sooth however suffering on dreadful night have be a poignant a to leave little spirit for further rebellion a soon a have dressed returned to room ' hope enjoyed at ' said seating on one side of fire while remained in arm chair on other stroking calf of leg be first time have have fire in room since summer pleased for good bishop loved to be warm cosy nothing must be more polite than archbishop mr archbishop have be equally charming mr proudie be delighted to hear nothing declared pleased so much a to think bairn respectit like lave did not put precisely in word what said came to same thing then having petted fondled little man sufficiently proceeded to business 'the poor dean be still alive ' said beo hear so hear ' said bishop `` ll go to deanery directly after breakfast to morrow 'we be going to party at ullathorne to morrow morning dear must be there early know by twelve o'clock suppose ' ah ' said bishop will certainly call next day much said about at ' asked mr proudie 'about what ' said bishop 'filling up dean place ' said mr proudie a spoke spark of wonted fire returned to eye bishop felt to be little le comfortable than before 'filling up dean place be if dean dy very little dear be mentioned just mentioned ' what did say about bishop ' 'why said that thought that if be must must dean die be said thought a went on stammering floundering saw that wife eye be fixed sternly on why must encounter such evil for man whom loved so slightly a mr slope why must give up enjoyment ease such dignity a might be allowed to to fight losing battle for chaplain chaplain after if successful must be a great tyrant a wife why fight at why contend why be uneasy from moment determined to fling mr slope to wind take good god provided be told ' said mr proudie speaking very slowly 'that mr slope be looking to be new dean 'yes certainly believe be ' said bishop doe archbishop say about ' asked mr proudie dear to tell truth promised mr slope to speak to archbishop mr slope spoke to about be very arrogant of must say be nothing to ' 'arrogant said mr proudie 'it be most impudent piece of pretension ever heard in life mr

attempt a mr slope dean of barchester indeed tossed head put arm kimbo with air of confident defiance that made husband quite sure that mr slope never must be dean of barchester in truth mr proudie be invincible have married petruchio may be doubted whether arch wife tamer must have be able to keep leg out of garment be presumed by men to be peculiarly unfitted for feminine use 'it be preposterous dear ' why have endeavoured to assist ' dear have assisted much ' why have done at why have mixed name up in thing so ridiculous what be did say to archbishop did just mention just did say that in event of poor dean death mr slope must must ' 'must what ' forget how put must take if must get something of sort did say much more than ' 'you must have said anything at did archbishop say 'he did say anything just bowed rubbed hand somebody else came up at moment a be discussing new parochial universal school committee matter of new dean dropped after did think be wise to renew ' benew be very sorry ever mentioned will archbishop think of ' 'you may be sure dear that archbishop thought very little about ' 'but why did think about bishop how must think of making such creature a dean of

considered to be in politics pure whig family belonged to whig party now among rank of englishman englishwoman mr proudie must think be ranked among former on score of great strength of mind one be so hostile to lowly born pretender to high station a pure whig bishop thought necessary to exculpate dear ' said 'it appeared to that mr slope did not get on quite a well a used to do ' 'get on ' said mr proudie moving foot uneasily on hearth rug compressing lip in manner betokened such danger to subject of discourse ' began to find that be objectionable to ' mr proudie foot worked on hearth rug with great rapidity 'and that must be more comfortable if be out of palace mr proudie smiled a hyena may probably smile before begin laugh 'and therefore thought that if got place so ceased to be chaplain might be pleased at such arrangement then hyena laughed loud pleased at such arrangement pleased at having enemy converted into dean with twelve hundred year medea when describes custom of native country be quoting from robson edition assures astonished auditor that in land captive when taken be eaten 'you pardon ' say medea 'we do indeed ' say mild grecian eat ' say of colchis with terrible energy mr proudie be medea of barchester have idea of not eating mr slope pardon merely get rid of make dean of be not so did with captive in country among people of sort mr slope have such mercy to expect must pick to very last bone yes dear of course will cease to be chaplain ' said 'after what have passed that must be matter of course must for moment think of living in same house with man besides have shown quite unfit for such situation making broil quarrel among clergy getting dear into scrape taking upon a though be a good a bishop of course will go because leaf palace be reason why must get into deanery 'oh of course not said bishop to save appearance know dear want to save appearance want mr slope to appear just what be false designing mean intriguing man have eye on little know what see be misconducting in most disgraceful way with lame italian woman that family be disgrace to barchester mr slope be disgrace to barchester if doe look well to will have gown stripped off back instead of having dean hat on head dean indeed man have gone mad with arrogance bishop said nothing further to excuse chaplain having shown passive docile be again taken into favour soon went to dinner spent pleasantest evening have have in own house for long time daughter played sang to a sipped coffee read newspaper mr proudie asked good natured little question about archbishop then went happily to bed slept a quietly a though mr proudie have be griselda while shaving in morning preparing for festivity of ullathorne fully resolved to run no more tilt against warrior so fully armed at

for own conduct doubt circumstanced a be with small living fellowship accustomed a have be to collegiate luxury expensive comfort might have hesitated to marry penniless woman have felt ever so strong

feeling of love for why must have done so need have done so with purest of men be that a may mr arabin decided against decided that have done so in case that be not purest of men also decided be more to purpose that eleanor did not care straw for very probably did not care straw for rival then made up mind not to think of more went on thinking of till be almost in state to drown in little brook be at bottom of archdeacon ground ever again mind must revert to signora neroni must make comparison between eleanor bold not always in favour of latter signora have listened to flattered believed in at

ashamed of determined to lose time in retrieving character so damaged in own eye thus when appeared at dinner be a animated a ever be author of most of conversation graced archdeacon board on evening mr harding be ill at ease sick at heart did not care to appear more comfortable than really be what little did say be said to daughter thought archdeacon mr arabin have leagued together against eleanor comfort wish now be to break away from pair undergo in barchester lodging fate have in store for hated name of hospital attempt to regain lost inheritance there have brought upon so much suffering a far a be concerned mr quiverful be now welcome to place archdeacon be not very lively poor dean illness be of course discussed in first place dr grantly did not mention mr slope name in connexion with expected event of dr trefoil death did not wish to say anything about mr slope just at present did wish to make known own sad surmise idea that enemy might possibly become dean of barchester made very gloomy must such even take place dire catastrophe come about there must be end to life a far a life be connected with city of barchester must give up old haunt old habit live quietly a retired rector at plumstead have be severe trial for to have dr proudie in palace with mr slope also in deanery felt that must be unable to draw breath in barchester close thus came to pas that in spite of sorrow at heart mr arabin be apparently gayest of party mr harding mr grantly be in slight degree angry with on account of want of gloom to one appeared a though be triumphing at eleanor banishment to other that be not affected a must have be by sad circumstance of day eleanor obstinacy mr slope success poor dean apoplexy so be at cross purpose mr harding left room almost together with lady archdeacon opened heart to mr arabin still harped upon hospital did that fellow mean ' said 'by saying in letter to mr bold that if mr harding must call on bishop must be right of course must not be guided by anything might say still may be well that mr harding must see bishop must be foolish to let thing slip through finger because mr bold be determined to make fool of herself ' mr arabin hinted that be not quite so sure that mr bold must make fool of herself said that be not convinced that did regard mr slope so warmly a be supposed to do archdeacon questioned cross questioned about elicited nothing at least remained firm in own conviction that be destined malgre lui to be brother in law of mr slope mr arabin strongly advised that mr harding must take step regarding hospital in connexion with in consequence of mr slope letter 'if bishop really mean to confer appointment on mr harding ' argued mr arabin 'he will take care to let have other intimation than message conveyed through letter to lady be mr harding to present at palace might merely be playing mr slope game ' thus be settled that nothing must be done till great dr gwynne arrival at rate

house income in question be very desirable certainly very just that mr harding must have at present be not main point be expedient to beat bishop if possible to smash mr slope mr slope have set up be

induced to refuse bishop offer that provision must be cut off when mr quiverful got hospital that eleanor be strong town doomed to be taken that mr slope a dean of barchester must be regarded by world

sombre enough mr grantly have be right in saying that priestess must be wanting at st ewold have sat there alone with glass before then with teapot thinking about eleanor bold a be usual in such meditation did little blame blame for liking mr slope blame for not liking blame for cordiality to blame for want of cordiality blame for being stubborn headstrong passionate yet more thought of higher rose in affection if only must turn out if only must be made to turn out that have defended mr slope not from love on principle must be right such principle in must be admirable loveable womanly felt that must be pleased to allow mr slope just so much favour a if then mr arabin poked fire most unnecessarily spoke crossly to new parlour maid who came in for tea thing threw back in chair determined to go to sleep why have be so stiff necked when asked plain question must not have known in what light regarded why have not answered plain question so put end to misery then instead of going to sleep in arm chair mr arabin walked about room a though have be possessed on following morning when attended miss thorne behest be still in somewhat confused state first duty have be to converse with mr clantantram that lady have found impossible to elicit slightest sympathy from on subject of hr roquelaure miss thorne have asked whether mr bold be coming with grantlys two name of bold grantly together have nearly made jump from seat be in state of confused uncertainty hope doubt when saw mr slope with most polished smile handing eleanor out of carriage thought of nothing more never considered whether carriage belonged to to mr slope to one else to whom might be mutually obliged without concert between sight in present state of mind be quite enough to upset resolve be clear a noonday have seen handed into carriage by mr slope at church door with white veil over head truth must not be more manifest went into house a have seen soon found walking with mr harding shortly afterwards eleanor came up then have to leave companion go about alone find while in state be encountered by archdeacon wonder ' said dr grantly 'if be true that mr slope mr bold come here together

not spare sister in law mr arabin therefore left a soon a must wandered back into house be impossible to say how knowledge have be acquired signora have sort of instinctive knowledge that mr arabin be admirer of mr bold men hunt fox by aid of dog be aware that do so by strong organ of smell with dog be endowed however in least comprehend how such sense can work with such acuteness organ by woman instinctively a be know feel how other woman be regarded by men how also men be regarded by other woman be equally strong equally incomprehensible glance word motion suffices by such acute exercise of feminine sens signora be aware that mr arabin loved eleanor bold therefore by further exercise of peculiar feminine propensity be quite natural for to entrap mr arabin into net work be half done before came to ullathorne when must have better opportunity of completing have have almost enough of mr slope though must not quite resist fun of driving very sanctimonious clergyman to madness by desperate ruinous passion mr thorne have fallen too easily to give much pleasure in chase position a man of wealth might make alliance of value a lover be very second rate may say that regarded somewhat a sportsman doe pheasant bird be so easily shot that must not be worth shooting be not for very respectable appearance that make in larder signora must not waste much time in shooting mr thorne still be worth bagging for family us mr arabin be game of sort signora be possessed of quite sufficient intelligence to know mr arabin be man more than usually intellectual knew also that a clergyman be of much higher stamp than mr slope that a gentleman be better educated than mr thorne must never have attempted to drive mr arabin into ridiculous misery a did mr slope must think possible to dispose of in ten minute a have done with mr thorne such be reflection about mr arabin a to mr arabin can not be said that reflected at about signora knew that be beautiful felt that be able to charm required charming in present misery therefore went stood at head of couch knew about such be peculiar gift be nature to see that required charming be province to charm a easter idler swallow dose of opium a london reprobate swallow dose of gin so with similar desire for similar reason did mr arabin prepare to swallow charm of signora neroni 'why be shooting with bow arrow mr arabin ' said when be nearly alone together in sitting room 'or talking with young lady in shady bower turning talent to account in way what be bachelor like asked here for mean to earn cold chicken champagne be must be ashamed to be so idle ' mr arabin murmured sort of answer though wished to be charmed a hardly yet in mood to be playful in return what ail mr arabin said 'here be in own parish

love respect of few friend will be too proud to own that value ' 'rich reward said 'but of little worth if be to be so treated ' 'oh be not to look for such success a awaits mr slope be born to be successful man suggests to object then start for with eager intention nothing will deter from pursuit will have scruple fear hesitation desire be to be bishop with rising family wife will come first

on greatest mistake man ever made be to suppose that good thing of world be not worth winning be mistake so opposed to religion preach why doe god permit bishop one after other to have five thousand ten thousand year if such wealth be bad not worth having why be beautiful thing given to luxury pleasant enjoyment if be not intended to be used must be meant for one what be good for layman can not surely be bad for clerk try to despise good thing only try succeed ' said mr arabin still musing not knowing what said ' ask question do succeed ' mr arabin looked at piteously seemed to a though be being interrogated by inner spirit of own to whom must not refuse answer to whom did not dare to give false reply mr arabin confess do succeed be money so contemptible be worldly power so worthless be feminine beauty trifle to be so slightly regarded by wise man ' 'feminine beauty ' said gazing into face a though feminine beauty in world be concentrated there 'why do say regard ' 'if look at like

taken when reached tent found bishop standing there in conversation with master of lazarus lordship have come out to air afer exertion of speech 'this be very pleasant very pleasant lord be not ' said mr slope with most gracious smile pointing to tent pleasant be delightful to see so many person enjoying so thoroughly ' mr slope thought might force bishop to introduce to dr gwynne very great

mr slope circle of acquaintance among clerical brother have own reason for dropping marked allusion to domestic chaplain therefore made shoulder rather cold for occasion very ' said without turning round even deigning to look at mr slope therefore dr gwynne really think that will find that hebdomadal board will exercise a wide a general authority a at present moment for one dr gwynne ' gwynne ' said mr slope raising hat resolving not to be outwitted by such insignificant little goose a bishop of barchester master of lazarus also raised hat bowed very politely to mr slope there be not more courteous gentleman in queen dominion than master of lazarus lord ' said mr slope 'pray do honour of introducing to dr gwynne opportunity be too much in favour to be lost ' bishop have help for bey chaplain dr gwynne ' said bey present chaplain mr slope ' certainly made introduction a unsatisfactory to chaplain a possible by use of word present seemed to indicate mr slope might probably not long

need future dean of barchester care for bishop for bishop wife have not mr slope just a be entering dr stanhope carriage received important note from tom tower of jupiter have not that note moment in pocket so disregarding bishop began to open out conversation with master of lazarus suddenly interruption came not altogether unwelcome to mr slope one of bishop servant came up to master shoulder with long grave face whispered into bishop ear 'what be john ' said bishop dean lord be dead ' mr slope have further desire to converse with master of lazarus be very soon on road back to barchester eleanor a have said having declared intention of never holding further communication with mr slope ran hurriedly back towards house thought however of what have done grieved greatly must not abstain from bursting into tear 't be thus played second act in day melodrama chapter xli mr bold confides sorrow to friend miss stanhope when mr bold came to end of walk faced lawn began to bethink what must do be to wait there till mr slope caught be to go in among crowd with tear in eye passion in face might in truth have stood there long enough without reasonable fear of further immediate persecution from mr slope be inclined to magnify bugbear frighten in present state of dread did not know of what atrocity might venture to be guilty have one told week ago that must have put arm around waist at party of miss thorne must have be utterly incredulous have be informed that must be seen on following sunday walking down high street in scarlet coat top boot must not have thought phenomenon more improbable improbable iniquity have committed now there be nothing must not believe of in first place be quite manifest that be tipsy in next place be to be taken a proved that religion be sheer hypocrisy finally man be utterly shameless therefore stood watching for sound of footfall not without fear that might creep out at suddenly from among bush a thus stood saw charlotte stanhope at little distance from walking quickly across grass eleanor handkerchief be in hand putting to face so a to conceal tear ran across lawn joined friend charlotte ' said almost too much out of breath to speak very plainly ' be so glad have found ' 'glad have found ' said charlotte laughing be good joke why bertie have be looking for everywhere swears that have gone off with mr slope be now on point of hanging ' 'oh charlotte ' said mr bold child what on earth be matter with ' said miss stanhope perceiving that eleanor hand trembled on own arm finding also that companion be still half choked with tear heaven something have distressed what be what can do for ' eleanor answered only by sort of spasmodic gurgle in throat be good deal upset a people say must not at moment collect 'come here way mr bold come way will not be seen have happened to vex so what can do for can bertie do anything ' said eleanor 'there be nothing to be done only that horrid man 'what horrid man asked charlotte there be moment in life in men woman feel called on to make confidence in not to do so requires disagreeable resolution also disagreeable suspicion there be people of sex who never make confidence who be never tempted by momentary circumstance to disclose secret such be generally dull close unimpassioned spirit gnome who live in cold dark mine there be nothing of gnome about eleanor therefore resolved to tell charlotte stanhope whole story about mr slope 'that horrid man that mr slope ' said 'did not see that followed out of dining room ' 'of course did be sorry enough must not help knew must be annoyed bertie managed badly between ' 'it be not fault mine know how dislike idea of coming in carriage with man ' ' be sure be very sorry if have led to ' ' know have led to ' said eleanor almost cry again 'but have not be fault ' what have done dear ' be abominable horrid hypocritical man must serve right to tell bishop about ' if want to do injury have far better tell mr proudie what did do mr bold ' 'ugh exclaimed eleanor 'well must confess be not very nice ' said charlotte stanhope 'nice said eleanor 'he be most fulsome fawning abominable man ever saw what business have to come to that never gave slightest tittle of encouragement always hated though did take part when others ran down ' 'that be just where be dear have heard that therefore fancied that of course be in love with ' be wormwood to eleanor be in fact very thing friend have be saying for last month past experience now proved to be true eleanor resolved within that must never again take man part world with villainy ill nature might wag a like must not again attempt to set crooked thing straight 'but what did do dear ' said charlotte who be really rather interested in subject 'he ' 'well come ca have be anything so very horrid for man be not tipsy ' be sure be ' said eleanor ' be sure must have be tipsy 'well declare did observe what be love ' believe can hardly tell talked such horrid stuff that never heard like about religion heaven love oh dear be such nasty man can really imagine sort of stuff must talk well then ' 'and then took hold of 'took hold of ' 'yes somehow got close to took hold of ' 'by waist 'yes said eleanor shuddering 'and then 'then jumped away from gave slap on face ran away along path till saw ' 'have have have ' charlotte stanhope laughed heartily at finale of tragedy be delightful to to think that mr slope have have ear boxed did not quite appreciate feeling made friend so unhappy at result of interview to thinking matter have ended happily enough a regarded widow who indeed be entitled to sort of triumph among friend whereas mr slope must be due jibe jeer must naturally follow such affair friend must ask whether ear tingled whenever saw widow must be cautioned that beautiful thing be made to be looked at not to be touched such be charlotte stanhope view on such matter did not at present moment clearly explain to mr bold object be to endear to friend therefore having have laugh be ready enough to offer sympathy must bertie do anything must bertie speak to man warn that in future must behave with more decorum bertie indeed declared must be more angry than one else when heard to what insult mr bold have be subjected 'but wo tell ' said mr bold with look of horror if like ' said charlotte 'but considering everything must strongly advise if have brother know must be unnecessary be very right that mr slope must know that have somebody by will can protect ' father be here ' 'yes be so disagreeable for clergyman to have to quarrel with other circumstanced a father be just at moment must be very inexpedient that there must be anything unpleasant between mr slope surely bertie be intimate enough for to permit to take part ' charlotte stanhope be very anxious that brother must at once on very day settle matter with future wife thing have now come to point between father between creditor that must either do so leave barchester do go back to unwashed associate dirty lodging poor living at carrara unless must provide with income must go to carrara to father prebendary have not said in so many word have done so must not have signified more plainly such being state of case be very necessary that more time must be lost charlotte have seen brother apathy when neglected to follow mr bold out of room with anger must hardly suppress be grievous to think that mr slope must have so distanced charlotte felt that have played part with sufficient skill have brought together induced degree of intimacy that brother be really relieved from trouble labour in matter moreover be quite plain that mr bold be very fond of bertie now be plain enough also that have nothing to fear from rival mr slope there be certainly awkwardness in subjecting mr bold to second offer on same day must have be well perhaps to have put matter off for week must week have be spared circumstance be frequently too peremptory to be arranged a must wish to arrange such be case now being so must not affair of mr slope be turned to advantage must not be made excuse for bringing bertie mr bold into still closer connection into such close connection

eleanor be too much confused to see anything 'oh madeline ' said charlotte ' want to speak to particularly must arrange about carriage know ' stooped down to whisper to sister mr arabin immediately withdrew to little distance a charlotte have in fact much to explain before must make new arrangement intelligible have nothing to do to talk to mr bold 'we have have very pleasant party ' said using

citizen formed in eye better depot for supremacy than throne at windsor cabinet in downing street even assembly at westminster on subject must not quarrel with mr slope for feeling be too general to be met with disrespect tom tower be a good if not better than promise on following morning jupiter spouting forth public opinion with sixty thousand loud clarion did proclaim to world mr slope be fittest man for vacant post be pleasant for mr slope to read following line in barchester news room did within thirty minute after morning train from london have reached city be just now five year since called attention of reader to quiet city of barchester from day to have in way meddled with affair of happy ecclesiastical community since then old bishop have died there young bishop have be installed believe did not do more than give customary record of interesting event be about to meddle very deeply in affair of diocese if of chapter feel qualm of conscience on reading let be quieted above let mind of new bishop be at rest be now not armed for war approach revered tower of old cathedral with olive branch in hand will be remembered that at time alluded to now five year past have occasion to remark on state of charity at barchester called hiram hospital thought that be maladministered that very estimable reverend gentleman who held office of warden be somewhat too highly paid for duty be somewhat too easily performed gentleman say in sincerity with touch of sarcasm have never looked on matter in light before wish to take praise to ourselves whether praise be due not consequence of remark be that warden did look into matter finding on doing so that must come to other opinion than expressed by very creditably threw up appointment then bishop then a creditably declined to fill vacancy till affair be put on better footing parliament then took up have now satisfaction of informing reader that hiram hospital will be immediately re opened under new auspex heretofore provision be made for maintenance of twelve old men will now be extended to fair sex twelve elderly woman if such can be found in barchester will be added to establishment there will be matron there will be hoped be school attached for poorest of child of poor there will be steward warden for there will still be warden will receive income more in keeping with extent of charity than heretofore paid stipend believe will be l may add that excellent house former warden inhabited will still be attached to situation hospital can not perhaps boast world wide reputation a advertised to state of decadence think right also to advert to renaissance may go up prosper whether salutary reform have be introduced within wall have be carried a far a must have be desired may be doubtful important question of school appears to be somewhat left to discretion of new warden might have be made most important part of establishment new warden whom trust will not offend by freedom of remark might have be selected with view to fitness a schoolmaster will not now look gift horse in mouth may hospital go on prosper situation of warden have of course be offered to gentleman who so honourable vacated five year since be given to understand that have declined whether lady who have be introduced be in estimation too much for power of control whether be that diminished income doe not offer to sufficient temptation to resume old place that have in meantime assumed other clerical duty know be however informed that have refused offer that situation have be accepted by mr vicar of puddingdale much think be due to hiram redivivus while be on subject of barchester will venture with respectful humility to express opinion on matter connected with ecclesiastical polity of ancient city dr

to be guilty will not bear heavily on may rest in peace though great age of expiring dean can not be made matter of reproach be not inclined to look on fault a at pardonable in dean just brought to

to pay for sort of work work be what may will be best performed by workman in prime of life dr trefoil see be eighty when died a have a yet completed plan for positioning superannuated clergyman wish to get rid of existing dean of age prefer having a few such a possible if man of seventy be now appointed beg to point out to lord that will be past use in year two if indeed be not so at present

selected be man of talent young active conversant with affair of cathedral be moreover conscientiously believe truly pious clergyman know that service in city of barchester have be highly appreciated

tear ran down over child face 'who have be cruel to eleanor ' said mary ' hope have not ' now in matter eleanor have great cause for uneasiness must not certainly accuse loving sister in law of cruelty have to do be more galling have to accuse herself of imprudence against sister in law have warned miss bold have never encouraged eleanor acquaintance with mr slope have positively discouraged friendship of stanhope a far a usual gentle mode of speaking have permitted eleanor have only laughed at however when said that disapproved of married woman who lived apart from husband suggested that charlotte stanhope never went to church now however eleanor must either hold tongue be quite impossible confess to have be utterly wrong be nearly equally so so staved off evil day by more tear consoled by inducing little johnny to rouse sufficiently to return caress 'he be darling a true a gold what must mamma do without mamma must lie down die if have not own johnny bold to give comfort '

never looked down on mr harding on account of great poverty did fully recognise satisfaction of having belonging to in comfortable position must be much more suitable that mr harding must be dean of barchester than vicar of st cuthbert precentor to boot then great discomfiture of arch enemy of be respectable in barchester of new low church clerical parvenu have fallen amongst that alone must be worth more almost than situation be frightful to think that such unhoped for good fortune must be marred by absurd crotchet unwholesome hallucination by mr harding allowed to be led astray to have cup so near lip then to lose drinking of be more than dr grantly must endure yet appears a though must have to endure in vain threatened in vain coaxed mr harding did not indeed speak with perfect decision of refusing proffered glory must not speak with anything like decision of accepting when pressed again again must again again allege that be wholly unfitted to new duty be in vain that archdeacon tried to insinuate though must not plainly declare that there be new duty to perform be in vain hinted that in case of difficulty archdeacon be willing able to guide weak minded dean mr harding seemed to have foolish idea not only that there be new duty to do that one must accept place who be not prepared to do conference ended in understanding mr harding must at once acknowledge

arrived at chemist door in high street barely knew way to turn in matter perplexed a be be doomed to further perplexity found note there from daughter begging to most urgently to come to immediately must again go back little in story miss thorne have not be slow to hear rumour respecting mr arabin have so much disturbed happiness of mr grantly also be unhappy to think that parish clergyman must be accused of worshipping strange goddess also be of opinion that rector vicar must be married with good natured energy be characteristic of put wit to work to find fitting match for mr arabin mr grantly in difficulty must think of better remedy than lecture from archdeacon miss thorne thought that young lady marriageable with dowry might be of more efficacy in looking through catalogue of unmarried friend who might possibly be in want of husband might also be fit for such promotion a country parsonage affords must think of one more eligible than mr bold consequently losing time went into barchester on day of mr slope discomfiture same day that brother have have interesting interview with last of nero invited mr bold to bring nurse baby to ullathorne make protracted visit miss thorne suggested month two intending to use influence afterwards in prolonging so a to last out winter in order that mr arabin might have opportunity of becoming fairly intimate with intended bride 'we will have mr arabin too said miss thorne to herself 'and before spring will know other in twelve eighteen month time if go well mr bold will be domiciled at st ewold then kind hearted lady gave not undeserved praise for matching genius eleanor be taken little by surprise matter ended in promising to go to ullathorne for at rate week two on day previous to on father drove out to plumstead have have herself driven out to ullathorne miss thorne must not perplex with embryo lord on same evening thinking that must allow few hour to make herself at home on following morning mr arabin arrived 'and now said miss thorne to herself ' must contrive to throw in other way ' same day after dinner eleanor with assumed air of dignity must no maintain with tear that must not suppress with flutter must not conquer joy must not hide told miss thorne that be engaged to marry mr arabin that behoved to get back home to barchester a quick a must to say simply miss thorne be rejoiced at success of schemed must give very faint idea of feeling on occasion reader may probably have dreamt before now that have have before terrible long walk to accomplish journey of twenty thirty mile amount of labour frightful to anticipate immediately on starting have ingeniously found accommodating short cut have brought without fatigue to work end in five minute miss thorne waking feeling be somewhat of same nature reader may perhaps have have to do with child may on occasion have promised to young charge great gratification intended to come off perhaps at end of winter at beginning of summer impatient juvenile however will not wait clamorously demand treat before go to bed miss thorne have sort of feeling that inexperienced gunner who have ill calculated length of train that have laid gunpowder exploded much too soon poor miss thorne felt that be blown up by strength of own petard miss thorne have have lover of own have be gentleman of old fashioned deliberate habit miss thorne heart also have not always be hard though be still virgin spinster have never yielded in way at first assault have intended to bring together middle aged studious clergyman discreet matron who might possibly be induced to marry again in doing have thrown fire among tinder well be all a must be did feel perhaps little put out by precipitancy of own success perhaps little vexed at readiness of mr bold to be wooed said however nothing about to one ascribed to altered manner of new age mother grandmother be perhaps little more deliberate be admitted on side thing be conducted very differently now that in former time for aught miss thorne knew of matter couple of hour might be quite sufficient under new regime to complete that for in ignorance have allotted twelve month must not pas over wooing so cavalierly have be told with perhaps tedious accuracy how eleanor disposed of two of lover at ullathorne must also be told with equal accuracy if possible with le tedium how encountered arabin can not be denied that when eleanor accepted miss thorne invitation remembered that ullathorne be in parish of st ewold since interview with signora have done little else than think about mr arabin appeal have be made to must not bring to believe try to bring to believe that what have be told be untrue think of how must must not accept a fact that mr arabin be fond of then when went further asked question must not accept a fact also that be fond of if be destined for to be partner of hope sorrow to whom must look for friendship so properly a to miss thorne invitation be like ordained step towards fulfilment of destiny when also heard that mr arabin be expected to be at ullathorne on following day seemed a though world be conspiring in favour well did not deserve in affair of mr slope have not world conspired against must not however make easy at home when in evening after dinner miss thorne expatiated on excellence of mr arabin quality hinted that little rumour might be ill naturedly spread abroad concerning really meant nothing mr bold found unable to answer when miss thorne went little further declared that did not know prettier vicarage house in country than st ewold mr bold remembering projected bow window projected priestess still held tongue though ear tingled with conviction that world must know that be in love with mr arabin well what must matter if must only meet tell other what now longed to tell did meet mr arabin came early in day found two lady together at work in drawing room miss thorne who have known truth must have vanished into air at once have conception that immediate absence must be blessing remained chatting with till luncheon time mr arabin must talk about nothing signora neroni beauty must discus people stanhope be very distressing to eleanor not very satisfactory to miss thorne yet there be evidence of innocence in open avowal of admiration then have lunch then mr arabin went out on parish duty eleanor miss thorne be left to take walk together think signora neroni be so lovely a people say ' eleanor asked a be coming home behe be very beautiful certainly very beautiful ' miss thorne answered 'but know that one considers lovely be woman men must like to look at few imagine must be glad to take to hearth even be unmarried not afflicted a be ' there be comfort in eleanor made most of till got back to house be then left alone in drawing room just a be getting dark mr arabin came in be beautiful afternoon in beginning of october eleanor be sitting in window to get advantage of last daylight for novel there be fire in comfortable room weather be not cold enough to make attractive a must see sun set from where sat be not very attentive to book mr arabin when entered stood awhile with back to fire in usual way merely uttering few commonplace remark about beauty of weather while plucked up courage for more interesting converse can not probably be said that have resolved then there to make offer to eleanor men believe seldom make such resolve mr slope mr stanhope have done so be true gentleman generally propose without absolutely defined determination a to doing so such be now case with mr arabin 'it be lovely sunset ' said eleanor answering on dreadfully trite subject have chosen mr arabin must not see sunset from hearth rug a have to go close to havery lovely said standing modestly so far away from s to avoid touching flounce of dress then appeared that have nothing further to say so after gazing for moment in silence at brightness of setting sun returned to fire eleanor found that be quite impossible for to commence conversation in first place must find nothing to say word be generally plenty enough with must not come to relief moreover do what must must hardly prevent from cry 'do like ullathorne said mr arabin speaking from safely distant position have assumed on hearth rug 'yes indeed very much ' mean mr miss thorne know like style of house there be something about old fashioned mansion built a be old fashioned garden that to be especially delightful ' like everything old fashioned said eleanor 'old fashioned thing be so much honestest ' know about ' said mr arabin gently laughing 'that be opinion on very much may be said on side be strange how widely world be divided on subject so nearly concern be so close beneath eye think that be quickly progressing towards perfection while others imagine that virtue be disappearing from earth 'and mr arabin what do think ' said eleanor felt somewhat surprised at tone conversation be taking yet be quite relieved at saying something enabled to speak without showing emotion do think mr bold then rumbled money with hand in trouser pocket looked spoke very little like thriving lover 'it be bane of life that on important subject acquire fixed opinion think think go on thinking yet thought be running over in different direction hardly know whether do lead more confidently than father did on high hope to profess to aspire ' ' think world grows more worldly day said eleanor 'that be because see more of than when be younger must hardly judge by what see see so very very little ' there be then pause for while during mr arabin continued to turn over shilling half crown 'if believe in scripture can hardly think that mankind in general will now be allowed to retrograde ' eleanor whose mind be certainly engaged otherwise than on general state of mankind made answer to felt thoroughly dissatisfied with must not force thought away from topic on signora have spoken to in so strange way yet knew that must not converse with mr arabin in unrestrained natural tone till did so be most anxious not to show to special emotion yet felt that if looked at must at once see that be not at ease did not look at instead of doing so left fire place began walking up down room eleanor took up book resolutely must not read for there be tear in eye do what must fell on cheek when mr arabin back be turned to wiped away be soon coming down face in place must come not deluge of tear must have betrayed at once one by one single monitor mr arabin did not observe closely passed unseen mr arabin thus passing up down room took four of five turn before spoke word eleanor sat equally silent with face bent over book be afraid that tear must get better of be preparing for escape from room when mr arabin in walk stood opposite to did not come close up stood exactly on spot to course brought then with hand under coat tail thus made confession bold ' said ' owe retribution for great offence of have be guilty towards ' be heart beat so that must not trust herself to say that have never be guilty of offence so mr arabin then went on ' have thought much of since be now aware that be wholly unwarranted in putting to question once asked be indelicate on part perhaps unmanly intimacy may exist between connection dr grantly must justify must acquaintance existed between ourselves word acquaintance struck cold on eleanor heart be to doom after therefore think right to beg pardon in humble spirit now do so ' what be eleanor to say to must not say much because be cry yet must say something be most anxious to say that something graciously kindly yet not in such manner a to betray have never felt so much at loss for word 'indeed took offence mr arabin ' did have not done so must not have be be a right to be offended a be wrong to so offend have not forgiven hope to hear that forgive ' be now past speaking calmly though still continued to hide tear mr arabin after pausing moment in vain for reply be walking off towards door felt that must not allow to go unanswered without grievously sinning against charity so rising from seat gently touched arm said 'oh mr arabin go till speak to do forgive know that forgive ' took hand have so gently touched arm then gazed into face a if must peruse there a though written in book whole future destiny of life a did so there be sober seriousness in own countenance eleanor found unable to sustain must only look down upon carpet let tear trickle a must leave hand within be for minute that stood so duration of minute be sufficient to make ever memorable to eleanor be sure now that be loved word be eloquence what might must be more impressive than eager melancholy gaze why did look into eye why did not speak to must be that looked for to make first sign though knew little of woman even knew that be loved have only to ask must be own inexpressible loveliness ever speaking yet now mute eye feminine brightness eager loving spirit have so attracted since first have encountered at st ewold might must all be own now on other supposition be possible that must allow hand to remain thus clasped within own have only to ask ah be difficulty did minute suffice for nay perhaps might be more than minute bold ' at last said then stopped if must not speak how be to do so have called by name same name that merest stranger must have used withdrew hand from moved a though to return to seat 'eleanor ' then said in softest tone a though courage be still afraid of giving offence by freedom took looked slowly gently almost piteously up into face there be at rate anger there to deter 'eleanor ' again exclaimed in moment have clasped to bosom how be done whether doing be with whether have flown thither conquered by tenderness of voice with violence not likely to give offence have drawn to breast neither of knew can declare there be now that sympathy between hardly admitted of individual motion be one same one flesh one spirit one life own eleanor own wife ' ventured to look at through tear bowing face down over hers pressed lip upon brow virgin lip since beard first grew upon chin have never yet tasted luxury of woman cheek have be told that yea must be yea nay nay be called on for one other told miss thorne that be engaged to mr arabin such word have passed between promise have be asked given 'oh let go ' said 'let go now be too happy to remain let go may be alone did not try to hinder did not repeat kiss did not press on lip might have done so have be so minded be now own took arm from round waist arm be trembling with new delight let go fled like roe to own chamber then having turned bolt enjoyed full luxury of love idolised almost worshipped man who have so meekly begged pardon be now own oh how wept cried laughed a hope fear misery of last few week passed in remembrance through mind mr slope that one must have dared to think that who have be chosen by must possibly have mated with mr slope that must have dared to tell also subject bright happiness to needle risk then smiled with joy a thought of comfort that must give not that cared for comfort that must be so delicious for to give got up rang for maid that might tell little boy of new father in own way did tell desired maid to leave in order that might be alone with child there while lay sprawling on bed poured forth praise so unmeaning to of man have selected to guard infancy must not be happy however till have made mr arabin take child to thus a be adopt a own moment idea struck took baby in arm opening door ran quickly down to drawing room at once found by step still pacing on floor that be there glance within room told that be alone hesitated moment then hurried in with precious charge mr arabin met in middle of room 'there said breathless with haste 'there take take love ' mr arabin took little fellow from kissing again again prayed god to bless 'he will be all a own a own said eleanor a stooped to take back child kissed hand held then rushed back with treasure to chamber be then that mr harding younger daughter be won for second time at dinner mr arabin be very bright silence occasioned remark in drawing room a have before said told miss thorne what have occurred next morning returned to barchester mr arabin went over with budget of news to archdeacon a dr grantly be not there must only satisfy by telling mr grantly how that intended honour of becoming brother in law in ecstasy of joy at hearing such tidings mr grantly vouchsafed warmer welcome than have yet received from eleanor 'good heaven exclaimed be general exclamation of rectory eleanor dear eleanor what monstrous injustice have be done well will all be made up now then thought of signora lie people tell ' said to herself people in matter have told no lie at chapter xlix beelzebub colt when miss thorne left dining room eleanor have formed intention of revealing to what have occurred when be seated beside hostess on sofa secret dropped from almost unawares eleanor be bad hypocrite found quite unable to continue talking about mr arabin a though be stranger while heart be full of when miss thorne pursuing own scheme with discreet zeal asked young widow whether in opinion must not be good thing for mr arabin to get married have nothing for to confess truth suppose must ' said eleanor rather sheepishly whereupon miss thorne amplified on idea miss thorne ' said eleanor 'he be going to be married be engaged to ' now miss thorne knew very well that there have be no such engagement when have be walking with mr bold in morning have also heard enough to be tolerably sure that there have be no preliminary to engagement be therefore a have before described taken little by surprise nevertheless embraced guest cordially congratulated eleanor have opportunity of speaking word to mr arabin that evening except such word a world might hear a may be supposed be few enough miss thorne did best to leave in privacy mr thorne who knew nothing of what have occurred guest friend of entirely interfered with good intention so poor eleanor have to go to bed without one sign of affection state nevertheless be not to be pitied next morning be up early be probable thought that by going down little before usual hour of breakfast might find mr arabin alone in dining room might not be that must calculate that interview must thus be possible thus thinking eleanor be dressed full hour before time fixed at ullathorne household for morning prayer did not at once go down be afraid to seem to be too anxious to meet lover though heaven know anxiety be intense enough therefore sat down at window repeatedly looking at watch nursed child till thought might venture forth when found at dining room door stood moment hesitating to turn handle when heard mr thorne voice inside hesitated no longer object be defeated might now go in a soon a liked without slightest imputation on delicacy mr thorne mr arabin be standing on hearth rug discussing merit of beelzebub colt rather mr thorne be discussing mr arabin be listening that interesting animal have rubbed stump of tail against wall of stable occasioned much uneasiness to ullathorne master of horse have eleanor waited minute mr thorne must have be in stable mr thorne when saw lady guest repressed anxiety beelzebub colt must do without so three stood saying little nothing to other till at last master of house finding that must no longer bear present state of suspense respecting favourite young steed made elaborate apology to mr bold escaped a shut door behind eleanor almost wished that have remained be not that be afraid of mr arabin hardly yet knew how to address however soon relieved from embarrassment came up to taking bother hand in said beo eleanor be to be man wife be so ' looked up into face lip formed into single syllable uttered sound must read affirmative plainly in face 'it be great trust ' said ' very great trust 'it be be ' said eleanor not exactly taking what have said in sense that have meant 'it be very great trust will do utmost to deserve ' 'and also will do utmost to deserve ' said mr arabin very solemnly then winding arm round waist stood there gazing at fire with head leaning in shoulder stood by well satisfied with position of spoke found want of speaking be needful for to say have be said yea yea have be spoken by eleanor in own way way have be perfectly satisfactory to mr arabin now remained to to enjoy assurance of other love how great luxury be how far surpasses other pleasure god have allowed to creature to woman heart how doubly delightful when ivy have found tower when delicate creeper have found strong wall know how parasite plant grow prosper be not created to stretch branch alone

without ivy high garden wall without jasmine give beauty fragrance hedge without honeysuckle be hedge there be s feeling still half existing now half conquered by force of human nature that woman must be ashamed of love till husband right to compels to acknowledge must fain preach different doctrine woman must glory in love on account let take more care that be such a to justify glory eleanor did glory in hers felt have cause to feel that deserved to be held a glorious must have stood there for hour with arm around have fate mr thorne permitted moment crept nearer to bosom felt more more certain that there be home what now to be archdeacon arrogance sister coldness dear father weakness what need care for duplicity of such friend a charlotte stanhope have found strong shield must guard from wrong trusty pilot must henceforward guide through shoal rock must give up heavy burden of independence once more assume position of woman duty of trusting loving wife too stood there fully satisfied with place be looking intently on fire a though must read there future fate till at last eleanor turned face towards 'how sad be ' said smiling indeed face be if not sad at least serious sad be love ' bead said looking down at 'no certainly not sad ' sweet loving eye be turned towards smiled softly a answered temptation be too strong even for demure propriety of mr arabin bending over pressed lip to hers immediately after mr thorne appeared be delighted to hear that tail of beelzebub colt be not materially injured have be mr harding intention to hurry over to ullathorne a soon a possible after return to barchester in order to secure support of daughter in meditated revolt against archdeacon a touching deanery be spared additional journey by hearing that mr bold have returned unexpectedly home a soon a have read note started off found waiting for in own house how much of have to tell other how certain be that story have to tell must astonish other dear be so anxious to see

what be ' ' be going ' led to sofa seating beside with hand in 'you be going to be married nelly be not that ' 'yes said faintly 'that be if will approve then blushed a remembered promise have so lately volunteered to have so utterly forgotten in making engagement with mr arabin mr harding thought for moment who man must be whom be to be called upon to welcome a son in law week since must have have doubt whom to name in case must have be prepared to give sanction although must have done so with heavy heart now knew that at rate must not be mr slope though be perfectly at loss to guess who must possibly have filled place for moment thought that man might be bertie stanhope very soul sank within 'well nelly papa promise that for sake will love ' 'come nelly come tell who be ' 'but will love papa ' 'dearest must love one love ' then turned face to whispered into ear name of mr arabin man that must have named must have more surprised more delighted have looked round world for son in law to taste must have selected one whom must have preferred to mr arabin be clergyman held living in neighbourhood be of set to mr harding own partiality most closely adhered be great friend of dr grantly be moreover man of whom mr harding knew nothing what approved nevertheless surprise be so great a to prevent immediate expression of joy have never thought of mr arabin in connection with daughter have never imagined that have feeling in common have feared that daughter have be made hostile to clergyman of mr arabin stamp by intolerance of archdeacon pretension have be put to wish might have wished for mr arabin for son in law have be put to guess name must never have occurred to ber arabin ' exclaimed 'impossible ' papa for heaven sake say anything against if do love say anything against oh papa be done must be undone oh papa fickle eleanor where be promise that must make choice for herself without father approval have chosen now demanded acquiescence papa be good be

be son own son will be a close to heart a be nelly child happy happy child need not pursue interview further by degree returned to subject of new promotion eleanor tried to prove to a grantlys have done that age must be bar to being very excellent dean argument have now even le weight than before said little nothing sat meditative now then must kiss daughter say 'yes ' true ' 'well dear ca quite agree with there ' must not be got to enter sharply into question of 'to be not to be dean of barchester of happiness of mr arabin virtue must talk a much a eleanor desired to tell truth be not little about deanery must now say nothing further have got new idea into head why must not mr arabin be new dean chapter l archdeacon be satisfied with state of affair archdeacon in journey into barchester have be assured by mr harding that prognostication about mr slope eleanor be groundless mr harding however have found very difficult to shake son in law faith in own acuteness matter have to dr grantly be so plainly corroborated by such patent evidence borne out by such endless circumstance that at first refused to take a true positive statement mr harding made to of eleanor own disavowal of impeachment at last yielded in qualified way brought to admit that must at present regard past conviction a mistake in doing so guarded that if at future time eleanor must come forth to world a mr slope might still be able to say 'there told so remember what said what said remember also for coming year be right in matter a in others carried however concession so far a to bring to undertake to call at eleanor house did call accordingly while father daughter be yet in middle of conference mr harding have have so much to hear to say that have forgotten to advertise eleanor of honour awaited heard brother in law voice in hall while quite unprepared to see be archdeacon said springing up 'yes dear told to tell that must come to see to tell truth have forgotten about ' eleanor fled away regardless of father entreaty must not now in first hour of joy bring to bear archdeacon retraction apology congratulation must have so much to say must be so tedious in saying consequently archdeacon when be shown into drawing room found on one there mr harding ' must excuse eleanor ' said mr harding 'be anything matter asked doctor who at once anticipated that whole truth about mr slope have at last come out 'well something be matter wonder whether will be much surprised ' archdeacon saw by father in law manner that after have nothing to tell about mr slope 'no said 'certainly not nothing will ever surprise again ' very many men nowadays besides archdeacon adopt affect to adopt nil admirari doctrine nevertheless to judge from appearance be just a subject to sudden emotion a grandfather grandmother be before do think mr arabin have done ' arabin be nothing about daughter of stanhope hope ' 'no not that woman ' said mr harding enjoying joke in sleeve 'not that woman be going to do anything about woman why ca speak out if yo have anything to say there be nothing hate so much a sort of mystery 'there will be mystery with archdeacon though of course must go further at present 'well ' susan must promise will tell one else 'nonsense ' exclaimed archdeacon who be becoming angry in suspense ca have secret about mr arabin ' 'only that eleanor be engaged ' be quite clear to see by archdeacon face that did not believe word of ber arabin be impossible ' at rate have just told so ' be impossible ' repeated archdeacon 'well ca say think be impossible certainly took by surprise doe not make impossible ' must be mistaken mr harding assured that there be mistake that must find on returning home mr arabin have be at plumstead with express object of making to same declaration that even miss thorne knew about that in fact thing be a clearly settled a such arrangement between lady gentleman must be 'good heaven said archdeacon walking up down eleanor drawing room 'good heaven good heaven now exclamation certainly betokened faith mr harding properly gathered from at last dr grantly did believe fact first utterance clearly evinced certain amount of distaste at information have received second simply indicated surprise tone of third mr harding fancied that must catch certain gleam of satisfaction archdeacon have truly expressed working of mind must not be disgusted to find how utterly astray have be in anticipation have only be lucky enough to have suggested marriage when first brought mr arabin into country character for judgment wisdom must have received addition must have classed at rate next to solomon why have not done so might not have foreseen mr arabin must want wife in parsonage have foreseen that eleanor must want husband must not also have perceived that mr arabin be man much more likely to attract than mr slope archdeacon found that have be at fault of course must not immediately get over discomfiture then surprise be intense how sly pair of young turtle dove have be with how egregiously have hoaxed have preached at eleanor against fancied attachment to mr slope at very time be in love with own protege mr arabin have absolutely taken that same mr arabin into confidence with reference to dread of mr slope alliance be very natural that archdeacon must feel surprise there be also great ground for satisfaction looking at match by be very thing to help doctor out of difficulty in first place assurance that must never have mr slope for brother in law be in great comfort then mr arabin be of men one with whom must best suit to be utterly connected crowning comfort be blow that marriage must give to mr slope have now certainly lost wife rumour be beginning to whisper that might possibly lose position in palace

of old bunce who for many year have be favourite of late warden be one abel handy who have be humble mean from driving warden from home be mr harding now resolved that must introduce new warden to hospital felt that many circumstance might conspire to make men receive mr quiverful with aversion disrespect felt also that mr quiverful might feel qualm of conscience if entered hospital with idea that did so in hostility to predecessor mr harding therefore determined to walk in arm in arm with mr quiverful to ask from men respectful obedience to new master on returning to barchester found that

circumstance have be impossible for to refuse proffered boon must not reject bread be offered to child refuse to ease heavy burden have so long oppressed that poor wife of nevertheless have be very grievous to to think that in going to hospital might encounter ill will of brother in diocese mr harding have fully comprehended be for such feeling a for nice comprehension of such motif that heart intellect be peculiarly fitted in most matter of worldly import archdeacon set down father in law a little better than fool perhaps be right in other matter equally important if be rightly judged mr harding have be so minded might with a much propriety have set down son in law for fool few men however be constituted a be mr harding have that nice appreciation of feeling of others belongs of right exclusively to woman arm in arm walked into inner quadrangle of building there five old men met mr harding shook hand with then mr quiverful did same with bunce mr harding shook hand twice mr quiverful be about to repeat ceremony old man gave encouragement be very glad to know at last have new warden said mr harding in very cheery voice be very old for change ' said one of 'but do suppose
