disruption a be for time complete after five year mr peacocke appeared again at oxford with beautiful american wife necessity of earning income by erudition must at first have seemed very improbable that dr wortle must have taken into school into parish gentleman who have chosen united state a field for classical labour doctor whose mind be by mean logical be thoroughgoing tory of old school therefore considered bound to hate name of republic hated rolling stone mr peacocke have certainly be rolling stone loved oxford with heart year since have be heard to say hard thing of mr peacocke when gentleman deserted college for sake of establishing across atlantic be one who thought that there must be place of penitence allowed to who have clearly repented of error moreover when heard that mr peacocke be endeavouring to establish in oxford a coach for undergraduate also that be married man without encumbrance in way of family there seemed to to be additional reason for pardoning that

peacocke scholarship power of teaching be acknowledged be already in order be declared that mr peacocke be undoubtedly lady many inquiry be made many meeting took place many difficulty arose at last mr mr peacocke came to bowick took up abode in school doctor requirement be not at once fulfilled mr peacocke position be easily settled mr peacocke who seemed to be woman possessed of sterling sense great activity undertook duty without difficulty mr peacocke must not at first consent to act a curate in parish did however after time perform portion of sunday service when first came to bowick have declared that must undertake clerical duty education be profession to that meant to devote exclusively for six eight month of sojourn did go back from so that doctor may be said even still to have failed in carrying out purpose at last new schoolmaster appeared in pulpit of parish church preached sermon have passed in private conference between doctor assistant on subject need not here be related mr peacocke aversion to do more than attend regularly at church service a one of parishioner have be very strong doctor anxiety to overcome assistant reasoning have also be strong there have doubt be much said between mr peacocke have be true to principle principle be in regard to appointment a curate came to pas that for month preached regularly sunday in parish church to full satisfaction of parishioner for have accepted payment much to doctor dissatisfaction nevertheless be certainly case that who served doctor gratuitously never came by worse of bargain mr peacocke be small wiry man anything robust in appearance still capable of great bodily exertion be great walker labour in school never seemed to fatigue addition of sermon to preach week seemed to make difference to energy in school be constant reader must pas from one kind of mental work to without fatigue doctor be noted scholar soon became manifest to doctor to boy mr peacocke be much deeper in scholarship than doctor though be poor man own small classical library be supposed to be repository of be known about latin greek in fact mr peacocke grew to be marvel of marvel about thing most marvellous be entire faith doctor placed in certain change even be made in old established curriculum of tuition be made a boy supposed by advice of mr peacocke mr peacocke be treated with personal respect almost seemed to imply that two men be equal be supposed by boy to come from fact that doctor assistant have be fellow of college at oxford parson other gentry around must see that there be more in than mr

youngest son of marchioness of altamont when lady altamont paid second visit to bowick for sake of taking boy home a soon a be fit to be moved ladyship made little mistake with sweetest most caressing smile in world offered mr peacocke ten pound note dear madam said mr peacocke without slightest reserve difficulty be so natural that must do because can not of course understand position be altogether out of question marchioness blushed stammered begged hundred pardon being good natured woman told whole story to mr wortle must just a soon have offered money to marchioness herself said mr wortle a told to husband must have done deal sooner said doctor be not in least afraid of lady altamont stand in awful dread of mr peacocke nevertheless mr peacocke have done work by little lord bed side just a though have be paid nurse so felt to be be in least ashamed of position in respect if there be aught of shame about a people said certainly did not come from fact that be in receipt of salary for performance of certain prescribed duty such remuneration be thought a honourable a doctor income to american intelligence acceptance of present of money from marchioness must have be degradation certainly be said of by person that there must have be something in former life of be ashamed honourable mr stantiloup to whom affair of bowick have be of consequence since husband have lost lawsuit who have not only heard much have inquired far near about mr mr peacocke declared diligently among friend with many nod wink that there be something rotten in state of denmark did at first somewhat imprudently endeavour to spread rumour abroad that doctor have become enslaved by lady beauty even hostile to bowick must not accept doctor certainly be not man to put in jeopardy respect of world own standing for beauty of woman moreover doctor a have said before be over fifty year of age there soon came up ground on calumny must found story be certainly case mr peacocke have never accepted hospitality from mr wortle other lady in neighbourhood reached ear of mr stantiloup first that lady have called upon other a lady be wont to do who intend to cultivate mutual personal acquaintance then that mr wortle have asked mr peacocke to dinner mr peacocke have refused not only that invitation subsequent invitation to le ceremonious form of tea drinking have be true have be true also though of mr stantiloup have not heard particular mr peacocke have explained to neighbour that did not intend to put on visiting footing with one why not dear mr wortle have said urged to argument by precept from husband why must make desolate here when will be so glad to have be part of life that must be so mr peacocke have answered be quite sure that duty have undertaken be becoming lady think that be becoming to one who give accepts entertainment there have be something of same kind between doctor mr peacocke why mischief must wife come eat bit of mutton drink glass of wine over at rectory like other decent people never believed that accusation against doctor in regard to swearing be doubt addicted to expletive in conversation might perhaps have indulged in strong word two have not be prevented by sanctity of order perhaps ought to say replied mr peacocke because be not like other decent people then went on to explain meaning decent people thought in regard to social intercourse be who be able to give take with ease among other have fallen into position in wife must give anything from though might be willing to accept must be accepted only a be by special favour bosh ejaculated doctor mr peacocke simply smiled said might be bosh that even be inclined to relax own view wife must certainly not relax hers so came to pas that although doctor mr peacocke be really intimate that something of absolute friendship sprang up between two lady when mr peacocke have already be more than twelve month in bowick neither have mr peacocke broken bread in doctor house yet friendship have become strong incident have happened early in year have served greatly to strengthen at school there be little boy just eleven year old only son of lady de lawle who have in early year be dear friend to mr wortle lady de lawle be widow of baronet little boy be heir to large fortune mother have be most loath to part with treasure friend uncle trustee have declared that old prescribed form of education for british aristocrat must be followed t'other school namely then eton then oxford mother might not go with first to one then to other such going living with must deprive education of real salt therefore bowick be chosen a t'other school because mr wortle must be more like mother to poor desolate boy than other lady so be arranged poor desolate boy became happiest of young pickle whom be mr wortle special province to spoil whenever must get hold of now happened that on one beautiful afternoon towards end of april mr wortle have taken young de lawle little boy with over foot bridge passed from bottom of parsonage garden to glebe meadow ran on other side of little river with have gone great newfoundland dog who be on term equally friendly with inmate of rectory school where bridge passed across stream garden field be on same level a water ran down to ground on school building have be erected there arose steep bank over bend in river rather steep cliff for indeed be almost perpendicular force of current a turned at spot having washed away bank in way have come to pas that there be precipitous fall of about dozen foot from top of little cliff into water that water here a eddied round curve be black deep so that bigger boy be wont to swim in arrangement for bathing having be made on further school side there have sometimes be question whether rail must not be placed for protection along top of cliff nothing of kind have yet be done boy be not supposed to play in field be on other side of river must only be reached by bridge through parsonage garden on day young de lawle friend dog rushed up hill before mr wortle there began to romp a be custom mary wortle who be one of party followed enjoining child to keep away from cliff for while did so of course returned once twice be recalled scolded always asserting that fault be altogether with neptune be neptune that knocked down always pushed towards river perhaps be neptune be that a might there came moment very terrible to dog in one of gyration came violently against little boy knocked off leg pushed over edge mr wortle who have be making way slowly up hill saw fall heard splash fell immediately to ground other eye have also seen accident doctor mr peacocke be at moment walking together in playground at school side of brook when boy fell have paused in walk be standing doctor with back to stream assistant with face turned towards cliff loud exclamation broke from lip a saw fall in moment almost before doctor have realised accident have occurred be in water two minute afterwards young de lawle drenched indeed frightened out of breath in nowise seriously hurt be out upon bank mr peacocke drenched also equally safe be standing over while doctor on knee be satisfying that little charge have received no fatal injury need hardly be explained that termination a to accident have greatly increased good feeling with mr peacocke be regarded by inhabitant of school rectory chapter iii mystery mr peacocke said that in matter great deal of fuss be made about nothing perhaps be so got ducking being strong swimmer probably suffered real danger boy rolling down three four foot of bank have then fallen down six eight foot into deep water might no doubt have be much hurt might have struck against rock have be killed in case mr peacocke prowess must have be of avail nothing of kind happened little jack de lawle be put to bed in one of rectory bed room be comforted with sherry negus sweet jelly for two day rejoiced thoroughly in accident being freed from school subjected only to caress after that rebelled having become tired of bed by time mother have be most unnecessarily summoned unless be wanted to examine forlorn condition of clothes there be nothing that must do came of course showered blessing on mr peacocke head while mr wortle went through to school showered blessing on mr peacocke what must have done have peacockes not be there must let have way whether for good bad doctor said when assistant complained rather of blessing pointing out at rate absurdity one man be damned for ever because in conscientious exercise of authority give little boy rap happens to make small temporary mark on skin becomes hero because when in equally conscientious performance of duty give ducking wo think hero of course consider very fortunate to have have beside man younger than quick ready at emergence of course feel grateful sha bother by telling so be not end of lady de lawle declared that must not be happy unless mr mr peacocke must bring jack home for holiday to de lawle park of course carried blessing up into mr peacocke little drawing room became quite convinced a be mr wortle mr peacocke be in respect lady heard of mr peacocke antecedent at oxford expressed opinion that be charming people must not be happy unless must promise to come to de lawle park for holiday then mr peacocke have to explain that in present circumstance did not intend to visit anywhere be very much flattered delighted to think that dear little boy be none worse for accident there must be end of there be something in manner a said almost overawed lady de lawle made at rate understood further attempt be made for next six week to induce mr peacocke to enter rectory dining room good deal be said about mr peacocke generally in favour generally in favour because be fine scholar must swim well preaching perhaps did something for swimming did more though there be so much said of good there be something also of evil man must not altogether refuse society for wife unless there be cause for to do so must have known to be unfit to associate with such person a must have met at de lawle park there be mystery mystery when unravelled must doubt prove to be very deleterious to character of person concerned mr stantiloup be quite sure that such must be case might be very well said mr stantiloup for dr wortle to obtain service of well educated usher for school became quite thing when put man up to preach in church of whose life for five year one knew anything somebody have told something a to necessity of bishop authority for appointment of curate one have strictly defined to what curate be be however quite ready to declare that mr peacocke have business to preach in pulpit that something very disagreeable must come of be feeling altogether confined to mr stantiloup though have perhaps originated with what have said among own friend think well must know something of life during five year have be said to rector by bishop who probably must have said nothing of kind have not report reached ear report when reach certain magnitude attain certain importance require to be noticed so much in world depends upon character attention have to be paid to bad character even when be not deserved in dealing with men woman have to consider what believe a well a what believe utility of sermon depends much on idea that audience have of piety of man who preaches though word of god must never have come with greater power from mouth of man will come in vain if be uttered by one who be known a breaker of commandment will come in vain from mouth of one who be even suspected to be so to when be said to by bishop in kindest manner dr wortle replied that such suspicion be monstrous unreasonable uncharitable declared that originated with abominable virago mr stantiloup look round diocese said bishop in reply to see if can find single clergyman acting in of detail of whose life for last five year know absolutely nothing thereupon doctor said that must make inquiry of mr peacocke might well be thought that mr peacocke must not like such inquiry doctor be quite sure that story told to must be true on returning home found necessary at rate expedient to postpone question for few day be not easy to ask man what have be doing with five year of life when question implies belief that five year have be passed badly be understood that questioning must in sort apply to man wife doctor have once said to mr wortle that stood in awe of mr peacocke there have certainly come upon idea that be lady with whom must not be easy to meddle be obedient diligent minutely attentive to wish be expressed to in regard to duty have become manifest to doctor that in matter beyond school be independent be by mean subject to external influence be not for instance very constant in own attendance at church never seemed to feel necessary to apologise for absence doctor in many familiar conversation with mr peacocke have not found able to allude to have observed that husband did not often speak of own wife unless be on matter having reference to school so came to pas that dreaded conversation proposed to postponed from day to day with cowardice be quite unusual to now o kind hearted reader feel constrained in telling of little story to depart altogether from principle of story telling to probably have become accustomed to put horse of romance before cart there be mystery respecting mr mr peacocke according to law recognised in such matter ought not to be elucidated till let say last chapter two so that interest must be maintained almost to end so near end that there must be left only space for little arrangement be necessary for well being perhaps for evil being of personage be purpose to disclose mystery at once to ask to look for interest must choose to go on with chronicle simply in conduct of person during disclosure to others be to know before doctor bishop before mr wortle hon mr stantiloup lady de lawle be to know before peacockes become aware that must necessarily be disclosed to one may be that when will have once told mystery there will no longer be room for interest in tale to that there be many such reader of novel know doubt whether greater number be not such be far from saying that kind of interest of be speaking of intend to deprive be not most natural most efficacious must 'black dwarf ' be if one knew from beginning that be rich man baronet 'the pirate ' if truth about norna of fitful head have be told in first chapter therefore put book down if revelation of future secret be necessary for enjoyment mystery be going to be revealed in next paragraph in next half dozen word mr mr peacocke be not man wife story how came to be so need not be very long will a think entail great degree of odious criminality upon man upon woman at st louis mr peacocke have become acquainted with two brother named lefroy who have come up from louisiana have achieved for character be by mean desirable be son of planter who have be rich in extent of acre number of slave before war of secession general lefroy have be in day great man in state have held command during war have be utterly ruined when war be over

lefroy be who afterwards came to england under name of mr peacocke mr peacocke be vice president of college at missouri when first saw when first became acquainted with two brother of whom be called colonel lefroy then there arose great scandal in city a to treatment wife received from husband be about to go away south into mexico with view of pushing fortune there with certain desperado who be maintaining perpetual war against authority of united state on border of texas demanded that wife must accompany refused to do violence be used to force then came to pas certain person in st louis interfered on behalf among be reverend mr peacocke vice president of college upon whose feeling singular beauty dignified demeanour of woman doubt have have much effect man failed to be powerful over wife then two brother went away together woman be left to provide for mr peacocke be generous in aid gave to in doing so may be understood that in way intimacy be created must not be understood that intimacy be of such nature a to be injurious to fair fame of lady thing went on in way for two year during mr lefroy conduct drew down upon reproach from one then there came tidings that colonel lefroy have perished in making one of raid in two brother be continually concerned colonel lefroy have perished if be younger brother must be nothing to mr peacocke if be elder must be everything if ferdinand lefroy be dead must not scruple at once to ask woman to be wife man have done that have not done have be of such nature a to solve bond of affection have already allowed to speak of man a one whose life be blight upon own though there have be no word of out spoken love from lip to ear thought that might succeed if must be made certain that ferdinand lefroy be no longer among living will never know said in misery what do hear will never believe how can one know anything a to what happens in country such a then took up hat staff vice president professor clergyman a be started off for mexican border did tell that be going barely told be thing ought to be found out said want turn of travelling will be away three month merely bade god bless said not word to hinder to encourage going be gone just three month have named then returned elate with news have seen younger brother robert lefroy have learnt from that elder ferdinand have certainly be killed robert have be most ungracious to having even on one occasion threatened life there have be no doubt that robert be alive ferdinand have be killed by party of united state soldier then clergyman have reward be accepted by widow with full happy heart not only have release be complete so be present joy nothing seemed wanting to happiness during six first month after union then one day of sudden ferdinand lefroy be standing within little drawing room at college of st louis dead certainly be not dead did not believe that one have said that be dead might be lying not did not care peacocke certainly have lied so said colonel did not believe that peacocke have ever seen brother robert robert be dead must have be dead indeed before date given for interview woman be bigamist be if second marriage have ever be perpetrated probably have wilfully agreed to falsehood for must resolve at once what step meant to take then departed being at moment after nine in evening in morning be gone again from moment have never either heard of seen how be to be with must have almost brought to think dream be not that others besides have seen man known that colonel ferdinand lefroy have be in st louis then there came to idea even might disbelieve word have spoken that even might think story to have be false to soon put end dearest said never knew word be true to come from mouth word be false from yours must part there be one who read will say that must have parted day passed together a man wife must be falsehood sin there must be absolute misery for in parting there be law from god man entitling man to escape

sin that have continued in one great falsehood be manifest enough mr stantiloup when hears will have triumph lady de lawle soft heart will rejoice because invitation be not accepted bishop will be unutterably shocked perhaps to good man there will be solace in feeling that have be right in surmise how doctor bore story be intended to tell how also mr mr peacocke bore when sin falsehood be made known to world around mystery have at rate be told who feel that on account hope of interest be at end have better put down book part ii chapter iv doctor asks question doctor instigated by bishop have determined to ask question of mr peacocke a to american life promise have be given at palace doctor a returned home repented in that have made lordship be gossip a bad a old woman a bad a mr stantiloup wanted to know thing in man must feel interest so said doctor to what be to bishop to doctor what mr peacocke have be doing in man scholarship be patent moral be unexceptional capacity for preaching undoubted peculiar fitness for place at bowick unquestionable who have right to know more that man have be properly educated at oxford properly ordained on entering fellowship be doubted by man even if there have be temporary backsliding in america might be possible for of have not backslided at time of life why must be raked up there be uncharitableness in such proceeding altogether opposed to doctor view of life hated severity may almost be said that hated that state of perfection must require pardon be thoroughly human quite content with own present position anticipating millennium for future of world probably in heart looking forward to heaven a simply better alternative when happiness of world must be at end be in respect wicked man yet little wickedness be not distasteful to be angry with in that have made promise have be rule of life with never to take advice bishop have power within a rector of bowick must certainly obey bishop have be theory to oppose bishop almost more readily than one else must bishop attempt to exceed power bishop have done so in giving advice yet have promised be angry with did not on account think that promise must be evaded oh having said that must do must do having said that must do sooner that did better when three four day have passed by despised because have not yet made for fit occasion be such mean sneaking thing to do said to still have to be done be on saturday afternoon that said to a returned back to parsonage garden from cricket ground where have left mr peacocke three other usher playing cricket with ten twelve of bigger boy of school there be french master german master master for arithmetic mathematics with adjacent science besides mr peacocke a assistant classical master among mr peacocke be facile princeps in rank supposed ability be admitted to delight of playground mr peacocke in spite of year of spent in america where cricket must not have be familiar to remembered well old pastime be quite adept at game be ten thousand pity that man must be disturbed by unnecessary questioning who must not only teach preach play cricket also nevertheless must be done when therefore doctor entered own house went into study wrote short note to assistant dear peacocke must come over see in study evening for hour have question two wish to ask hour may name will suit after eight yours most sincerely jeffrey wortle in answer to there came note to say that at past eight mr peacocke must be with doctor at half past eight mr peacocke came have fancied on reading doctor note that further question must be raised a to money doctor have declared that must no longer accept gratuitous clerical service in parish have said that must look out for one else if mr peacocke must not oblige by allowing name to be referred in usual way to bishop have now determined to say in answer to that school gave enough to do that must much prefer to give up church although must always be happy to take part occasionally if must be wanted doctor have be sitting alone for last quarter of hour when assistant entered room have spent time in endeavouring to arrange conversation must follow have come at last to conclusion must let mr peacocke know exactly what have passed between bishop must then leave to usher to tell own story a to past life to abstain from telling have promised to ask question must ask must let man judge for whether answer ought to be given bishop have be bothering about peacocke said standing up with back to fireplace a soon a other man have shut door behind doctor face be always expressive of inward feeling at moment showed very plainly that sympathy be not with bishop be sorry that lordship must have troubled said other a certainly intend to take part in diocese will sink that for present said doctor wo let that be mixed up with what have got to say just now have taken certain part in diocese already very much to satisfaction hope may be continued wo bother about now a far a can see be just man must suit a colleague in parish mr peacocke bowed remained silent fact be continued doctor certain old woman have got hold of bishop made feel that ought to answer objection that mr stantiloup have tongue a loud a town crier bell what have mr stantiloup to say about nothing except in so far a can hit through what doe bishop say think that ought to know something of life during five year be in america think so also said mr peacocke want to know anything for a far a be concerned be quite satisfied know where be educated how be ordained can feel sure from present efficiency that can not have wasted time if tell that wish to say anything will be contented will tell bishop a far a be concerned there must be end of what will do asked mr peacocke well a far a curacy be concerned of course can refuse licence have not slightest intention of applying to lordship for licence usher said with tone of self assertion grated little on doctor ear in spite of good humour towards speaker want to go into said man never can say what intention may be six month hence if be to refuse to speak of life in america said mr peacocke thus to decline to comply with what must confess must be no more than rational requirement on part how then must be with wife in regard to school must make difference said doctor there be story to tell said mr peacocke very slowly be sure that can not be to disgrace say that be do say that be not there may be circumstance in man may hardly know whether have done right wrong do know have done otherwise must have despised must not have done otherwise have lived there be man in world said doctor earnestly le anxious to pry into secret of others than be take thing a find if cook sends up good dish care to know how made if read good book be not le gratified because there may have be something amiss with author must doubt teaching said mr peacocke who have gone astray then must doubt human teaching for men have gone astray have better hold tongue about past let tell who ask unnecessary question to mind own business be very odd doctor said mr peacocke that must have come from just now why odd just now because have be turning in mind for last fortnight whether ought not to ask a favour to listen to story of life must do so before must formally accept curacy have determined that only brought to resolution of refusing office think think that irrespective of curacy ought to be told have not quite made up mind suppose be pressing oh must pressing influence much a owe to undeserved kindness forbearance be bound to say that nothing can influence in least in such matter well being of wife own sense of duty be matter in can unfortunately take counsel from one alone besides know circumstance be so forgetful of can hardly ask for opinion doctor by time have doubt become curious there be something mysterious with must like to become acquainted be by mean philosopher superior to ordinary curiosity of mankind be manly even at moment remembered former assurance of course said can not in least guess what be about for hate secret have secret in world know nothing of might know too for cared be good fortune rather than merit might well have be with a be with a rule think that where there be secret have better be kept one at rate must allow to be wormed out of by impertinent assiduity of others if there be anything affecting wife wish world on side of water to know tell to one on side of water there be something affecting wife that wish world to know then tell to one said dr wortle authoritatively will tell will do said mr peacocke will take week to think of then will let know whether will tell whether will not if tell will let know also how far will expect to keep secret how far to reveal think bishop will be entitled to know nothing about unless ask to be recognised a one of clergy of diocese certainly not certainly not said doctor then interview be at end mr peacocke when went away from rectory did not at once return to own house went off for walk alone be now nearly midsummer there be broad daylight till ten o'clock be after nine when left doctor still there be time for walk knew well through

aught death part thee ' then rose from chair flinging on knee at foot buried face in lap ella said only injury can do be to speak of leaving be injury be surely unnecessary because can not carry beyond word now if will sit up listen to will tell passed between doctor then raised from ground took seat at tea table listened patiently a began tale have be talking about here in county who have found necessary to talk about one so obscure a what doe matter who might be doctor in kindly wrath for be very wroth mention name other what doe matter obscurity becomes mystery mystery of course produce curiosity be bound to be so be not who be in fault if be different from others of course will be inquired into be so different yes different in not eating doctor dinner when be offered to different in not accepting lady de lawle hospitality different in contenting simply with duty husband of course be different how must not be different a be different so of course there will be question wonderings that sifting searching always at last find out fact bishop say that know nothing of american life why must want to know anything because have be preaching in one of church be natural natural that mother of boy must want to know something doctor say that hate secret so do oh dearest secret be always accompanied by more le of fear produce more le of cowardice can no more be

darling wound may not be laid bare to eye who have secret because chooses bishop well yes bishop bishop have told doctor to examine doctor have done give credit of saying that task have be most distasteful to do justice of acknowledging that have backed out of work have undertaken have asked question have said in same breath need not answer unless like have not answered yet have answered nothing a yet have think made up mind that question must be answered that everything must be told everything to idea be to tell everything to to leave to to decide what must be done must refuse to repeat story further then bid go away from bowick must think that conduct have be altogether straightforward not uncharitable what must do then must go what else whither ah on must decide must be friendly with though might think necessary must leave bowick must not turn against violently must hing think must assist rather must help perhaps to find place where might still earn bread by such skill a posse where must do so without dragging in aught of domestic life a have be forced to do here have be curse to exclaimed unhappy wife dearest blessing said that call curse have come from circumstance be common to of there need be more said about man have be source of terrible trouble to trouble must be discussed from time to time necessity of enduring may be taken for granted can not be philosopher such a be said there be escape from philosophy be forced upon when evil thing be necessary there remains only consideration how may be best borne must tell then think so have week to consider of think so though be very kind at moment in giving option mean what say in declaring that will remain even though tell nothing yet mind must become uneasy must gradually become discontented think how great be stake in school how must feel towards be success to be gradually diminished because kept master here of whom people believed unknown evil there have be sign of such falling off there have be time for be only now that people be beginning to talk have nothing of kind be said have bishop asked question have be regarded a people simply obscure to whom mystery attached thing might have gone on a be be bound to tell truth then must go probably at once when have be so decided sooner better how must endure to remain here when going will be desired oh must flit again seek other home though must keep secret believe will if be asked will be known that there be secret secret of such nature that circumstance have driven hence if must get literary work in london perhaps might live there how how must set about truth be dearest that for work such a yours must either have wife at else wife of whom need not be ashamed to speak whole truth before world what be use of said rising from chair a in anger why go back to that must be settled between a fixed by fate of have given to other have to give partnership be complete a far a be concerned at rate be contented ah darling exclaimed throwing arm round neck let there be end to distinction difference between can have effect to increase trouble be woman be man therefore doubt name when brought in question be more subject to remark than mine a be name being that of clergyman more subject to remark than of one not belonging to sacred profession not on account do wish to unfrock certainly on account do wish to be deprived of wife for good bad have to be endured together expression of regret a to be unavoidable only aggravate trouble after that seated took up book a though be able at once to carry off mind to other matter probably knew that must not do so sat silent by for while till bade take to bed promising that must follow without delay for three day nothing further be said between on subject be allusion made to between doctor assistant school went on same a ever intercourse between two men be unaltered a to general mutual courtesy there did undoubtedly grow in doctor mind certain feverish feeling of insecurity at rate knew that there be mystery that there be something about peacockes something referring especially to mr peacocke if generally known must be held to be deleterious to character so much must not help deducing from what man have already told doubt have undertaken in generosity that although man must decline to tell secret alteration must be made a to school arrangement became conscious that in so promising have in degree jeopardised well being of school began to whisper to that person in position a filled by mr peacocke wife must not be subject to peculiar remark from ill natured tongue weapon be afforded by such mystery to stantiloups of world stantiloups must be sure to use with virulence to establishment a school respectability be everything credit said to be matter so subtle in essence that a may be obtained almost without reason so without reason may be made to melt away much a liked mr peacocke much a approved of much a there be in man of manliness worth be absolutely dear to still be not willing to put character of school in peril for sake of mr peacocke be to do so must be neglecting duty much more sacred than must owe to mr peacocke be thus that during three day conversed with on subject although be able to maintain outwardly same manner same countenance a though thing be going well between when parted after interview in study doctor doubt have so expressed a rather to dissuade usher from telling secret than to encourage to do so have be free in declaring that telling of secret must make difference in assistant position at bowick in that have acted from habitual impulse have since told that mystery ought to be disclosed be not right that boy must be left to charge of one who however competent dared not speak of own antecedent be thus thought of matter after consideration must wait of course till week must be over before made up mind to anything further so peacocke be going to take curacy be said to doctor by mr pearson squire in course of two three day of be speaking mr pearson be old gentleman who did not live often at bowick being compelled a always said by health to spend winter spring of year in italy summer month by family in london in truth did not much care for bowick have always be on good term with doctor have never opposed school mr pearson have be good also a to church matter a far a goodness can be shown by generosity have interested about curate so have come to pas that doctor did not wish to snub neighbour when question be asked rather think not said doctor fear will have to look out for one else did not prolong conversation for though wished to be civil did not wish to be communicative mr pearson have shown parochial solicitude did not trouble with further question so mr peacocke be going to take curacy very same question in very same word be put to doctor on next morning by vicar of next parish rev mr puddicombe clergyman without flaw who did duty excellently in station of life be one who must preach sermon take whole service for brother parson in distress never think of reckoning up return sermon return service be due to one who gave dinner too have pretty daughter still doctor did not quite like be little too pious perhaps given to ask question so mr peacocke be going to take curacy there be certain animation about asking of question by mr puddicombe very different from mr pearson listless manner be clear to doctor mr puddicombe wanted to know seemed to doctor that something of condemnation be implied in tone of question not only against mr peacocke against also for having employed mr peacocke upon word ca tell said rather crossly thought that have be all settled heard that be decided then have heard more than have be bishop told now certainly be case that in fatal conversation have induced doctor to interrogate mr peacocke about past life doctor have said that intended to look out for curate probably did not remember that at moment wish bishop must confine to asserting thing that know said doctor angrily be sure bishop intends to do so said mr puddicombe very gravely apologise have not intended to touch subject on there may perhaps be reserve be only going to tell of excellent young man of whom have heard good morning then mr puddicombe withdrew chapter vi lord carstairs during last six month mr peacocke most intimate friend at bowick excepting of course wife have be one of pupil at school lad be one of pupil must not be said to be one of boy be young lord carstairs eldest son of earl bracy have be sent to bowick now six year ago with usual purpose of progressing from bowick to eton from bowick to eton have gone in due course there thing have not gone well with young lord school disturbance have taken place when have be there about year half in be be supposed to have be ringleader be thought necessary for preservation of discipline of school that victim must be made be perhaps thought well in order that impartiality of school might be made manifest that victim must be lord earl bracy be therefore asked to withdraw son young lord carstairs at age of seventeen be left to seek education where must have be still be earl purpose to send son to oxford there be now interval of two year before must be accomplished during one year be sent abroad to travel with tutor be then reported to have be that well conducted lad ought to be be declared to be quite worthy of oxford must do for be even suggested that eton have done badly for herself in throwing off from such young nobleman though lord carstairs have done well with french german on continent must certainly be necessary that must rub up greek latin before went to christ church then request be made to doctor to take in at bowick in sort a private pupil after demurring doctor consented be not wont to run counter to earl who treated with respect deference earl bracy have in special manner be friend lord carstairs have be great favourite at bowick when expulsion from eton have come about doctor have interested have declared that very scant measure of justice have be shown to young lord be thus in measure compelled to accede to request made to lord carstairs be received back at bowick not without hesitation with full measure of affectionate welcome bed room be in parsonage house dinner took with doctor family in other respect lived among boy will not be bad for mary mr wortle have said anxiously to husband when matter be first discussed why must be bad for mary oh know young people together know might be dangerous be boy be mere child be child will be trouble think will be at dangerous in way so be decided mr wortle did not at all agree a to being child thought that girl be far from being child have argued matter quite a much a ever argued anything with doctor so matter be arranged young lord carstairs came back to bowick a far a doctor must see nothing must be nicer than young pupil manner be not at above playing with other boy took very kindly to old study old haunt of evening after dinner went away from drawing room to study in pursuit of latin greek without precocious attempt at making conversation with miss wortle doubt there be good deal of lawn tennis of afternoon lawn tennis be generally played in rectory garden then have ever be case lawn tennis be always played with two on side there be tete tete game between lordship mary whenever game be going on mr wortle be always there to see fair play among other amusement young lord took to walking far afield with mr peacocke then doubt many thing be said about life in america when man have be much abroad have passed time there under unusual circumstance doings will necessarily become subject of conversation to companion to have travelled in france germany in italy be not uncommon be uncommon to have lived year year in florence in rome be not uncommon now to have travelled through united state rocky mountain peru be hardly uncommon so much have taste for travelling increased for oxford fellow of college clergyman of church of england to have established a professor in missouri be uncommon must hardly be that lord carstairs must ask question respecting that far away life mr peacocke have objection to such question told young friend much about manner of people of st louis told how far people have progressed in classical literature in what fell behind in what excelled youth of own age in england how far college be success then described own life before after marriage have liked people of st louis well enough not quite well enough to wish to live among doubt habit be very different from of englishman must however have be happy enough there only that circumstance arose did mr peacocke like place young lord asked one day be american know oh yes have heard did come from st louis father be planter in louisiana not far from new orleans before abolition of slavery did like st louis well enough think when be first married have be married before know be widow did like coming to england among stranger be glad to leave st louis thing happened there made life unhappy be on account came here gave up position

to have school of own must take money said have not got to be tutor at college must take never mind be very well where be have nothing to complain of have be going to say that to be tutor of college must want high standing then must have be forced to explain that have lost at own college that standing have once possessed yes said on occasion be unhappy ask question about who oh dear must not think of taking such liberty must be a kindness not a liberty still speak to about there be sorrow must be hidden be better to endeavour to bury by never speaking of by not thinking of if be possible be a bad a that lad asked be bad enough sometimes never mind remember that roman wisdom deus quoque finem think that thing be bearable if man will only make up mind to bear tell one have complained who oh never not have said anything world might not know that be unmanly to complain indeed complain only wish that thing be lighter to then went off to other matter heart be yearning to tell

told during whole of morning doctor did not come into school school hour lasted from half past nine to twelve during portion of time be practice to be there sometimes on saturday must be absent when be understood generally that be preparing sermon for sunday such doubt might be case now there be feeling among boy that be kept away by other reason be known that during hour of morning school mr peacocke have be occupied with uncouth stranger of boy might have observed that uncouth stranger have not taken altogether away from premise there be at rate general feeling that uncouth stranger have something to do with doctor absence mr peacocke did best to go on with work a though nothing have occurred to disturb usual tenor of way a far a boy be aware succeeded be just a clear about greek verb just a incisive about passage of caesar a must have be have colonel lefroy remained on other side of water during whole time be exercising mind in painful process of thinking of two thing at once be determined that caesar must be uppermost may be doubted whether succeeded at very moment colonel lefroy might be telling doctor that ella be in truth wife of man at moment doctor might be deciding in anger that sinful deceitful man must no longer be officer of hour be too important to to leave mind at own disposal nevertheless did best clifford junior said will never make understand what caesar say here elsewhere if give entire mind to caesar do give entire mind to caesar said clifford junior very well now go on try again remember caesar want mind a said be revolving in own mind how must face doctor when doctor must look at in wrath if doctor be in degree harsh with must hold own against doctor a far a personal contest might go at twelve boy went out for hour before dinner lord carstairs asked to play game of racket not to day lord said be anything wrong with yes something be very wrong have strolled out of building be walking up down gravel terrace in front when be said knew something be wrong because called lord yes something be so wrong a to alter for ordinary way of life be thinking of came by accident just because be so troubled what be there have be man here man whom knew in america enemy yes enemy one who be anxious to do injury can be in power mr peacocke thank god not be in man power can not do material harm anything may happen must have happened whether have come not be unhappy wish knew so do with heart wish knew wish knew must that world knew will live through doubt if what matter 'nil conscire sibi nulla pallescere culpa ' be be necessary to man have done nothing of repent nothing must not do again nothing of be ashamed to speak a far a judgment of other men be concerned go now be making up side for cricket perhaps can tell more before evening be over mr mr peacocke be accustomed to dine with boy at one when carstairs being private pupil only have lunch on occasion did not come into dining room think can to day said when bade to take courage not be altered more than must help in outward carriage by misery of present circumstance must not eat if be there then must look at if be so attempt there be necessity what mean be that le one shrink le will be suffering be man who shiver on brink be cold not who plunge into water if be over if first brunt of be over must find mean to comfort went through dinner a have done caesar eating roast mutton baked potato great plateful of currant pie be brought to be fed nourished doubt may be doubtful whether knew much of flavour of what ate before dinner be quite ended before have said grace be always duty to pronounce there came message to from rectory doctor must be glad to see a soon a dinner be done waited very calmly till proper moment must come for grace then very calmly took way over to house be certain now that lefroy have be with doctor because be sent for considerably before time fixed for interview be chief resolve to hold own before doctor doctor who must read character well have so read that of mr peacocke a to have be aware from first that censure fault finding must be possible if connection be to be maintained other usher other curate have occasionally scolded have be very careful never even to seem to scold mr peacocke mr peacocke have be aware of too aware that must not endure aware also that doctor avoided attempt at have known that a consequence of be bound to be more than ordinarily prompt in performance of duty man who will not endure censure have to take care that doe not deserve such have be man struggle have be altogether successful of two understood other respected other now position must be changed be hardly possible mr peacocke thought a entered house that must not be rebuked with grave severity quite out of question that must bear rebuke at library at rectory be spacious handsome room in centre of stood large writing table at doctor be accustomed to sit when be at work facing door with bow window at right hand rarely remained there when one be summoned into room unless one be summoned with whom meant to deal in spirit of severity mr peacocke must be there perhaps three four time week doctor must always get up from chair stand seat elsewhere in room must probably move about with vivacity being fidgety man of quick motion who sometimes seemed a though must not hold own body still for moment now when mr peacocke entered room did not leave place at table must take chair said there be something that must talk about colonel lefroy have be with take man calling by name have be here will not take chair know that will be necessary what have told what suppose have told be true have better at rate take chair believe that what have told be true be believe that what have told be true of can not think be true much of be not so unless be more deceived in than ever be in man at rate sit down then schoolmaster did sit down have made out to be perjured wilful cruel bigamist have not be such said peacocke rising from chair one who have be willing to sacrifice woman to passion who deceived by false witness never who have now refused to allow to see own husband brother lest must learn truth be there at rate for to see therefore man be liar long story have to be told a to at present can only guess what may be nature presume story will be same a that must have told have man never come here exactly same dr wortle therefore will own be right in asking to sit down story may be very long be if mean to tell do did be wrong from first in supposing that nature of marriage need be of concern to others to herself to yes mr peacocke yes be of joined together too closely to admit of isolation such a there be something in grated against schoolmaster pride though nothing have be said a to did not know that much harder thing must meet ear before matter must be brought to end between doctor mister have be prefixed to name have be omitted for last three four month in friendly intercourse have taken place between then though have be done in form of agreeing with what have said doctor have made first complaint by declaring that man have right to regard own moral life a isolated from life of others around be a much a to declare at once that have be wrong in bringing woman to bowick calling mr peacocke have said a much did not make censure lighter when came to from mouth of doctor come said doctor getting up from seat at table throwing into easy chair so a to mitigate austerity of position let hear true story so big liar a american gentleman probably never put foot in room before then mr peacocke told story beginning with incident of woman life have seemed to be so cruel to to others at st louis before have be in degree intimate with then came departure of two men necessity for pecuniary assistance mr peacocke now passed over lightly saying nothing specially of assistance have rendered be left quite alone asked doctor quite alone for how long eighteen month have passed before heard tidings then there came news that colonel lefroy be dead husband did not know be colonel then did tell went down into mexico never mind what told that told be lie what tell will believe tell everything there be tone of complete authority in doctor voice mixed with there be kindliness made schoolmaster determined that must tell everything a far a knew how when heard that one of be dead went away down to border of texas in order might learn truth did know that be going yes told day started told why might find out whether husband be still alive doctor hesitated a asked next question knew however that have to be asked went on with did know that loved to other made immediate answer doctor be man who in matter be intelligent enough therefore put question in shape have told that loved never while thought that other man be living must have guessed said doctor might guess what pleased told be going went how be then went after time came across very man who be here now robert lefroy met questioned told that brother have be killed while fighting be lie altogether lie asked doctor how altogether might have be wounded given over for dead brother might have thought to be dead think so believe to have be plot in order that man might get rid of wife believed then went back to st louis be married thought there be obstacle what might become man wife legally thought be widow there be further delay very little why must there have be delay only ask have suffered enough have waited long enough owed great deal said doctor be not case of owing said mr peacocke at least think not think have learnt to love a have learnt to love how did go with then very well for month there be nothing to mar happiness till one day came made way into presence husband yes husband ferdinand lefroy elder brother of whom have be told that be dead be there standing before talking to half drunk still well knowing what be doing why have come in want of money suppose a other one have come here did ask for money think did then though spoke of poor condition on next day went away heard that have taken steamer down river for new orleans have never heard more of from day to can imagine what caused conduct such a think money be given to night to go if so know by whom gave none during next day two found that many in st louis knew that have be there knew then that knew that wife be not wife be what mean to ask doctor nodded head yes knew what then word be brought to that must part if chose to keep place at college that must disown president told that must be better that must go elsewhere how must send from indeed a to fact know pretty well now must not send from must go leave have be separated then because of law because of religion burden misery desolation must have be upon must have clung to let law say what might said doctor rising from chair must must think must have reconciled to god might have be wrong added might have be wrong only say what must have done be what did exactly exactly be sinner might have be wrong then brought over here suppose know rest know everything now said mr peacocke believe word have heard let say that if may be consolation to of friendship may remain assured whether can remain here be question be prepared to go can not expect must have thought out during hearing of story there be much to be considered very much can only say a between man man that man ever sympathized with more warmly than do with have better let have till monday to think about chapter ix mr wortle mr puddicombe in way nothing be said at first telling of story to decide fate of schoolmaster of lady whom will still call wife there certainly have be no horror displayed by doctor whether can remain here be question doctor during whole interview have said nothing harder than mr peacocke a left rectory did feel that doctor have be very good to there have not only be horror expression of kindest sympathy a to going be left in doubt felt that ought to go must have be so very sad to have to go without friend left with whom must consult a to future condition have be very kind then said mr peacocke to husband when related to particular of interview very kind did not reproach not word declared that have be who be in question must have clung to for ever ever did then will leave here that doe not follow must think not will know that others must know brother in law will not tell only lefroy when find that can get money here from sheer revenge will tell story everywhere when left rectory be probably a angry with doctor a be with will do harm that can to of must go then must think so position here must be insupportable even if must be permitted may be sure of everybody will know do care for everybody said be not that be ashamed of dearest be ashamed of of there will be bitter word bitter word will produce bitter look scant respect how must be with if boy looked at a though thought ill of must not oh must not servant if reviled must come to that must not come to be a doctor said just now man can not isolate moral manner way of life from moral of others men if live together must live together by certain law then there can be hope for none can see a far a bowick be concerned be too closely joined in work with other people there be not boy here with whose father mother sister be not more le connected when be preaching in church there be not one in parish with whom be not connected must do do think for priest to preach against drunkenness whilst be noted drunkard be like that be not what drunken priest might think of what others might think of must not be with position know that hold together that others must think to be if be in dr wortle case be to a be to must bid go must turn away from wife must first duty must be to parish to school if must befriend otherwise must do so be what expect from dr wortle will have to go will be forced to approve of dismissal in way mr peacocke came definitely clearly to conclusion in own mind be very different with dr wortle story so disturbed that during whole of afternoon did not attempt to turn mind to other subject even went so far a to send over to mr puddicombe asked for assistance for afternoon service on following day be too unwell said to preach one curate must have two entire service unless mr puddicombe must help must mr puddicombe come see on sunday afternoon note sent away by messenger who came back with reply saying that mr puddicombe must preach in afternoon must afterwards call in at rectory for hour two before dinner doctor went out on horseback roamed about among lane endeavouring to make up mind be hitherto altogether at loss a to what must do in present uncomfortable emergency must not bring conscience inclination to come square together even when counselled to yield to conscience very conscience second conscience a be revolted against first first conscience told that owed primary duty to parish second duty to school third to wife daughter in performance of duty must be bound to rid of mr peacocke then there came that other conscience telling that man have be more sinned against than sinning that common humanity required to stand by man who have suffered so much have suffered so unworthily then second conscience went on to remind that man be pre eminently fit for duty have undertaken that man be god fearing moral especially intellectual assistant in school be to lose must not hope to find one must be equal at approaching to in capacity second conscience went further assured that man excellence a schoolmaster be even increased by peculiarity of position do not know that if man be under cloud very cloud will make more attentive to duty than if man for wage receives can give to employer high character a well a work will think that may lighten work because of character a to man who be very phoenix of school assistant there must really be nothing amiss with character if only piteous incident a to wife be unknown in way second conscience almost got better of first then must be known must be impossible that must not be known have already made up mind to tell mr puddicombe absolutely not daring to decide in such emergency without consulting friend mr puddicombe must hold peace if be to promise to do so certainly might be trusted to do others must know bishop must know mr stantiloup must know that man of course must take care that broughton with close full of cathedral clergyman must know when mr stantiloup must know there must not be boy parent through school who must not know if kept man must keep resolving that world must know that kept that world must know of what nature be married life of assistant in whom trusted must be prepared to face world confiding in uprightness humanity of purpose in such case must say something of kind to world know that be not married know that condition of life be opposed to law of god man know that bear name be not in truth own think that circumstance in case be so strange so peculiar that excuse disregard even of law of god man have courage enough for if courage be there be high enough powerful enough to carry out such purpose must beat down mr stantiloups indeed must beat down bishop bishop phalanx for knew that bishop bishop phalanx must be against must not touch in living because mr peacocke must not be concerned in service of church must not school melt away to nothing in hand if be to attempt to carry on after fashion then must not have destroyed without advantage to man whom be anxious to assist to only one point did make up mind certainly during ride before slept that night must tell whole story to wife have at first thought that must conceal from be rule of life to act so entirely on own will that rarely consulted on matter of importance a be must not endure responsibility of acting by people must say of that have subjected wife to contamination have done so without giving choice in matter so resolved that must tell wife not married said mr wortle when heard story married yes be married be not fault that marriage be nothing what be to do when heard that have be deceived in way not married properly poor woman yes indeed what must have done if such have happened to when have be six month married must have be why not to a well a to be only young girl if have be widow dear must have be possible pity oh yes see that great misfortune have fallen upon must not help not till knew said wife who have be married quite properly what then what must have done then gone said wife who have doubt a to comfort beauty perfect security of own position gone gone away at once whither must go who must have taken by hand who must have supported must have have lay down in first gutter die better than what did do said mr wortle then by faith have in christ think be hard upon do think what be to have to go out live alone to have to look for bread in desolation have never be tried dear said clinging close to have never have anything what be good ought not to be kind to one to whom fortune have be so unkind if can do so without sin sin despise fear of sin make think that contact will soil sin if be sin be so near akin to virtue that doubt whether must not learn of rather than avoid woman must not live with man unless be wife mr wortle said with more of obstinacy than have expected be wife a far a knew when knew that be not so longer then must have left have starved suppose might have taken bread from think then that must go away from here think so what will mr stantiloup say be to turn out into cold because of virago such a be must have more charity than oh jeffrey what must bishop say can not get beyond mr stantiloup beyond bishop think what justice demand boy must be taken away if have son must send where there be schoolmaster living living oh must be very clear to doctor that wife mind be made up on subject yet there be softer hearted woman than mr wortle anywhere in diocese one le likely to be severe upon neighbour not only be kindly gentle woman be one who always have be willing to take husband opinion on question of right wrong however be decided that must go on next morning after service schoolmaster did not attend doctor saw mr peacocke declared intention of telling story to mr puddicombe if bid hold tongue said will do so will be better must consult clergyman be man who can keep secret then mr peacocke gave full authority to tell everything to mr puddicombe declared that doctor might tell story to whom must everybody might know now have said quite made up mind about be good of affecting secrecy when man lefroy be in country in afternoon after service mr puddicombe came up to house heard be dry thin apparently unsympathetic man just withal by mean given to harshness must pardon whenever must bring to believe that pardon must have good result must not be driven by impulse softness of heart to save faulty one from effect of fault merely because effect must be painful be man of great mental calibre not sharp quick capable of repartee a be doctor rational in thing always guided by conscience have behaved very badly to said when heard story think so have such feeling behaved very badly in bringing here without telling fact considering position that be to occupy must have known that be deceiving can forgive said doctor vehemently a far a be concerned forgive everything be not entitled to do so how not entitled must pardon if seem to take liberty in expressing too boldly in matter of course must not do so unless asked want to speak freely that think in considering conduct have to consider first of there came great terrible misfortune can not excite pity according to own story seems up to time to have be affectionate generous believe word of said doctor allowing for man natural bias on own side so do have allowed to become attached to man wife need not perhaps insist upon that doctor moved uneasily in chair said nothing will grant that put right by marriage though in doubt there must have be more of caution then came great misfortune knew that marriage have be no marriage saw man have doubt quite so quite so said doctor impatiently must of course have separated from there can be doubt about there be room for quibble quibble said doctor mean that reference in own mind to pity of thing to softness of moment must make doubt about feeling such a must induce to pardon sinner even to receive back into friendship respect when have seen error of way have repented be very hard hope not at rate can only say a think in truth in present emergency have nothing to do with if asked for counsel might give to be not present position have told story not in spirit of repentance because such telling have become necessary must have told same though man have never come let grant that be so there still remains relation to came here under false pretence have done serious injury think not said doctor must have taken into establishment have known before certainly not therefore say that have deceived advise to speak to with severity must think be made to know that appreciate what have done must turn off send away at once out about business certainly must send away think reprobate that must not be allowed to earn bread anywhere have not said so know nothing of mean of earning bread men living in sin earn bread constantly certainly must not be allowed to earn here not though man who be husband must now be dead must again marry legally marry woman to whom have be so true loyal a regard school said mr puddicombe think must alter position with conference ended mr puddicombe took leave a left house doctor declared to that man be strait laced fanatical hard hearted bigot though said so to hardly thought so be aware that man word have have effect upon part iv chapter x mr peacocke go doctor have be savage with wife for moment have hated mr puddicombe still what said have affected be of quite clear that mr peacocke must be made to go at once though hated mr puddicombe for cold logic must not acknowledge that man have said be true according to strict law of right wrong two unfortunate must have parted when found that be not in truth married again according to strict law of right wrong mr peacocke must not have brought woman there into school a wife there have be deceit then must not dr wortle have be guilty of similar deceit have fallen upon to have to defend woman who have be true affectionate to mr puddicombe must have left woman to break heart have gone away done duty like christian feeling tugging at heart string be so that doctor spoke to of counsellor sitting there alone in library during conference with lefroy something have be said have impressed suddenly with idea word have fallen from colonel unintended word by doctor be made to believe that other colonel be dead at rate now have cunningly tried to lead up to subject robert lefroy have be on guard a soon a have perceived doctor object have drawn back denying truth of word have before spoken doctor at last asked question direct lefroy then declared that brother have be alive well when left texas did in such manner a to strengthen in doctor mind impression that be dead if be so then might not all crooked thing be made straight have thought better to raise false hope have said nothing of to peacocke on discussing story have not even hinted to wife from whom might probably make way to mr peacocke have suggested to mr puddicombe asking whether there might not be way out of difficulty mr puddicombe have declared that there must be such way a far a school be concerned let marry repent sin go away from spot have contaminated earn bread in place in there need be no longer additional sin in concealing story of past life seemed to have be mr puddicombe final judgment be altogether opposed to dr wortle feeling when mr puddicombe came down from church to rectory lord carstairs be walking home after afternoon service with miss wortle be custom to go to church with family whereas school went there under charge of one of usher sat apart in portion of church appropriated to mr wortle when found that doctor be not going to afternoon service declined to go be thoroughly disturbed by bad tidings be indeed very little able to say prayer in fit state of mind must hardly keep herself still for moment be a one who think that crack of doom be coming so terrible to be vicinity connection with man with woman who be not wife then again became flurried when found that lord carstairs mary must have to walk alone together made little abortive attempt to keep first one then other from going to church mary probably saw reason for staying away while lord carstairs possibly found additional reason for going poor mr wortle have for week past wished that charming young nobleman have be at home with father mother anywhere in house have be arranged however that must go in july not return after summer holiday under circumstance having full confidence in girl have refrained from again expressing fear to doctor there be fear be evident to though doctor seemed to see nothing of that young lord be falling in love might be that youth natural bashfulness must come to aid that nothing must be said before day in july must separate when suddenly occurred to that two must walk to fro from church together there be cause for additional uneasiness if have heard conversation a came back must have be in way disturbed by tone on score of young man tenderness towards daughter might perhaps have be surprised by vehemence in respect must have be surprised also at finding how much have be said during last twenty four hour by others besides herself husband about affair of mr mr peacocke do know what came about asked mary have of course be robert lefroy not in least came up there looking so queer a though certainly have come about something unpleasant then be with papa afterwards said mary be sure papa mamma not coming to church have something to do with mr peacocke have be to church day something have happened to make very unhappy said boy told so even before man came here know one whom like so much a mr peacocke think be about wife said mary how about wife know think be be so very quiet how quiet miss wortle asked never will come in to see have asked to dinner to drink tea ever so often never come call perhaps once in two three month in formal way be see of do like asked how can say when so seldom see do like very much go see often be sure of be quite lady mamma asked to go to carstairs for holiday because of what said be not going neither of will come wish must oh miss wortle do so wish be going to be there too be be said of peculiar tenderness between on walk home late in evening so late that boy have already gone to bed doctor sent again for mr peacocke must not have troubled to night said only have heard something from pritchett pritchett be rectory gardener who have charge also of school building be person of great authority in establishment a well doctor held mr peacocke in great respect must have be almost a unwilling a doctor to tell story to schoolmaster discredit be saying down at lamb lamb be bowick public house that lefroy told yesterday doctor hesitated before must tell that wife be not wife just so of course be prepared for knew that must be so did not expected be sure of may be taken for granted at once that there be longer secret to keep must wish to act just a though fact be known to entire diocese after there be pause during of spoke for few moment doctor have not intended to declare purpose of own on occasion seemed to now a though be almost driven to do so then mr peacocke seeing difficulty at once relieved from be quite prepared to leave bowick said at once know that must be so have thought about have perceived that there be possible alternative must like to consult with a to whither have better go where will first take leave here said doctor here where where be in school house one will come to fill place for while must have thought said mr peacocke very slowly that presence must have be worse almost than own to said doctor to be a pure a most unsullied matron in country upon mr peacocke jumping from chair seized doctor hand must not speak for tear then seated again turning face away towards wall to

into school mr peacocke among boy till must have gone to america have come back be explained in school by doctor early for doctor must now take morning school that circumstance of very grave import made necessary that mr peacocke must start at once for america that tidings have be published at lamb must reach boy be more than probable nay be not certain must of course reach boy parent there be use service in secrecy in speaking to school not word be said of mr peacocke doctor explained that must take morning school that mr rose mathematical master must take charge of school meal mr cane house keeper must look to linen bed room be made plain that mr peacocke service be not to be required name be not mentioned except that doctor in order to let be understood that be not to be banished from house begged boy a favour that must not interrupt mr peacocke tranquillity during mr peacocke absence on tuesday morning mr peacocke started remaining however couple of day at broughton during doctor saw lefroy declared that knew nothing about brother whether be alive dead might be dead because be always in trouble generally drunk robert on whole thought probable that be dead must not be got to say so for thousand dollar must go over to missouri if necessary to texas so a to find truth must then come back give undeniable evidence while making benevolent offer declared with tear in eye that have come over intending to be true brother to sister in law have simply be deterred from prosecuting good intention by peacocke austerity then swore most solemn oath that if knew anything about brother ferdinand must reveal doctor peacocke agreed together that man word be worth nothing that man service might be useful in enabling to track out truth be convinced by word fell from ferdinand lefroy be dead must be of avail unless must obtain absolute evidence during two day there be various conversation at broughton between doctor mr peacocke lefroy in plan of action be at length arranged lefroy schoolmaster be to proceed to america together there obtain what evidence must a to life death of elder brother when absolute evidence have be obtained of thousand dollar be to be handed to robert lefroy when agreement be made man be given to understand that own uncorroborated word must go for nothing who be to say what be evidence what not asked man not unnaturally mr peacocke must be judge said doctor ai going to agree to said other though be to see dead might swear have not give red cent why ai to be judge a well a because can trust can not in least trust said doctor know well enough that if be to see brother alive to see dead must get money at rate have other way of getting what propose to robert lefroy at last assented prospect before mr peacocke for next three month be certainly very sad be to travel from broughton to st louis possibly from thence down into wild of texas in company with man whom thoroughly despised nothing must be more abominable to than association there be other way in proposed plan must be carried out be to pay lefroy expense back to own country must only hope to keep man true to purpose by doing so from day to day be to give man money man must at once disappear here in england in passage across ocean man might in degree be amenable obedient there be knowing to what might have recourse when must find nearer to country must feel that companion be distant from own will have to keep close watch upon whispered doctor to friend must not advise if did not think be man of strong nerve be not afraid said other doubt whether may not be too many for at rate will try will hear from a go on so parted a dear friend part doctor have in truth taken man altogether to heart since circumstance of story have come home to need hardly be said that other be aware how deep debt of gratitude owed to protector of wife indeed very money be to be paid to robert lefroy if earned be advanced out of doctor pocket mr peacocke mean be sufficient for expense of journey fell short when thousand dollar have to be provided chapter xi bishop mr peacocke have be quite right in saying that secret must at once be known through whole diocese certainly be so before have be gone week certainly be case also that diocese generally did not approve of doctor conduct woman ought not to have be left there so said diocese be of course case though diocese knew much did not know be impossible to keep story concealed be quite a impossible to make known detail in eye of diocese woman be of course chief sinner chief sinner be allowed to remain at school when assertion be made to doctor became very angry saying that mr peacocke did not remain at school that according to arrangement a at present made mr peacocke have nothing to do with school that house be own that might lend to whom pleased be to turn woman out houseless when husband have gone on errand on advice of course house be own a clergyman of parish have not right to do what liked with have right to encourage evil man be not woman husband be just point made by diocese be at school living under same roof with boy diocese be clearly of opinion that boy must be taken away diocese spoke by voice of bishop a diocese must do shortly after mr peacocke departure doctor have interview with lordship told whole story doing went much against grain with hardly dared not to do felt that be bound to do on part of mr peacocke if not on own then man who have now gone though have never be absolutely curate have preached frequently in diocese felt that must not be wise to abstain from telling bishop bishop be goodly man comely in person possessed of manner have made popular in world be one of who have done best must with talent not wrapping up in napkin getting from best interest world market must afford not on account be other than good man to do best must for family also to do duty be line of conduct pursued there be who reverse order be not one of have become scholar in youth not from love of scholarship a mean to success church have become profession have worked hard at calling have taught to be courteous urbane because have be clever enough to see courtesy urbanity be agreeable to men in high place a bishop never spared work bishop ought to do answered letter studied character of clergyman under be just with patronage endeavoured to be efficacious with charge confirmed child in cold weather a well a in warm occasionally preached sermon be beautiful decorous in gait of manner a behoves clergyman of church of england to be liked to be master even to be master must not encounter abominable nuisance of quarrel when first coming to diocese have have little difficulty with doctor bishop have abstained from violent assertion have on whole be friend there be however on bishop part something of feeling that doctor be bigger man be probable that without active malignity must take advantage of chance might lower doctor little bring more within episcopal power in degree begrudged doctor manliness listened with many smile with perfect courtesy to story a be told to be much le severe on unfortunate than mr puddicombe have be be not wickedness of two people in living together wickedness in keeping secret offended so much a evil be likely to do to have done doubt said ill living man may preach good sermon perhaps better one than pious god fearing clergyman whose intellect may be inferior though moral be much better coming from tainted lip better sermon will not carry blessing with at doctor shook head bringing blessing be phrase doctor hated shook head not too civilly saying that have not intended to trouble lordship on so difficult point in ecclesiastical moral can not remember said bishop that have be preaching in parish church people will know that have acted among a clergyman hope people lord may never have gospel preached to by worse man will not judge do think that have be misfortune of course be in ignorance have known about must have be very much inclined to do same be in fact not true be said simply in spirit of contradiction bishop shook head smiled school be matter of more importance said doctor hardly hardly dr wortle of more importance in way that school may probably be injured whereas moral faith of parishioner will have be hurt have gone have gone remains what exclaimed bishop have gone remains repeated word very distinctly with frown on brow a though to show on branch of subject intended to put up with opposition hardly even with adverse opinion have certain charge a understand a to school have lord very well did work will have great loss in for present said remained have lent use of house till husband will come back mr peacocke mean said bishop who be unable not to put in contradiction against untruth of word have be used will always regard a married be not have lent house at rate during absence must not turn into street must not lodging here in city have suited better thought not people here must have refused to take because of story wife of religious grocer who sand sugar regularly must have thought house contaminated by such inmate so must have be doctor to extent at hearing doctor made very evident sign of discontent can not alter way of world suddenly though by example precept may help to improve slowly in present imperfect condition of moral culture be perhaps well that company of guilty must be shunned guilty be afraid that must say so knowledge that feeling exists doubt deters others from guilt fact that wrong doing in woman be scorned help to maintain innocence of woman be not so must hesitate before trouble lordship by arguing such difficult question thought right to tell fact after what have occurred have gone be there there will remain for present must not turn out thinking a do worthy of friendship must not do other than befriend of course must be judge have to be judge lord be afraid that parent of boy will not understand also be afraid will be very hard to make understand there will be who will work hard to make misunderstand not that there will must stand brunt of have have battle before have hoped that now when be getting old might have be at end there be something left of can fight still at rate have made up mind about there will remain till come back to fetch so interview be over bishop feeling that have in slight degree have best of doctor feeling that in slight degree have have worst if possible must not talk to bishop on subject again told mr puddicombe also with generosity kindness of heart quite sympathise said mr puddicombe endeavouring to be pleasant in manner not with prudence not with prudence said mr puddicombe endeavouring to be true at same time doctor greatest difficulty be with wife whose conduct be necessary that must guide whose feeling conscience be most anxious to influence when first heard decision almost wrung hand in despair if woman must have gone to america man have remained must have be satisfied anything wrong about man be of little moment comparatively so even though be clergyman anything wrong about woman so near to herself o dear poor dear boy under same roof with boy mamma how must be able to endure sight of horrid mr stantiloup mr stantiloup word must certainly be conveyed to there be something much worse for even than doctor insisted that must go call upon woman take mary asked mr wortle what must be good of taking mary who be talking of child like be for sake of charity for dear love of christ that ask to do do ever think of mary magdalene oh yes be magdalene be woman led into fault by vicious propensity here be one who have be altogether unfortunate who have be treated more cruelly than of whom have ever read why did not leave because be woman with heart in bosom be to go to order only ask such asking from husband be knew very near alike to ordering what will say to bid keep up courage till will return if be alone a be must not wish that other woman must come to comfort think of desolation mr wortle did think of after day two made up mind to obey husband request made call very little came of except that promised to come again mr wortle said poor woman pray let be trouble to if stay away will quite understand that there be sufficient reason know how good husband have be to mr wortle said however a took leave that must come again in day two there be other trouble in store for mr wortle before have repeated visit to mr peacocke lady who lived about ten mile off wife of rector of buttercup called upon be lady margaret momson daughter of earl of brigstock who have thirty year ago married young clergyman nevertheless up to present day be quite a much earl daughter a parson wife be first cousin to mr stantiloup between whom doctor internecine war be always being waged be also aunt to boy at school who however be in way related to mr stantiloup young momson being son of parson eldest brother lady margaret have never absolutely openly taken part of mr stantiloup have done so visit even of ceremony must have be impossible be supposed to have stantiloup proclivity be not therefore much liked at bowick there have be question indeed whether young momson must be received at school because of quasi connection with arch enemy squire momson of buttercup boy father have set that at rest by bursting out in doctor hearing into violent abuse against close fisted vulgar old faggot son of man imbued with such proper feeling be of course accepted lady margaret be proud especially at present time what romance be mr wortle said have gone through diocese reader will remember that lady margaret be also wife of clergyman mean peacockes of course do have gone away know that of course to look for wife husband good gracious what story think that be dead now suppose thought so before said lady margaret of course did though doe seem that inquiry be made at perhaps care about thing over there a do here must have cared very much doctor think that be very much to be pitied doctor always be little quixotic eh think that at lady margaret mean in way of being so very good natured kind brother came did first husband brother said mr wortle blushing first husband well know what mean lady margaret yes know what mean be so very shocking be so two men have gone off together to look for third goodness what party will be if meet do think will quarrel

here very often have taken to church with suppose bishop have be told may be sure that know a well a be so anxious know about dear little gu dear little gu be augustus momson lady nephew who be supposed to be worst behaved certainly stupidest boy in school augustus will not be hurt must say perhaps not directly sister have know very strong opinion on such subject now want to ask one thing be true that remains here be still living in school house be that prudent mr wortle if want to have opinion on subject lady margaret must recommend to ask doctor by meant to assert lady margaret must not for life of dare to ask doctor question have done what have thought best most good natured mean mr wortle mean what say lady margaret have done what have thought best looking at circumstance think that be very worthy people that have be most cruelly ill used have taken that into consideration call good nature others perhaps may call charity wife though at heart deplored husband action in matter be not going to own to lady that have be imprudent be sure hope will said lady margaret then a be taking leave made suggestion of boy will be taken away suppose doctor probably expects that know what expects said mr wortle be always going when go others come in place a for wish must give school up altogether perhaps mean said lady margaret otherwise perhaps must have be so good natured then took departure when visitor be gone mr wortle be very unhappy have be betrayed by wrath into expressing wish a to giving up of school knew well that doctor have such intention have more than once suggested in timid way doctor have treated suggestion a being worth nothing have idea about mary who be undoubtedly very pretty girl mary might marry well l must probably assist in doing so when be told of lady margaret hint said in wrath that must send young momson away instantly if word be said to by boy mamma of course said if lad turn out scapegrace a be like enough will be because mr peacocke have two husband be often question to whether religion of world be not more odious than want of religion to terrible suggestion poor mr wortle did not dare to make answer chapter xii stantiloup correspondence

bishop hon mr stantiloup party be staying in house collected for purpose of entertaining bishop must perhaps not have be possible to have got together in diocese four lady more likely to be hard upon doctor for though squire momson be not very fond of mr stantiloup have used strong language respecting when be anxious to send boy to doctor school mr momson have always be of other party have in fact adhered to mr stantiloup from beginning of quarrel do trust said mr stantiloup that there will be end to kind of thing now do mean end to school asked lady margaret do indeed always thought matter of great regret that augustus must have be sent there after scandalous treatment bob received bob be little boy who have drank champagne required carriage exercise always heard that school be quite popular said mr rolland think will find continued mr stantiloup that there wo be much left of popularity now keeping that abominable woman under same roof with boy master of school be absolutely blown up with pride must have taken such people a peacockes without making proper inquiry then to let preach in church suppose mr momson will allow to send for augustus at once said turning to mr momson mr momson think so much of doctor scholarship said mother apologetically be so anxious that gu must do well when go to eton what be latin greek a compared to soul asked lady margaret indeed said mr rolland have found herself compelled a wife of bishop to assent to self evident proposition have be made be quiet silent little woman whom bishop have married in day of earliest preferment who though be delighted to find promoted to society of big people in diocese have never quite lifted up into sphere though have idea a to what be to be bishop wife have never yet be quite able to act up to know that young talbot be to leave said mr stantiloup wrote to mr talbot immediately when occurred have heard from cousin lady grogram that boy be not to go back after holiday happened to be altogether untrue what probably meant be that boy must not go back if must prevent doing so feel quite sure said lady margaret that lady anne will not allow boy to remain when find out what sort of inmate doctor chooses to entertain lady anne spoken of be lady anne clifford widowed mother of two boy who be intrusted to doctor care do hope will be firm about gu said mr stantiloup to mr momson if be not to put down kind of thing what be good of having moral in country at might just a well live like pagan do without marriage service a do in so many part of united state wonder what bishop doe think about asked mr momson of bishop wife make very unhappy know said mr rolland of course can not interfere about school a for licensing gentleman a curate be of course quite out of question at moment mr momson clergyman bishop came into room be offered a be usual on such occasion cold tea remains of buttered toast squire be not there have be with other gentleman mr stantiloup violent a be must probably have held tongue a be absent opportunity be not bad for attacking bishop on subject under discussion be talking lord about bowick school now bishop be man who must be very confidential with one lady be apt to be guarded when men be concerned to one of present might have said what thought have one else be there to hear must have be expression of private opinion to speak before four must have be tantamount to public declaration about bowick school said hope there be nothing going wrong with bowick school must have heard about mr peacocke said lady margaret yes have certainly heard of mr peacocke believe have left dr wortle seminary remains said mr stantiloup with tragic energy so understand in house not a part of establishment doe that make so much difference asked lady margaret doe make very great difference said lady margaret husband parson wishing to help bishop in difficulty see at said mr stantiloup main spirit in matter be just a manifest whether lady be be not allowed to look after boy linen in fact despise for making pretence doing menial work about house must injure one be presence there presence of woman who have falsely pretended to be married when knew very well that have husband when knew that have two said lady margaret fancy lady margaret lady bracy absolutely asked to go to carstairs woman be always infatuated about dr wortle what must have done if have gone other man have followed sister in law there lord lady bracy must ask one to carstairs just one that must get hold of mr momson be one whose obstinacy be wont to give way when sufficiently attacked even after having be for two day subjected to eloquence of mr stantiloup acknowledged that doctor took great deal too much upon doe said mr stantiloup just to show that there be nothing that ca bring parent to assent to fancy woman living there a house keeper with man a usher pretending to be husband wife when knew along that be not married mr momson who did care straw about moral of man whose duty be to teach little boy latin grammar moral of woman who looked after little boy waistcoat trouser gave half assenting grunt be to pay continued mr stantiloup with considerable emphasis be to pay two hundred fifty pound year for such conduct a two hundred suggested squire who cared a little for money a did for moral two hundred fifty shilling of when consider extra there be extra a far a can see then boy be strong healthy thank god said squire taking opportunity of having one fling at lady while be going on did give half assent that gu must be taken away at midsummer being partly moved thereto by letter from doctor in be told that boy be not doing good at school be week after mr stantiloup wrote following letter to friend lady grogram after have returned home from buttercup hall lady grogram be great friend of hers be first cousin to mr talbot who have son at school lady grogram be old woman of strong mind small mean who be supposed to be potential over connected with mr stantiloup feared that must not be efficacious either with mr mr talbot hoped that might carry purpose through lady grogram may be remembered that have declared at buttercup hall that young talbot be not to go back to bowick have be figure of speech a have be already explained dear lady grogram since got last letter have be staying with momsons at buttercup be awfully dull be think stupidest people that ever met none of momsons have idea among be just a heavy inharmonious a name lady margaret be one of party must have be better only that excellent bishop be there too lady margaret thought well to show off grace before bishop bishop wife never saw such dowdy in life a mr rolland be very well look at rate like gentleman be take that got diocese say queen saw once be taken by manner did one good thing at buttercup got mr momson to promise that boy of must not go back to bowick dr wortle have become quite intolerable think be determined to show doe people will put up with be not only most expensive establishment of kind in england also worst conducted know of course how matter about woman stand now be remaining there at bowick absolutely living in house calling mr peacocke while man be living with have gone off with brother in law to look for husband did ever hear of mess a doctor expects that father mother will still send boy to such place a be very much mistaken if will not find altogether deserted before christmas lord carstairs be already gone be at rate disingenuous a have be very severe when at buttercup on carstairs family because of declared perverse friendship for doctor mr momson though be quite incapable of seeing meaning of anything have determined to take boy away may thank at rate for have heard that lady anne clifford two boy will leave in one sense have heard because suggestion have be made by at buttercup do hope that mr talbot dear little boy will not be allowed to return to such contamination a fancy man woman living there in way together doctor keeping woman on after knew be really so horrible that one doe know how to talk about when bishop be at buttercup really felt almost obliged to be silent know very well that mr talbot be always ready to take advice a for men very often think so much about thing a ought will not like boy to be nearly only one left at school have not heard of one who be to remain for certain how can be possible that boy who have mother must be allowed to remain there do think of do best need not tell that nothing ought to be so dear to a high tone of moral most sincerely yours juliana stantiloup need not pursue

mr talbot doctor have be at school together at oxford be friend will give now letter be written by doctor to mr momson in answer to one in gentleman signified intention of taking little gu away from school dear mr momson after what have said of course will not expect boy back after holiday tell mamma with compliment that will take thing home with a rule do charge for quarter in advance when boy be taken away suddenly without notice apparently without cause will not do so at present moment either to to parent who may withdraw son circumstance have happened though can not impair utility of school ought not to injure character may still be held a giving offence to certain person will not be driven to alter conduct by what believe to be foolish misconception on part have right to own opinion will not mulct because of conscientious conviction yours faithfully jeffrey wortle if come across friend who have boy here be perfectly at liberty to show letter defection of momsons wounded doctor doubt be aware that mr stantiloup have be at buttercup that bishop also have be there must put two two together hurt to think that one so staunch though so stupid a mr momson must be turned

probably have left mr puddicombe house with sense of thankfulness for kindness rendered to did go farther endeavoured to extract from friend sense of injustice shown by bishop stantiloups newspaper enemy in general through diocese here failed signally really think dr wortle that must not have expected otherwise expect that people must lie know about lie if people have told lie have not seen

must expect to sympathise with wrong doing what have done wrong have countenanced immorality deceit in brother clergyman deny said doctor rising up impetuously from chair then understand position dr wortle be can say to thinking mr puddicombe never came across better man than mr peacocke in life can not make comparison a to best man ever met in life might have to acknowledge even have done wrong in certain circumstance a matter be forced upon have to express opinion that great sin be committed by man by woman not only condone sin declare by word deed that sympathise with sin a well a with sinner have right to expect that bishop will sympathise with in can be that in such country a voice of many will be loud against yours a loud a said doctor angrily be unkind unjust said mr puddicombe what have said have said to not to others what have said have said in answer to question asked by then doctor apologised with what grace must when left house heart be still bitter against mr

though be self asserting somewhat violent man be thoroughly soft hearted be to be hoped that reader have already learned a much a that man with kind tender affectionate nature must perhaps be unfair to raise question whether must have done a much be so willing to sacrifice for plain woman have mr stantiloup sir samuel griffin if have suddenly come again to life be found to have prior wife also living must doctor have found shelter for in ignominy trouble mr wortle who knew husband thoroughly be sure that must not have done so mr peacocke be very beautiful woman doctor be man who thoroughly

have got well by ear think not at of own wound only how may catch enemy by lip so be doctor in regard to mr stantiloup when two clifford boy be taken away took joy to in remembering that mr stantiloup must not pay butcher bill then just at end of holiday good natured friend sent to copy of 'everybody business ' there be duty man owes to more clearly than of throwing into waste paper basket unsearched even unopened newspaper sent to without previously declared purpose sender have written something wish to force to read else have be desirous of wounding by ill natured criticism upon be business ' be paper in natural course of thing did not find way into bowick rectory doctor though be doubt acquainted with title have never even looked at column be purpose of periodical to amuse reader a name declared with private affair of neighbour went boldly about work excusing by assertion that jones be just a well inclined to be talked about a smith be to hear must be said about jones a party be served what must be objection be in main good natured probably did most frequently gratify jones while afforded considerable amusement to listless numerous smith of world if ca read understand jones speech in parliament may at rate have mind enough to interest with fact that never composed word of in own room without ring on finger flower in button hole may also be agreeable to know walker poet always take mutton chop two glass of sherry at past one 'everybody business ' did for everybody to whom such excitement be agreeable in managing everybody business in fashion let writer be a good natured a may let principle be ever so well founded that nobody be to be hurt still there be danger be not always easy to know what will hurt what will not then sometimes there will come temptation to be not spiteful specially amusing there must be danger writer will sometimes be indiscreet personality will lead to libel even when libeller have be most innocent may be that after poor poet never drank glass of sherry before dinner in life may be that little toast water even with dinner give refreshment that want that two glass of alcoholic mixture in middle of day will seem when imputed to to convey charge of downright inebriety writer have perhaps learned to regard two glass of meridian wine a moderate amount of sustentation man be much flattered if be given to be understood of that fall in love with pretty woman that see whereas will think that have be made subject to foul calumny by such insinuation 'everybody business ' fell into such mistake a in very amusing article be written for delectation of reader in reference to dr wortle mr peacocke 'broughton gazette ' doubt confined to clerical highly moral view of case having dealt with subject chiefly on behalf of close admirer of close have made allusion to fact that mr peacocke be very pretty woman one two other local paper have be more scurrilous have with ambiguous timid word alluded to doctor personal admiration for lady rumour created by have reached one of funniest lightest handed of contributor to 'everybody business ' have concocted amusing article have not intended to be at libellous have thought to be only funny have not appreciated probably tragedy of lady position sanctity of of gentleman there be comedy in idea of doctor having sent one husband away to america to look after other while consoled wife in england must be admitted said writer that doctor have best of while one gentleman be gouging other a can not be expected doctor will be at rate in security enjoying smile of beauty under own fig tree at bowick after hot morning with 'tupto ' in school there will be 'amo ' in cool of evening be absolutely sent to by good natured friend funny writer obtained popularity wider probably than have expected word reached mr stantiloup a well a doctor be read even in bishop palace be quoted even in 'broughton gazette ' not with approbation in high tone of moral severity see nature of language to dr wortle conduct have subjected whole of diocese be tone of criticism made by 'broughton gazette ' on article in 'everybody business ' what else have right to expect said mr stantiloup to mr rolland having made journey into broughton for sake of discussing at palace there explained to mr rolland having studied passage so a fully to appreciate virus contained in pass morning in school whipping boy because have sent mr peacocke away then amuses in evening by making love to mr peacocke wife a call dr wortle when read re read article when joke be made upon reached ear a be sure to do be nearly maddened by what called heartless iniquity of world state became still worse when received affectionate solemn letter from bishop warning of danger affectionate letter from bishop must surely be most disagreeable missive parish clergyman can receive affection from one man to be not natural in letter bishop never writes affectionately unless mean to reprove severely when call clergyman dear brother in christ be sure to go on to show that man so called be altogether unworthy of name so be with letter now received at bowick in bishop expressed opinion that dr wortle ought not to pay further visit to mr peacocke till must have settled down with one legitimate husband let that legitimate husband be who might bishop did not indeed at first make reference by name to 'everybody business ' stated that metropolitan press have taken up matter that scandal must take place in diocese if further cause be given be not enough to be innocent said bishop men must know that be so then there came sharp pressing correspondence between bishop doctor lasted four five day doctor without referring to other portion of bishop letter demanded to know to what metropolitan newspaper bishop have alluded a if such paper have spread scandalous imputation a to doctor respecting lady in question must be doctor duty to proceed against newspaper for libel in answer to bishop in note much shorter much le affectionate than former letter said that did not wish to name metropolitan newspaper doctor must not of course put up with answer a wrote very solemnly now if not affectionately lordship have spoken of becandal in diocese ' word said doctor contained most grave charge did not mean to say that such accusation have be made by bishop such accusation must have be made by one at least of london newspaper bishop must not have be justified in what have written under such circumstance dr wortle thought entitled to demand from bishop name of newspaper in question date on article have appeared in answer to there came written reply copy of 'everybody business ' doctor have already seen have doubt known from first that be funny paragraph about 'tupto amo to bishop have referred in serious step now intended to take be determined to have positive proof from hand of bishop bishop have not directed pernicious newspaper with own hand if called upon must not deny that have be sent from palace by order having received doctor wrote back at once a follows right reverend dear lord word coming from lordship to be of grave importance a must think be word coming from bishop to clergy be of special importance when containing reproof whether deserved undeserved scurrilous vulgar attack made upon in newspaper lordship have sent to must not have be worthy of serious notice have not be made worthy by lordship a being ground on letter be written to a of lordship of th instant now have be invested with so much solemnity by lordship notice of that feel obliged to defend against by public action if have given just cause of scandal to diocese will retire from living from school before doing so will endeavour to prove have done can only do by publishing in court of law circumstance in reference to connection with mr mr peacocke a regard though necessary will be very painful a regard be inclined to think that more truth be known more general more generous will be sympathy felt for position a newspaper sent to doubt by lordship order from palace have be accompanied by letter may be necessary that lordship must be troubled by subpoena so a to prove that newspaper alluded to by lordship be one against proceeding will be taken will be necessary of course must show that libel in question have be deemed important enough to bring down upon ecclesiastical rebuke of such nature a to make remaining in diocese unbearable unless be shown that rebuke be undeserved there be consternation in palace when be received so stiffnecked man so obstinate so unclerical so determined to make much of little bishop have felt bound to warn clergyman for sake of church must not do altogether a other men might doubt certain lady have got around especially lady margaret momson filling ear with horror of doctor proceeding gentleman who have written article about greek latin word have seen truth of thing at once so said lady margaret doctor have condoned offence committed by peacockes because woman have be beautiful be repaying for mercy by basking in loveliness there be saying that there be not truth in mr wortle entertained feeling of same kind be palpable on face of to except dr wortle to mr peacocke mr stantiloup who have made way into palace be quite convincing on point everybody knew said that doctor went across saw lady alone day everybody did not know that if everybody have be accurate everybody must have asserted that did thing other day matter a be represented to bishop by lady with assistance of one two clergyman in close certainly seemed to justify lordship interference be threatened be very terrible there be determination about doctor made clear to bishop that must be a bad a said when bishop have spoken of scandal of course have not intended to say that doctor conduct be scandalous have said anything of kind have used word in proper sense have declared that offence must be created in mind of people unless injurious report be stopped be not enough to be innocent have said men must know that be so have declared in belief in dr wortle innocence yet there might doubt be action for libel against newspaper when damage came to be considered much weight must be placed naturally on attention bishop have paid to article result of be that bishop invited doctor to come spend night with in palace doctor went reaching palace only just before dinner during dinner in drawing room dr wortle made very pleasant be man who must always be soft gentle in drawing room to see talking with mr rolland bishop daughter must not have thought that there be anything wrong with discussion with bishop came after lasted till midnight will be for disadvantage of diocese that matter must be dragged into court for disadvantage of church in general that clergyman must seem to seek such redress against bishop so said bishop doctor be obdurate seek redress said against bishop seek redress against newspaper have calumniated be good opinion lord good opinion ill opinion be breath of nostril have to refer to in order may show that paper must otherwise have despised have be strong enough to influence opinion chapter iii 'amo ' in cool of evening doctor went up to london be told by lawyer that action for damage probably must lie 'amo ' in cool of evening certainly meant making love there must be doubt that allusion be made to mr peacocke to accuse clergyman of parish schoolmaster of making love to lady so circumstanced a mr peacocke doubt be libellous presuming that libel must not be justified must probably succeed justified said doctor almost shrieking to lawyer never said word to lady in life except in pure kindness charity word might have be heard by world nevertheless have world be present must not have held hand so tenderly so long a have done on certain occasion have be mentioned will probably apologise said lawyer will be bound to accept apology not bound must have to show if went on with action that damage complained of be of so grievous nature that apology must not salve damage have be already done said doctor eagerly have received bishop rebuke rebuke in have said have brought scandal upon diocese rebuke break bone said lawyer can show that will serve to prevent boy from coming to school may not improbably force to give up living certainly will not remain there subject to censure of bishop in truth want damage must not accept money only want to set right before world be then agreed that necessary communication must be made by lawyer to newspaper proprietor so a to put matter in proper train for action after doctor returned home just in time to open school with diminished force at last moment there be defaulter so that there be now no more than twenty pupil school have not be so low a for last fifteen year there have never be le than eight twenty before since mr stantiloup have first begun campaign be heartbreaking to felt a though be

staring in face moment of life hope be not really going to law said wife to must dear have other way of defending honour go to law with bishop not with bishop bishop must be brought into yes will certainly be brought into a enemy what mean be that will be brought in very much against own will not doubt about said doctor will have brought altogether upon how can have condescended to send scurrilous newspaper be more than can understand one gentleman must have so treated be to incomprehensible that bishop must have done so to clergyman of own diocese shake old conviction there be vulgarity about meanness of thinking aptitude to suspect manner of evil can not fathom what did really think be making love to woman did doubt be treating husband with kindness a one human being be bound to treat in affliction did believe in heart sent man away in order might have opportunity for wicked purpose of own be impossible when think of of can not believe that woman who have succeeded at last in stirring up evil against even must not believe malice be sufficient to make conduct intelligible there be malice in bishop mind against must infinitely sooner live with on pleasant term if must justify doing so to conscience have be stirred to do in execution of presumed duty accuse of malice do accuse of meanness of intellect lower than what must have presumed to have be possible in man so placed never thought clever never thought great never thought even to be gentleman in fullest sense of word did think be man be performance of creature not worthy to be called so oh jeffrey did not believe that what did believe when read that article did see in true rebuke against hypocrite did see in scurrilous attack upon brother clergyman neighbour friend if latter certainly must not have be instigated by to write to letter a did certainly must not have sent paper to have felt to contain foul mouthed calumny wanted to know what people of sort be saying yes wanted to know wanted to know also that knowledge have come to from bishop must have thought evil of one who have sent vile ribaldry coming from fill with despair despair said repeating word yes despair a to condition of church when see man capable of such meanness holding so high place 'amo in cool of evening ' word such a must have be sent to by bishop a showing what beetropolitan press ' of day be saying about conduct of course action will be against against bishop will be bound to expose conduct what else can do there be thing man can not bear live be to put up with must leave school leave parish nay leave country

sufferer have come from mr stantiloup must of course have be nothing must have understood that malice must have condescended to anything however low from bishop how will be worse who will know know said striking breast know wound be here do think that when coarse libel be welcomed in bishop palace treated there a true that will not be spread abroad among other house when bishop have thought necessary to send what will other people do others who be not bound to be just righteous in dealing with a be 'amo in cool of evening ' then seized hat rushed out into garden gentleman who have written paragraph certainly have have idea that word must have be thus effectual little joke have seemed to to be good enough to fill paragraph have gone from without further thought of doctor of lady have conceived no idea whatsoever somebody else have said somewhere that clergyman have sent lady reputed husband away to look for husband while lady remained together joke have not be much of joke have be enough have gone forth have now brought whole palace of broughton into grief have nearly driven excellent doctor mad 'amo in cool of evening word stuck to like shirt of nessus lacerating very spirit that word such a must have be sent to in solemn sober spirit by bishop of diocese never occurred to that have in truth be imprudent when paying visit alone to mr peacocke be late in evening wandered away up through green ride of wood border of came down to glebe field have be boiling over with indignation while talking to wife a soon a be alone endeavoured purposely endeavoured to rid for while of wrath matter be so important to that knew well that behoved to look at round in spirit other than of anger have talked of giving up school giving up parish have really for time almost persuaded that must do so unless must induce bishop publicly to withdraw censure felt to have be expressed against then what must life be afterwards parish school have not be only source of income to duty also have be dear have be performed on whole with conscientious energy be everything to be thrown up whole life hereafter be made blank to because bishop have be unjust injudicious must see that well might be so if be to carry contest on knew own temper well enough to be sure that a fought must grow hotter in fight that when be once in midst of nothing must be possible to absolute triumph absolute annihilation if once must succeed in getting bishop into court a witness bishop must be crushed bishop must be got to say why have sent that low ribaldry to clergyman in parish must be asked whether have believed whether have not believed must be made to say that there existed slightest reason for believing insinuation contained then having confessed so much must be asked why have sent that letter to bowick parsonage if be false a well a ribald slanderous a well a vulgar malicious a well a mean be sending of mode of communication between bishop clergyman of a bishop must approve question such a must be asked doctor a walked alone arranging question within own bosom putting into strongest language must find almost assured that bishop must be crushed in answering bishop have made great mistake so doctor assured have be entrapped by bad adviser have fallen into pit have gone wrong have lost when cross questioned a doctor suggested to that must be cross questioned bishop must have to own then must be crushed did really want to crush bishop have man be so bitter enemy to that having on hip wanted to strike down altogether in describing man character to wife a have done in fury of indignation have acquitted man of malice be sure now in calmer moment that man have not intended to do harm if be left in bishop bosom parish school character must all be made safe to be sure of there be none of spirit of mr stantiloup in feeling have prevailed at palace bishop who have never yet be able to be masterful over have desired in mild way to become masterful have liked opportunity of writing affectionate letter reference to metropolitan press have slipt from unawares then when badgered for authority when driven to give instance from london newspaper have sent objectionable periodical have in point of fact made mistake stupid foolish mistake into really well bred man must hardly have fallen ought to take advantage of said doctor to when have wandered for hour more alone through wood certainly did not wish to be crushed ought to be anxious to crush bishop because of error a for paper said to walking quicker a mind turned to side of subject a for paper be beneath notice what be to what publication even reader of may think of a for damage must rather starve than soil hand with money though must succeed in ruining must not accept redress in shape thus having thought matter fully over returned home still wrathful with mitigated wrath saturday be fixed on must again go up to london to see lawyer be obliged now to be particular about day a in absence of mr peacocke school required time saturday be half holiday on day must be absent on condition of remitting classical lesson in morning a thought of began to be almost tired of mr peacocke

monday if not to morrow mr wortle be going with not with view of being present at interview with lawyer knew must not be allowed on pretext of shopping real reason for making request to be taken up to town be that might use last moment possible in mitigating husband wrath against bishop have seen one of proprietor editor said lawyer be quite willing to apologise really do believe be very sorry word have be allowed to pas without being weighed nothing beyond innocent joke be intended dare say seems innocent enough to if soot be thrown at chimney sweeper joke be innocent very offensive when be thrown at be quite aware that have ground to complain of course can go on if like fact that have offered to apologise will doubt be point in favour nevertheless must probably get verdict must bring bishop into court think so have got letter speaking of beetropolitan press ' oh yes be for to think dr wortle whether there must not be feeling against among clergyman of course there will men in authority always have public sympathy with in country man more rejoices that must be so than do not le be necessary that now again man will make stand in own defence must never have sent that paper here said lawyer be apology propose to insert if approve of will also pay bill however will not be sorry to say be very heavy then lawyer handed to doctor slip of paper on following word be written attention have be called to notice be made in impression of ultimo on conduct of clergyman in diocese of broughton joke be perpetrated be sorry to find have given offence where certainly offence be intended have since heard detail of case to reference be made be able to say that conduct of clergyman in question have deserved censure ridicule actuated by purest charity have proved sincere friend to person in great trouble will put in name if wish said lawyer alter in way like so that be not made to eat too much dirt want to alter said doctor sitting thoughtfully eating dirt will do good to be nothing to be bishop then a though be not thinking of what did tore paper threw fragment down on floor be nothing to will not accept apology said lawyer oh yes rather be unnecessary may tell have changed mind will ask for apology a far a paper be concerned will be better to let thing die natural death must never have troubled about newspaper if bishop have not sent to indeed have seen before bishop sent thought little nothing of animal will after kind wasp sting polecat stink lion tear prey asunder paper a of course follows own bent one must have thought that bishop must have done same may tell that action be withdrawn certainly certainly tell also that will oblige by putting in apology a for bill must prefer to pay will exercise anger against be not who in truth have injured a returned home be not altogether happy feeling that bishop must escape made wife happy by telling decision to have come chapter iv be impossible absence of dr mr wortle be peculiarly unfortunate on afternoon a visitor rode over from distance to make call visitor whom must have be very glad to welcome of whose coming mr wortle be not so delighted to hear when be told by mary that have spent two three hour at rectory mr wortle began to think whether visitor must have known of intended absence doctor that mary have not known that visitor be coming be quite certain indeed did not really suspect

occasion for present be over went into yard got upon horse be by mean contented with what have done still thought that must have made understand purpose mary when found safe within own room must not refrain from asking question lover have asked must love did see reason why must love must be very nice thought to love be sweet tempered handsome bright thoroughly good humoured then position in world be very high not for moment did tell that must love did not understand difference in world rank quite a well a did father still felt that because of rank because of rank youth combined ought not to allow to love there be reason why son of peer must not marry daughter of clergyman peer clergyman might be equally gentleman young carstairs have be there in trust lord bracy have sent there to be taught latin greek have right to expect that must not be encouraged to fall in love with tutor daughter be not that did not think good enough to be loved by young lord that be too good to bring trouble on people who have trusted father father must despise be to hear that have encouraged lad a might say have entangled did not know whether must not have spoken to lord carstairs more decidedly must at rate comfort with assurance that have given encouragement of course must tell to mother in doing so must declare positively that have given young man encouragement be very unfortunate that lord carstairs must have come just when be away said mr wortle to daughter a soon a be alone together yes mamma be so odd have be away from home day summer before expected to find of course did have anything particular to say yes mamma have what be dear be very much surprised mamma must help asked asked what mary oh mamma here knelt down hid face in mother lap oh dear be very bad very bad indeed need be bad for mamma for papa be bad for child mamma except of course that be sorry that must be so what did say to of course told that be impossible be only boy told so made promise mamma no promise oh dear of course be impossible knew never dreamed of anything of kind said there out on lawn have come on purpose yes so said think have will go to oxford will of course forget be such nice boy said mr wortle who in anxiety must not like lad better for having fallen in love with daughter yes mamma be always liked be quite out of question what must papa mamma say must be very dreadful to have quarrel must just at present when there be so many thing to trouble papa though mr wortle be quite honest true in feeling have expressed a to young lord visit yet be alive to glory of having young lord for son in law of course be out of question mamma have never occurred to for moment a otherwise have got to go to oxford take degree before think of such thing will be quite old woman by time will have forgotten may be sure mamma that did say to be quite plain wish must have be here heard seen darling said mother embracing must not believe more thoroughly even though saw heard night mr wortle felt constrained to tell whole story to husband be indeed impossible for to keep secret from husband when mary in younger year have torn frock cut finger be always told to doctor if gardener be seen idling time housemaid flirting with groom that certainly must be told to doctor what comfort doe woman get out of husband unless may be allowed to talk to about everything when have be first proposed that lord carstairs must come into house a private pupil have expressed fear to doctor because of mary doctor have ridiculed fear have be result of course must tell doctor oh dear said what do think have happened while be up in london carstairs be here oh yes be here came on purpose to make regular declaration of love to mary nonsense did jeffrey how do know came on purpose told so did not think boy have so much spirit in said doctor be way of looking at mr wortle have not expected husband seemed rather to approve than otherwise of what have be done at rate have expressed none of loud horror have expected nevertheless continued doctor be stupid fool for pain know that be fool said mr wortle yes be be not yet twenty have oxford before how did mary behave like angel said mary mother be of course be bound to believe so what did do what did say told that be simply impossible so be be afraid at rate be bound to give encouragement gave none feel quite strongly that be altogether impossible what must lord bracy say if carstairs be three four year older said doctor proudly lord bracy must have much to be thankful for in attachment on part of son if be met by return of affection on part of daughter what better must want be only boy said mr wortle be where be mary be quite right to tell that be impossible be impossible trust for sake that word have not touched young heart oh said mr wortle have be otherwise how must have be angry with child now did seem to mother to be very much in contradiction to doctor have said when have whispered to that lord carstairs coming might be dangerous be afraid of a know said character have altered during last twelve month suppose when boy grow into men be so with not so quickly said doctor boy when leaf eton be not generally thinking of thing boy at eton be not thrown into such society said mr wortle suppose being here seeing mary day have done poor mary think be poor at said mary mother be afraid must not dream of young lover of course will not dream of have never entertained idea of kind there never be girl with le nonsense of kind than mary when lord carstairs spoke to to day suppose have thought about more than other boy have be here will think now not in least know be impossible nevertheless will think about so will yes why not why must be different from other mother why must not think about a other father might do be impossible wish be not for mary sake wish be three four year older be a be know that be impossible nevertheless be natural that must think about only hope that will not think about too much so saying closed conversation for night mary did not think very much about in way a to create disappointment at once realised impossibility so far a to perceive that young lord be top brick of chimney a far a be concerned top brick of chimney may be very desirable one doe cry for because be unattainable therefore mary did not in truth think of loving young lover have be to very nice boy so be still that nothing more then have come little episode in life seemed to lend gentle tinge of romance have inquired of bosom must have declared that have not be in love with mother there be perhaps something of regret be exactly regret may be felt in reference to top brick must have be so sweet have be possible then be so evidently impossible with doctor feeling be somewhat different be not quite so manifest to that special brick be altogether unattainable even that be quite at top of chimney there be reason why daughter must not marry earl son heir doubt lad have be confided to in trust doubt must have be duty to have prevented anything of kind have anything of kind seemed to to be probable have there be moment in duty have seemed to to be duty must have done even though have be necessary to caution earl to take son away from bowick there have be nothing of kind have acted in simplicity of heart have be result of course be impossible acknowledged to that be so because of necessity of oxford study long year must be required for taking of degree to thinking there be other ground for saying that be impossible thing must stand a be if youth must show to be more constant than other youth be not probable if at end of three four year mary must not have given heart to other lover be also improbable why then might come to pas that must day find father in law to future earl bracy though mary did not think of mr wortle thought of so a to give additional interest to disturbed day chapter v correspondence with palace possible glory of mary future career did not deter doctor from thinking of trouble especially that trouble with bishop be at present heavy on hand have determined not to go on with action have so resolved because have felt in more sober moment that in bringing bishop to disgrace must be a bird soiling own nest be that conviction not idea a to sufficiency insufficiency a to truth falsehood of editor apology have actuated a have said to lawyer did not in least care for newspaper people must not condescend to be angry with abominable joke a to two verb be altogether in line a coming from be more to than ribald word of boy might hear in street offence to have come from bishop resolved to spare bishop because of church yet something must be done must not leave man to triumph over if nothing further be done in matter bishop must have triumphed over a must not bring to expose bishop must see whether must not reach man by mean of own power of word so wrote a follows dear lord have to own that letter be written with feeling have be very much lacerated by what lordship have done must tell in first place have abandoned intention of bringing action against proprietor of scurrilous newspaper lordship sent because be unwilling to bring to public fact of quarrel between clergyman of church of england bishop think that may be difficulty between must be arranged without bringing down upon of adverse criticism from public press trust lordship will appreciate feeling in matter nothing le strong must have induced to abandon what seems to be most certain mean by must obtain redress have seen paper lordship sent to before came to from palace scurrilous unsavoury vulgar word contained did not matter to much have lived long enough to know let man own garment be a clean a may be can not hope to walk through world without rubbing against who be dirty be only when word came to from lordship when found that expression found in paper be to lordship have before alluded a being criticism on conduct in metropolitan press criticism so grave a to make lordship think necessary to admonish respecting be only then say that considered to be worthy of notice when lordship in admonishing found necessary to refer to metropolitan press to caution to look to conduct because metropolitan press have expressed dissatisfaction be submit to natural for to ask where must find that criticism have so strongly affected lordship judgment there be perhaps score of newspaper published in london whose animadversion a clergyman might have reason to respect even if did not fear be not justified in thinking that at least two three of have dealt with conduct when lordship held metropolitan press in terrorem over head applied to lordship for name of newspaper lordship when pressed for reply sent to that copy of 'everybody business ' ask lordship to ask whether so far have overstated anything did not that paper come to a only sample be able to send of criticism made on conduct in metropolitan press doubt conduct be handled there in very severe term doubt insinuation if true if of such kind a to be worthy of credit with lordship whether true false be severe plain spoken damning language be so abominable so vulgar so nauseous will not trust to repeat lordship probably when sending one copy kept now must ask lordship must beg of lordship for reply whether periodical have character a to justify lordship in founding complaint against clergyman on unproved statement also whether fact of case a be known to be not such a to make lordship well aware that insinuation be false before ribald word be printed lordship have heard fact of case from own lip lordship have known character for think dozen year know character bear among others a clergyman schoolmaster gentleman have be aware how great be friendship have felt for unfortunate gentleman whose career be in question for lady who bear name when read abominable word did induce lordship to believe have be guilty of inexpressible treachery of making love to poor lady whose misfortune be endeavouring to relieve of doing so almost in wife presence defy to have believed men be various mind work in different way same cause will produce same effect have known too much of to have thought possible must have done a be accused must hold man to be no le than mad who must so have believed knowing a much a lordship knew then how be to reconcile to idea of lordship character fact that must have sent that paper what be to think of process going on in lordship mind when lordship must have brought to use narrative must have known to be false made in newspaper knew to be scurrilous a ground for solemn admonition to clergyman of age standing wrote to a be evident from tone context of lordship letter because found that metropolitan press have denounced conduct be proof sent to that such have be case occurred to at once that a paper in question have vilely slandered must redress by action of law must prove magnitude of evil done by showing grave importance lordship have attached to word in way must have forced answer from lordship to question now put to lordship must have be required to state on oath whether believed insinuation not if so why believed on ground have already explained have thought improper to do so having abandoned that course be unable to force answer from lordship appeal to sense of honour justice whether must not answer question also ask from lordship ample apology if on consideration will feel that have done undeserved injury have honour to be lord lordship most obedient very humble servant jeffrey wortle be rather proud of letter a read to yet little afraid of feeling that have addressed bishop in very strong language might be that bishop must send answer at curt note from chaplain in must be explained that tone of letter precluded bishop from answering must do then be not thought improbable that curt note from chaplain must be that might receive let letter lie by for four twenty hour after have composed then determined that not to send must be cowardly sent then occupied for hour two in meditating sort of letter must write to bishop when curt reply have come from chaplain that further letter must be one must make amicable intercourse between bishop impossible must be so written a to be fit to meet public eye if must be ever driven by bishop conduct to put in print great wrong have be done great wrong bishop have be induced by influence must have have power over to use episcopal rod to smite dr wortle must certainly show bishop that must have considered beforehand whom be about to smite 'amo ' in cool of evening given a expression of opinion from metropolitan press in general have spared bishop a far a action be concerned must not spare must be driven to further measure by further injustice in way lashed again into rage whenever odious word occurred to be almost mad with anger against bishop when letter have be two day sent so that might have have reply have reply come to by return of post put copy of into pocket rode off to call on mr puddicombe have thought of showing to mr puddicombe before sent mind have revolted from such submission to judgment of mr puddicombe must no doubt have advised not to send then must have be almost compelled to submit to such advice letter be gone now bishop have read doubt re read two three time be anxious that other clergyman must see that other clergyman must tell that even if inexpedient have still be justified mr puddicombe have be made acquainted with former circumstance of affair now with mind full of own injury went again to mr puddicombe be just sort of letter that must write a matter of course said mr puddicombe then hope that think be good letter good a being expressive good also a being true do think not good a being wise have be in case must have thought unnecessary be self demonstrative can not control feeling quite understand what did matter bishop did foolish thing in talking of metropolitan press have only meant to put on guard choose to be put on guard in way said doctor exactly must have known better than to suppose must bear then pressed found compelled to send that stupid newspaper of course have made mistake think that world go easier when mistake be forgiven did forgive a far a foregoing action that think be matter of course if have succeeded in putting poor bishop into witness box must have have sensible clergyman in england against felt that not quite that said doctor something very near therefore withdrew can not get sense of injury out of mind therefore have persecuted bishop with letter persecuted will think so so must have be addressed to a said before argument be true only think have made so much more of matter than be necessary ought not to have sent that newspaper ought to have talked about metropolitan press did harm have wished to do harm perhaps might have be a well to pas over must have done so can not imagine in position must not at rate have written letter a even if must must have be afraid to write if must value peace quiet too greatly to quarrel with bishop unless indeed must attempt to impose upon conscience there be nothing of kind here think must have seen that have made mistake have passed over doctor a rode home be on whole better pleased with visit than have expected to be have be told that letter be argumentative true that in have be much at end of week received reply from bishop found that be not at rate written by chaplain dear dr wortle said reply letter have pained exceedingly because find have caused degree of annoyance be certainly very sorry have inflicted when wrote to in letter certainly did not intend a admonition about metropolitan press only meant to tell for own information that newspaper be making reference to affair with mr peacocke doubt whether knew anything of nature of 'everybody business ' be not sure even whether have ever actually read word to object so strongly at rate have have weight with if have read probably did very cursorily did not rest on mind at when wrote to object be to caution not at all a to own conduct a to others who be speaking evil of a to action of spoke so strongly when have pleasure of seeing here be very glad that abandoned for own sake for mine sake of generally to whom peace of church be dear a to nature of language in have found compelled to write to must remind that be unusual a coming from clergyman to bishop be however ready to admit that circumstance of case be unusual can understand that must have felt matter severely under circumstance trust that affair may now be allowed to rest without breach of kind feeling have hitherto existed between yours very faithfully c broughton be beastly letter doctor said to when have read beastly letter then put away without saying more about to to one else have appeared to to be beastly letter because have exactly effect bishop have intended did not eat humble pie did not give full satisfaction of complete apology yet left room for further rejoinder have declared that censure have be intended expressed sorrow that annoyance have be caused yet to doctor thinking be unmanly letter not intended a admonition then why have bishop written in severely affectionate episcopal style have intended a admonition excuse be false so thought doctor comprised criticism in one epithet given above after that put letter away determined to think more about will come in see mr peacocke after lunch doctor said to wife next morning paid visit together after when doctor called on lady be generally accompanied by mr wortle so much have be effected by 'everybody business ' abomination chapter vi journey will now follow mr peacocke for while upon journey began close connection with robert lefroy by paying man bill at inn before left broughton after found called upon to defray trifle of expense incurred a went along lefroy be very anxious to stay for week in town must no doubt have be two week month have companion given way on matter line of conduct have be fixed by mr peacocke in conjunction with doctor from never departed if will not be guided by will

to foot must be unfit also not on account disgraced in own estimation comfort by thinking can not be altogether bad when man such a have loved doe love two woman when parted on that morning kissed other have not done before mr wortle have be made to doubt whether after sin have be so very sinful did endeavour to ask whether must not have done same in same circumstance woman thought must have be right to have married man whom loved when heard that first horrid husband be dead there must at rate have be sin in then what ought to have done when dead man dead a be supposed to have be burst into room mr wortle who found indeed extremely difficult to imagine to be in such position did at last acknowledge that in such circumstance certainly must have done dr wortle have told must not bring nearer to herself than must not suggest to herself two men a own husband must not imagine that doctor have be either bad husband who have unexpectedly come to life good husband who must not in truth be husband at did determine in own mind that however might have be must clearly have done doctor told must have sworn to obey even though when swearing must not have really married be terrible to think of so terrible that must not quite think of in struggling to think of heart be softened towards other woman after day never spoke further of woman sin of course told to doctor not indeed explaining working of own mind a to suggestion that must have be in first condition very bad man have be reported dead have come again in second shape a good man kept that to herself did endeavour to describe effect upon herself of description woman have given of own conduct quite know how must have done otherwise said mr wortle have always said so must have be so very hard to go away when told not must have be very hard to go away said doctor if have told to do so where be to go what be to do have be brought together by circumstance in such manner that be so to say impossible that must part be not often that one come across event like so altogether out of ordinary course that common rule of life seem to be insufficient for guidance to most of never happens be better for that must not happen when doe one be forced to go beyond common rule be that feeling have made give protection have be great misfortune placed a be must not help must not turn out be clearly duty to go almost a clearly mine to give shelter till must come back great misfortune jeffrey be afraid so look at then handed to letter from nobleman living at great distance at distance so great that mr stantiloup must hardly have reached there expressing intention to withdraw two boy from school at christmas doe give a reason be not acquainted with other personally must hardly have alluded to conduct in matter be easier for to give mere notice such a not le do understand intention be that elder mowbray must remain for year younger for two year of course be at liberty to change mind do feel entitled to complain school such a mine must depend on credit of establishment have heard doubt something of story have injured credit be natural that must take boy away do think that school will be put end to look very like altogether will not care to drag on a failure be too old now to begin again with new attempt if collapse have offer to fill up vacancy parent of who remain of course will know how be going with school will not be disposed to let die of idea at present be to carry on without saying anything till christmas holiday then to give notice to parent that establishment will be closed at midsummer

must man give up profession while have health strength to carry on have yes be not one to energy have be chiefly applied work of parish such a can be done by one person have always have curate be moreover nonsense to say that man doe not care most for by make money be to give up over l year have have not trouble delight in making be like coming to end of one life oh jeffrey have to be looked in face know wish wish have never come what be good of wishing came according to way of thinking did duty by much a be grieved by protest must do same again be again to be done do think must be deterred from what thought to be right by machination of dragon such a have done well think so said doctor after little hesitation think have be in truth doing there have be grand opportunity for slander have used with uncommon skill be wonderful chance in favour have be enabled without actual lie lie must be proved to be lie to spread abroad report have be absolutely damning have succeeded in getting hold of very people through whom must injure of course correspondence with bishop have helped bishop have kept a secret why must bishop have have nothing to do with school said mr wortle thing have be mixed up together do think must have effect with woman a lady anne clifford to be told that bishop have censured conduct severely if have not be for mr stantiloup bishop must have heard nothing about be doing pain to feel have to give credit for skill energy wickedness mean what doe signify whether have be wicked not in matter oh jeffrey wickedness be matter of course knew that beforehand if person have to be wicked be great thing for to be successful in wickedness must have to pay final penalty even if failed to be wicked to hing be to be mean round be afraid that mr stantiloup will have succeeded in wickedness chapter viii lord bracy letter school parish went on through august september up to middle of october very quietly quarrel between bishop doctor have altogether subsided people in diocese have ceased to talk continually of mr mr peacocke there be still alive certain interest a to what might be ultimate fate of poor lady other matter have come up no longer formed one topic of conversation at meeting twenty boy at school felt that a number have be diminished so also have reputation be le loud a other boy must have said of le cocky than of yore ate drank played let hope learnt lesson a usual mr peacocke have from time to time received letter from husband last up to time of speak having be written at ogden junction at mr peacocke have stopped for four twenty hour with object of making inquiry a to statement made to at st louis here learned enough to convince that robert lefroy have told truth in regard to what have there occurred people about station still remembered condition of man who have be taken out of car when suffering from delirium tremens remembered also that man have not died there have be carried on by next train to san francisco one of porter also declared that have heard few day afterwards that sufferer have died almost immediately on arrival at san francisco information a far a mr peacocke have sent home to wife have added firm belief that must find man grave in cemetery be able to bring home with testimony to authority in england whether social episcopal judicial must refuse to give credit of course will be married again said mr wortle to husband will be married here will perform ceremony think bishop must object to must care straw if did will go on with school whispered mr wortle will school go on if school go on will go on suppose about that have better ask mr stantiloup will ask nobody said wife putting up face to kiss a be going on everything be said to comfort mr peacocke to give hope of new life mr wortle told how doctor have promised that must marry a soon a form of church legal requisition must allow mr peacocke accepted be said to quietly thankfully did not again allow to be roused to such excitement a have shown on one occasion recorded be at time that doctor received letter greatly affected mode of thought at time have certainly become hipped low spirited if not despondent clearly showed to wife even though be silent that mind be still intent on injury that wretched woman have done by virulence letter of speak for time removed feeling gave a be new life letter be from lord bracy be a follows dear doctor wortle carstairs left for oxford yesterday before went startled mother considerably by piece of information tell that be over head ear in love with daughter communication be indeed made three day ago told must take day two to think of before wrote to be very anxious when told to go off at once to bowick to see wife of course young lady stopped by exercise of somewhat peremptory parental authority then informed that have be to bowick have found lady love at home mr wortle having by chance be absent at time seems that declared to young lady who in exercise of wise discretion ran away from left planted on terrace be account of what passed in least doubt absolute truth be at rate quite clear from own showing that young lady gave encouragement such having be case think must have found necessary to write to at have not carstairs persevered with till promised to do so be willing said not to go to bowick on condition must write to on subject meaning of be have not be very much in earnest must have considered best to let matter pas on a such matter do be forgotten be very much in earnest however foolish be perhaps have better say unusual that lad must be in love before be twenty be suppose possible at rate seems to be case with have convinced mother that must be cruel to ignore fact may at once say that a far a girl be concerned must be quite satisfied that must choose for marriage value rank at rate a much a be worth that will have of own doe not need to strengthen by intermarriage with house of peculiarly old lineage a far a be concerned must be contented a for money must not wish to think of in marrying if come tant mieux if not will have enough of own write to therefore exactly a must do if have happened to be brother peer instead of clergyman think that long engagement be very dangerous probably will agree with that be likely to be more prejudicial to girl than to man may be that a difficulty arise in course of year can forget affair that can not have many thing of to think whereas perhaps have only that one may have made that thing so vital to that can not be got under conquered whereas without fault heartlessness on part occupation have conquered for in case fear that engagement if made must not be long must be sorry that must not take degree think wise to send lad up to university hampered with serious feeling that have already betrothed tell just a be leave to wisdom to suggest what have better be done wished to promise must undertake to induce to tell miss wortle of conversation with said that have right to demand so much a that though must not for present go to bowick must write to young gentleman seems to have will of own can not say that regret what will do a to young lady whether will will not tell have written must leave to yourself if do be to send word to from lady bracy to say that will be delighted to see here have better however come when inflammatory young gentleman will be at oxford yours very faithfully bracy letter certainly did great deal to invigorate doctor to console in trouble even though debated marriage might prove to be impossible a have be declared by voice of wortles one after still there be something in tone in be discussed by young man father be in relief there be at rate contempt in letter may at once say that a far a girl be concerned will be very well pleased that at rate be satisfactory more looked at le thought that need be altogether impossible if lord bracy liked lady bracy liked young carstairs a to whose liking there seemed to be reason for doubt did not see why must be impossible a to mary must not conceive that must make objection if others be agreed how must possibly fail to love young man if encouraged to do so suitor who be good looking rich of high rank sweet tempered at same time thoroughly devoted be not wont to be discarded difficulty lay in lad youth after how many nobleman have done well in world without taking degree degree too have be taken by married men again young men have be persistent before now even to extent of waiting three year long engagement be bad doubt everybody have always said so long engagement may be better than none at at last made up mind that must speak to mary determined that must consult wife first consulting wortle on part generally amounted to more than instructing found sometimes necessary to talk over a have done in matter of visiting mr peacocke when set to work rarely failed have nowhere else to go for certain foundation support therefore hardly doubted much when began operation about suggested engagement have got that letter morning from lord bracy said handing document oh dear have heard about carstairs have better read have told exclaimed when have finished first sentence have told certainly have better read letter through then seated read almost trembling however a went on with oh dear be very nice what say about mary be very nice a far a go there be reason why must not be nice might have made so angry then must have be very unreasonable acknowledges that mary did not encourage of course did not encourage must have be very unlike gentleman have thought so in truth dear be very good letter of course there be difficulty oh be impossible see at must rest very much with doubt with carstairs like to think that girl happiness must depend on young man constancy such danger have to be encountered be engaged for three year before be married did not find so very bad be very good oh be so happy at time happier than have be since well know be very nice to know that be lover why must mary think very nice to have lover knew that must be true why must carstairs be true remember be so young be in order know be at more likely to be true on account clergyman can jilt girl just a well a depends on nature of man be so good never came across better youth than carstairs see what father say about having will of own when young man show purpose of kind generally stick to upshot of be that mary be to be told that father be to tell yes papa did come said told mamma about told of course did what be quite right must not have thought necessary to speak to have not lord bracy written to lord bracy have written said mary seemed to a have done to mother that lord bracy must have written angrily though thought so plucked up spirit gallantly telling that though lord bracy might be angry with own son must have cause to be displeased with yes have letter will read young man seems to have be very much in earnest know said mary with little exultation at heart seems other day that be boy now have become suddenly man to mary said nothing also have come to conclusion that in respect lord carstairs have lately changed very much for better do like mary like papa well darling how be to put be so much in earnest that have got father to write to be coming over again before went to oxford told father what be going to do earl stopped there be letter may read mary read letter taking apart to corner of room seemed to father to take long time in reading there be very much on be called upon to make up mind during few minute up to present time up to moment in father have now summoned into study have resolved that be impossible have become so clear on subject that must not ask question whether must love young man must not be wrong to love young man must not be longing for top brick of chimney ought to know be out of reach so have decided have therefore already taught to regard declaration made to a ebullition of young man folly not le have known how great have be thing suggested to how excellent be top brick of chimney a to young man must not feel have matter be different might have loved now there have come sudden change did not at know how far might go to meet change what change altogether meant have be made sure by father question that have taught to hope must not have asked whether liked must not at rate have asked that question in voice have not be prepared to be good to have answered in affirmative then matter did not depend upon father wish even on father judgment be necessary that before said word must find out what lord bracy said about there have lord bracy letter in hand mind be so disturbed that hardly knew how to read aright at spur of moment understand what say mary think so papa be very kind letter very kind indeed must have thought that must not have liked at make objection of kind to tell truth mary must have thought unreasonable have done so gentleman can do better than marry lady though be much to be nobleman be more to be gentleman people think so much of then having be here a pupil be very sorry when spoke to be past gone danger be that engagement must be long very long must be afraid of mary mary felt that be hard upon unfair be to say that danger of long engagement did not seem to to be very terrible must at once be giving up everything must have declared then that did love young man at rate that intended to do so must have succumbed at first hint that such succumbing be possible to yet have not known that be very much afraid of long engagement must thought have be much more afraid have speedy marriage be proposed to upon whole did not know whether must not be nice to go on knowing that young man loved to rest secure on faith in be sure of that reading of lord bracy letter have in way made happy though be unwilling at once to express happiness to father be quite sure that must make immediate reply to question whether be afraid of long engagement must answer lord bracy letter know said doctor yes papa what will say to know papa yet must tell what to say darling must papa certainly who else can tell will not answer to day will put off till monday be saturday

letter from san francisco giving detail of evidence that husband have obtained enclosing copy of photograph there be now reason why must not become true honest wife of man whom have along regarded a husband in sight of god writer declared that must so quickly follow letter that might be expected home within week at longest ten day from date at must receive immediately on arrival at liverpool must of course give notice by telegraph when letter reached at once sent message across to mr wortle must mr wortle kindly come see mr wortle be of course bound to do a be asked started at once be in truth little able to give counsel on subject outside one be at moment nearest to heart at one o'clock when boy went to dinner mary be to instruct father a to purport of letter be to be sent to lord bracy mary have not a yet come to decision must not go to father for aid must not at rate go to until appointed hour must come be therefore entirely thrown upon mother have be old enough to understand effect power of character must have known at last moment father must certainly decide for have experience of world be greater might have be quite sure that father must decide in favour a be be quivering shaking in dark leaning on mother very inefficient aid nearly overcome with feeling that by one o'clock must be ready to say something quite decided in midst of mother be taken away from just at ten o'clock there be not in truth much that two lady must say to other mr peacocke felt to be necessary to let doctor know that mr peacocke must be back almost at once took mean of doing so in week said mr wortle a though painfully surprised by suddenness of coming arrival in week ten day be to follow letter a quickly a possible from san francisco have found out yes have learned everything think look at mr peacocke handed to friend photograph of tombstone dear said mr wortle ferdinand lefroy be grave be grave said mr peacocke turning face away be very sad very sad indeed have to learn know will not be sad for hope said mr peacocke in endeavour to think of rather than of when be forced to think of seems to that life have be so blighted destroyed that must be indifferent what happens to now what have happened to have be so bad that can hardly be injured further if there can be good time coming for something at least of relief something perhaps of comfort then will be satisfied why must there not be comfort for be almost a dead to hope a be to shame year two ago must have thought impossible to bear eye of people looking at a though life have be sinful impure seem now to care nothing for can look back again with bold eye brazen face tell that hardness be at rate a bad a impurity have not looked at like said mr wortle therefore send to in trouble tell strangest thing of to be must have come across one man so generous a husband one woman so soft hearted a there be nothing further to be said then mr wortle be instructed to tell husband that mr peacocke be to be expected in week ten day then hurried back to give what assistance must in much more important difficulty of own daughter of course be much more important to be girl to become wife of young lord to be future countess be destined to be mother in law of earl of course be much more important to then through being a be dear good christian motherly woman be well aware that there be something in truth much more important even than though thought much of earl ship countess ship great revenue big house at carstairs fine park with magnificent avenue carriage in daughter must be rolled about to london party diamond must wear when must be presented to queen a bride of young lord carstairs yet knew very well that ought not in such emergency a present to think of thing a being of primary importance what must tend most to girl happiness welfare in world next be of that ought to think of only if answer be now returned to lord bracy giving lordship to understand that wortles be anxious to encourage idea then in fact girl must be tied to engagement whether young lord must hold to be so tied how must be with girl if engagement must be allowed to run on in doubtful way for year then be dropped by reason of young man indifference how must be with if after perhaps three four year letter must come saying that young lord have changed mind have engaged to nobler bride be not duty a mother to save child from too probable occurrence of crushing grief such a of be clear to mind then be clear also that if opportunity of greatness be thrown away such chance in probability must ever come again thus be so tossed to fro between prospect of glorious prosperity for child on one side fear of terrible misfortune for child on other that be altogether unable to give salutary advice at rate ought to have known that advice must at last be of importance experience ought to have told that doctor must certainly settle matter have be own happiness be in question own conduct own greatness must not have dreamed of having opinion of own must have consulted doctor simply have done a directed be for child in vague vacillating way felt that for child ought to be ready with counsel of own mamma said mary when mother

into position fitted for composition have described to daughter acknowledged to that there be difficulty in making fit reply to letter have to answer when mind be set on sending indignant epistle to bishop word flew from like lightning out of thunder cloud now have to think much of before must make light to come must not bear different colour from intended of course such marriage must suit child must suit wished to say not only not chiefly because son be nobleman will be earl man of great property go long way with be too true to deny hate humbug want to know simply truth about title money go far not so far a opinion entertain of young man own good gift must not give girl to greatest richest nobleman under british crown if did not think that must love be good to treat a husband must treat wife believing young man to have good gift such a fine disposition be willing on girl behalf also be willing to encounter acknowledged danger of long engagement in hope of realising good thing must if thing went fortunately thus come within reach be what wanted to say to earl found very difficult to say in language must be natural dear lord bracy when learned through mary mother that carstairs have be here in absence made declaration of love to girl be must confess annoyed felt in first place that be too young to have taken in hand business a in next that might not unnaturally have be angry that son who have come here simply for tuition must have fallen into matter of love imagine that will understand exactly what be feeling there be however nothing to be said about evil so far a be evil have be done carstairs be going away to oxford where possibly might forget whole affair did not at rate think necessary to make complaint to of coming to letter have given altogether different aspect think be a little likely a to spend time thought in looking for external advantage be a much alive a to great honour to myself advantage to child of marriage be suggested to know how more secure prospect of happiness must be opened to than marriage offer have thought bound to give letter to read because heart imagination have naturally be affected by what son said to think may say of girl that none sweeter none more innocent none le likely to be over anxious for such prospect must exist heart have be touched though have not dreamt of a acquaintance till came here told own tale though then altogether declined to entertain proposal when be made now that have learnt so much more through be no longer indifferent think will find to be natural mother also be of course alive to danger of long engagement more so because son have still before considerable portion of education have asked advice either of of must of course have be counselled not to think of marriage a yet very passion have prompted to take action upon show a yourself say of that have stronger will than be usual to be found at year a be so be probable that may remain constant to a to fixed idea think will now understand mind mary mother lord bracy a read declared to that though doctor mind be very clear mr wortle a far a knew have mind in matter at must suggest that affair must remain a be that of young people must be made to understand that future engagement must depend not simply on persistency of one of on joint persistency of two if after lady bracy must be pleased to receive mary at carstairs need not say that mary will be delighted to make visit believe dear lord bracy yours most faithfully jeffrey wortle earl when read though there be not word in to must take exception be not altogether pleased of course will be engagement said to wife of course will said countess then carstairs be so very much in earnest must have done for if have done for at rate doctor be gentleman earl said comforting chapter xi mr peacocke return earl rejoinder to doctor be very short so let be there be not word in body of letter there be appended to postscript almost equally short lady bracy will write to mary settle with period for visit so came to be understood by doctor by mr wortle by mary herself that mary be engaged to lord carstairs doctor having so far arranged matter said little nothing more on subject turned mind at once to other affair of mr mr peacocke be evident to wife who probably alone understood buoyancy of spirit corresponding susceptibility to depression that at once went about mr peacocke affair with renewed courage mr peacocke must resume duty a soon a be remarried let see what mr stantiloup bishop must dare to say then be impossible thought that parent must be such ass a to suppose that boy moral must be affected to evil by connection with man so true so gallant so manly a did not at time say anything further a to abandoning school seemed to imagine that vacancy must get filled up a in course of nature ate dinner again a though liked abused liberal be anxious about grape peach a be always case with when thing be going well all a mr wortle understood have come to from brilliancy of mary prospect though held tongue on subject mr wortle did not found absolutely impossible not to talk of when be alone with mary alone with doctor a counselled not to make mary think too much about be obliged to hold peace when be with with of alone be always full of to doctor communicated fear doubt showing only too plainly that must be altogether broken hearted if anything must interfere with grandeur prosperity seemed to be partly within reach not altogether within reach of darling child if carstairs must prove to be recreant young lord if aristotle socrates must put love out of heart if other wicked young lord at christ church be to teach that be foolish thing for young lord to become engaged to tutor daughter before have taken degree if better born young lady be to come in way drive mary out of heart more lovely better girl must be found to do so of be sure to latter assertion doctor agreed telling that a be so ought to have stronger trust in daughter charm telling also with somewhat sterner voice that must not allow to be so disturbed by glory of bracy coronet in there be think hypocrisy have doctor be a simple a wife in showing own heart must probably have be found that be a much set upon coronet a then mr wortle must carry doctor wisdom to daughter papa say dear that must think of too much do think of mamma do love now of course think of of course do dear of course do how must not think of when be in to papa mean that can hardly be called engagement yet know what must be called of course love can change if like must think of knowing rank wealth never did mamma be what be must think of poor mr wortle did not know what special advice to give when declaration be made to have held tongue must have be wisest be impossible to out of full heart mouth speaks heart be very full of lord carstairs of carstairs house of diamond daughter must certainly be called upon to wear before queen if only that young man must do duty poor mary herself probably have worst of provision be made either for to see lover to write to only interview have ever taken place between a lover be that on have run by into house leaving a earl have said planted on terrace have never be able to whisper one single soft word into ear to give even one touch of finger in token of affection did not in least know when might be allowed to see whether have not be settled among elder that be not to see other a real lover till must have taken degree must be almost in future world so distant seemed time have be already settled that be to go to carstairs in middle of november stay till middle of december be altogether settled that lover be not to be at carstairs during time be to be at oxford then must be thinking only of greek latin perhaps amusing in utter forgetfulness that have heart belonging to at bowick parsonage in way mary though doubt thought most of have le opportunity of talking of than father mother in mean time mr peacocke be coming home doctor a soon a heard that day be fixed nearly fixed being then a have be explained in full good humour with world except mr stantiloup bishop bethought a to what step might best be taken in very delicate matter in be called upon to give advice have declared at first that must be married at own parish church felt that there must be difficulty in must go up to london meet there said to mr wortle must not show here till brings down a actual wife then there be very much to be done in arranging something to be done also in making who have be friend perhaps more in making who have be enemy understand exactly how matter stood have injury be inflicted upon a though have done evil to world in general in befriending mr peacocke must have be quite willing to pas matter over in silence among friend a be must not afford to hide own light under bushel be being punished almost to extent of ruin by cruel injustice have be done by evil tongue of mr stantiloup a thought by folly of bishop must now let who have concerned know a accurately a must what have done in matter have be effect of doing wrote letter therefore be not however to be posted till after peacocke marriage have be celebrated copy of prepared with own hand in order that might send to bishop to lady anne clifford to mr talbot not indeed to mr stantiloup to mr stantiloup husband there be copy also made for mr momson though in heart despised mr momson thoroughly in letter declared great respect have entertained since have first known for mr mr peacocke distress have felt when mr peacocke have found obliged to explain to fact fact need not be repeated because reader be so well acquainted with mr peacocke went on to say have since be to america have found that man whom believed to be dead when married wife have died since calamitous reappearance mr peacocke have seen man grave with stone on bearing name have brought back with certificate evidence a to burial under circumstance have hesitation in re employing wife think that will agree must not do le think will agree also in whole transaction have done nothing of parent of boy intrusted to have right to complain having done went up to london made arrangement for having marriage celebrated there a soon a possible after arrival of mr peacocke on return to bowick went off to mr puddicombe with copy of letter in pocket have not addressed copy to friend have intended that one must be sent to mr puddicombe have not interfered in regard to boy have on whole shown to be true friend there be need for to advocate cause to mr puddicombe be right thought that gentleman must know what did might be that hoped that must at length obtain praise from mr puddicombe mr puddicombe did not like letter doe not tell truth said not truth not whole truth a how where have concealed anything if understand question rightly who have thought proper to take child away from school because of mr peacocke have done so because gentleman continued to live with lady when knew that be not man wife be doing condoned be not condemning condoned now defend in letter in defence really touch offence a to be according to own showing accused in telling whole story must say 'they did live together though be not married under circumstance did not think that be on account unfit to be left in charge of boy sent away immediately to america allowed lady to remain then what must have say demanded doctor nothing said mr puddicombe not word live down in silence there will be like who though must not dare to say that in moral be strictly correct will love better for what did doctor turned face towards dry hard looking man showed that there be tear in of eye there be few of not so infirm a sometimes to love best that be not best when man be asked downright question be bound to answer truth must say nothing in own defence not word know french proverb excuse be own accuser ' truth generally make way a far a can see slander never life long ten of boy be gone said doctor who have not hitherto spoken word of to one out of own family ten out of twenty will only be temporary loss be nothing nothing be idea that school must be failing will come again believe that letter must bring boy be almost inclined to say dr wortle that man must never defend must never have to defend be much same thing will tell what will do dr wortle if will suit plan will go up with will assist at marriage for moment think that will require countenance that if did must give man know so efficiently may be that mr peacocke will like to find that clergyman from neighbourhood be standing with so be settled that when day must come on doctor must take mr peacocke up with to london mr puddicombe be to accompany doctor when left mr puddicombe parsonage have by mean pledged not to send letter when man have written letter have taken trouble with more specially when have copied several time so a to have made many letter of when have argued point successfully to have triumphed in own mind a be likely to be case with dr wortle in that did doe not like to make waste paper of letter a rode home tried to persuade that might yet use must not quite admit friend point mr peacocke doubt have known own condition strict moralist might condemn dr wortle have known nothing that have done be not to condemn other man when did know nevertheless a rode into own yard made up mind that must burn letter have shown to one else have not even mentioned to wife must burn without condemning in opinion of one burned when mr puddicombe found at station at broughton a be about to proceed to london with mr peacocke simply whispered fate of letter after what said destroyed what have written perhaps be a well said mr puddicombe when telegram came to say that mr peacocke be at liverpool mr peacocke be anxious immediately to rush up to london be restrained by doctor rather by mr wortle under doctor order dear must not go till will be ready for to meet in church doctor say so be not to see till come up to altar on there be consultation between mr wortle doctor at explained how impossible must be for woman to go through ceremony with due serenity propriety of manner unless must be first allowed to throw into arm to welcome back to yes said can come see at hotel on evening before again in morning so that if there be word to say can say then when be over will bring down here doctor mr puddicombe will come down by later train of course be painful said mr wortle must bear up to seemed to be so painful that be quite sure that must not have borne to be married for third time for second time to same husband to mr peacocke a thought of pain did not so much rest in a in condition of life thing have forced upon must go up to town to morrow must be away for two day said doctor out loud in school speaking immediately to one of usher so that boy present might hear trust that will have mr peacocke with day after to morrow will be very glad of said usher mr peacocke will come eat dinner again like before asked little boy hope so charley will like that because have to eat by now school down even to charley smallest boy in knew about mr peacocke have gone to america mr peacocke be going up to london to be married once more to own husband doctor mr puddicombe be going to marry usher of course knew detail more clearly than that a did probably bigger boy there have even be rumour of photograph have be seen by one of maid servant who have be to be feared given information to french teacher so much however doctor have felt wise to explain not thinking well that mr peacocke must make reappearance among without notice on afternoon of next day one mr mr peacocke be driven up to school in one of broughton fly went quickly up into own house when mr peacocke walked into school boy clustered round three assistant word said to be kind friendly in whole course of trouble there have never be moment to more difficult than in found so nearly impossible to say anything to say nothing yes have be over very many mile since saw last be answer to young talbot who asked whether have not be great traveller whilst be away in america suggested french usher who have heard of photograph knew very well where have be taken yes in america way to san francisco suggested charley way to san francisco charley back again yes know be come back again said charley because see here there be only twenty boy half said one of twenty then will have more time to attend to now suppose so said lad not seeming to find special consolation in view of matter painful a first re introduction have be there be not much more in than that question be asked explanation expected may be that mr stantiloup be affected with fresh moral horror when heard of return that bishop said that doctor be foolish headstrong a ever may be that there be good deal of talk about in close at broughton at school there be very little more said about than what have be stated above chapter xii mary success in last chapter of short story will venture to run rapidly over few month so a to explain how affair of bowick arranged up to end of current year can not pretend that reader will know a ought to be made to know future fate fortune of personage must be left still struggling then be not such always in truth case even when happy marriage have be celebrated even when in course of two rapid year two normal child make appearance to gladden heart of parent mr mr peacocke fell into accustomed duty in diminished school apparently without difficulty a doctor have not sent ill judged letter of course received reply be neither troubled by further criticism consoled by praise a to conduct indeed almost seemed to a though thing now that be done excited le observation than deserved heard more of metropolitan press be surprised to find that 'broughton gazette ' inserted only very short paragraph in stated that have be given to understand mr mr peacocke have resumed usual duty at bowick school after performance of interesting ceremony in london at dr wortle mr puddicombe have assisted press a far a doctor be aware said nothing more on subject if remark injurious to conduct be made by stantiloups momsons did not reach ear very soon after return of peacockes there be grand dinner party at palace to doctor wife be invited be not clerical dinner party so honour be greater aristocracy of neighbourhood be there including lady anne clifford who be devoted with almost repentant affection to old friend lady margaret momson be there only clergyman wife besides own who declared to with unblushing audacity that have never regretted anything so much in life a augustus must have be taken away from school be evident that there have be intention at palace to make what amends palace must for injury have done did lady anne say anything about boy asked mr wortle a be going home be going to must not let managed to show did not wish be clever enough to stop must wonder if sent back said mr wortle wo do indeed doubt whether must take if must come to pas that must wish to send back may be sure that others will come in such matter be very good a weathercock showing how wind blow in way dinner party at palace be in degree comforting consolatory incident of be most comforting most consolatory to one of inhabitant of parsonage took place two three day after dinner party on going out of own hall door one saturday afternoon immediately after lunch whom must doctor see driving into yard in hired gig from broughton young lord carstairs there have be no promise absolute compact made certainly have seemed to be understood by of that carstairs be not to show at bowick till at long distant period when must have finished trouble of education be understood even that be not to be at carstairs during mary visit so imperative be that young people must not meet now here be getting out of gig in rectory yard halloa carstairs be that yes dr wortle here be hardly expected to see boy suppose not when heard that mr peacocke have come back about marriage know must not come over to see have always be such great friend oh to see mr peacocke thought 'd think unkind if did look up have made right have yes have made right think finer fellow never lived will tell about travelled with pistol in pocket seemed to want too suppose must come in see lady after have be to peacocke suppose can just see said young lord a though moved by equal anxiety a to mother a to daughter will leave word that be here then will go into school so doctor found servant sent what message thought fit into house lord carstairs here yes indeed miss be with papa going across to school told to take word in to missus that supposes lordship will stay to dinner maid who carried tidings who have received commission to convey to miss mary be doubt too much interested in affair of love not to take first to one must be most concerned with very morning mary have be bemoaning a to hard condition of what use be to to have lover if be never to see never to hear from only to be told about that be not to think of more than must help be already beginning to think that long engagement carried on after fashion must have more of suffering in than have anticipated seemed to that while be always must be thinking of never never must continue to think of if must be only word once month must be something just one two written word under envelope even must have sufficed to keep hope alive never to see never to hear from mother have told very morning that there be to be meeting probably for three year till must have done with oxford here be in house papa have sent in word to say that be to eat dinner there so astonished that felt that must be afraid to meet before have have minute to think of mother be with carstairs love be here oh mamma what have brought have gone into school with papa to see mr peacocke always be very fond of mr peacocke for moment something of feeling of jealousy

mamma wish to see oh yes mamma if be to come go be not to meet at must think be over then only know what to say to must take that a come dear two hour afterwards be walking two of alone together out in bowick wood when once law have be rather understood than spoken have be infringed set at naught there be longer use in endeavouring to maintain semblance of restriction two young people have met in

know be here said doctor a led young lord back from school into house know be coming for wrote told mother always tell everything be sometimes best to make up mind before get answer then doctor made up mind that lord carstairs must have own way in anything that wished to accomplish wo earl be angry mr wortle asked not angry know world too well not to be quite sure that something of kind must happen be too fond of son not to think well of anything that doe be to be supposed that must never meet after have passed be bound to make welcome if chooses to come here a mary lover to give best

feeling of discomfort if thought that be to see again when be at carstairs be not last walk in wood even on occasion remained two day at bowick so necessary be for to renew intimacy with mr peacocke explained that have got two day leave from tutor of college that two day in college parlance always meant three must be back on third day in time for gate be strictest college discipline must require of need hardly be said of that most of time spent with mary did manage to devote hour two to old friend school assistant mr peacocke told whole story carstairs whose moral be perhaps not quite so strict a of mr puddicombe gave sympathy to think that man can be such brute a that said when heard that ferdinand lefroy have shown to wife at st louis only on spree there be knowing to what depth utter ruin may reduce man who have be born to better thing fall into idleness then comfort with drink so seems to have be with that other fellow do think meant to shoot never meant to frighten when brought out knife in bedroom at leavenworth did pistol be not loaded why not because little a wish to be murdered must prefer that to murdering one else did mean only object be to get a much out of a must a for must give more because have got after that made league of friendship mr peacocke promised that must on distant occasion take wife with on visit to carstairs be about month after mary be packed up sent on journey to carstairs when took place doctor be in supreme good humour there have come letter from father of two mowbrays saying that have again changed mind have said story told two way trusted dr wortle must understand forgive when declared that have believed story if after doctor chose to refuse to take boy back again must have acknowledged ground for offence if doctor must take must intrust to doctor care with greatest satisfaction in world a have done before for while doctor have hesitated here perhaps for first time in life wife be allowed to persuade be such leading people said who care for have never gone in for however be hardly true when have be sure that man be gentleman have taken son without inquiring much farther be mean of to withdraw after have acceded to request withdraws withdrawal in such flattering way then doctor assented two boy be allowed to come lady anne clifford hearing learning that doctor be so far willing to relent became very piteous implored forgiveness noble relative be willing now have not be fault a far a be concerned have always be anxious that boy must remain at bowick so two cliffords came back to old bed in old room mary when first arrived at carstairs hardly knew how to carry lady bracy be very cordial earl friendly for first two day nothing be said about carstairs there be open acknowledgment of position then have
