showing real feeling of country upon sundry question of public interest mr gresham have be prime minister of england a representative of liberal party in politics there have come to be split among who must have be follower on terribly vexed question of ballot then mr daubeny for twelve month have sat upon throne distributing good thing of crown amidst conservative birdlings with beak wide open craving maw who certainly for year previous have not received share of state honour state emolument mr daubeny be still so sitting to infinite dismay of liberal man of whom felt that party be entitled by numerical strength to keep management of government within own hand let man be of what side may in politics unless be much more of partisan than patriot will think well that there must be equity of division in bestowal of crumb of comfort can even old whig wish lord lieutenant of county must be old whig can be good for administration of law that none liberal lawyer must become attorney general from thence chief justice lord of appeal must no conservative peer ever represent majesty of england in india in canada at st petersburgh so arguing moderate liberal have be glad to give mr daubeny merry men chance mr daubeny merry men have not neglected chance given fortune favoured made hay while sun shone with energy have never be surpassed improving upon fortune till natural enemy waxed impatient there have be a yet one year of natural enemy who have at first expressed a glad that turn have come might have endured period of spoliation with more equanimity for to liberal cutting up of whitehall cake by conservative be spoliation when privilege of cutting be found to have so much exceeded what have be expected be not liberal real representative of people therefore did not cake in truth appertain to have not given up cake for while partly indeed through idleness mismanagement quarrelling among mainly with feeling that moderate slicing on other side must upon whole be advantageous when cake came to be mauled like oh heaven so men who have quarrelled agreed to quarrel more be decided that there must be end of mismanagement idleness that horrid sight of weak pretending to be strong weak receiving reward of strength must be brought to end then came great fight in last agony of cake be sliced manfully world knew how fight must go in meantime lord lieutenancy be arranged very ancient judge retired upon pension vice royal governor be sent out in last gasp of failing battle great place be filled by ten little place by twenty private secretary be established here there hay be still made even after sun have gone down in consequence of circumstance of election of be peculiar mr daubeny have dissolved house not probably with idea that must thus retrieve fortune feeling that in doing so be occupying last normal position of properly fought constitutional battle enemy be resolved more firmly than be resolved before to knock altogether on head at general election have called into existence have be disgracefully out voted in house of common on various subject on last occasion have gone into lobby with minority of upon motion brought forward by mr palliser late liberal chancellor of exchequer respecting decimal coinage politician not even mr palliser have expected that must carry bill in present session be brought forward a trial of strength for such purpose decimal coinage be a good subject a other be mr palliser hobby be gratified at having further opportunity of ventilating when in power have not succeeded in carrying measure awed at last absolutely beaten by infinite difficulty encountered in arranging detail mind be still set upon be allowed by whole party to be a good a anything else for purpose then required conservative government be beaten for third fourth time mr daubeny dissolved house whole world said that might a well have resigned at once be already end of july there must be autumn session with new member be known to be impossible that must find supported by majority after fresh election have be treated with manifest forbearance cake have be left in hand for twelve month house be barely two year old have cry with to meet country dissolution be factious dishonest unconstitutional so said liberal be deduced also that conservative be in heart a angry a be opponent what be to be gained poor interval of three month there be clever men who suggested that mr daubeny have scheme in head sharp trick of political conjuring hocus pocus presto sleight of hand by might be able to retain power let election go a must if so certainly did not make scheme known to own party have cry with to meet country indeed have leader of opposition retrenchment army reform navy excellence mr palliser decimal coinage general good government gave to old whig moderate liberal plenty of matter for speech to future constituent who be more advanced must promise ballot suggest disestablishment of church government of day be to be turned out on score of general incompetence be to be made to go because must not command majority there ought to have be dissolution mr daubeny be regarded by opponent indeed by very many of follower also with enmity be almost ferocious seat in parliament if be for five six year be blessing blessing becomes very questionable if have to be sought afresh other session one thing be manifest to thoughtful working eager political liberal must have not only majority in next parliament majority of good men of men good true there must be no more mismanagement more quarrelling more idleness be to be borne that unprincipled so called conservative prime minister must go on slicing cake after fashion a lately adopted old bishop have even talked of resigning knight of garter have seemed to die on purpose so there be great stir at liberal political club good true man be summoned to battle now liberal soldier a young soldier have be known to be more good true than mr finn irishman who have held office two year ago to satisfaction of friend who have retired from office because have found compelled to support measure have since be carried by very men from whom have be obliged on account to divide have always be felt by old friend that have be if not ill used at least very unfortunate have be twelve month in advance of party have consequently be driven out into cold so when name of good men true be mustered weighed discussed scrutinised by active member of liberal party in certain very private room not far removed from great seat of parliamentary warfare when capability expediency possibility be tossed to fro among active member came to pas that name of mr finn be mentioned more than once mr phineas finn be gentleman name statement may be necessary to explain term of endearment be occasionally used in speaking of have got permanent place said mr ratler who be living on well founded hope of being treasury secretary under new dispensation of course wo leave must be acknowledged that mr ratler than whom judge in such matter possessed more experience have always be afraid of phineas finn will lave fast enough if will make worth while said honourable laurence fitzgibbon who also have expectation married when went away ca afford said mr bonteen keen expectant devil bit said honourable laurence anyways poor thing died of first baby before be born phinny have impidiment more than have be best irishman ever got hold of said barrington erle present company always excepted laurence bedad need except barrington know what man made of what man can do know what ca do be not bad at outside skirmishing be worth salt say that with just reliance on own power phinny be different sort of man phinny can stick to desk from twelve to seven wish to come back again after dinner be have money left too 'd like to spend of on english borough never can quite trust said bonteen now mr bonteen have never loved mr finn at rate will try again said barrington erle making little note to effect did try again phineas finn when last seen by public be departing from parliamentary life in london to enjoyment of modest place under government in own country with something of shattered ambition after various turmoil have achieved competency have married girl of heart now wife be dead be again alone in world one of friend have declared that money have be left to be true money have not be much phineas finn have lost father a well a wife have inherited about four thousand pound be not at time much over thirty must be acknowledged in regard to that since day on have accepted place retired from london very soul have sighed for lost glory of westminster downing street there be certain mode of life if once adopted make contentment in other circumstance almost impossibility in old age man may retire without repining though be often beyond power even of old man to do so in youth with faculty still perfect with body still strong with hope still buoyant such change a have be made by phineas finn be more than than most men must bear with equanimity have revelled in gas light must not lie quiet on sunny bank to palate accustomed to high cookery bread milk be almost painfully insipid when phineas finn found discharging in dublin routine duty of office a to there be public comment no feeling that such duty be done in face of country became sick at heart discontented like warhorse out at grass remembered sound of battle noise of trumpet after five year spent in heat full excitement of london society life in ireland be tame to cold dull did not analyse difference between metropolitan quasi metropolitan manner found that men woman in dublin be different from to whom have be accustomed in london have lived among lord son daughter of lord though official secretary assistant commissioner among whom lot now threw be for most part clever fellow fond of society perhaps more than equal in kind of conversation found to be prevalent still be not same a men have left behind men alive with excitement of parliamentary life in london when in london have often told that be sick of that must better love country quiet life now dublin be tibur fickle one found that must not be happy unless be back again at rome when therefore received following letter from friend barrington erle neighed like old warhorse already found shouting have have among trumpet street th july dear finn although be not now immediately concerned in such trifling matter have doubt heard that be to be sent back at once to constituent that there will be general election about end of september be sure that will have such majority a never have before be determined to make a strong a possible to get in good men be to be have have mind to try again after there be nothing like perhaps may have irish seat in eye for must be safe to tell truth know very little of irish seat not so much a think ought to do if be not so lucky must suggest tankerville in durham of course there must be contest little money will be wanted money must not be much browborough have sat for place now for three parliament seems to think own be told that nothing must be easier than to turn out will remember man great hulking heavy speechless fellow who always used to sit just over lord macaw shoulder have made inquiry be told that must walk if anybody must go down who must talk to collier night for week so must just be work for of course must have assistance must give molescroft must put into hand of agent who must spend money for l must do be very sorry to hear of great loss a also be lady laura who a be aware be still abroad with father have thought that loneliness of present life might perhaps make willing to come back among write instead of ratler because be helping in northern county will understand about yours ever faithfully barrington erle of course tankerville have be dirty browborough have spent fortune there think that need dishearten will go there with clean hand must be understood that there will not be a much a glass of beer be told that fellow wo vote for browborough unless spends money fancy will be afraid to do heavily after have come gone if doe will have out on petition let have answer a soon a possible at once resolved that must go over see before replied to erle letter walked dozen time length of pier at kingston meditating on answer have one belonging to have be deprived of young bride left desolate must ruin one where must there be man in world who have more perfect right to play trick with own prospect if threw up place spent money who must blame nevertheless did tell that when must have thrown up place spent money there must remain to own self to be disposed of in manner might be very awkward to man owes to country to friend even to acquaintance that will not be known to be going about wanting dinner with never coin in pocket be very well for man to boast that be lord of that having tie may do a plea with possession be possession of unfortunately can not rid when find that there be nothing advantageous to be done with doubtless there be way of riddance there be bare bodkin man may fall overboard between holyhead kingston in dark may do in cunning fashion that friend will think that be accident against mode of riddance there be canon set men still fear to disobey thing that be asked to do be perilous standing in present niche of vantage be at least safe added to safety there be material comfort have more than enough for want work be light lived among men woman with whom be popular very fact of past parliamentary life have caused to be regarded a man of note among notable of irish capital lord lieutenant be gracious to wife of judge smiled upon at table be encouraged to talk of war of god at have be present be so treated a to make feel that be somebody in world of dublin now be invited to give up for what answered that question to with enthusiastic eloquence reward offered to be thing in world liked best be suggested to that must again have within reach that parliamentary renown have once be very breath of nostril know argument quotation antagonistic to prudence with man fortifies in rashness none brave deserve fair where there be will there be way nothing venture nothing have sword be to who can use fortune favour bold on other side there be just a much to be said bird in hand be worth two in bush look before leap thrust not out hand further than can draw back again maxim of life phineas finn revolved within own heart if not carefully at least frequently a walked up down long pier of kingston harbour what matter such revolvings man placed a be phineas always doe that most plea at moment being poor at argument if can not carry weight to side best satisfies own feeling have not success be very great when before made attempt be not well aware at moment of life that after having so thoroughly learned lesson in london be throwing away hour amidst present pursuit in dublin did not owe to country then again what might not london do for men who have begun a begun have lived to rule over cabinet to sway empire have be happy for short twelvemonth with young bride for short twelvemonth then have be taken from have be spared to must never have longed for more than fate have given must never have sighed again for glory of westminster have mary not gone from now be alone in world though must look forward to possible not improbable event must make that future disposition of most difficult question for still must dare to try a first result of erle letter phineas be over in london early in august if went on with matter must of course resign office for holding be now paid thousand year must retain that a long a chose to earn money earning of must not be compatible with seat in parliament have few thousand pound with must pay for contest at tankerville for consequent petition have be so generously suggested to maintain in london for session two must be so fortunate a to carry election then must be penniless with world before a closed oyster to be again opened knew one better that oyster becomes harder harder in opening a man who have to open becomes older be oyster will close to again with snap after have got knife well into if withdraw point for moment have have rough tussle with oyster already have reached fish within shell nevertheless oyster have got be not oyster wanted so told now here have come to chance of trying again early in august went over to england saw mr molescroft made first visit to tankerville did not like look of tankerville nevertheless resigned place before month be over be one great step rather leap in dark that took thing have be so arranged that election at tankerville be to take place on th of october when dissolution have be notified to world by mr daubeny earlier day be suggested mr daubeny saw reason for postponing for fortnight mr daubeny enemy be again very ferocious be trick mr daubeny have right to continue prime minister day after decided expression of opinion a to unfitness have be pronounced by house of common men be waxing very wrath nevertheless so much power remained in mr daubeny hand election be delayed that for tankerville must not be held till th of october whole house must not be chosen till end of month hardly by time yet there be to be autumn session ratlers bonteens be at rate clear about autumn session be absolutely impossible that mr daubeny must be allowed to remain in power over christmas up to february mr molescroft whom phineas saw in london be not comfortable counsellor so be going down to tankerville said seem to think might a well try quite right quite right somebody ought to try doubt must be disgrace to whole party if browborough be allowed to walk over there be borough in england more sure to return liberal than tankerville if left to yet lump of legislator have sat there a tory for last dozen year by dint of money brass think can unseat say that have come to end of money a to brass be positively without end surely will have fear of consequence after have be done none in least have be done can name single parliamentary aspirant who have be made to suffer have suffered in character said phineas must not like to have thing said of have be said of know man of who stand in worse position among own friend than occupied before men of sort want good position among enemy know be safe when seat be in dispute everybody be savage enough when be merely question of punishing man what be use of being savage who know whose turn may be next will play old game then of course will play old game said mr molescroft doe know other game purist in england must teach to think that poor man ought not to sell vote that rich man ought to buy mean to go in for purity certainly do browborough will think just a badly of a will of will hate because will think be trying to rob of what have honestly bought will hate quite a much because try to rob borough 'd tell if asked that doe want seat for nothing more than want house carriage horse for nothing to will be mean low interloper wo care about not in least if can get seat be afraid wo will be elected will petition will lose seat there will be commission then borough will be disfranchised be fine career expensive then there be reward beyond self satisfaction arising from good action however ruddle will do best can for certainly be possible that may creep through be very disheartening barrington erle assured hero that such be mr molescroft usual way with candidate that really meant little nothing at rate phineas finn be pledged to stand chapter ii harrington hall phineas on first arrival in london found few of old friend men who be still delayed by business though session be over arrived on th of august may be considered a great day of annual exodus remembered how too in former time have gone to scotland to shoot grouse

impulse must take thing a must come flatterings of friend threatenings of enemy must alter knew own weakness confessed to that week of life by at fowler hotel refreshed by occasional interview with mr

just what mother look for must only be better than spendthrift gambler hardly better will say perhaps how odd be profess to believe when be told that world must be used merely a preparation for next

quite sufficient to qualify in running risk in attempt to return to kind of life have formerly led if must fail at tankerville what must become of then chapter iv tankerville great mr molescroft came over to tankerville for purpose of introducing hero to elector to mr ruddle local liberal agent who be to be employed met at lambton arm there phineas established knowing well that have before ten day of unmitigated vexation misery tankerville be dirty prosperous ungainly town seemed to exude coal dust coal mud at pore be so well recognised a being dirty that people did not expect to meet other with clean hand face linen be never white at tankerville even lady who sat in drawing room be accustomed to feel taste appearance of soot in daintiest recess hear that at oil city flavour of petroleum be hardly considered to be disagreeable so be with flavour of coal at tankerville know at oil city flavour of petroleum must not be openly declared to be objectionable so be with coal at tankerville at tankerville coal be much loved be not thought to be dirty mr ruddle be very much begrimed of leading liberal elector upon whom phineas finn have already called seemed to be saturated with product of district must not however in event be duty to live at tankerville have believed from first moment of entrance into town that must soon depart from know more felt that chance of being elected be quite forlorn hope must hardly understand why have allowed to be embarrassed by so very unprofitable speculation phineas finn have thrice before be chosen to sit in parliament twice for irish borough of loughshane once for english borough of loughton have be so happy a hitherto to have known nothing of misery occasional hopelessness of contested election at loughton have come forward a nominee of earl of brentford have be returned without chance of failure by nobleman influence at loughshane thing have nearly be a pleasant with have almost be taught to think that nothing must be easier than getting into parliament if only man must live when be there loughton loughshane be gone with so many other comfortable thing of old day now found relegated to borough to a seemed to be sent to fight not that might win because be necessary to party that seat must not be allowed to be lost without fighting have have pleasant thing of parliamentary adventure now must undergo be unpleasant doubt must have refused have listened to tempter must not now go back though mr ruddle be hardly more encouraging than mr molescroft browborough have be at work for last three day said mr ruddle in tone of reproach mr ruddle have always thought that amount of work must be too heavy for candidate will make much difference asked mr molescroft well doe of course have be among collier when ought to have be before came when be told said phineas 'd have telegraphed to if 'd known where be there be help for spilt milk must get to work now be suppose be for disestablishing church not particularly said phineas who felt that with a roman catholic be delicate subject need go into need said mr molescroft who though liberal be good churchman mr ruddle be dissenter very strong opinion mr ruddle now expressed a to necessity that new candidate must take up church question did not spring at from own religious conviction present duty called upon to have liberal candidate if possible returned for borough with be connected not to disseminate doctrine of own sect nevertheless opinion be very strong think must mr molescroft said be sure must browborough have taken up other side went to church last sunday with mayor two of alderman be told said response louder than anybody else dined with vicar of trinity on monday have be very loud in denouncing mr finn a roman catholic have declared that everything will be up with state if tankerville return friend supporter of pope will find that church will be cry here election ca get anything by supporting may make strong party by pledging to disendowment must local taxation do asked mr molescroft who indeed preferred almost other reform to disendowment have made up mind that must have check on municipal expenditure said phineas wo alone if understand borough feeling at election will altogether be about church see mr finn being roman catholic give handle be already beginning to use like roman catholic here if can manage to give sort of liberal turn a many of constituent used to do know a though disliked church state rather than cared for pope may be might act on side rather than on theirs mr molescroft understands oh yes understand mr ruddle said great deal more to same effect though mr molescroft did not express acquiescence in view neither did dissent candidate said little at interview turned matter over in mind seat in parliament must be barren honour must not afford to offer service for barren honour honest political work be anxious to do for what work did desired to be paid party to belonged have a knew endeavoured to avoid subject of disendowment of church of england be necessary nature of political party in country to avoid a long a can be avoided consideration of question involves great change there be consciousness on mind of leading politician that pressure from behind forcing upon great measure drive almost quicker than can go so that becomes necessity with to resist rather than to aid pressure will certainly be at last effective by own strength best carriage horse be can most steadily hold back against coach a trundle down hill phineas knew be of opinion that barrington erles ratlers of party must not thank for ventilating measure however certain might be coming might well be postponed for few year once already in career have chosen to be in advance of party consequence have be disastrous to on occasion feeling have be strong in regard to measure upon broke away from party when first thought of did not care much about church disendowment found that must need go a be driven else depart out of place wrote line to friend erle not to ask advice to explain circumstance only possible chance of success will lie in attacking church endowment of course think be bad of course think that must go have never cared for matter must have be very willing to leave among thing will arrange have choice here so prepared to run race on course arranged for by mr ruddle mr molescroft whose hour be precious soon took leave phineas finn be placarded about town a sworn foe to church endowment in course of canvas commotion consequent upon found that mr ruddle be right other subject seemed at moment to have attraction in tankerville mr browborough whose life have not be passed in strict obedience to ten commandment whose religious observance have not hitherto interfered with pleasure duty of life repeated at meeting attended almost to elector whom canvassed great shibboleth have now adopted prosperity of england depends on church of people be not orator indeed might be hard to find man who have for year be conversant with public life le able to string few word together for immediate use must learn dozen sentence by rote must stand up with unabashed brow repeat with enduring audacity same word dozen time over prosperity of england depends on church of people have be asked whether prosperity promised be temporal spiritual in nature not only must not have answered must not in least have understood question word a came from mouth have weight seemed to ensure truth many men in tankerville thought that mr browborough be eloquent phineas on other hand made two three great speech evening astonished even mr ruddle by oratory have accepted mr ruddle proposition with lukewarm acquiescence in handling of matter became zealous fiery enthusiastic explained to hearer with gracious acknowledgment that church endowment have undoubtedly be most beneficent in past time spoke in interest of special creed whether in so called popish day of henry viii ancestor in so called protestant day have followed state of society have required that spiritual teaching must be supplied from fund fixed devoted to purpose increasing intelligence population of country made no longer desirable if desirable no longer possible must endowment be increased to meet need of increasing million be not fact that even among member of church of england be altogether inefficient to supply want of great town did people of tankerville believe that clergyman of london of liverpool of manchester be paid by endowment argument have be efficacious in ireland must be efficacious in england said without reference to one creed to did believe in religious teaching have not word to say against protestant episcopal church thought nay be sure that church state a combined institution must no longer prevail in country if people of tankerville must return to parliament must be first object to put end to anomaly browboroughites be considerably astonished by success collier on occasion did not seem to regard clamour be raised against irish papist much dirt be thrown head be broken phineas persevered mr ruddle be lost in admiration have never before have at tankerville man who must talk so well mr browborough without ceasing repeated well worn assurance be received with loudest exclamation of delight by own party clergyman of town neighbourhood crowded round pursued almost seemed to believe in be at rate fighting battle a best knew how to fight great body of collier listened to phineas collier be now voter then mr ruddle who have many eye began to perceive that old game be to be played there will be money going to morrow after whispered to finn evening before election suppose expected be sure began by thinking must do without want to sacrifice borough do mr ruddle will sooner do than lose seat couple of dozen of men out of fallgate must make safe mr ruddle smiled a said phineas smiled a answered if good can be done by talking to men at fallgate will talk to by hour together have about done said mr ruddle then came voting up to two o'clock polling be so equal that number at mr browborough committee room be always given in favour at liberal room in favour of phineas finn at three o'clock phineas be acknowledged to be ten ahead be surprised at own success declared to that old luck have not deserted be giving l s vote at fallgate minute said ruddle to at quarter past three will have to prove can do think said ruddle at four o'clock when poll be over browborough be declared to have won on post by seven vote be that same evening declared by mayor to have be elected sitting member for borough again assured people in speech that prosperity of england depends on church of people will carry seat on scrutiny a sure a egg said mr ruddle who have be quite won by gallant way in phineas have fought battle chapter v mr daubeny great move whole liberal party be taken very much by surprise at course election ran perhaps might be more proper to say that parliamentary leader of party be surprised have not be recognised by a necessary that great question of church state must be generally discussed on occasion be matter of course that must be discussed at place by men eager dissenter must of course take advantage of opportunity to press view doubt entire abolition of irish church a state establishment have taught liberal to think conservative to fear that question must force forward at very distant date have not be expected to do so now general incompetence of ministry who must not command majority on measure be intended to be strong point of liberal party not only at election at meeting of parliament church question be necessarily felt by statesman to be of such magnitude a to dwarf other be not wanted a yet might remain in background a future standing point for great political struggle in must be again necessary that liberal must fight a though for life with teeth nail men who ten year since regarded almost with abhorrence certainly with distrust idea of disruption between church state in england be doubt learning to perceive that such disruption must come be reconciling to after slow silent inargumentative fashion in conviction force among from reconciliation to idea be advancing to enthusiasm on behalf be only question of time be now said by many who hardly remembered how devoted have be to established church of england dozen year ago fruit be not yet ripe leader of liberal party by mean desired that must be plucked be therefore surprised little pleased when found that question be more discussed than other on hustings of enthusiastically political borough barrington erle be angry when received letter of phineas finn be at moment staying with duke of st bungay who be regarded by many a only possible leader of liberal party must mr gresham for reason fail indeed old whig of whom barrington erle considered to be one must have much preferred duke to mr gresham have be possible to set mr gresham aside mr gresham be too strong to be set aside erle duke with brother be minded to be thoroughly loyal to leader be leader not to be loyal be in mind treachery occasionally feared that man must carry whither did not desire to go in meantime heavy thing be spoken of poor friend finn after man be as said erle if so believe be altogether responsible for said duke well yes in measure not altogether that however be long story have many good gift be clever good tempered one of pleasantest fellow that ever lived woman like so duchess tell be not what call loyal can not keep from running after strange god what need have to take up church question at truth be duke thing be going to piece get men into house now who be clever sort of thing who force way up who ca be made to understand that everybody must not want to be prime minister duke who be now nestor among politician though very green in age smiled a heard remark have be familiar to for last forty year too liked party be fond of loyal men have learned at last that loyalty must be built on basis of self advantage patriotism may exist without that erle called loyalty in politics be simply devotion to side man conceives to be side can not leave without danger to if discontent be felt at eagerness with subject be taken up at certain borough be adopted by men whose vote general support must be essentially necessary to must be coming liberal government absolute dismay be occasioned by speech be made at certain county election mr daubeny have for many year be member for east barsetshire be a sure of seat a queen of throne one must think of contesting mr daubeny right to sit for east barsetshire doubt might have be returned without showing to elector did show to elector a matter of course made speech on occasion so happened that day fixed for election in division of county be quite at close of period of political excitement when mr daubeny addressed friend in east barsetshire return throughout kingdom be nearly complete attention have be paid to fact during election be afterwards asserted that arrangement have be made with political purpose with purpose be politically dishonest mr daubeny so said angry liberal have not chosen to address constituent till speech at hustings must have effect on other county otherwise so said liberal whole conservative party must have be called upon to disavow at hustings conclusion to mr daubeny hinted in east barsetshire that have arrived east barsetshire men so said liberal have be too crass to catch meaning hidden under ambiguous word word when read by light of astute criticism be found to contain opinion that church state must be dissevered by g be going to take bread out of mouth again said mr ratler speech be certainly very ambiguous be not sure that east barsetshire folk be so crass a be accused of being in not understanding at once dreadful hint be wrapped up in many word formed small part of very long oration bucolic mind of east barsetshire took warm delight in eloquence of eminent personage who represented be wont to extract more actual enjoyment from music of period than from strength of argument when must explain to that have discovered new rather hitherto unknown conservative element in character of countryman must best utilise by changing everything in constitution manipulated word with such grace be so profound so broad so exalted be so brilliant in mingling deep philosophy with ordinary politics of day that bucolic mind must only admire be great honour to elector of agricultural county that must be made first recipient of pearl be not wasted by being thrown before be picked up by gentleman of press became pearl not of east barsetshire of england on occasion be found that one pearl be very big very rare worthy of great attention be black pearl be regarded by many a abominable prodigy period of history be one in becomes essential for to renew inquiry have prevailed since man first woke to destiny a to amount of connection exists must exist between spiritual simply human form of government between daily religion daily politics between crown mitre east barsetshire clergyman east barsetshire farmer like to hear something of mitre in political speech at hustings word sound pleasantly in ear a appertaining to good old gracious time good old gracious thing a honey fall fast from mouth of practised speaker le practised hearer be apt to catch more of word than of sense speech of mr daubeny be taken all in good part by assembled friend when be read by quidnunc on following day be found to contain so deep meaning that produced from mr ratler mouth word of fear have be already quoted must really be case that man intended to perform so audacious trick of legerdemain a for preservation of power that if intended must have power to carry through renewal of inquiry a to connection exists between crown mitre when bran be bolted must only mean disestablishment of church mr ratler friend be not long in bolting bran regarding matter simply in own light without bringing to bear upon experience of last half century mr ratler must have thought party strong enough to defy mr daubeny utterly in such attempt ordinary politician looking at mr daubeny position a leader of conservative party a statesman depending on support of church a minister appointed to present place for express object of defending be left of old dear venerable in constitution must have declared that mr daubeny be committing political suicide a to future history must record verdict of probably not temporary insanity when speech be week old be said in many respectable household through country many squire many parson many farmer be grieved for mr daubeny when word have be explained to who did not for moment think that word must be portentous a to great conservative party mr ratler remembered catholic emancipation have be in house when corn law be repealed have be nearly broken hearted when household suffrage have become law of land while conservative cabinet conservative government be in possession of dominion in israel mr bonteen be disposed to think that trick be beyond conjuring power even of mr daubeny after know there be party said to mr ratler mr ratler face be a good a play if seen by party must have struck that party with dismay shame meaning of mr ratler face be plain enough thought so little of party on score of intelligence honesty fidelity a to imagine that must consent to be led whithersoever mr daubeny might choose to lead if care about anything be about church said mr bonteen there be something like great deal better than church said mr ratler indeed there be only one thing care about at now have given up old thing be very likely that if daubeny be to ask to vote for pulling down throne establishing republic 'd follow into lobby like sheep have be so knocked about by one treachery after that care now for anything beyond place be only few of get anything after yes do be just so much year want though who have wo like to part with like getting county garter promotion in army like brother to be made bishop sister like wardrobe bedchamber there be one of doe hang on somewhere at least not many do remember peel bill for corn law there be fifty went against then said bonteen be fifty man doe like to be one of fifty be too many for glory not enough for strength there have come up among general feeling that be just a well to let thing slide a yankee say be down hearted about enough within own house doubt what can do if hold back stout old cavalier here there may shut up in own castle tell that world around may go to wrack ruin that will not help evil work be shutting up look at old quin when carried reform bill men a rule like to be shut up how reconcile to conscience be what ca understand such be wisdom such be fear of mr ratler mr bonteen however must not bring to believe that arch enemy must on occasion be successful may be too hot for said mr bonteen when reviewed whole matter think will be too heavy who have mounted higher than mr ratler mr bonteen on political ladder who have mounted on same side be le astonished than inferior perhaps be equally disgusted though did not allow to express disgust a plainly mr gresham be staying in country with friend lord cantrip when tidings reached of mr daubeny speech to elector of east barsetshire mr gresham lord cantrip have long sat in same cabinet be fast friend understanding other view thoroughly trusting other loyalty mean said lord cantrip mean to see if be possible said other be thrown out a feeler to own party will do justice of saying that be not afraid of party if mean mean altogether will not retract even though party must refuse a body to support give other credit give mr gresham paused for few moment before answered know said whether be justified in thinking that one man will always be same daubeny have once be very audacious succeeded have two thing to help leader who though thoroughly trusted be very idle ill defined question when have won leader have won party have such tower of strength now in doing of thing if mean to do must encounter assured conviction of man on own side in upper lower house when told that must tap conservative element by reducing suffrage did not know whether to believe not there might be something in might be that must thus resume class of suffrage existing in former day have fallen into abeyance because not properly protected must teach to believe that might be so among who found necessary to free soul did so teach see how be to free soul when be invited to put down state establishment of church will find way for be possible be last man in world to contest possibility even expediency of change in political opinion know whether follows that because be brave successful once must necessarily be brave successful again man ride at outrageous fence by wonderful activity obedient zeal of horse be carried over in safety doe not follow that horse will carry over house that must be fool enough to ask beast to do so intends to ride at house said lord cantrip mean because others have talked of saw line rash young friend finn took at tankerville for nothing be not so sure of that say be like rest if daubeny doe carry party with suppose day of church be numbered what if be mr gresham almost sighed a said although intended to express certain amount of satisfaction what if be know know that thing have to be done may be own individual feeling even present judgment on subject a to of can perhaps say that mind be not so made up that may not soon be altered know that present union can not remain be unfitted for condition of humanity to be coming if so change must be for good why must not do a well a rather must not do better than if can do with le of animosity than must rouse against if blow must come softer from hand than from ours with le of feeling of injury to who dearly love church must not be glad that must undertake task then will not oppose ah there be much to be considered before can say that though may not be bound by friend may be bound by ours then though can hint to at certain condition of mind can sympathise with feeling that such may become condition of mind can not say must act upon a established conviction that can expect that will do so if such be political programme submitted to when house meet then must be prepared lord cantrip also paused moment before answered have answer ready can frankly say must follow leading must give voice for opposition voice be always persuasive said mr gresham consternation felt among mr daubeny friend be infinitely greater than fell among enemy when wonderful word be read discussed criticised explained seemed to clergyman in england that nothing short of disestablishment must be intended by be man to whom have looked for protection be bulwark of church to whom have trusted be hero who have be so sound so firm respecting irish establishment when evil counsel have be allowed to prevail in regard to ill used still sacred vineyard friend of church have then whispered among fearfully have with sad look grievous foreboding acknowledged that thin edge of wedge have be driven into very rock of establishment enemy of church be known to be powerful numerous of course unscrupulous surely brutus must not raise dagger against caesar yet if not what be meaning of word then men woman began to tell other men woman who be very salt of earth in england of ours brutus in spite of great quality have ever be mysterious unintelligible dangerous given to feat of conjuring have only be too submissive to brutus wonderful feat of conjuring have endured understanding nothing of manner in be performed nothing of probable result feat of conjuring must not endure so there be many meeting held about country though time for combined action be very short nothing more audacious than speaking of few word to bucolic elector of east barsetshire have ever be done in political history of england cromwell be bold when closed long parliament shaftesbury be bold when formed plot for lord russell others suffered walpole be bold when in lust for power discarded one political friend after peel be bold when resolved to repeal corn law in none of instance be audacity displayed more wonderful than when mr daubeny took upon to make known throughout country intention of abolishing church of england for to declaration did few word amount be now recognised parliamentary leader of party to church of england be essentially dear have achieved place by skill rather than principle by conviction on men mind that be necessary rather than that be fit still there be though have alarmed many have probably alarmed who followed by eccentric dangerous mode of carrying on battle though conservative regarded a safe yet on question of church have be believed that be sound what might be special idea of own mind regarding ecclesiastical policy in general have not be thought necessary to consider utterance have be confusing mysterious perhaps purposely unintelligible be matter of little moment so long a be prepared to defend establishment of church of england a institution adapted for english purpose on point be believed that be sound to mast be supposed have nailed own colour of party in defending that fortress be thought that must be ready to fall must defence of require fall be because be so far safe that be there yet spoke word without consulting single friend suggesting propriety of new scheme to single supporter knew what be doing be way in have thought best to make known to own follower not only that be about to abandon old institution that must do so too a regarded east barsetshire be returned feted sent home with ear stuffed with eulogy before bucolic mind have discovered purpose on so much have probably calculated have calculated also that after interval of three four day secret must be known to friend enemy on day after speech came report of in newspaper on next day leading article in world be told what be that prime minister have really said then on following day startled parson startled squire farmer above startled peer member of lower house whose duty be to vote a must lead be agog must be that newspaper be right in meaning have attached to word on day week after election in east barsetshire cabinet council be called in london at must of course be mr daubeny duty to explain to colleague what be that did purpose to do in meantime saw colleague two let look straight in face said to noble colleague must look in face before long need not hurry forward there be storm coming knew that before heard sound of from husting in country how will rule storm so that may pas over land without devastating if bring in bill bill for disestablishing church said horror stricken lord if bring in bill purport of will be to moderate ascendancy of church in accordance with existing religious feeling of population will save much that otherwise must fall if there must be bill must rather that must be modelled by who love church by who hate that lord be very wrath told right honourable gentleman to face that duty to party must have constrained to silence on subject till have consulted colleague in answer to mr daubeny said with much dignity must such be opinion of colleague in general must at once abandon high place held in council trusted that might be otherwise have felt bound to communicate idea to constituent have known that in doing so mind must be shocked trusted that might be able to allay feeling of dismay a regarded noble lord did succeed in lessening dismay before meeting be over though did not altogether allay gentleman who be in habit of sitting at mr daubeny elbow daily in house of common be much gentler with a to word manner be bold throw be afraid wo come up six said right honourable gentleman let come up five then be only chance have if think a do that be essentially necessary for welfare of country that must remain where be must run risk with colleague whose mind be really set on church be presumed to represent used argument be convinced at rate of said mr daubeny that by sacrificing something of ascendancy establishment be supposed to give can bring church love nearer to want of people so came about before cabinet met member of knew what be be expected of chapter vi phineas old friend phineas finn returned from tankerville to london in much better spirit than have accompanied on journey thither be not elected then before election have come to believe that be quite out of question that must be elected now did think probable that must get seat on petition scrutiny used to be very expensive business under existing law made a scrutiny must be in borough must cost little little must be successful must fall on shoulder of mr browborough must knock off eight vote lose none must be member for tankerville knew that many vote have be given for browborough if truth be known of must be knocked off did not know that same must be said of one of by have be supported unfortunately judge by whom must be decided might not reach tankerville in travel till after christmas perhaps not till after easter in meantime what must do with a for going back to dublin be now out of question have entered upon feverish state of existence in be impossible that must live in ireland must ultimately fail in regard to seat must vanish out of world while remained in present condition must not even endeavour to think how might in such case best bestow for present must remain within region of politics live a near a must to whirl of wheel of sound be so dear to of one club have always remained member have already be re elected member of reform so took up residence once more at house of certain mr mr bunce in great marlborough street with whom have lodged when first became member of parliament so be at old game mr finn said landlord yes at old game suppose be same with

have brought direct to if can learn anything of mr kennedy life of real condition pray do faint rumour reach be painfully distressing chapter vii coming home from hunting lady chiltern be probably right when declared that husband must have be made to be master of hound presuming to be granted that somebody must be master of hound such necessity certainly doe exist in present condition of england hunting prevails hunting men increase in number fox be preserved farmer rebel owner of covert even when be not hunting men acknowledge fact dare to maintain pheasant at expense of much better loved four footed animal hound be bred horse be trained specially to work master of fox hound be necessity of period allowing so much can not allow also that lord chiltern must have be made to fill situation understood hunting perhaps there be nothing else requiring acute intelligence that did understand understood hunting not only a huntsman understands in branch of science refers simply to judicious pursuit of fox being probably inferior to own huntsman in respect knew exactly what men must do what must not in regard to various interest with be brought in contact knew when to hold fast to own claim when to make claim at be afraid of one be possessed of sense of justice induced to acknowledge right of around when found that earth be not stopped in trumpeton wood from judged that keeper must complain that hound must not must not kill of cub found there wrote in very round term to duke who owned if grace did not want to have wood drawn let say so if did let have earth stopped when great question came up a to gartlow covert when uncommonly disagreeable gentleman mr smith of gartlow gave notice that hound must not be admitted into place at lord chiltern soon put whole matter straight by taking part with disagreeable gentleman disagreeable gentleman have be ill used men have ridden among young laurel if gentleman who did hunt so said lord chiltern to own supporter did not know how to conduct in matter of hunting how be to be expected that gentleman who did not hunt must do so on occasion lord chiltern rated own hunt so roundly that mr smith be quite in bond together gartlow covert be re opened now world know that gartlow covert though small be material a being in very centre of brake country be essential that master of hound must be somewhat feared by men who ride with there must be much awe mixed with love felt for must be man with whom other men will not care to argue irrational cut thrust unscrupulous yet distinctly honest man one who can be tyrannical will tyrannise only over evil spirit man capable of intense cruelty to alongside of who will know whether victim doe in truth deserve scalping before draw knife must be savage yet good humoured severe yet forbearing truculent pleasant in same moment must exercise unflinching authority must do so with consciousness that can support only by own popularity speech must be short incisive always to point never founded on argument rule be based on reason will never bear discussion must be most candid of men also most close yet never hypocrite must condescend to explanation yet must impress men with assurance that decision will certainly be right must rule a though man special welfare be of account yet must administer so a to offend none friend must have not favourite must be self sacrificing diligent eager watchful must be strong in health strong in heart strong in purpose strong in purse must be economical yet lavish generous a wind yet obdurate a frost must be assured that of human pursuit hunting be best that of living thing fox be most valuable must so train heart a to feel for fox mingled tenderness cruelty be inexplicable to ordinary men woman desire to preserve brute then to kill must be equally intense passionate must do in accordance with code of unwritten law can not be learnt without profound study may not perhaps be truly asserted that lord chiltern answered description in detail combined so many of quality required that wife showed discernment when declared that seemed to have be made to be master of hound early in november be riding home with miss palliser by side while huntsman whip be trotting on with hound before call that good run illustration adelaide palliser be matter with declare seems to that something be always wrong men like hunting better than anything else yet never find man contented in first place did kill know be short of fox at gartlow said miss palliser who a be manner with hunting lady liked to show that understood affair of hunt if knew there be one fox in county got upon one fox must like to kill one fox barring vixen in march thought very nice be fast enough for anybody might go a fast with drag if be will tell something else must have killed if maule have once ridden over hound when came out of little wood spoke very sharply to heard lord chiltern suppose thought be brute who did not particularly know men do say such thing to other doe mind fancy suppose man doe not like to be told directly show in run sport be over hound ought to be taken home did say that remember now what said know made angry come let trot on can take hound home without good night cox said miss palliser a passed by pack poor mr maule did pity do think doe care for though be so impassive must be with now only be chewing cud of unhappiness in solitude mile behind be hard upon hard upon lord chiltern be hard upon perhaps upon why must be hard upon hard upon must have said though why must be other way know be friend of yours certainly especial friend suppose a matter of course violet talk to about doubt doe when once woman be married must be regarded a having thrown off allegiance to own sex be sure to be treacherous at rate in one direction not that lady chiltern can tell anything of might not be told to world a far a be concerned there be nothing in then nothing at honour bright oh honour a bright a ever be in such matter a be sorry for very sorry why so lord chiltern because if be engaged to thought that perhaps might have induced to ride little le forward lord chiltern said miss palliser seriously will never again speak to word on subject except hunting at moment gerard maule came up behind with cigar in mouth apparently quite unconscious of of displeasure a to miss palliser have supposed that be chewing cud in solitude be goodish thing chiltern said very good hound hunted well to end very well be odd how scent will die away at moment see must carry on field after got out of copse not field considering thing be glad did kill uncommon glad said lord chiltern then trotted on in silence little way maule again dropped behind be blessed if know that spoke to roughly said chiltern be deaf think when chooses to be be not sorry lord chiltern not in least nothing will ever do good a for offending might a well swear at tree think to offend there be comfort in anyway wonder whether 'd talk to if went away hope that wo try experiment believe must 'd go at once wonder whether really do care for not in least for quite indifferent must say ca answer for lord chiltern quite a positively a can for know a thing go people have to play at caring for other be what call flirting just reverse flirting take to be excitement of love without reality without ordinary result in marriage playing at caring have none of excitement often lead to result sometimes end in downright affection if maule perseveres then will take by bye will come to like in twenty year might come to if be always to live in same house a leaf harrington to morrow may probably not meet other for next four year think chance be small then maule trotted up again after riding in silence with other two for hour pulled out case lit fresh cigar from end of old one threw away have baccy chiltern said thank never smoke going home mind be too full have family behind to think of be generally out of sort with misery of day must say word to cox must have to go to kennel on way home so dropped behind gerard maule smoked cigar before spoke word miss palliser be quite resolved that must not open mouth till have spoken suppose like said at last who like what mr maule chiltern like blowing fellow up be part of business be way look at must think must be disagreeable take deal of trouble about heard going on to day to one a though whole soul depended on be very energetic just so be quite sure be mistake doe man ever get by folk around soon discount till go for nothing think energy go for nothing mr maule bull in china shop be not useful animal be ornamental there can be doubt of energy hare be full of energy did win race man who stand still be man who keep ground stand still when be out hunting ride about chiltern swears at man be fool sometimes wisdom perfect at other time break down in hunting field in least mind chaffing know what think of just a well a though told what do think of that be poor creature generally half asleep willow pated slow blooded ignorant useless unambitious certainly unambitious mr maule that word carry others what be good of ambition there be man be talking about last night irishman mr finn yes phineas finn be ambitious fellow will have to starve according to what chiltern be saying have sense enough to know ca do good be sensible admit very well miss palliser can say just what like of course have privilege did not mean to say anything severe do admit that be master of certain philosophy for much may be said be not to expect that will express approval feel want to approve ah there fear can not oblige want to approve though one else may though else must do so can not then take task of curing sick one of strengthening weak one into own hand if will teach perhaps may learn have mission for teaching mr maule once said that be so ungenerous a to throw in teeth what once said if ever said word must not now repeat think that be ungenerous miss palliser be sure be not be confident be obliged to seek comfort from such scrap of encouragement a may have fallen in way here there once did think that intended to love doe love go by intention think so frequently with men much more so with girl will never go so with will never intend to love one if ever love man will be because be made to do so despite intention a fortress be taken well if like to put so only claim advantage can always get rid of enemy when bore be boring now did say so here be lord chiltern again know by rattle of horse foot that something be matter lord chiltern came up full of wrath one of men horse be thoroughly broken down a master said be worth saddle carried did care for horse man have told at rate there wo be anything to carry anybody by christmas will have to buy more said gerard maule buy more said lord chiltern turning round looking at man talk of buying horse a must sugar plum then trotted in at gate in two minute be at hall door chapter viii address before th of november day on parliament be to meet whole country be in hubbub consternation triumph be perhaps equally predominant equally strong there be who declared that now at length be great britain to be ruined in actual present truth who asserted that of sudden after fashion so wholly unexpected a to be divine a great fire great famine great war be called divine mighty hand have be stretched out to take away remaining incubus of superstition priestcraft bigotry under england have hitherto be labouring proposed disestablishment of state church of england be of course subject of diversity of opinion there be not only diversity with great confusion political feeling of country be a rule so well marked that be easy a to almost question to separate sheep from goat with few exception one can tell where to look for supporter where for opponent of one measure of meeting be called in in public hall to assist to combat minister of day men know what be about now be not so be understood that mr daubeny accredited leader of conservative be about to bring in bill one a yet knew who must support bill own party to man without single exception be certainly opposed to measure in mind must be so must not be certain that must hate individual sitting on conservative side in house did most certainly within own bosom cry ichabod when fatal news reached ear such private opinion inward wailing need not probably must not guide body ichabod have be cried before though probably never with such intensity of feeling disestablishment might be worse than free trade household suffrage be not more absolutely opposed to conservative conviction than have be great measure yet party a party have swallowed to first lesser evil compact little body of staunch commoner have stood forth in opposition nothing have come of to true briton beyond feeling of living in cold shade of exclusion when greater evil arrived that of household suffrage measure twenty year since must hardly have be advocated by advanced liberal of day conservative have learned to acknowledge folly of clinging to own conviction have swallowed dose without serious disruption of rank man with exception two took measure up with face so singularly distorted a to create true pity with assumption of indifference with affected glee in double process party have become used to mode of carrying on public service a poor old england must go to dog a doom have be pronounced against country that must be ruled by folly of many foolish not by wisdom of few wise why must few wise remain out in cold seeing a did that by so doing good must be done to country dissension among foe did when properly used give power such power must only use by carrying measure believed to be ruinous ruin must be a certain must abstain individual might have gloried in standing aloof in hiding face beneath toga in remembering that rome did once exist in splendour party can not afford to hide face in toga party have to be practical party can only live by having share of garter lord lieutenant bishop attorney general though country be ruined party must be supported party have be supported have latterly enjoyed almost share of star garter thanks to individual skill strategy of great english political von moltke mr daubeny now what must party say about disestablishment of church even party must draw line somewhere be bad to sacrifice thing mundane thing be very holy of holy be nothing to be conserved by conservative party what if mr daubeny be to explain day to elector of east barsetshire that hereditary peerage be absurdity what if in rural nook of boeotia must suggest in ambiguous language to farmer that republic be only form of government capable of logical defence duke have already said to duke earl to earl baronet to baronet that there must be line somewhere bishop a rule say little to other now be afraid to say anything church have be be so truly beloved surely that must be beyond line yet there crept through very marrow of party agonising belief that mr daubeny must carry bulk of party with into lobby of house of common if such be dismay of conservative how will writer depict consternation of liberal if there be feeling odious to mind of sober hardworking man be feeling that bread have earned be to be taken out of mouth pay patronage power pleasure of government be due to liberal god bless soul said mr ratler who always saw thing in practical light have larger fighting majority than party have have since lord liverpool time have right to attempt be bound to go out there be nothing of honesty left in politics said mr bonteen declaring that be sick of life barrington erle thought that whole liberal party must oppose measure though be liberal be not democrat yet infidel when barrington erle said great leader of liberal party have not a yet decided on ground of action there be much difficulty in reaching decision have be asserted so often that disestablishment of church be only question of time that intelligence of country have gradually so learned to regard who have said so men did not know did not inquire word be spoken everywhere parson with sad heart men who in own parish be enthusiastic pure pious useful whispered in dead of night to wife of bosom bishop who have become le pure by contact with world at club shrugged shoulder wagged head remembered comfortably sanctity of vested interest statesman listened to with politeness did not deny that be true in free intercourse of closest friendship matter be discussed between ex secretary of state press teemed with assertion that be only question of time fervent credulous friend predicted century of life hard hearted logical opponent thought that twenty year must put end to anomaly few stout enemy have sworn on hustings with anathema that present session must see deposition from high place of eldest daughter of woman of babylon none have expected blow so soon a none certainly have expected from hand what must liberal party do ratler be for opposing mr daubeny with force without touching merit of case be fitting work for mr daubeny suddenness of proposition coming from quarter must justify now for ever even though must disestablish everything before session be over barrington erle suffering under real political conviction for once in life be desirous of positive chivalric defence of church believed in twenty year mr bonteen shut up in disgust thing be amiss a thought evil be due to want of party zeal on part of own leader mr gresham did not dare to say lest when house door must at last be opened might not be invited to enter with others such be conviction if be little le in abstract little more in concrete must be better for laurence fitzgibbon when word have be whispered to by mr bonteen have hardly understood have be explained to that friend have meant men not measure when parliament met mr gresham leader of liberal party have not a yet expressed desire to general follower queen speech be read one paragraph seemed to posse great public interest be almost repetition of word mr daubeny have spoken to elector of east barsetshire will probably be necessary for to review connection still exists between bind together church state mr daubeny word have of course be more fluent gist of expression be same have be quite in earnest when addressing friend in country though there have be interval of few week conservative party in two house heard paragraph read without surprise without murmur said that gentleman on treasury bench in house of common did not look to be comfortable mr daubeny sat with hat over brow mute apparently impassive unapproachable during reading of speech moving seconding of address house be very full there be much murmuring on side of opposition from government bench hardly sound be heard a young gentleman from one of midland county in deputy lieutenant uniform who have hitherto be known for particular idea of own have be believed to be at rate true to church explained not in very clear language that time have at length come when interest of religion demanded wider support fuller sympathy than must be afforded under system of church endowment state establishment for country have hitherto be so grateful for country have such boundless occasion for gratitude gentleman in uniform of guard seconded address declared that in nothing be sagacity of legislature so necessary a in discerning period in that have hitherto be good ceased to be serviceable status pupillaris be mentioned be understood that have implied that england be now old enough to go on in matter of religion without tutor in shape of state church who make speech absolutely put together word be uttered when address be moved seconded can hardly be that lesson be prepared sent to noble lord honourable gentleman to be learned by heart like school boy task yet from construction style general tone from platitude contain a well a from general safety good sense of remark from absence of attempt to improve great occasion by fire of oratory one can not be convinced that very absolute control be exercised gorgeously apparelled speaker who seem to have great latitude allowed in matter of clothing have certainly very little in matter of language then always seems that of four might have made speech of of others must not have be case that hon colonel mowbray dick member for west bustard have really elaborated out of own head that theory of status pupillaris better fellow more popular officer sweeter tempered gentleman than mowbray dick doe not exist certainly never entertained advanced opinion respecting religious education of country when be at home with family always go to church there have be end of then fight began thunderbolt of opposition be unloosed fire of political rancour blazed high mr gresham rose to leg declared to world have hitherto kept secret from own party be known afterwards that in discussion with own dearly beloved political friend lord cantrip have expressed unbounded anger at duplicity greed for power want of patriotism displayed by opponent have acknowledged that blow have come so quick so unexpectedly that thought better to leave matter to house without instruction from now revelled in sarcasm before speech be over raged into wrath must move amendment to address for two reason first because be moment for bringing before parliament question of church establishment when a yet well considered opportunity of expressing on subject have be afforded to country secondly because measure of reform on matter must certainly not come to from right honourable gentleman opposite a to first objection must withhold argument till bill suggested have be presented to be in handling second that displayed great power of invective men who then sat in house who on night crowded gallery remember tone a turning to dissenter who usually supported pointing over table to opponent uttered that well worn quotation quod minime reris then paused began again quod minime reris graia pandetur ab urbe power inflexion of voice at word graia be certainly very wonderful ended by moving amendment to address asking for support equally from one side of house a from other when at length mr daubeny moved hat from brow rose to leg began by expressing thankfulness that have not be made victim to personal violence of right honourable gentleman continued same strain of badinage throughout in be thought to have be wrong a be method of defence attack for peculiar power hardly suited a to bill be to be laid upon table have not a yet produced did not doubt that dissenting interest of country must welcome relief from anomaly let come whence might even graia ab urbe waved hand back to clustering conservative who sat behind that right honourable gentleman must be angry must understand a return to power of right honourable gentleman party have be anticipated might almost say discounted a certainty then when mr daubeny sat down house be adjourned chapter ix debate beginning of battle a recorded in last chapter took place on friday friday th november consequently two entire day intervened before debate must be renewed there seemed to prevail opinion during interval mr gresham have be imprudent be acknowledged by men that finer speech than delivered by have ever be heard within wall of house be acknowledged also that a regarded question of oratory mr daubeny have failed signally strategy of minister be said to have be excellent whereas that of ex minister be very loudly condemned there be nothing so prejudicial to cause a temper man be declared to be unfit for position of note because always show temper anything can be done with man can be made to fit almost hole because have temper under command may indeed be assumed that man who loses temper while be speaking be endeavouring to speak truth such a belief to be again may be assumed that man who speaks constantly without losing temper be not always entitled to same implicit faith whether not be reason more for preferring calm tranquil man may be doubted calm tranquil man be preferred for public service want practical result rather than truth clear head be worth more than honest heart in matter of horseflesh of what use be to have manner of good gift if horse wo go whither want refuse to stop when bid mr gresham have be very indiscreet have especially sinned in opposing address without arrangement with party made matter worse by retreating within own shell during whole of saturday sunday monday morning lord cantrip be with three four time saw mr palliser who have be chancellor of exchequer under mr ratler went amidst congregation of liberal asked for support told ratler that wished gentleman to vote altogether in accordance with opinion came to be whispered in certain circle that have resigned be resigning must resign leadership of party men said that passion be too much for that be destroyed by feeling of regret almost of remorse minister held cabinet council on monday morning be supposed afterwards that also have be stormy two gentleman have certainly resigned seat in government before house met at four o'clock there be rumour abroad that others must do so if suggested measure must be found really to amount to disestablishment rumour be of course worthy of belief a transaction of cabinet be of necessity secret lord drummond at war office mr boffin from board of trade did however actually resign mr boffin explanation in house be heard before debate be resumed mr boffin have certainly not joined present ministry so said with view of destroying church have other remark to make be sure that house must appreciate course have induced to seat below gangway house cheered very loudly mr boffin be hero of ten minute mr daubeny detracted something from triumph by overstrained perhaps ironic pathos with deplored loss of right honourable friend service now right honourable gentleman have never be specially serviceable wonder of world arose from fact that only two gentleman out of twenty thirty who composed government did give up place on occasion be conservative government with what force of agony did ratlers of day repeat inappropriate name conservative yet be ready to abandon church at bidding of such man a mr daubeny ratler almost felt that loved church only two resignation whereas have be expected that whole house must fall to piece be possible that earl marquis two duke staunch old tory squire must remain in government pledged to disestablish church be honesty truth of great party confined to bosom of mr boffin lord drummond doubtless be esau must sell great birthright for so very small mess of pottage parson in country little squire who rarely come up to london spoke of exactly a did ratlers there be parish in country in mr boffin be canonised though up to date cabinet minister must well have be le known to fame than be mr boffin what must liberal do who must naturally rejoice in disestablishment of church member of lower house who have always spoken of ascendancy of protestant episcopacy with bitter acrimony of exclusion after success failure of mr daubeny must depend not on own party on must always be so when measure of reform be advocated by conservative ministry there will always be number of untrained men ready to take gift without looking at giver have not expected relief from hand of greek will take when come from greek trojan what must mr turnbull say in debate what mr monk mr turnbull be people tribune of day mr monk have also be tribune then minister now be again something le than tribune there be few men in house out of who regarded mr monk a honestest most patriotic politician of day debate be long stormy be peculiarly memorable for skill with mr daubeny higher colleague defended step be about to take thing be to be done in cause of religion whole line of defence be indicated by gentleman who moved seconded address active well supported church be chief need of prosperous intelligent people a to endowment there be confusion of idea nothing be to be done with inappropriate to religion education must receive bulk of what be left after existing interest have be amply guaranteed there must be doubt so said gentleman ample fund for support of episcopal church must come from wealthy member of body to whom church be dear there seemed to be conviction that clergyman under new order of thing must be much better off than under old a to connection with state time for have clearly gone by church a church must own increased power when must appoint own bishop be wholly dissevered from state patronage seemed to be almost matter of surprise really good churchman must have endured so long to be shackled by subservience to state of gentleman pleaded cause so well that almost made appear that episcopal ascendancy must be restored in england by disseverance of church state mr turnbull who be dissenter be at last upon leg then ratlers knew that game be lost must be lost a far a must be lost by majority in house on motion be by majority minority that mr daubeny must be maintained in high office ejected from mr turnbull began by declaring that did not at like mr daubeny a minister of crown be not in habit of attaching specially to minister of crown experience have taught to doubt of possible minister of crown at period mr daubeny be thought perhaps worst most dangerous thing now offered be too good to be rejected let come from what quarter must indeed might not be said of good thing obtained for people of really serviceable reform that be gathered garnered home in consequence of squabble of minister when men wanted power to grasp at to retain then offered bribe to people in taking of such bribe there be dishonesty must willingly take bribe mr monk spoke also must not said feel justified in refusing address to crown proposed by minister simply because address be founded on proposition of future reform a to expediency of have not

usually particular in matter of wine persisted in declining to have anything to do with after first attempt gloomy old servant who stuck to during repast persisted in offering a though credit of hospitality of loughlinter depended on there be so many men by whom tenuis ratio saporum have not be achieved that caleb balderstones of house in plenty doe not flow be almost justified in hoping that goblet of gladstone may pas current phineas finn be not martyr to eating drinking played with fish without thinking much about worked manfully at steak gave crumple to tart left without pang when old man urged for third time to take pernicious draught with cheese angrily demanded glass of beer old man toddled out of room on return proffered to diminutive glass of white spirit called usquebaugh

brentford now supposed that intended at future time to pay debt of phineas finn chapter have got seat when phineas returned to london autumn session though have be carried on so near to christmas a to make many member very unhappy have already be over for fortnight mr daubeny have played game with consummate skill to last have brought in bill have stated intention of doing so early in following session have said of course be aware from first that must have be quite impossible to carry measure a proposed during few week in have be possible for to sit between convening of parliament christmas holiday thought that be expedient that proposition must be named to house ventilated a have be so that member on side might be induced to give most studious attention to subject before measure must be so momentous must be proposed to a have happened unforeseen division to house have be pressed on address have proved that majority of house be in favour of great reform be object of ambition to complete be aware that have be assembled at somewhat unusual inconvenient period of year because service of country have demanded that certain money bill must be passed however rejoiced greatly that earliest opportunity have be afforded to of explaining intention of government with have honour of being connected in answer to there arose perfect torrent of almost vituperative antagonism from opposite side of house did right honourable gentleman dare to say that question have be ventilated in country when have never be broached by of follower till after general election have be completed be not notorious to country that first hint of have be given when right honourable gentleman be elected for east barsetshire be not equally notorious that election have be so arranged that marvellous proposition of right honourable gentleman must not be known even to own party till there remained possibility of expression of condemnation from hustings might be that right honourable must so rule own follower in house a to carry with even in matter so absolutely opposite to own most cherished conviction certainly seemed that have succeeded in doing so for present must one believe that must have carried country have dared to face country with measure in hand ventilation indeed have not dared to ventilate proposition have used short session in order that might keep clutch fastened on power in doing so be indifferent alike to constitution to party to country harder word have never be spoken in house than be uttered on occasion minister be successful have be supported on address went home to east barsetshire at christmas perhaps with little fear of parson around with full conviction that must at least carry second reading of bill london be more than usually full busy year immediately after christmas seemed a though be admitted by liberal party generally that sadness of occasion ought to rob season of usual festivity who must eat mince pie think of twelfth night while so terribly wicked scheme be in progress for keeping real majority out in cold be injustice of thing rankled so deeply that sense of inferiority to cleverness displayed by mr daubeny be a when player be checkmated by audacious combination of two pawn knight such being remaining force of victorious adversary when beaten man have two castle queen upon board be indeed worse than for adversary have appropriated to own use castle queen of unhappy vanquished one church reform be legitimate property of liberal have not be a yet used by only because have felt right to keep in background for future great occasion so great so valuable piece of ordnance be so safely that must afford to bide time then so said so of believed country be not ready for so great measure must come there must be tenderness in mode of producing parson must be respected great church of england feeling of people must be considered with affectionate regard even most rabid dissenter must hardly wish to see structure so nearly divine attacked destroyed by rude hand with grave slow sober earnestness with loving touch soft caressing manipulation let beautiful old church be laid to rest a something too exquisite too lovely too refined for present rough manner of world such be idea a to church reform of leading liberal of day now man without even majority to back audacious cagliostro among statesman destructive leader of declared conservative have come forward without moment warning pretended that must do thing out of hand men knew that have to be done country have begun to perceive that old establishment must fall knowing must not liberal backbone of great britain perceive enormity of cagliostro wickedness rise against bury beneath scorn a ought to do be feeling made real christmas impossible to messrs ratler bonteen one thing incredible to said mr ratler be that englishman must be so mean be alluding to conservative who have shown intention of supporting mr daubeny whom accused of doing so simply with view to power patronage without regard to own consistency to welfare of country mr ratler probably did not correctly read mind of men whom be accusing did not perceive a must have done with experience how little there be among of concerted action to defend church be duty to of then so also be duty to support party one must see way to one duty whereas other be vague too probably ultimately impossible if be proper to throw off incubus of conjuror authority surely wise great bold man must get up so declare junto of wise men of party must settle that must be deposed where be to look for wise bold men where even for junto of whom did party consist of honest chivalrous enthusiastic men mainly of men who be idle unable to take upon own shoulder responsibility of real work leader have be selected from outside clever eager pushing men of late have be hardly selected from among a used to be case with italian power entrusted cause to mercenary foreign general soldier of fortune who carried good sword whither be wanted a of old leader be ever ready to fight must declare what must be what must not be casus belli there be not so much meanness a mr ratler supposed in conservative rank very much more unhappiness must not be better to go home live at family park year round hunt attend quarter session be able to declare morning evening with clear conscience that country be going to dog such be mental working of many conservative who supported mr daubeny on occasion at instance of lady laura phineas called upon duke of st bungay soon after return be very kindly received by grace in former day when there be whig instead of liberal be almost rule of political life that leading whig must be uncle brother in law cousin to other be pleasant gave great consistency to party system have now gone out of vogue there remain of however trace so that among nobler born liberal of day there be still good deal of agreeable family connection in way st bungay fitz howard be related to mildmays standish man a barrington erle be sure to be cousin to of lady laura have thus only sent friend to relation of own a duke phineas have be in same government grace be glad enough to receive returning aspirant of course there be something said at first a to life of earl at duke recollected occasion of such banishment shook head attempted to look unhappy when wretched condition of mr kennedy be reported to be essentially happy man shook off gloom at once when phineas spoke of politics so be coming back to mr finn tell may perhaps get seat be heartily glad for be very useful remember how cantrip almost cried when told be going to leave have be rather put upon fancy before there be perhaps something in grace there will be nothing to return to now beyond barren honour not for while not for long while said duke for long while be a candidate for office regard time mr daubeny will be safe for session at least doubt whether will really attempt to carry measure year will bring forward after late division must get second reading will then break down gracefully in committee declare that importance of interest concerned demand further inquiry be thing to be done in one year why must do at asked phineas be what everybody asks answer seems to be so plain because can do ca will get from side much support must get none from there be something to sickening in dishonesty said phineas energetically country have advantage know that be dishonest ought to come to deadlock in legislation in order that party might fight out battle till one have killed other think man must support measure belief to be destructive doe believe to be destructive belief be theoretic not even quite that be hardly more than romantic a long a acre be dear can retain belonging to country gentleman will never really believe country to be in danger be same with commerce a long a three per cent really mean four per cent may say a long a mean five per cent country will be rich though one must swear that be ruined be very glad at same time that call conservative said phineas show how disinterested be a certainly must be in office good bye come see duchess when come to town if have nothing better to do give day two at longroyston at easter now longroyston be duke well known country seat at whig hospitality have be dispensed with lavish hand for two century on th january phineas travelled down to tankerville again in obedience to summons served upon at instance of judge who be to try petition against browborough be special somewhat unusual nature of petition that complainant not only sought to oust sitting member also to give seat to late unsuccessful candidate there be to be scrutiny by if must be successful so great number of vote must be deducted from polled on behalf of unfortunate mr browborough a to leave majority for opponent with additional disagreeable obligation upon of paying cost of transaction by must thus lose seat mr browborough doubt looked upon whole thing with greatest disgust thought that battle when once won must be regarded a over till occasion must come for battle have spent money like gentleman hated mean way one must ever say that have ever petitioned that be way of looking at that shibboleth of a to prospect of england church of people have doubt made house le agreeable to during last short session than usual have stuck to party voted with mr daubeny on address obligation for such vote having inconveniently pressed upon before presentation of petition have be formally completed have always stuck to party be pride of life that have be true consistent also be summoned to tankerville be forced to go although knew that shibboleth must be thrown in teeth mr browborough spent two three very uncomfortable day at tankerville whereas phineas be triumphant there be worse thing in store for poor mr browborough than repudiated shibboleth even than lost seat mr ruddle acting with wondrous energy succeeded in knocking off necessary vote succeeded also in proving that vote be void by reason of gross bribery astonished phineas by cool effrontery with took credit to for not having purchased vote in fallgate on liberal side phineas be too wise to remind that have hinted at one time that must be well to lay out little money in way one at present moment be more clear than be ruddle a to necessity of purity at election not penny have be misspent by finnites vote two from score be knocked off on ground did not touch candidate agent one man have personated vote appeared to have be done at instigation of very cunning browborough partisan man have be wrongly described however amounted to nothing phineas finn be seated for borough judge declared purpose of recommending house of common to issue commission with reference to expediency of instituting prosecution mr browborough left town in great disgust not without various publicly expressed intimation from opponent that prosperity of england depended on church of people phineas be gloriously entertained by liberal of borough then informed that a so much have be done for be hoped that must now open pocket on behalf of charity of town gentleman said phineas to one two of leading liberal be a well that must know at once be very poor man leading liberal made wry face phineas be member for borough moment that decision be announced phineas shaking off for time congratulatory friend hurried to post office sent message to lady laura standish at dresden have got seat be almost ashamed of a telegraph boy looked up at when gave in word be task must not have entrusted to one else almost thought that be in truth proudest happiest moment of life must so thoroughly enjoy triumph must receive from such great unselfish joy that almost wished that must have taken message surely have done so there must have be fit occasion for embrace be again member of british house of common be again in possession of privilege for have never ceased to sigh since moment in lost drunkard gambler may be weaned from way not politician to have be in house not to be there be to one a phineas finn necessarily state of discontent now have worked way up again be determined that fear for future must harass must give heart soul to work while money lasted must surely last for session be alone in world must trust to chapter of accident for future never knew fellow with such luck a yours said barrington erle to on return to london seat always drop into mouth when circumstance seem to be most forlorn have be lucky certainly cousin laura kennedy have be writing to about went over to see know so heard talk nonsense about earl being willing to do anything for must earl do have more influence in loughton borough than have kind of thing be clean done for with one two exception got much better men while lasted than do now must doubt that did much truer men men who went straighter by bye phineas must have trick on church matter mean to do can to throw out second reading know what said at hustings d hustings know what browborough said browborough voted like man with party be against church at hustings be for will vote just other way there will be little confusion people of tankerville will never remember particular know that can do by heaven if will never more be officer of ours though laura kennedy must

must like that much better than poisoning hound trapping fox when got to meet conclave of men might be seen gathered together here there in conclave be telling something new something old a to iniquity perpetrated at trumpeton wood on evening before dinner madame goesler be told by hostess that phineas finn be expected on following day communication be made quite a matter of course lady chiltern have chosen time in light be shaded room be dark adelaide palliser be present a be also certain lady baldock not that lady baldock who have abused all papist to poor phineas son wife be drinking tea together over fire dim light be removed from circle doubt be simply accident gloom served madame goesler during one moment of embarrassment old friend of yours be coming here to morrow said lady chiltern old friend of mine will call friend remember mr finn be moment in madame goesler rejoiced that strong glare of light fell upon face be woman who must not long leave subject to such

communication must be made to phineas so that might not come across madame goesler unawares lady chiltern be more alive to necessity than have be to other felt that gentleman if not warned of what be to take place must be much more likely than lady to be awkward at trying moment madame goesler must in circumstance be sure to recover self possession very quickly even be to lose for moment so much must hardly be said for social power of phineas finn lady chiltern therefore contrived to see alone for moment on arrival who do think be here lady laura have not come indeed wish have old friend not so old a laura can not guess not lord fawn lord fawn what must lord fawn do here know that lord fawn go nowhere since last matrimonial trouble be friend of yours not of mine madame goesler whispered

none at only be surprised did know be coming told yesterday hope have not done wrong made thing unpleasant knew that used to be friend a friend parted lady chiltern have nothing more to say in matter have must not tell story of what have taken place between lady must not keep from surmising that something have taken place have known must have prevented from bringing two together at harrington madame goesler when be dressing acknowledged to herself that have task before must require tact courage certainly must not have accepted lady chiltern invitation have known that must encounter phineas finn at house have twenty four hour to think of at one time have almost made up mind that sudden business must recall to london of course motive must be suspected of course lady chiltern must connect departure with man arrival even bad a must be might be preferable to meeting what fool have be so accused in not foreseeing that accident might happen knowing a did that phineas finn have reappeared in political world that chiltern people have ever be fast friend a have thought about lying awake at night have told that must certainly be recalled back to london by business must telegraph up to town raising question about trifle on receipt of answer must be off with something of excuse shame of running away from man seemed to be worse evil than shame of meeting have in truth done nothing to disgrace in desire to save man whom have loved from ruin thought have threatened have offered hand have made offer have refused be must not be driven to confess to herself that have ever fled from face of man woman man must be again in london must not always fly must be only necessary that must maintain own composure misery of meeting must pas away after first few minute one consolation be assured to thoroughly believed in man feeling certain that have not betrayed must not betray now a time for meeting drew near a stood for moment before glass pretending to look at in order that maid might not remark uneasiness found that courage great a be hardly sufficed almost plotted scheme of headache by might be enabled not to show till after dinner be so blind can hardly see out of eye said to maid actually beginning scheme woman assumed look of painful solicitude declared that madame did not look quite best suppose will shake off said madame goesler then descended stair illustration suppose will shake off condition of phineas finn be almost a bad have much le protracted period of anticipation than with lady be tormented be sent up to dress for dinner with knowledge that in hour must find in same room with madame goesler there must be question of running away possibility even of escaping by headache may be doubted whether dismay be not even more than hers knew that must teach to use other than fitting word be almost sure that must break down if attempted to speak to must be safe from blushing must assuredly become a red a turkey cock comb up to root of hair blood must be under control must be coursing hither through vein so a to make utterly unable to rule nevertheless also plucked up courage descended reaching drawing room before madame goesler have entered chiltern be going on about trumpeton wood to lord baldock be renewing fury against pallisers while adelaide stood by laughed gerard maule be lounging on chair wondering that man must expend such energy on subject lady chiltern be explaining merit of case to lady baldock who knew nothing about hunting other guest be listening with eager attention certain mr spooner who rode hard did nothing else who acted a unacknowledged assistant master under lord chiltern there be such man in hunt acted a chorus indicated chiefly with dumb show strong point of case finn how be said lord chiltern stretching out left hand glad to have back again congratulate about seat be put down in red herring found nearly dozen of afterwards enough to kill pack picked up nine said mr spooner child might have picked up quite a well eaten said lady chiltern did care about continued master now have wire trap over whole place palliser friend of yours be finn of course knew when be in office know what may be in office be uncommon bad sort of fellow to have in county shameful said mr spooner lifting up hand be first cousin know whispered adelaide to lady baldock if be own brother grandmother must say same continued angry lord must have meeting about let world know be at moment door be again opened madame goesler entered room when one want to be natural of necessity one becomes reverse of natural clever actor more frequently clever actress will assume appearance very fact of assumption render reality impossible lady chiltern be generally very clever in arrangement of little social difficulty have thought le about might probably have managed present affair in easy graceful manner thing have weighed upon mind have decided that must be expedient that must say something when two old friend first met other again in drawing room madame max said remember mr finn lord chiltern for moment stopped torrent of abuse lord baldock made little effort to look uninterested quite in vain mr spooner stood on one side lady baldock stared with eye with feeling of instinct that there must be something to see gerard maule rising from sofa joined circle seemed a though lady chiltern word have caused formation of ring in midst of phineas madame goesler be to renew acquaintance very well indeed said madame max putting out hand looking full into hero face with sweetest smile hope mr finn will not have forgotten did admirably so well that surely need not have thought of running away poor phineas be not happy will never forget said then that unavoidable blush suffused face blood began to career through vein be so glad be in parliament again said madame max yes have got in again after struggle be still living in park lane oh yes will be most happy to see then seated a did also lady chiltern by side see poor duke iniquity be still under discussion hope lord chiltern recognises great happiness of having grievance must be pity so great blessing must be thrown away upon for moment madame max have got through difficulty indeed have done so altogether till moment must come in must find alone with phineas slunk back from gathering before fire stood solitary silent till dinner be announced became fate to take old woman into dinner who be not very clearsighted did know lady before asked oh yes knew two three year ago in london do think be pretty certainly men say so never can see have be saying ever so long that old duke of omnium mean to marry on deathbed suppose there can be anything in why must put off for so very inopportune occasion asked phineas chapter xvi copperhouse cross broughton spinnies after thing have not be so very bad with little courage hardihood can survive very great catastrophe go through even without broken bone phineas when got up to room found that have spent evening in company with madame goesler have not suffered materially except at very first moment of meeting have not said word to lady except such a be spoken in mixed conversation with others have be together bone have be broken must not be that old intimacy must be renewed must now encounter in society a fate might direct without renewal of feeling of dismay have be so heavy on be about to undress when there came knock at door host entered room what do mean to do about smoking lord chiltern asked nothing at there be fire in smoking room be tired want to go to bed baldock doe smoke gerard maule be

chiltern to cox huntsman to two whip at last to mr spooner may have specially led to remark on occasion lord chiltern be very short with not loving lady gertrude cox bestowed upon two lady then turned from to peccant hound spooner be partly gratified partly incapable underwent long course of question about duke poisoning lady gertrude whose father seemed to have owned covert in ireland have never before heard of such enormity suggested round robin must not be at ashamed to put own name to oh for matter of said spooner chiltern can be round enough without robin ca be too round said lady gertrude with very serious aspect at last moved away phineas found riding by side of madame goesler be natural that must do so a have come with maule have of course remained with miss palliser

remedying evil when be told that friend horse be perfect only that doe that there come weight on mind from be unable to release can not discount trouble at percentage may amount to absolute ruin a far a day be concerned in such circumstance always look forward to worst when groom have done description phineas finn must almost have preferred day canvas at tankerville under mr ruddle authority to present position when hound entered broughton spinnies phineas madame goesler be still together have not be riding actually at side morning many men two three lady have be talking to have never be far from in ruck now be again close by horse head broughton spinnies be in truth series of small wood running one into almost without intermission never thick of breadth there be always litter two of cub at place in part of brake country be greater care taken in way of preservation encouragement to interesting vixen lying be bad there be little real covert fox be very apt to travel get away into big wood belonging to duke where a brake sportsman now believed must almost surely come to untimely end if draw blank know what be to do said mr spooner addressing to madame goesler with lachrymose anxiety have nothing else to draw asked phineas in common course of thing must take muggery gorse so on to trumpeton wood muggery be on duke land chiltern be in such fix wo go there unless ca help muggery gorse be only mile side of big wood fox of course go to big wood asked madame max not always often come here a ca hang here have whole country before get a good run from muggery a from covert in country chiltern wo go there to day unless hound show line by george be fox be dido be find spooner galloped away a though dido must hing with fox have found unless be there to help spooner be quite right a generally be on such occasion knew hound even by voice knew what hound must believe most hound will lie occasionally dido never lied there be many besides spooner who believed in dido whole pack rushed to music though body of must have remained utterly unmoved at voice of le reverenced le trustworthy colleague whole wood be at once in commotion men woman riding hither thither not in accordance with judgment a saw thought saw others riding who be supposed to have judgment to get away well be so very much to get away well be often so very difficult there be so many thing of horseman be bound to think in moment way doe wind blow then though fox will not long run up wind will break covert up wind a often a not from of various ride can find fair exit into open country without chance of breaking neck before run begin when hear wild halloa informing that one fox have gone in direction exactly opposite to in hound be hunting be sure that noise be not made about second fox on matter be bound to make up mind without losing moment if make up mind wrongly five pound have invested in day amusement will have be spent for nothing phineas madame goesler be in very centre of wood when spooner rushed away from down one of ride on hearing dido voice at time be in crowd almost immediately fox be seen to cross ride body of horseman rushed away in direction knowing that covert be small there animal must soon leave wood then there be shout of away repeated over over again lord chiltern running up like flash of lightning passing two friend galloped down third ride to right of others phineas at once followed master of pack madame goesler followed phineas men be still riding hither thither farmer meeting with horse turned back towards centre of wood be leaving halloaed out a passed that there be way out at bottom met man in pink who screamed out something a to devil of bank down there chiltern however be still going on hero have not heart to stop horse in gallop turn back from direction in hound be running at moment hardly remembered presence of madame goesler did remember word have be said to about dandolo did not in least doubt that chiltern have chosen direction rightly that if be once out of wood must find with hound what if brute must refuse to take out of wood that dandolo be very fast soon became aware for gained upon friend before a neared fence then saw what there be before new broad ditch have be cut with express object of preventing egress ingres at point great bank have be constructed with clay in probability there might be ditch on other side chiltern however have clearly made up mind about horse be riding went at gallantly cleared first ditch balanced for moment on bank then with fresh spring got into field beyond tail hound be running past outside covert master have placed exactly right for work in hand how excellent must be condition of finn if only dandolo must do just a chiltern horse have done before phineas almost began to hope that might be so horse be going very well very willingly head be stretched out be pulling not more however than pleasantly seemed to be a anxious a rider there be little twitch about ear rider did not like then be impossible not to remember awful warning given by groom be only sometimes sir after what fashion must phineas ride at obstacle did not like to strike horse seemed to be going well be unwilling a be good rider to use heel so spoke to proposed to lift at ditch to very edge horse galloped too fast indeed if meant to take bank a chiltern horse have done then stopping so suddenly that must have shaken joint in body planted fore foot on very brink there stood with head down quivering in muscle phineas finn following naturally momentum have be given to went over brute neck head foremost into ditch madame max be immediately off horse oh mr finn be hurt phineas happily be not hurt be shaken dirty not so shaken not so dirty that be on leg in minute imploring companion not to mind go on going on doe seem to be so easy said madame goesler looking at ditch a held horse in hand to go back in such circumstance be terrible disaster amount to complete defeat be tantamount to confession that must go home because be unable to ride to hound man when be compelled to do be almost driven to resolve at spur of moment that will give up hunting for rest of life if one thing be more essential than other to horseman in general be that not animal ride will be master best thing be to stick at till do groom have said phineas resolved to be guided by groom first duty be to attend on madame goesler with very little assistance be again in saddle at once declared certain that horse must take fence phineas again instantly jumped into saddle turning dandolo again at ditch rammed rowel into horse side dandolo must not jump yet stood with fore foot on brink when phineas with whip struck severely over shoulder went down into ditch on four then scrambled back again to former position what infernal brute said phineas gnashing teeth be little obstinate mr finn wonder whether 'd jump if gave lead phineas be again making attempt urging horse with spur whip voice have brought now to condition in man be utterly reckless a to falling even to kind of fall may get if can only force animal to make attempt dandolo must not make attempt with ear down head outstretched either stuck obstinately on brink allowed to be forced again again into ditch let try once mr finn said madame goesler in quiet way be riding small horse very nearly thoroughbred known a perfect hunter by who habitually saw madame goesler ride doubt must have taken fence readily enough have rider followed immediately after lord chiltern dandolo have baulked at fence nearly dozen time evil communication will corrupt good manner without show of violence still with persistent determination madame goesler horse also declined to jump put at again again must make slightest attempt to do business phineas raging fuming out of breath miserably unhappy shaking rein plying whip rattling about in saddle banging leg against horse side again again plunged away at obstacle be to purpose dandolo be constantly in ditch sometimes lying with side against bank have now be so hustled driven have be on other side must have have breath left to carry rider even in ruck of hunt in meantime hound leading horseman be far away never more to be seen on day by phineas finn madame max goesler for while during frantic effort be made occasional tardy horseman be viewed galloping along outside covert following track of who have gone before before frantic effort have be abandoned a utterly useless vestige of morning work have left neighbourhood of broughton spinnies except two unfortunate one at last be necessary that defeat must be acknowledged be beaten madame goesler said phineas almost in tear altogether beaten mr finn have good mind to swear that will never come out hunting again swear what like if will relieve only think of keeping such oath have known before to be depressed by circumstance quite a distressing a to be certain that hope be over yet have recovered be only allusion have yet made to former acquaintance now must think of getting out of wood have slightest idea of direction of anything have a clearly ca get out way might a well try other come along will find somebody to put in right road for part be glad be worse thought at one time that be going to break neck rode on for few minute in silence then spoke again be not odd mr finn that after have come gone must find riding about broughton spinnies together chapter xvii madame goesler story after have come gone be not odd that must find riding about broughton spinnies together be question madame goesler asked phineas finn when have agreed that be impossible to jump over bank out of wood be of course necessary that answer must be given to when saw last in london said phineas with voice be gruff manner be abrupt certainly did not think that must meet again so soon left a though have ground for quarrelling there be quarrel wrote to tried to explain that did though answer be necessarily short be very grateful here be back among doe seem so odd lady chiltern never told be to meet did tell be better so for otherwise must not have come then perhaps must have be alone in discomfiture at bank must have be very bad see can be quite frank with mr finn be heartily glad to see must not have come have be told when did see be quite improbable that must be thrown together a be now be not ah here be man can tell way back to copperhouse cross suppose have better ask for harrington hall at once man knew nothing at about harrington hall very little about copperhouse did direct on to road found that be about sixteen mile from lord chiltern house hound have gone away in direction of trumpeton wood be agreed that must be useless to follow waggonette have be left at inn about two mile from copperhouse cross resolved to abandon to ride direct to harrington hall be now nearly three o'clock must not be subjected to shame fall upon sportsman who be seen riding home very early in day to get lost before twelve then to come home be very degrading thing at time after two may be supposed to have ridden run of season to be returning after excellent day work then madame goesler began to talk about to give short history of life during last two half year did in frank natural manner continuing tale in low voice a though be almost matter of course that must make recital to so old friend phineas soon began to feel that be natural that must do so be just before left said that duke took to coming to house duke spoken of be duke of omnium phineas well remembered to have heard rumour about duke madame max have be hinted to that duke wanted to marry lady that rumour have never believed reader if have duly studied history of age will know that duke did make offer to madame goesler pressing with eloquence that madame goesler on mature consideration thought best to decline to become duchess of however reader who understands madame goesler character will be quite sure that did not say word to phineas finn since business have be completed have spoken of to one to lady glencora palliser who have forced into knowledge of circumstance while be being acted met duke once at matching said phineas remember well be there first made duke acquaintance on occasion know how be that became intimate did then formed sort of friendship with lady glencora somehow have come about have be great deal together since suppose like lady glencora very much indeed duke too truth be mr finn let one boast a one may of one independence very often do boast of mine to myself one be inclined to do more for duke of omnium than for mr jones duke have more to offer than jones mean in way of wealth only of what one enjoys most in society generally suppose have at rate be glad that must make excuse for do like man be gracious noble in bearing be now very old sinking fast into grave even wreck be noble know that ever did much said phineas know that ever did anything according to idea of doing there must be men who hing man with wealth rank have opportunity so great look at nephew doubt mr palliser be great man never have moment to speak to wife to anybody else be always thinking so much about country doubt if know anything about own affair of course be man of different stamp of higher stamp if will have idea that such character a of present duke be necessary to maintenance of great aristocracy have have power of making world believe in simply because have be rich duke nephew when come to title will never receive tithe of respect have be paid to old faineant will achieve much more than ten time reputation said phineas wo compare will argue like duke nay love during last two year have allowed whole fashion of life to be remodelled by intimacy knew what be habit have only be in vienna for one week since last saw have spent month month at matching what do do there read to talk to give food do that in lie to make life bearable last year when be thought necessary very distinguished people must be entertained at great family castle in barsetshire know have heard of place regular treaty agreement be drawn up condition be sealed signed one condition be that lady glencora must be there put head together to try to avoid a of course prince must not want to see particularly be altogether so grand affair thing have to be weighed duke be inexorable lady glencora at time must have other thing to do must be there gatherum castle must not be opened suggested whether must not remain in background look after duke a kind of upper nurse lady glencora said must not do why must subject to such indignity simply from love of man see be not subjected for two day wore jewel beneath royal eye eye will sooner later belong to absolute majesty be awful bore ought to have be at vienna ask why did fact be that thing sometimes become too strong for one even when there be real power of constraint for year past have be used to have own way when there came question of entertainment of royalty found reduced to blind obedience have to go to gatherum castle to absolute neglect of business went do still keep up oh dear yes be at matching now doubt whether will ever leave again will go there from here a matter of course relieve guard with lady glencora see what get for get what must get believe in friendship then certainly do friendship be so unequal can hardly understand that must have grown from personal liking on side think have said madame goesler slowly see mr finn a young man can hardly understand how natural be that young woman if may call young must minister to old man there must be bond to old man there be bond must not be angry with said phineas be not in least angry must not venture to express opinion of course only that ask do ask be quite welcome to express opinion be not expressed must know what thought just same have wondered at sometimes must have become a be engulfed in new life almost without will of own when dy how will return to other life of course have house in park lane still very maid talk of matching a home how will be when have gone ah how indeed lady glencora will have to curtsey to other there will be end of will be duchess then will no longer be wanted even if be wanted oh of course must last duke time last no longer must not be healthy kind of life be not that do very best to make evening of day pleasant for in way to be of service in world have done good to think have in small degree sacrificed let see be to turn here to left go to copperhouse cross doubt be not odd must have told history just because brute must not jump over fence dare say must have told even if have jumped over certainly have be great opportunity do tell friend lord chiltern not to abuse poor duke more before dare say host be right in what say like will come see in london mr finn will be at matching do get few day at home sometimes see have escaped for present otherwise must not have come to grief together in broughton spinnies soon after be overtaken by others who be returning home who have be more fortunate than in getting away with hound fox have gone straight for trumpeton wood not daring to try gorse on way then have be run to ground chiltern be again in towering passion a earth said have be purposely left open on matter men who have overtaken friend be of opinion that chiltern be wrong have allowed to be understood that must not draw trumpeton wood have therefore no right to expect that earth must be stopped there be have be various opinion on difficult point a law of hunting be complex recondite numerous traditional not always perfectly understood perhaps day may arrive in will be codified under care of great laborious master of hound did nothing more asked phineas yes chopped fox before left place so that in point of fact have drawn trumpeton did mean when madame max goesler phineas have reached harrington hall be able to give own story of day sport to lady chiltern a remainder of party have not a yet returned chapter xviii spooner of spoon hall adelaide palliser be tall fair girl exquisitely made with feminine grace of motion highly born carrying always warranty of birth in appearance with special loveliness of face let not reader suppose that therefore be plain possessed much more than sufficiency of charm to justify friend in claiming a beauty demand have be generally allowed by public opinion adelaide palliser be always spoken of a girl to be admired be not one whose countenance must strike with special admiration beholder who did not know eye be pleasant bright being in truth green might perhaps with propriety be described a grey nose be well formed mouth be perhaps too small teeth be perfect chin be somewhat too long be on account defective feature of face hair be brown plentiful in way peculiar doubt wore chignon if so wore with special view of being in degree remarkable in reference to head dress such a be beauty beauty own mind on subject be made up have resolved long since that gift of personal loveliness have not be bestowed upon yet after fashion be proud of own appearance knew that looked like lady knew also that have that command of health strength can give to woman when be without feminine affectation lady chiltern in describing to phineas finn have said that talked italian wrote for time former assertion be doubt true a miss palliser have passed year of childhood in florence latter statement be made probably with reference to capability rather than performance lady chiltern intended to imply miss palliser be so much better educated than young lady in general that be able to express intelligibly in own language have be well educated must no doubt have done time credit have time chosen to employ be youngest daughter of youngest brother of existing duke of omnium first cousin therefore of mr plantagenet palliser who be eldest son of second brother a mother have be bavilard there must be no better blood adelaide have be brought up so far away from lofty pallisers lofty bavilards a almost to have lost flavour of birth father mother have died when be infant have gone to custody of much older half sister mr atterbury whose mother have be not bavilard brown mr atterbury be mere nobody rich erudite highly accomplished gentleman whose father have made money at bar whose grandfather have be country clergyman mr atterbury with husband be still living at florence adelaide palliser have quarrelled with florence life have gladly consented to make long visit to friend lady chiltern in florence have met gerard maule acquaintance have not be viewed with favour by atterburys mr atterbury knew history of maule family declared to sister that good must come from intimacy old mr maule said be disreputable mr maule mother who according to mr atterbury have be only worthy member of family be long since dead gerard maule sister have gone away with irish cousin be now living in india on professional income of captain in foot regiment gerard maule younger brother have gone utterly to dog nobody knew anything about maule abbey family seat in herefordshire be so said mr atterbury absolutely in ruin furniture a world knew have be sold by squire creditor under sheriff order ten year ago not chair table have be put into house since time property be small l year at outside be doubt entailed on eldest son gerard fortunately have small fortune of own independent of father then be also spendthrift so said mr atterbury keeping stable full of horse for must not afford to pay be moreover most insufferably idle man who ever wandered about world without visible occupation for hour hunt said adelaide do call that occupation asked mr atterbury with scorn now mr atterbury painted picture copied madonna composed sonata corresponded with learned men in rome berlin boston have be intimate friend of cavour have paid visit to garibaldi on island with view of explaining to real condition of italy be supposed to understand bismarck be possible that woman who so filled own life must accept hunting a creditable employment for young man when be admitted to be sole employment moreover desired that sister adelaide must marry certain count brudi who according to belief have more advanced idea about thing in general than other living human being adelaide palliser have determined that must not marry count brudi have indeed almost determined that must marry gerard maule have left brother in law house in florence after something like quarrel mr atterbury have declined to authorise visit to harrington hall then adelaide have pleaded age independence be own mistress if so chose to call must not at rate remain in florence at present moment to receive attention of signor brudi of previous winter have passed three month with relative in england there have learned to ride to hound have first met gerard maule have made acquaintance with lady chiltern gerard maule have wandered to italy after appearing at florence in desultory way having definite purpose not even that of asking adelaide to be wife still pursuing a though wanted without knowing what wanted in course of spring however have proposed have be almost accepted adelaide though must not yield to sister have be frightened knew that loved man swore to herself thousand time that must not be dictated to by sister be prepared to accept fate must at once be hers be now to marry gerard maule what must do with man who have idea of own a to what ought to do with lady chiltern be in favour of marriage fortune said be a much a adelaide be entitled to expect man be gentleman be tainted by vice be truly in love have better let fight out somewhere else lord chiltern have said when wife proposed that invitation to gerard maule must be renewed lady chiltern have known that if fought out at must be fought out at harrington hall have asked to come back said to adelaide in order that may make up mind if chooses to come will show that be in earnest then must take make understand that be not to be taken gerard maule have chosen to come adelaide palliser have not a yet quite made up mind perhaps there be nothing so generally remarkable in conduct of young lady in phase of life of be now speaking a facility may almost be said audacity with do make up mind young man seek young woman hand in marriage because have waltzed stoutly with talked pleasantly between dance young woman give almost with gratitude a to young man readiness of action be le marvellous than hers mean to be master by very nature of joint life propose to lead must take to sphere of life not bind to hers if worked before will work still if be idle before will be idle still probably doe in sort make calculation strike balance between mean proposed additional burden of wife child knowing nothing take monstrous leap in dark in everything be to be changed in everything be trusted to chance miss palliser however differing in from majority of friend acquaintance frightened perhaps by representation of sister to must not altogether yield have paused be still pausing where must go live if did marry said to lady chiltern suppose have opinion of own on subject not in least must think have never said anything about oh dear matter have not got so far a at must ever out of own head if be married taken away to train must only ask what place must take ticket for when got to station must manage to live at maule abbey perhaps might only there be furniture a be told only roof doe seem to be absurd that two must not make up mind just a other people do said lady chiltern of course be not rich man have known that along be not question of wealth poverty of utterly lack daisical indifference to everything in world be not indifferent to be marvellous part of said miss palliser be said on evening of famous day at broughton spinnies late on night lord chiltern predicted to wife that episode be about to occur in life of friend what do think have just asked permission to fight duke mr palliser be nothing about hunting want to know if 'd mind staying here three four day longer what very odd request be odd because be to have gone to morrow suppose there be objection of course not if like to have like bit said lord chiltern must turn out know what mean what doe mean have observed anything have observed nothing in mr spooner except awe struck horror at trapping of fox be going to propose to adelaide palliser oswald be not in earnest believe be must have told if thought must give slightest encouragement ca very well turn out now will get answer that wo like if doe said lady chiltern miss palliser have ridden well on day so have gerard maule that mr spooner must ride well to hound be quite matter of course be business of life to do so did with great judgment hated maule style of riding considering to be flashy injurious to hunting unsportsmanlike now have come to hate man have of course perceived how close be attention paid by mr maule to miss palliser thought that perceived that miss palliser did not accept with thorough satisfaction on way back to harrington hall made inquiry be taught to believe that mr maule be not man of very high standing in world mr spooner have very pretty property of own be own there be doubt about furniture about roof at spoon hall be spooner of spoon hall have be high sheriff for county be not so young a once have be be still young man only just turned forty be own master in everything must read always looked at country newspaper book be thing that must bear to handle did think have ever seen girl sit horse better than adelaide palliser sat hers girl who rode a did must probably like man addicted to hunting mr spooner knew that understood hunting whereas fellow maule cared for nothing jumping over flight of rail asked few question that evening of phineas finn respecting gerard maule did not get much information know where life said phineas never saw till met here think seems sweet upon girl must wonder if be be uncommonly clean built young woman be said mr spooner seems to care much for master maule did see how be riding to day did see anything mr spooner did get away wish 'd be with went uncommon well after that made request to lord chiltern lord chiltern with foresight quite unusual to predicted coming event to wife there be shooting on following day gerard maule mr spooner be out lunch be sent down to covert side lady walked down joined sportsman on occasion mr spooner assiduity be remarkable seemed to be accepted with kindly grace adelaide even asked question about trumpeton wood expressed opinion that cousin be quite wrong because did not take matter up know be keeper do said mr spooner shaking head with appearance of great wisdom never can have fox unless keep keeper well in hand if drew spoon hall covert blank 'd dismiss man next day illustration know be keeper do all might be fault know mind will take care that there be fox have be at stick covert three time year put brace out time leash went from last monday week when man really mean thing miss palliser can pretty nearly always do miss palliser replied with smile that thought that to be true mr spooner be not slow at perceiving that afforded good encouragement to in regard to matter be now weighing most heavily upon mind on next day there be hunting again phineas be mounted on

be to be feared that made extremely disagreeable to poor lady chiltern to whom be intending to open heart must only find opportunity for so much a lady chiltern be determined not to have confidence at last withdrew from scene in order that might not be entrapped before lunch have come party knew what be to happen except adelaide too perceived that something be in wind that there be stir discomfort secret affair forward event expected made uneasy did connect with presence of mr spooner in pitiable ignorance of fact be clear enough to everybody else went on watching wondering with half formed idea that house must be more pleasant a soon a mr spooner must have taken departure be to go after lunch on such occasion there be of course latitude after lunch may be stretched at rate to five o'clock tea at three o'clock mr spooner be still hanging about madame goesler phineas with openly declared intention of friendly intercourse have gone out to walk together lord lady baldock be on horseback two three old lady hung over fire gossiped lady chiltern have retired to baby when on sudden adelaide palliser declared intention of walking into village might accompany miss palliser said mr spooner want walk above thing be very brave persevered though be manifest that lady did not desire company adelaide said something about old woman whom intended to visit whereupon mr spooner declared that visiting old woman be delight of life must undertake to give sovereign to old woman if miss palliser must allow to come be very brave persevered in such fashion that carried point lady chiltern from nursery window saw start through shrubbery together have be waiting for opportunity morning said mr spooner gallantly in spite of gallantry although have known almost from breakfast time that have be waiting for something still did not suspect purpose have be said that mr spooner be still young being barely over forty year of age have unfortunately appeared to be old to miss palliser to seemed a though fountain of youth be still running through vein though have given up schooling young horse must ride a hard a ever must shoot day must take whack of wine a called sit up smoking night be on next morning after early breakfast without slightest feeling of fatigue be red faced little man with broad shoulder clean shaven with small eye nose on incipient pimple began to show to comrade of life be almost a young a have ever be young lady of county called old spooner regarded a permanent assistant unpaid huntsman to brake hound be not within compass of miss palliser imagination to conceive that man must intend to propose to a lover have be waiting for opportunity morning said mr spooner adelaide palliser turned round looked at still understanding nothing ride at fence hard enough chance be will get over harder ride heavier fall if get fall greater chance of getting over have be precept in life of mr spooner verified by much experience have resolved that must be guided by on occasion ever since first saw miss palliser have be so much taken by that in point of fact love better than woman in world ever saw will will be mr spooner have at rate ridden hard at fence there have be no craning looking about for easy place hesitation a brought horse up to man ever rode straighter than did on occasion adelaide stopped short on path stood opposite to with finger inserted between closed button of frock coat mr spooner exclaimed adelaide be quite in earnest miss palliser man ever be more in earnest can offer comfortable well furnished home undivided heart good settlement embarrassment on property be fond of country life will adapt to in everything reasonable be mistaken mr spooner be indeed how mistaken mean that be altogether out of question have surprised so much that must stop sooner pray speak of again be little sudden what be man to do if will only think of ca think of at there be need for thinking really mr spooner ca go on with if must mind turning back will walk into village by mr spooner however did not seem inclined to obey injunction stood ground when moved on walked on beside must insist on being left alone said have done anything out of way said lover think be very much out of way have hardly ever spoken to before if will only leave now there will not be word more said about mr spooner be man of spirit be not in least ashamed of what have done said might a well go away when ca be of use know why must be of use miss palliser be man of good property great great grandfather lived at spoon hall have be there ever since mother be one of platter of platter house see that have done anything out of way a for shilly willying hanging about never knew good come from let quarrel miss palliser say that will take week to think of wo think of at wo go on walking with if will go one way mr spooner will go other then mr spooner waxed angry why be to be treated with disdain said want to treat with disdain only want to go away seem to think that be something something altogether beneath so in truth did miss palliser have never analysed own feeling emotion about spooners whom met in society probably conceived that there be people in world who from certain accident be accustomed to sit at dinner with who be more fitted for intimacy than be servant who waited upon such people be to little more than table chair with be brought in contact be person with whom seemed to to be impossible that must have anything in common who be inferior a completely a be menial around why must thus despise mr spooner while in heart of heart loved gerard maule must be difficult to explain be not simply affair of age of good look altogether of education gerard maule be by mean wonderfully erudite be addicted to hunting of did anything useful in respect mr spooner stood higher a managed own property successfully gerard maule so wore clothes so carried limb so pronounced word that be to be regarded a one entitled to make love to lady whereas poor mr spooner be not justified in proposing to marry woman much more gifted than own housemaid such at least be adelaide palliser idea think anything of kind said only want to go away will go back to house hope wo accompany if do will turn other way whereupon did retire at once be left standing in path there be seat there sat down for moment to think of must persevere in suit must rejoice that have escaped from such ill conditioned minx remembered that have read in younger day lover in novel generally do persevere that be almost always successful at last in affair of heart such perseverance be thought correct thing in instance conduct of lady have not given slightest encouragement when horse balked with at fence be habit to force animal till jumped a groom have recommended phineas to do when have encountered decided fall be not sensible practice to ride horse at same place again there be probably occult cause for failure must not own that have be thrown on present occasion upon whole thought that have better give up found way back to house put up thing got away to spoon hall in time for dinner without seeing lady chiltern of guest illustration sat down for moment to think of what have become of mr spooner maule asked a soon a returned to harrington hall nobody know said lady chiltern believe have gone have anything happened have heard tidings if ask for opinion think something have happened certain lady seems to have be ruffled certain gentleman have disappeared be inclined to think that few unsuccessful word have be spoken gerard maule saw that there be smile in eye be satisfied dear what did mr spooner say to during walk question be asked by ill natured old lady in presence of nearly party be talking of hunting said adelaide did poor old woman get half sovereign forgot that did not go into village at be tired came back poor old woman poor mr spooner everybody in house knew what have occurred a mr spooner discretion in conduct of affair have not be equal to

debt mr kennedy have declared to be quite indifferent about though sum be large whole thing be explained to be satisfied before year be over complained to papa then papa chiltern together raised money l be paid to mr kennedy have written more than once to papa lawyer to say that though money be altogether useless to will not return penny of because by doing so must seem to abandon right nobody have

must be of service to be indeed of men least fitted to give counsel in present emergency seemed to that a be safe from attack on person need only remain at dresden answering letter by what softest negative must use be clear to that in present condition must take step whatever in regard to money must be left to conscience to time to chance a to threat of publicity probability thought be that must lead to nothing doubted whether respectable newspaper must insert such statement a suggested be published evil must be borne diligence on part on part of lawyer must prevent what have meant when wrote of continual sin sin not to be avoided of sin repeated daily nevertheless weighed to ground be expected of that must answer portion of letter amounted to passionate renewal of declaration of affection for have made at koenigstein have pervaded whole life since period antecedent to wretched marriage phineas a thought of tried to analyse nature of love also in old day have loved have at once resolved that must tell so though hope of success have be poor indeed have taken first opportunity have declared purpose with imperturbable serenity of matured kind hearted woman have patted on back a be a told of existing engagement with mr kennedy must be that at moment must have loved a now said did that must have be so cold so calm so kind while at very moment coldness calmness kindness be thin crust over so strong passion how different have be own love have be neither calm kind have felt for day two to be so terribly knocked about that world be nothing to for month two have regarded a man peculiarly circumstanced marked for misfortune for solitary life then have retricked beam before twelve month be passed have almost forgotten love knew now thought that knew that continued indulgence of hopeless passion be folly opposed to very instinct of man woman weakness showing want of fibre of muscle in character here be woman who must calmly conceal passion in early day marry man whom did not love in spite of who must make heart feeling feminine delicacy subordinate to material consideration nevertheless must not rid herself of passion in course of year although felt existence to be intolerable burden on conscience on side lay strength of character on side weakness be strong be tried to examine own feeling in regard to thing be so long ago that be to a aunt sister so much elder a to be almost venerable acknowledged to feeling made incumbent upon to spend in service must serve by work of be must be devoted to owed never dying gratitude be free to marry again to morrow knew that must not marry have said same thing have said that must be sister have specially required of that must make known to wife must ever marry again have declared that be incapable of further jealousy yet now told of daily sin of conscience must not assoil phineas said voice close to ear be repenting sin oh certainly what sin be barrington erle know that be going to hing to morrow continued so be told will let address pas almost without word gresham will simply express determination to oppose church bill to knife mean to be very plain spoken about may be merit of bill must be regarded a unconstitutional effort to retain power in hand of minority coming from such hand a of mr daubeny take will go at length into question of majority show how inexpedient be on behalf of nation that ministry must remain in power who can not command majority in house on ordinary question know whether will do to morrow at second reading of bill quite agree with of course do everybody agrees with gentleman can have doubt on subject personally hate idea of church reform dear old mildmay who taught know hate too mr gresham be head of party now much a may differ from on many thing be bound to follow if proposes church reform in time anything else will support know be idea of course be there be other idea on thing can be made to work be not that men get drilled into by force of circumstance government in country must be impossible be not so what must come to queen must find justified in keeping in set of minister who must get favour ambitious men must prevail without support from country queen must submit to dictation from quarter must submit to advice certainly cavil at word when know to be true said barrington energetically constitution of country requires that must submit to dictation can come safely from other quarter than of majority of house of common think not be agreed about not single man in house must dare to deny if be so what man in sens can think of running counter to party belief to be right in general view man so burthened with scruple a to be unable to act in way must keep aloof from public life one can not serve country in parliament though may possibly do so with pen ink in closet wonder then that must have asked to come forward again after what did about irish land question said phineas first fault may be forgiven when sinner have in other respect be useful long short of be that must vote with against daubeny bill browborough see plainly enough supported chief in teeth of protestation at tankerville be not browborough half so good man if desert said barrington erle with anger say nothing about have idea of duty have mine will go so far a have not yet made up mind will ask advice must not quarrel with if say must seek from one who be le distinctly partisan than be from monk yes from mr monk do think will be bad for country that measure must come from hand of mr daubeny then why d must support oppose own party at same time after ca do well ratler guide philosopher how be going to be mr ratler have joined be still standing before seat occupied not condescending to sit down in amicable intercourse with man a to whom did not yet know whether to regard a friend foe will be very quiet for next month six week said ratler then asked phineas well then will depend on may be number of few insane men who never ought to have seat in house such a mr monk mr turnbull now be well known that gentleman who be recognised a leading men be strong radical be supposed that must support bill come whence might must separate church state such a mr monk said ratler will grant that turnbull may be exception be business to go in for everything in way of agitation at rate be consistent when man have once be in office why then when have taken shilling said phineas just so confess like deserter phineas will be right said barrington erle hope so said mr ratler a passed on ratler run very much in same groove said barrington fancy there be little difference in motive power ratler want place so do want just a most men want professional success said phineas if understand object be chiefly maintenance of old established political power of whig believe in family do believe in patriotism of certain family believe that mildmays fitzhowards pallisers have for century brought up child to regard well being of country a highest personal interest that such teaching have be generally efficacious of course there have be failure child wo learn lesson however well may be taught school in good training be most practised will a rule turn out best scholar in way believe in family have come in for of teaching expect to see scholar yet house met on following day address be moved seconded there be debate there be not even full house same ceremony have taken place so short time previously that whole affair be flat uninteresting be understood that nothing must in fact be done mr gresham a leader of side of house confined to asserting that must give firmest opposition to proposed measure be seemed so popular with gentleman who sat on other side who supported so called conservative government of day reason for doing so have be stated very lately must unfortunately be repeated very soon must not therefore now trouble house with did not on occasion explain idea a to majority address be carried by seven o'clock in evening mr daubeny named day month hence for first reading of bill be asked cause of delay by member on back bench because can not be ready sooner said mr daubeny when honourable gentleman have achieved position will throw upon responsibility of bringing forward great measure for benefit of country will probably find expedient to devote little time to detail if will be le anxious to avoid attack than be minister can always give reason if be clever can generally when doing so punish man who asks for punishing of influential enemy be indiscretion obscure questioner may often be crushed with good effect mr monk advice to phineas be simple agreeable intended to support mr gresham of course counselled friend to do same supported daubeny on address before christmas said phineas will therefore be bound to explain why oppose now task will not be difficult queen speech to parliament be in judgment right therefore concurred in address certainly can not trust mr daubeny with church reform know that many will make same distinction will do so phineas soon found sitting in house a though have never left absence have not be long enough to make place feel strange to be on leg before fortnight be over asking question of minister of course insinuating a did so that minister in question have be guilty of enormity of omission commission came back upon a though have be born to very manner a became known to ratlers that meant to vote right on great coming question to vote right to speak right in spite of doings at tankerville everybody be civil to mr bonteen did express opinion to mr ratler that be quite impossible that phineas finn must ever again accept office a of course tankervillians must never replace in seat after manifest apostasy to pledge mr ratler seemed to think very little of that wo remember lord bless then be one of fellow always get in somewhere be not man particularly like will always see in house up down know when fellow begin early have got in be hard to shake off thus even mr ratler be civil to hero lady laura kennedy letter have of course be answered not without very great difficulty dear laura have begun for first time in life have told to treat a brother must do thought best to comply with instruction beyond till declared at end to be hers affectionately made further protestation of affection made allusion to sin weighed so heavily on answered question advised to remain at dresden assured that power must be used to enforce return expressed belief that mr kennedy must abstain from making public statement suggested that if be made answering of must be left to family lawyer in regard to money thought impossible that step must be taken then told there be to tell of lord lady chiltern something also of when letter be written found that be cold almost constrained to own ear did not sound like hearty letter of generous friend savoured of caution with have be prepared what must do must not sin against increase difficulty if addressed with warm affection be to say word ought not to be addressed to woman might do irreparable injury yet tone of own letter be odious to chapter xxi mr maule senior life of mr maurice maule of

going to be married to be married tone in mr maule senior repeated word be much same a might be used by ordinary father if son expressed intention of going into shoe black business yes sir be kind of

tell of course know that can hing for suppose that can do anything for a far a own welfare go if have large fortune have fortune fortune two three thousand pound perhaps then look upon a act of simple madness can only say that a such will treat have nothing in power therefore can neither do good harm will not hear particular can only advise to break off let trouble be what may certainly will not do sir then have nothing more to say ask to be present ask to see have heard name yet care one straw what name be be adelaide palliser adelaide muggins must be exactly same thing to dear gerard have lived too long in world to believe that men can coin into money noble blood of well born wife twenty thousand pound be worth more than blood of howard wife even with twenty thousand pound must make poor embarrassed half famished man then suppose will be whole famished a certainly have not got quarter of sum doubt will yet sir married men with family have lived on income on le than quarter of very respectable man who brush clothes doubt doe so then see have be brought up in way suppose that a bachelor put by year at least income never put by shilling sir indeed owe few hundred pound yet expect to keep house over head expensive wife family with lady maid nurse cook footman groom on sum have be hitherto insufficient for own want did think be such idiot boy thank sir what will dress cost have not slightest idea dare say not probably be horsewoman a far a know anything of life be sphere in will have made lady acquaintance doe ride doubt so do will be very easy to say whither will ride together if be fool enough to get married can only advise to hing of kind be there anything else there be much more to be said if gerard must succeed in forcing father to hear mr maule who have hitherto be standing seated a asked that last question took up book have be prepared for morning delectation be evidently intention that son must leave news have be communicated to have said that must say on subject have at once determined to confine to general view of matter to avoid detail might be personal to gerard have be specially required to force father into detail have be left to must certainly have thought that conversation have gone far enough be inclined almost a well a father to avoid present discomfort when miss palliser have suddenly almost suddenly accepted when have found describing prospect of life in presence in of lady chiltern question of maule abbey inheritance have of necessity be discussed at maule abbey there might be found home for married couple so thought lady chiltern only fitting home mr maule father certainly did not desire to live there probably arrangement might be made for repairing house furnishing with adelaide money then if gerard maule must be prudent give up hunting farm little if adelaide must do own housekeeping dress upon forty pound year if must both live exemplary model energetic strictly economical life end might be made to meet adelaide have be quite enthusiastic a to forty pound have suggested that must do for thirty housekeeping be matter of course more so a leg of mutton roast boiled must be beginning end of to adelaide discussion have be exciting pleasurable have be quite in earnest when looking forward to new life at maule abbey after there must be such great difficulty for young married couple to live on l year with house garden of own there must be carriage man servant till till old mr maule be dead suggestion a to ultimate desirable haven be wrapped up in ambiguous word property must be day suggested lady chiltern if outlive father take for granted then know so lady chiltern went on dilating upon future state of squirearchal bliss rural independence adelaide be enthusiastic gerard maule after have assented to abandonment of hunting much a man assent to being hung when antecedent of life have put option in matter out of power have sat silent almost moody while joy of coming life be described to lady chiltern however have be urgent in pointing out to that scheme of living at maule abbey must not be carried out without father assistance knew that mr maule must not be affected by matter also knew that have very little power in reference to property plan must not be matured without sanction from therefore there be still much more to be said when father have completed exposition of view on marriage in general wanted to speak to about property said gerard have be specially enjoined to be staunch in bringing father to point what about property of course marriage will not affect interest must say not must be very odd if did a be income be much larger than mine know how be sir suppose will not refuse to give helping hand if can do so without disturbance to own comfort in what sort of way think anything of kind can be managed better by lawyer if there be thing hate be business gerard remembering promise to lady chiltern did persevere though perseverance went much against grain with thought sir that if must consent might live at maule abbey oh did did be there objection simply fact that be house not yours belongs suppose to property a a what asked father turning upon son with sharp angry eye with something of real animation in face gerard be very awkward in conveying meaning to father a continued a must come to suppose day will be proper sort of thing that must live there then thought that must agree that if went lived there now must be good sort of thing to do be idea talked over with friend lady chiltern indeed be so much obliged to friend lady chiltern for interest take in affair pray make compliment to lady chiltern tell at same time that though doubt have one foot in grave must like to keep house for other foot though too probably may never be able to drag so far a maule abbey think of living there dear boy if will inquire among friend may happen to know who understand world better than lady chiltern seems to do will tell that son must not suggest to father abandonment of family property because father may probably soon be conveniently got rid of under ground there be thought of such thing said gerard be decent say that with due deference to lady chiltern better judgment be not kind of thing that men do care le about than most men even object to proposition when be made so openly doubt be old assertion mr maule made in weak quavering voice showed that have intention be way turned in youth might probably have earned bread on stage nobody thought of being old sir sha last long of course be poor feeble creature while do live must prefer not to be turned out of own house if lady chiltern must be induced to consent to arrangement doctor seems to think that might linger on for year two with great care father know be thinking of nothing of kind wo act king prince further if please prince protested very well if remember right father pretended to believe in weak state have rather upset if have objection must choose to be left to recover little be that will say to good heaven what more can want will not consent to give up house at maule abbey for use a long a live will do if choose to marry wife starve wo think that reason why must starve too will do friend lady chiltern may go be d d will do good morning sir good morning gerard so interview be over gerard maule left room father a soon a be alone immediately lit cigarette took up french novel went to work a though be determined to be happy comfortable again without losing moment found to be beyond power have be really disturbed must not easily compose cigarette be almost at once chucked into fire little volume be laid on one side mr maule rose almost impetuously from chair stood with back to fire contemplating proposition have be made to be actually true that have be offended by very faint idea of death have be suggested to by son though be man bearing palpable sign of decay in excellent health with good digestion who might live to be ninety did not like to be warned that heir must come after claim have be put forward to maule abbey by son have rested on fact that when must die place must belong to son fact be unpleasant to lady chiltern have spoken of behind back a being mortal in doing so have be guilty of impertinence maule abbey doubt be ruined old house in never thought of living be not let to tenant by creditor of estate only because condition be unfit for tenancy now mr maule began to think whether might not possibly give lie to people who be compassing death by returning to hall of ancestor if not in bloom of youth still in pride of age why must not live at maule abbey if successful marriage must be effected almost knew well enough to be aware that month at maule abbey must destroy be proper thing for man of fashion to have place of own have always be alive to glory of being mr maule of maule abbey in preparing way for marriage be to come must be so known to be spoken of a father of maule of maule abbey must have be fatal to to be father of married son at be disagreeable therefore when communication be made to have managed to be very unpleasant a for giving up maule abbey fretted fumed a thought of proposition through hour must have be to hour of enjoyment anger grew hot against son a remembered that be losing at last however composed sufficiently to put on with becoming care luxurious furred great coat

mr slide still professed to protect existing right of people to demand new right for people did so a conservative have watched progress of thing have perceived that duty called upon to be organ of mr daubeny duty performed with great zeal with assumption of consistency infallibility be charming doubt somewhat difficult task of veering round without inconsistency without flaw to infallibility be eased by mr daubeny newly declared view on church matter people banner must still be genuine people banner in reference to ecclesiastical policy a be now subject mainly discussed by newspaper change made be almost entirely confined to lauding of mr daubeny instead of mr turnbull other slight touch be doubt necessary mr daubeny be head of conservative party in kingdom though mr slide might be of men in kingdom most democratic even most destructive still be essential that mr daubeny organ must support conservative party round became mr slide duty to speak of men a heaven born patriot whom have designated month two since a bloated aristocrat leech fattened on blood of people of course remark be made by brother of press remark be intended to be very unpleasant one evening newspaper took trouble to divide column of own into double column printing on one side of inserted line remark made by people banner in september respecting duke of marquis of sir be certainly very harsh on other side remark equally laudatory a to character of same titled politician journalist with tact experience of mr quintus slide knew business too well to allow to be harassed by such small stratagem a that did not pause to defend boldly attacked meanness duplicity immorality grammar paper type wife of editor of evening newspaper in storm of wind in rowed be unnecessary for to defend own conduct then said at close of very virulent successful article hireling of dare to accuse of inconsistency reader of people banner thought that editor have beaten adversary out of field mr quintus slide be certainly well adapted for work must edit paper with clear appreciation of kind of matter must best conduce to success must write telling leading article be indefatigable unscrupulous devoted to paper perhaps great value be shown most clearly in distinct appreciation of low line of public virtue with reader must be satisfied highly wrought moral strain must knew well create disgust ridicule if

put down that property in land must be taken away from men who be enabled by such property to live in idleness what must be done with land when so taken away be question have not yet learnt to answer at present moment be accustomed to say very hard word of mr slide behind back because of change have be effected in people banner certainly be not man to shrink from asserting in person presence aught that said in absence well mr conservative slide said stepping into little back parlour in editor be left while mr bunce went up to learn whether member of parliament must receive visitor none of chaff bunce have enough of chaff anyhow mr slide still see banner mr slide most day just for joke of a long a take bunce care what reason be suppose heditor about same a cabinet minister have got to keep

want be progress be about mr slide where be to get did ever hear that rose by other name 'd smell a sweet if can get progress from conservative want progress why not go to conservative for who

be shown up into room first greeting be very affectionate at rate on part of editor grasped young member hand congratulated on seat began work a though have never be kicked out of very same room by present occupant now want to know what be come about doubt will hear in good time mr slide be important matter so will say when do hear be one in know whether will be able to see way quite clear will do best if concern doe so saying mr slide who have seated in arm chair by fireside opposite to phineas crossed leg folded arm on breast put head little on one side sat for few moment in silence with

sin be for man to forgive a hope for forgiveness expatiated on absolute almost divine right be intended that husband must exercise over wife quoted old new testament in proof of assertion then went on to say that appealed to public sympathy through public press because owing to gross insufficiency in law of extradition must not call upon magistracy of foreign country to restore to erring wife thought that public opinion if loudly expressed must have effect upon upon father private word must not produce wonder very greatly that must put letter a into type said phineas when have read why

loughlinter have taken mr kennedy to macpherson hotel phineas when called at about three o'clock on sunday afternoon be at once informed by mr macpherson mr kennedy be nae doubt at hame be nae willing to see folk on saaboth phineas pleaded extreme necessity of business alleging that mr kennedy must regard nature a sufficient justification for such sabbath breaking sent up card then there came down

door kennedy though be awkward still succeeded in firing before friend must leave room phineas heard thud of bullet knew that must have passed near head be not struck however man frightened at own deed abstained from second shot loitered long enough in remorse to enable prey to escape with three four step phineas leaped down stair finding front door closed took shelter within mr macpherson bar man be mad said did not hear shot woman be too frightened to reply stood trembling holding phineas by arm there be nobody in house said two lass nae doobt laird by ordinaire said at last have known of pistol have not dared to have removed macpherson have only feared that must hurt have at last agreed a day after day passed without injury from weapon to let thing remain unnoticed have heard shot have be sure that one of two men above must have be killed illustration then sir will abide wrath phineas be now in great doubt a to what duty be required of first difficulty consisted in that hat be still in mr kennedy room that mr macpherson altogether refused to go fetch while be still discussing phineas have not a yet resolved whether must first get policeman go at once to mr low bell from room be rung furiously be laird said mr macpherson if naebody wait on will surely be shooting ane of two girl be now outside bar shaking in shoe evidently unwilling to face danger at last door of room above be opened hero hat be sent rolling down stair be clear to phineas that man be so mad a to be not even aware of act have perpetrated will hing more with pistol said unless must attempt to destroy at last be determined that one of girl must be sent to fetch macpherson home from scotch church that application must be made at once to police seemed that macphersons knew circumstance of guest family that there be cousin of in london who be only one with whom seemed to have near connection thing have occurred be to be told to cousin phineas left address so that if must be thought necessary might be called upon to give account of affair then in perturbation of spirit asked for glass of brandy having swallowed be about to take leave brandy wull be saxpence sir said mr macpherson a wiped tear from eye having paid for refreshment phineas got into cab have driven to mr low house have escaped from peril now again became strongest object to stop publication of letter slide have shown a sat in cab must not hinder from shuddering at danger have be so near to remembered sensation a first saw glimmer of barrel of pistol then became aware of man first futile attempt afterwards saw flash heard hammer fall at same moment have once stood up to be fired at in duel have be struck by ball nothing in encounter have made feel sick faint through muscle a have felt just now a sat in cab be aware that for spirit have swallowed must be altogether overcome doubted even now whether must be able to tell story to mr low luckily perhaps for mr low wife be at home be out together be expected in

end of hour heart be beating so violently that must hardly control motion of own limb low have be shot at by madman said a soon a friend entered room have determined to be calm to speak much more of document in editor hand than of attempt have be made on own life have be utterly unable to repress exclamation shot at yes by robert kennedy man who be chancellor of duchy almost within yard of head then sat down burst out into fit of convulsive laughter story about pistol be soon told mr low be of opinion that phineas must not have left place without calling in policeman giving account to of transaction have something else on mind said phineas made necessary must see at once something more important even than madman attack upon have written most foul mouthed attack upon wife be already in print will fear be published to morrow morning then told story of letter slide doubt will be at people banner office to night can see there perhaps when tell have occurred will consent to drop publication altogether in view of matter mr low did not agree with visitor argued case with deliberation to phineas in present state of mind be almost painful if whole story of what have occurred be told to quintus slide that worthy protector of moral caterer for amusement of public must mr low thought at once publish letter give statement of occurrence at macpherson hotel there must be nothing to hinder from so profitable proceeding a must know that one must stir on behalf of lady laura in matter of libel when tragedy of mr kennedy madness must have be made known publication must be a safe a attractive if phineas must abstain from going to at same calculation have induced to show letter must induce to postpone publication at rate for twenty four hour mean to make capital out of virtue wo give up for sake of being day in advance in meantime will get injunction from vice chancellor to stop publication can do in one day think can chancery be what used to be said mr low with sigh will tell what will do will go very moment to pickering mr pickering at time be one of three vice chancellor be exactly proper thing for counsel to call on judge on sunday afternoon with direct intention of influencing judgment for following morning be case in point may be strained when such paper a people banner get hold of letter from madman if published must destroy happiness of whole family one must stick at trifle pickering be just man to take common sense view of matter will have to make affidavit in morning can get injunction served before two three o'clock mr septimus slope whatever name be wo dare to publish after of course if come out to morrow morning will have be too late will be best chance so mr low got hat umbrella started for vice chancellor house tell what phineas do stay

with pistol without anybody to take care against a to lady laura kennedy seemed to think that poor husband have great cause of complaint that lady laura ought to be punished wife thought must never leave husband on pretext a far a have heard story there have be no pretext at in case sympathy be clearly with madman though be quite ready to acknowledge that step must be taken might be adverse to

finding vice chancellor great judge smiled nodded listened to story acknowledged that circumstance be very peculiar thought that injunction to restrain publication might be given at once upon mr finn affidavit that peculiar circumstance justified peculiarity of mr low application whether must have said a much have fact concerned family of mr joseph smith son in law mr john jones instead of earl of brentford right honourable robert kennedy reader will perhaps doubt may doubt also whether application coming from newly fledged barrister must have be received a graciously a made by mr low qc mp who must probably soon sit on lofty legal bench on following morning phineas mr low doubt also mr vice chancellor pickering obtained early copy of people banner be delighted to find mr kennedy letter did not appear in mr low have made calculation rightly editor considering that must gain more by having young member of parliament standish family a be in hand than by publication of certain libellous letter have resolved to put document back for at least twenty four hour even though young member came wrote a have promised letter did not appear before ten o'clock phineas finn have made affidavit in dingy little room behind vice chancellor court injunction be at once issued be of such potency must editor dare to publish paper therein prohibited that editor editor newspaper must assuredly be

in lincoln inn have gone to judd street to inquire a to condition of man who have tried to murder there saw mr kennedy cousin received assurance from gentleman that robert kennedy must be taken down at once to loughlinter up to moment not word have be said to police a to what have be done more notice have be taken of attempt to murder than might have be necessary have mr kennedy thrown clothes brush at visitor head there be little hole in post of door with bullet in just six foot above ground there be pistol with five chamber still loaded macpherson have cunningly secured on return from church given over to cousin same evening there be certainly want of evidence nobody be disposed to use at noon injunction be served in quartpot alley be put into mr slide hand on arrival at office at

town that must now find communication on great subject matter be one of most serious importance letter a be in possession must no doubt create much surprise receive ordinary attention people banner must hardly ask for better bit of good fortune than privilege of first publishing letter must doubt be copied into london paper into hundred of provincial paper journal so copying must be bound to declare that be taken from column of people banner be indeed addressed to editor of people banner in printed slip mr slide have shown to phineas finn though kennedy have not prefixed to such direction letter in hand of quintus slide must not simply have be letter might have be groundwork for perhaps half dozen leading article of most attractive kind mr slide high moral tone upon occasion must have be qualified to do good to british matron to add virtue to bench of bishop have postponed with inadequately defined idea that must do better with property in hand by putting into personal communication with person concerned if must manage to reconcile husband to wife even to be conspicuous in attempt to do so if must make old earl young member of parliament feel that have spared by abstaining from publication result might be very beneficial conception of matter have be somewhat hazy have certainly made mistake a walked from home to quartpot alley little dreamed of treachery with

when be made to suffer newspaper editor sport daily with name of men of whom hesitate to publish almost severest word can be uttered let editor be attacked even without name think that thunderbolt of heaven must fall upon offender let manner truth judgment honesty even consistency be questioned thunderbolt be forthcoming though may not be from heaven there must certainly be thunderbolt two now mr slide did not at first quite see how be to be forged read injunction again again a far a document went knew force recognised necessity of obedience might perhaps be able to use information contained in letter from mr kennedy so a to harass phineas lady laura earl be at once aware that must not be published editor be bound to avoid mesh of law be always infinitely more costly to company thing institution than be to individual of fighting with chancery have notion must go hard with if did not have fight with phineas finn then there arose cause for deep sorrow paragraph be shown to in morning paper of day must thought refer to mr kennedy phineas finn rumour have reached that member of parliament calling yesterday afternoon upon right honourable gentleman member of late government at hotel be shot at by latter in sitting room whether rumour be true not have mean of saying therefore abstain from publishing name be informed that gentleman who used pistol be out of mind bullet did not take effect how cruel be that such information must have reached hand of rival not fallen in way of people banner what pity that bullet must have be wasted paragraph must certainly refer to phineas finn kennedy finn member of parliament have be sent by slide to call upon kennedy member of late government at kennedy hotel paragraph must be true have warned finn that there must be danger in visit have even prophesied murder murder have be attempted whole transaction have be a be very good chattel of people banner paper have be shamefully robbed of property mr slide hardly doubted that phineas finn have sent paragraph to adverse paper with express view of adding to injury inflicted upon banner that day mr slide hardly did work effectively within glass cage so much be mind affected at five o'clock when left office instead of going at once home to mr slide at camden town took omnibus went down to westminster must at once confront traitor who have deceived must be acknowledged on behalf of editor that did in truth believe that have be hindered from doing good whole practice of life have taught to be confident that editor of newspaper must be best possible judge indeed only possible good judge whether statement story must must not be published not altogether without conscience intensely conscious of such conscience a did constrain mr quintus slide imagined that law of libel injunction from vice chancellor outward power pressure be needed to keep energy within proper limit newspaper formed together simply beneficent institution interference with must of necessity be injury to public everything done at office of people banner be done in interest of people even though individual might occasionally be made to suffer by severity with name be handled in column general

among whose name be known let detail be laid open to light so that people may have warning that such detail will make paper pay mr slide knew also be not only in mr slide path of life that bias of man mind may lead to find virtue profit be compatible unprofitable newspaper can not long continue existence while existing can not be widely beneficial be circulation profitable circulation of forty fifty sixty hundred thousand copy through artery vein of public body be beneficent how can such circulation be effected unless taste of public be consulted mr quintus slide a walked up westminster hall in search of wicked member of parliament did not at doubt goodness of cause must not contest vice chancellor injunction be firm in opinion that vice chancellor injunction have inflicted evil on public at large be unhappy within in power majesty goodness of press must still be hampered by ignorance prejudice favour for great be quite sure that injunction must have be granted in favour of mr joseph smith mr john jones went boldly up to one of policeman who sit guarding door of lobby of house of common asked for mr finn cerberus on left be not sure whether mr finn be in house must send in card if mr slide must stand on one side for next quarter of hour mr slide heard more of message then applied again to cerberus cerberus shook head again desired applicant to stand on one side have done in lay other watchful cerberus standing on right observing that intruder be not accommodated with member intimated to propriety of standing back in one of corner editor turned round upon man a though must bite did stand back meditating article on gross want of attention to public shown in lobby of house of common be possible that editor must endure inconvenience without meditating article judicious editor think twice of such thing editor be still in wrath when saw prey come forth from house with card doubt own card leaped forward in spite of policeman in spite of cerberus seized phineas by arm want just to have few word said made effort to repress wrath knowing that whole world must be against must exhibit violence of indignation on spot phineas must see in fire of eye certainly said phineas retiring to side of lobby with conviction that distance between house be already sufficient ca come down into westminster hall must only have to come up again can say what have got to say here have got great deal to say never be so badly treated in life never must not quite repress voice saw that policeman looked at phineas saw also because have hindered from publishing

slide if stayed with afternoon must tell nothing more good evening will crush said quintus slide in stage whisper will a sure a name be slide phineas looked at retired into house whither quintus slide must not follow editor of people banner be left alone in anger how cock can crow on own dunghill be mr slide first feeling a with painful sense of diminished consequence retraced step through outer lobby down into westminster hall have be browbeaten by phineas finn simply because phineas have be able to retreat within happy door knew that to eye of policeman stranger assembled phineas finn have be hero parliamentary hero have be poor outsider to be ejected at once must make disagreeable to member nevertheless have not column of people banner in pocket be not great in fourth estate much greater than phineas finn in estate must not thunder night so that audience to be counted by hundred of thousand must hear thunder whereas poor member of parliament must struggle night after night for opportunity of speaking must then only speak to bench half deserted to few member half asleep unless press must choose to convert word into thunderbolt who must doubt for moment with lay greater power yet wretched irishman who have wriggled into parliament on petition getting better of good downright english john bull by quibble have treated with wretched irishman being for moment like cock on own

dear friend have long story to tell fear will find difficult in telling be so necessary that must know fact must go through with a best may will give very great pain result a regard own position will not think be injurious to yesterday sunday man came to who edits newspaper whom once knew will remember when used to tell in portman square of amenity anger of mr slide man who wanted to sit for loughton be editor brought long letter from mr kennedy intended for publication be already printed giving elaborate may say most cruelly untrue account of quarrel read letter of course can not remember word if must remember must repeat contained old charge with be familiar unfortunate husband now desired to publish in consummation of threat why mr slide must have brought paper before publishing can hardly understand did so told that mr kennedy be in town have managed among to obtain legal warrant for preventing publication of letter think may say that will not see light when mr slide left called on mr kennedy whom found in miserable little hotel in judd street kept by scotch people named macpherson have come from neighbourhood of loughlinter knew mr kennedy well be yesterday afternoon sunday found difficulty in making way into presence object be to induce to withdraw letter for at time doubted whether law must interfere quickly enough to prevent publication found husband

blundered down stair to mr macpherson room whom have consulted in matter namely barrington erle particular friend mr low to whom went for legal assistance in stopping publication seem to think must have at once sent for police given mr kennedy in charge did not do so hitherto police have believe knowledge of what occurred paragraph appeared in one of morning paper to day giving almost accurate account of matter mentioning place of name doubt will be repeated in paper name will soon be known result will be simply general conviction a to insanity of poor mr kennedy a to who know have have for long time little doubt macphersons seem to have be very anxious to screen guest at other hotel doubt landlord must have sent for police in case attempt be kept quite secret did send for george kennedy cousin of husband whom think know whom saw morning assures that robert kennedy be quite aware of wickedness of attempt made that be plunged in deep remorse be to be taken down to loughlinter to morrow be so say cousin a tractable a child what george kennedy mean to do can not say for a did not send for police at moment a be told ought to have done will now hing know that man be subject to punishment because doe not make complaint suppose have right to regard all a accident if please for must be very important that mr kennedy be insane there can not now think be doubt therefore question of returning to a far a there have be question be absolutely settled none of friend must be justified in allowing to return be undoubtedly mad have done act be not murderous only on conclusion settle question so perfectly that must no doubt reside in england now without danger mr kennedy must feel that must take step to enforce return after what did yesterday indeed if must bring to face publicity must imagine obtain legal separation must give again control of own fortune feel bound to mention give advice will doubt explain circumstance to father think have now told everything need tell thing only happened yesterday have be morning busy getting injunction seeing mr george kennedy just before began letter horrible editor be with again threatening with penalty editor can inflict to tell truth do feel confused among still fancy that hear click of pistol newspaper paragraph say that ball went through whisker be certainly not case foot two off be quite near enough for pistol duke of omnium be dying have heard to day madame goesler old friend have be sent for to matching renewed acquaintance other day at harrington god bless most sincere friend phineas finn let news oppress firing of pistol be thing done over without evil result state of mr kennedy mind be what have long suspected though be must contain for at rate consolation that accusation made against must not have be made have mind be unclouded twice while finn be writing letter be rung into house for division once be suggested to to say few word of angry opposition to government on not important subject under discussion since beginning of session hardly night have passed without verbal sparring very frequently limit of parliamentary decorum have be almost surpassed never within memory of living politician have political rancour be so sharp feeling of injury so keen on one side on other taunt thrown at conservative in reference to church have be almost unendurable more so because strong expression of feeling from own party throughout country be against own conviction also be against there have for while be almost determination through party to deny leader disclaim bill feeling of duty to party have prevailed have not be done have not be done not doing of be sore burden on half broken shoulder of many man who sat gloomily on bench behind mr daubeny men goaded a be by opponent by natural friend by own conscience must not bear in silence very bitter thing be said in return mr gresham be accused of degrading lust for power other feeling must prompt to oppose with factious acrimony never before exhibited in house so said wretched conservative with broken back broken heart measure must only be too willing to carry be allowed privilege of passing over to other side of house for purpose in encounter phineas finn have already exhibited prowess in spite of declaration at tankerville have become prominent a opponent to mr daubeny bill have of course be taunted held up in house to execration of own constituent have enjoyed fight have remembered how friend mr monk have once told that pleasure lay on side of opposition on evening declined to speak suppose have hardly recovered from kennedy pistol said mr ratler who have of course heard whole story whole affair together have upset said phineas fitzgibbon will do for be in house so happened that on occasion honourable laurence fitzgibbon made very effective speech against government on next morning from column of people banner be hurled first of thunderbolt with be purpose of mr slide absolutely to destroy political social life of phineas finn must not miss aim a mr kennedy have done must strike such blow that constituency must ever venture to return mr finn again to parliament thought that must also so strike blow that mighty nobleman distinguished commoner lady of rank must again care to entertain miscreant feed with dainty of fashion first thunderbolt be a follows abstained yesterday from alluding to circumstance occurred at small hotel in judd street on sunday afternoon a observe be mentioned by one of contemporary name however be not given although person implicated be indicated can see reason why name must be concealed indeed a gentleman concerned have be guilty of very great criminality think that be bound to tell whole story more especially a certain circumstance have in very peculiar manner placed in possession of fact be secret that for last two year lady laura kennedy have be separated from husband honourable robert kennedy who in last administration under mr mildmay held office of chancellor of duchy of lancaster believe a little secret that mr kennedy have be very persistent in endeavouring to recall wife to home with equal persistence have refused to obey have in hand clearest possible evidence that mr kennedy have attributed obstinate refusal to influence exercised over by mr phineas finn who three year since be father nominee for then existing borough of loughton who lately succeeded in ousting poor mr browborough from seat for tankerville by impetuous promise to support very measure of church reform be now opposing with venom make valuable to party whether mr phineas finn will ever sit in parliament can not of course say think can at least assure that will never again sit for tankerville on last sunday afternoon mr finn knowing well feeling with be regarded by mr kennedy outraged decency by calling upon gentleman whose address obtained from office what took place between one know probably one ever will know interview be ended by mr kennedy firing pistol at mr finn head that must have done so without grossest provocation one will believe that mr finn have gone to husband to interfere with respecting wife be undoubted fact fact if necessary be in position to prove such interference must have be most heartrending one will admit intruder who have thrust upon unfortunate husband on sabbath afternoon be very man whom husband accuses of having robbed of company comfort of wife can not on account absolve mr kennedy of criminality of act must be for jury to decide what view must be taken of act to say how far outrageous provocation offered must be allowed to palliate offence matter have not reached police mr finn be not struck managed to escape from room be manifest duty a one of community more especially so a member of parliament to have reported circumstance at once to police be not done by by person who keep hotel mr finn must have reason of own for keeping whole affair secret for screening attempt at murder be clear enough what inducement have be used with people of house can not of course say understand that mr kennedy have be allowed to leave london without molestation such be true story of what occurred on sunday afternoon in judd street knowing what do think justified in calling upon major mackintosh to take case into own hand now major mackintosh be at time head of london constabulary be quite out of question that transaction must take place in heart of london at three o'clock on sunday afternoon be allowed to pas without notice intend to keep a little of what know from public a possible hesitate to acknowledge that be debarred by injunction of vice chancellor from publishing certain document must throw clearest light upon whole circumstance a soon a possible after shot be fired mr finn went to work a think by misrepresentation obtained injunction early on yesterday morning feel sure that must not have be granted have transaction in judd street be at time known to vice chancellor in enormity hand be of course tied document in question be still with be sacred when called upon to show by proper authority will be ready knowing what do know must not be justified in allowing matter to sleep in meantime call upon whose duty be to preserve public peace to take step necessary for bringing delinquent to justice effect upon mr finn must say must be immediate withdrawal from public life for last year two have held subordinate permanent place in ireland have given up on rumour that party to have attached be likely to return to office that be seeker after office be notorious that possible government must now employ even a tide waiter be quite out of question be equally out of question that must be again returned to parliament be to resign seat on accepting office a be believe notorious that gentleman can not maintain position hold without being paid for service be reasonable to suppose that friend will recommend to retire seek living in obscure let hope honest profession mr slide when thunderbolt be prepared read over with delight still with fear a to probable result be expedient that must avoid prosecution for libel essential that must not offend majesty of vice chancellor injunction be sure that be safe in direction a to libel must not tell that be certainly safe be saying very hard thing of lady laura of phineas finn sailing very near wind of person must probably be willing to prosecute must be prosecuted must then at rate be able to give in mr kennedy letter a evidence in own defence really did believe that what be doing be done in cause of morality be business of such paper a conducted to run risk in defending moral exposing distinguished culprit on behalf of public then without such risk how must phineas finn be adequately punished for atrocious treachery of have be guilty a to chancellor order mr slide thought that have managed that matter very completely doubt have acted in direct opposition to spirit of injunction legal order be read by letter not by spirit be open to to publish anything pleased respecting mr kennedy wife subject of course to general law of land in regard to libel vice chancellor special order to referred simply to particular document from document have not quoted word though have contrived to repeat bitter thing contained with much added venom of own felt secure of being safe from active anger on part of vice chancellor article be printed published reader will perceive that be full of lie began with lie in statement that abstained yesterday from alluding to circumstance have be unknown to writer when yesterday paper be published indignant reference to poor finn want of delicacy in forcing upon mr kennedy on sabbath afternoon be of course tissue of lie visit have be made almost at instigation of editor paper from beginning to end be full of falsehood malice have be written with express intention of creating prejudice against man who have offended writer mr slide did not know that be lying did not know that be malicious weapon used be one to hand be accustomed have be led by practice to believe that use of such weapon by one in position be not only fair also beneficial to public have anybody suggested to that be stabbing enemy in dark must have averred that be doing nothing of kind because anonymous accusation of sinner in high rank be on behalf of public special duty of writer editor attached to public press mr slide blood be running high with virtuous indignation against hero a inserted last cruel word a to choice of obscure honest profession phineas finn read article before sat down to breakfast on following morning dagger went right into bosom word told upon with jaunty laugh within own sleeve have assured that be safe against wound must be inflicted on from column of people banner have be sure that must be attacked thought that be armed to bear thin blade penetrated joint of harness particle of poison curdled in blood be hurt about lady laura be hurt about borough of tankerville be hurt by charge against of having outraged delicacy be hurt by being handed over to tender mercy of major mackintosh be hurt by craft with vice chancellor injunction have be evaded be especially hurt by allusion to own poverty be necessary that must earn bread doubt be seeker after place did not wish to obtain wage without working for did not see why work wage of public office must be le honourable than of other profession to with idea there be profession so honourable a certainly there be none demanded greater sacrifice be more precarious did believe that article a must have effect of shutting against gate of dangerous paradise desired to enter have great claim upon party in giving away good thing of office giver be only too prone to recognise objection against individual may seem to relieve from necessity of bestowing aught in direction phineas felt that must almost be ashamed to show face at club in house must do so a matter of course knew that must not do so without confessing by visage that have be deeply wounded by attack in people banner went in first instance to mr low be almost surprised that mr low must not have yet even have heard that attack have be made have almost felt a walked to lincoln inn that everybody have looked at that passer by in street have declared to other that be unfortunate one who have be doomed by editor of people banner to seek obscure way of earning bread mr low took paper read probably only half read article then threw sheet aside a worthless what ought to hing at one first desire must be to beat to jelly of course must be worst must most certainly conduce to triumph just so only allude to pleasure one must have have to deny know whether have laid open for libel must think not have only just glanced at therefore ca give opinion must think must not dream of such thing object be to screen lady laura name have to think of first may be necessary that step must be taken to defend character if accusation be made with such publicity a to enforce belief if not denied denial must be made may probably be best made by action for libel must be done by friend certainly not by have laughed at vice chancellor injunction think that can interfere if a believe mr kennedy be insane that fact will probably soon be proved will have effect of clearing lady laura character wife may be excused for leaving mad husband think must hing see what can do have encountered chimney sweeper of course get of soot what do do what do must depend at rate on wish of lady laura kennedy father be matter in must make subordinate to fuming fretting yet recognising truth of mr low word phineas left chamber went down to club be wednesday house be to sit in morning before went to house put in way of certain of associate in order that might hear what must be said learn if possible what be thought nobody seemed to treat accusation in newspaper a very serious though around congratulated on escape from mr kennedy pistol suppose poor man really be mad said lord cantrip whom met on step of one of club doubt must say ca understand why did go to police have hoped thing must not become public said phineas everything becomes public everything of kind be very hard upon poor lady laura be worst of lord cantrip if be father must bring to england demand separation in regular legal way be what must do now in behalf must then have opportunity of clearing character from imputation to certain extent will affect even though come from madman from very scum of press have read that article yes saw minute ago need not tell that there be not faintest ground in world for imputation made against lady laura there be sure that there be none therefore be that tell opinion so plainly think that lord brentford must be advised to bring lady laura to england to put down charge openly in court might be done either by application to divorce court for separation by action against newspaper for libel know lord brentford quite well enough to intrude upon with letter have objection whatever to having name mentioned to poor mr kennedy sat together in same government think that lord brentford must trust friendship so far phineas thanked assured that what have said must be conveyed to lord brentford chapter xxix spooner correspondence will be remembered that adelaide palliser have accepted hand of mr maule junior that lady chiltern between have despatched up to london on embassy to father in failed very signally have be originally lady chiltern idea that proper home for young couple must be ancestral hall must be theirs day in with exceeding prudence might be able to live a maules of maule abbey upon very limited income must belong to how slight be ground for imputing such stern prudence to gerard maule lady felt have become essential to do something young people be engaged to other manner of life must be suggested discussed a far a possible arranged lady chiltern be useful at such work having practical turn of mind understanding well condition of life for be necessary that friend must prepare lover be not vicious drank gambled ran hopelessly in debt be good humoured tractable docile enough when nothing disagreeable be asked from must have said objection to live at maule abbey if adelaide liked did believe much in farming must consent at adelaide request to be owner of bullock be quite ready to give up hunting having already taught to think that very few good run in season be hardly worth trouble of getting up before daylight winter went forth therefore on embassy know how failed lover must have communicated disastrous tidings at once to lady gerard maule waited week before did so then told story in dozen word governor cut up rough about maule abbey will not hear of generally doe cut up rough must be made to hear of said lady chiltern two day afterwards news reached harrington of death of duke of omnium letter of official nature reached adelaide from mr fothergill in writer explained that have be desired by mr palliser to communicate to relative sad tidings so poor old man have gone at last said lady chiltern with affectation of funereal gravity be common to of poor old duke said adelaide have be hearing of a sort of bugbear life think ever saw once then gave kiss pair of earring never paid attention to at be taught to think that providence have be very good to in making duke uncle be very rich horribly rich have always heard wo leave something must be very nice now that be engaged to find that have given five thousand pound very nice indeed there be not chance of have always be known that everything be to go to heir papa have fortune spent brother be never friend though duke did once give kiss imagine that forgot existence immediately afterwards so duke of omnium be dead said lord chiltern when came home that evening adelaide have have letter to tell so afternoon mr fothergill wrote to said adelaide man who be so wicked about fox care straw about mr fothergill now mouth be closed against uncle be quite frightful to think that duke of omnium must die like anybody else duke be dead long live duke said lady chiltern wonder how mr palliser will like men always do like suppose said adelaide woman do said lord chiltern lady glencora will be delighted to reign though can hardly fancy by other name by bye adelaide have got letter for letter for lord chiltern well yes suppose have better give be not addressed to must answer what on earth be think can guess said lady chiltern laughing have guessed rightly adelaide palliser be still altogether in dark when lord chiltern took letter from pocket handed to a did so left room wife followed will be upstairs adelaide if want advice said lady chiltern letter be from mr spooner have left harrington hall after uncourteous reception have be accorded to by miss palliser in deep disgust resolving that must never again speak to almost resolving that spoon hall must never have mistress in time with wine after dinner courage came back to began to reflect once more that be not habit of young lady to accept lover at first offer there be living with mr spooner at time very attached friend whom usually consulted in emergency to whom on occasion opened heart mr edward spooner commonly called ned by who knew not unfrequently so addressed by who did not be distant cousin of squire who unfortunately have particular income of own for last ten year have lived at spoon hall have certainly earned bread squire have achieved certain credit for success a country gentleman nothing about place be out of order own farming be extensive succeeded bullock sheep won prize horse be always useful healthy tenant be solvent if not satisfied did not owe shilling now many people in neighbourhood attributed to judicious care of mr edward spooner whose eye be never off place whose discretion be equal to zeal in giving squire due one must acknowledge that recognised merit of cousin trusted in everything night a soon a customary bottle of claret have succeeded absolutely normal bottle of port after dinner mr spooner of spoon hall opened heart to cousin will have to walk then said ned not if know said squire suppose be going to let woman have command of spoon hall do command inside know woman will ever turn out of house ned be not thinking of said cousin of course will marry day of course must take chance see why must be miss palliser a well a jade almost made angry suppose be way with most of 'ludit exultim metuitque tangi ' for ned spooner have preserved few tattered shred of learning from school day remember about filly yes do very well said squire expers be what be suppose try again advice on part of cousin be genuine unselfish that mr spooner of spoon hall must be rejected by young lady without fortune seemed to to be impossible at rate be duty of man in such circumstance to persevere a far a ned knew world lady always required to be asked second third time then harm can come from such perseverance ca break bone tom there be much honesty displayed on occasion squire when be thus instigated to persevere did best to describe manner in have be rejected power of description be not very great did not conceal anything wilfully be a hard a nail know know that mean much horace filly kicked few doubt told that if 'd go one way 'd go other always say about hardest thing come to tongue curse swear a do there 'd be bearing if really like be such well built creature there be look of blood about see in of 'em sort of breeding be what one want to get through mud with then be that cousin recommended letter to lord chiltern lord chiltern be at present moment to be regarded a lady guardian be lover intimate friend direct proposal have already be made to young lady must now be repeated to gentleman who for time stood in position of father squire for while hesitated declaring that be averse to make secret known to lord chiltern one doe want fellow in country to know said in answer to cousin be very explicit there must be little doubt that lord chiltern knew secret already must certainly be rather induced to keep a secret than to divulge if be communicated to officially what other step must squire take must not be likely that must be asked again to harrington hall with express view of repeating offer cousin be quite of opinion that written proposition must be made on very night cousin wrote out letter for squire to copy in morning on morning squire copied letter not without addition of own a to have very many word with discreet cousin in formal manner handed to lord chiltern towards afternoon of day having devoted whole morning to finding of proper opportunity for doing so lord chiltern have read letter have a see delivered to adelaide palliser be proposal from mr spooner lady chiltern said a soon a be alone exactly that knew 'd go on with men be such fool see that be fool at said lord chiltern almost in anger why must ask girl to be wife be rich man have got farthing might say same of butcher oswald mr spooner be gentleman mean to say that be fit to marry girl a adelaide palliser know what make fitness be got red nose if like red nose be unfitness gerard maule nose be red dare say therefore be fitter only unfortunately have money adelaide palliser must no more think of marrying mr spooner than must have thought of marrying cook if have liked cook must have asked see why mr spooner must ask miss palliser need take in meantime miss palliser be reading following letter spoon hall th march dear lord chiltern venture to suppose at present be acting a guardian of miss palliser who have be staying at house winter if be wrong in hope will pardon consent to act in capacity for occasion entertain feeling of greatest admiration warmest affection for young lady have named ventured to express when have pleasure of staying at harrington hall in early part of last month can not boast be received on occasion with much favour know that be not very good at talking be told in book that man have right to expect to be taken at first time of asking perhaps miss palliser will allow through to request to consider proposal with more deliberation than be allowed to before when spoke to perhaps with injudicious hurry so far squire adopted cousin word without alteration be owner of own property be more than everybody can say income be nearly l year will be willing to make proper settlement may be recommended by lawyer though be strongly of opinion that estate must be crippled for sake of widow a to refurnishing old house will do anything miss palliser may please know taste about hunting know hers so that there need not be difference of opinion on score miss palliser ca suspect of interested motif come forward because think be most charming girl ever saw because love with heart have got very much to say for if will consent to be mistress of spoon hall will have that heart of woman can desire pray believe dear lord chiltern yours very sincerely thomas platter spooner a believe that miss palliser be fond of book may be well to tell that there be uncommon good library at spoon hall will have objection to go abroad for honeymoon for three four month in summer postscript be squire own be inserted in opposition to cousin judgment wo come for sake of book said cousin squire thought that attraction must be piled up must talk of honeymoon till 'd got to come round little said cousin squire thought that cousin be falsely delicate pleaded that girl like to be taken abroad when be married second half of body of letter be very much disfigured by squire petulance so that modesty with commenced be almost put to blush by touch of arrogance in conclusion sentence in squire declared that estate ought not to be crippled for sake of widow be very much questioned by cousin word a 'widow ' never ought to go into letter a squire protested that must not be mealy mouthed can bear to think of will go bail why must hear about what can think about talk about furniture yet tom cousin said squire be obstinate cousin became hopeless that word about loving with heart be cousin own what followed a to being mistress of spoon hall be altogether opposed to judgment will be proud enough of spoon hall if come here said squire 'd let come first said cousin know that phraseology of letter be of importance whatever when be received lady be engaged to man regarded mr spooner of spoon hall a being guilty of unpardonable impudence in approaching at red faced vulgar old man who look a if did nothing drink said to lady chiltern doe harm dear doe do harm make thing very uncomfortable have business to think possible people will suppose gave encouragement used to have lover coming to year after year same people whom think ever encouraged never felt angry with did have mr spooner mr spooner did know in day there be saying what might have happened then lady chiltern argued matter on view directly opposite to have put forward when discussing matter with husband always think that man who be privileged to sit down to table with be privileged to ask there be disparity of course may make privilege questionable disparity of age rank mean of taste said adelaide know about that poet doe want to marry poetess philosopher philosopheress man may make fool by putting in way of certain refusal take broad rule be that man may fall in love with lady who habitually sits in company agree with at what must be said if curate at long royston be to propose to one of fitzhoward girl duchess must probably ask duke to make young man bishop out of hand duke must have to spend morning in explaining to change have come over making of bishop since be young there be other rule that can lay down think that girl must understand that have to fight battle subject to law be very easy to say 'no man wo take 'no be lucky for sometimes that said lady chiltern remembering certain passage in early life answer be written that night by lord chiltern after much consultation a to nature of answer that must be positive refusal of course there must be doubt then arose question whether reason must be given whether refusal must be simply refusal at last be decided that reason must be given letter ran a follows dear mr spooner be commissioned to inform that miss palliser be engaged to be married to mr gerard maule yours faithfully chiltern young lady have consented to be thus explicit because have be already determined that secret must be kept a to future prospect be one of poverty stricken wheedling fellow one meet about world day said squire to cousin fellow ride horse that ca pay for owes poor devil of tailor for breech that sits in eat drink get along heaven only know how be sure to

meant to intimate that real owner of substantial wealth must not be allowed to disembarrass of responsibility strip of privilege by few generous idle word late duke will be very serious thing seemed

majority of active politician double pleasure of pulling down opponent of raising be charm of politician life by practice becomes extended to so many branch that delight also disappointment be very widespread great satisfaction be felt by because by lucky conjunction of affair man whom never saw be made lord lieutenant of county instead of man of whom know a little be great thing to that sir samuel bobwig excellent liberal be seated high on bench of justice instead of time serving conservative sir alexander mcsilk men not measure be doubt very life of politics then be not fashion to say so in public place mr gresham be determined to introduce fashion on present occasion did not think very much of mr daubeny bill so told friend at duke house bill be full of fault went too far in one

treachery must be expected from army in officer private be called upon to fight against conviction meeting passed off without dissension be agreed that house of common must be called upon to reject church bill simply because be proposed from side of house on minority be sitting a there be more than two hundred member present on occasion by none of whom be objection raised seemed probable that mr

london a to murderous attack have be made by mr kennedy on phineas finn in judd street advice given by mr slide in people banner to police be not taken public official inquiry be made into circumstance mr kennedy under care of cousin retreated to scotland a seemed there be to be end of throughout month of march various smaller bolt be thrust at phineas at police by editor of above named newspaper seemed to fall without much effect one be put in prison be one ever examined nevertheless missile have effect everybody knew that there have be row between mr kennedy phineas finn that row have be made about mr kennedy wife everybody knew that pistol have be fired at finn head great many people thought that there have be cause for assault be alleged at one club that present member for tankerville have spent greater part of last two year at dresden at that have called on mr kennedy twice once down in scotland once at hotel in judd street with view of inducing gentleman to concede to divorce there be also very romantic story afloat a to engagement have existed between lady laura phineas finn before lady have be induced by father to marry richer suitor various detail be given in corroboration of story be not known that earl have purchased submission of phineas finn by seat for borough of loughton be not known that lord chiltern brother of lady laura have fought duel with phineas finn be not known that mr kennedy have be a be coerced into quiescence by singular fact that have be saved from garotters in street by opportune interference of phineas finn be even suggested that scene with garotters have be cunningly planned by phineas finn that might in way be able to restrain anger of husband of lady whom loved story be very pretty a reader be hoped know be untrue phineas have made one short visit to dresden in life lady laura have be engaged to mr kennedy before phineas have ever spoken to of love duel with lord chiltern have be about lady seat at loughton have be conferred upon phineas chiefly on account of prowess in extricating mr kennedy from garotters respecting circumstance may be said that a meeting in street be fortuitous reward be greater than occasion seemed to require while thing be being said phineas became something of hero man who be supposed to have caused disturbance between two married people in certain rank of life doe generally receive certain meed of admiration man who be asked out to dinner twice week before such rumour be afloat must probably receive double that number of invitation afterwards then to have be shot at by madman in room to be subject of venom of people banner tends also to fame other lady besides madame goesler be anxious to have story from very lip of hero in way phineas finn became conspicuous man fame begets envy there be who said that member for tankerville have injured prospect with party may be very well to give dinner to man who have caused wife of late cabinet minister to quarrel with husband can hardly be expected that must be placed in office by head of party to late cabinet minister belonged never saw such fellow a be said barrington erle to be always getting into mess nobody ought to know better than how false calumny be said because erle lady laura be cousin of course be calumny have heard before what made go poking head into lion mouth mr bonteen be very much harder upon than be barrington erle never liked from first always knew must not run straight irishman ever doe be said to viscount fawn distinguished member of liberal party who have lately be married be known to have very strict notion a to bond of matrimony have be heard to say that man who have interfered with happiness of married couple must be held to have committed capital offence know whether story about lady laura be true of course be true world know to be true be always there at loughlinter at saulsby in portman square after have left husband mischief have done be incalculable there be conservative sitting in poor kennedy seat for dunross shire might have be case anyway nothing must have turned kennedy out remember how behaved about irish land question hate such fellow if thought true about lady laura lord fawn be again about to express opinion in regard to matrimony mr bonteen be too impetuous to listen to be out of question that must come in again at rate if doe wo will tell gresham so very plainly woman will do that can for always do for fellow of kind phineas heard of not exactly by repetition of word be spoken by chance phrase from look of men lord cantrip who be best friend among who be certain to hold high office in liberal government did not talk to cheerily did not speak a though phineas must a matter of course have place assigned to thought that mr gresham be hardly a cordial to a might be when met in closer intercourse of house there be always word two spoken sometimes shaking of hand have right to complain yet knew that something be wanting can generally read man purpose towards in manner if purpose be of much moment to phineas have written to lady laura giving account of occurrence in judd street on st of march have received from short answer by return of post contained hardly more than thanksgiving that life have not be sacrificed in day two have written again letting know that have determined to consult father then on last day of month received following letter dresden march th dear friend at last have resolved that will go back to england almost at once thing have gone so rapidly that hardly know how to explain be papa resolution lawyer mr forster tell that will be best go so far a to say that be imperative on behalf that step must be taken to put end to present state of thing will not scruple to tell that be actuated chiefly by consideration a to money be astonishing to that man who have life be so liberal must now in old age think so much about be however in degree for be for can not bear to think that fortune must be withheld from by mr kennedy while have done nothing wrong be obliged to show letter what said about control of money took hold of mind at once think that if unfortunate husband be insane there can be difficulty in obtaining separation on term must oblige friend to restore horrid money of course must stay if chose papa must not refuse to find home for here do agree with mr forster that something must be done to stop tongue of ill conditioned people idea of having name dragged through newspaper be dreadful to if must be done one way other will be better that must be done with truth there be nothing that need fear a know so well can not look forward to happiness anywhere if question of separation be once settled know whether must not prefer returning here to remaining in london papa have got tired of place want say to see saulsby once again before dy what can say in answer to will go have sent to have house in portman square got ready for suppose will be there about th of next month papa have instructed mr forster to tell mr kennedy lawyer that be coming be to find out if can whether interference in management of property have be a yet made by family perhaps ought to tell that mr forster have expressed surprise that did not call on police when shot be fired of course can understand god bless affectionate friend l k phineas be obliged to console by reflecting that if understood of course be everything first great duty in matter have be to if in performing that duty have sacrificed must bear undeserved punishment like man that be to be punished began to perceive too clearly conviction that mr daubeny must recede from treasury bench after coming debate became day stronger within little inner circle of liberal party usual discussion be made a to ministry mr gresham must a matter of course be called upon to form in discussion phineas finn did not find taking assured comfortable part laurence fitzgibbon countryman who in way of work have never be worth salt be eager happy without doubt others of old stager men who have be going in out ever since have be able to get seat in parliament stood about in club in lobby chamber of house with busy magpie air be worn only by who have high hope of good thing to come speedily lord mount thistle be more sublime ponderous than ever though who best understood party declared that must never again be invited to undergo care of office lordship be one of terrible political burden engendered originally by private friendship family consideration one minister leaf to sir gregory grogram great whig lawyer showed plainly by manner that thought at last secure of reaching reward for have be struggling life for be understood by men who knew anything that lord weazeling be not to be asked again to sit on woolsack better advocate effective politician ever lived be supposed that lacked dignity for office of first judge in land that most of old lot must come back be matter of course there must be duke duke of st bungay who have for year past be duke when liberal administration be discussed second duke whom know so well sir harry coldfoot legge wilson lord cantrip lord thrift rest of there must of course be lord fawn mr ratler mr erle thing be so thoroughly settled that one be almost tempted to think that prime minister must have voice in selection to be made a to one office be acknowledged on side that doubt existed must at last be found to be very injurious a thought altogether crushing to party to whom must mr gresham entrust financial affair of country who must be new chancellor of exchequer there be not few who inferred that mr bonteen must be promoted to high office during last two year have devoted to decimal coinage with zeal only second to displayed by plantagenet palliser be accustomed to say of that have almost perished under exertion be supposed that must have support of present duke of omnium that mr gresham who disliked man must be coerced by fact that there be other competitor that mr bonteen must go into cabinet must be gall wormwood to many brother liberal gall wormwood such a have to be swallowed rising in life of familiar friend be perhaps bitterest morsel of bitter bread be called upon to eat in life do eat after while becomes food to when find able to use on behalf perhaps of child influence of whom have once hoped to leave behind in race of life when man suddenly shoot up into power few suffer from very acutely rise of pitt can have caused heart burning mr bonteen have be hack among hack have filled usual half dozen place have be junior lord vice president deputy controller chief commissioner joint secretary hope have be raised abased among place of l l l year have hitherto culminated at l have be supposed with diligence to have worked up to top of ladder a far a ladder be accessible to now be spoken of in connection with one of highest office of state of course created much uneasiness gave rise to many prophecy of failure in midst of office be assigned to phineas finn there be general feeling not expressed understood that affair with mr kennedy stood in way quintus slide have undertaken to crush must be possible that so mean man must be able to make good so monstrous threat man be very mean threat have be absurd a well a monstrous yet seemed that might be realised phineas be too proud to ask question even of barrington erle felt that be being left out in cold because editor of people banner have said that government must employ at moment on very morning of day be to usher in great debate be to be so fatal to mr daubeny church reform thunderbolt be hurled of people banner have learned that very painful matter to have be compelled by sense of duty to call public attention in reference to late member for dunross shire present member for tankerville must be brought before one of tribunal of country in reference to matrimonial difference between mr kennedy wife must be in remembrance of reader that unfortunate gentleman have be provoked to fire pistol at head of member for tankerville circumstance though publicly known have never be brought under notice of police there be reason to hope that mystery might now be cleared up that end of justice must demand that certain document must be produced have be vexatiously restrained from giving to reader although have be most carefully prepared for publication in column of people banner then thunderbolt went on to say that there be evidently great move among member of so called liberal party who seemed to think that be only necessary that must open mouth wide enough in order that sweet of office must fall into be quite of different opinion believed that minister for many long day have be so firmly fixed on treasury bench a be mr daubeny at present moment at rate might be inferred must mr gresham by unhappy combination of circumstance be called upon to form ministry must be quite impossible for to include within name of member for tankerville be second great thunderbolt fell so did work of crushing poor friend proceed there be great injustice in at least so phineas thought injustice not only from hand of mr slide who be unjust a matter of course also from who ought to have be staunch friend have be enticed over to england almost with promise of office be sure that have done nothing deserved punishment even censure must not condescend to complain indeed a yet must say that there be ground for complaint nothing have be done to not word have be spoken except lying word in newspaper be too proud to notice on one matter however be determined to be firm when barrington erle have absolutely insisted that must vote upon church bill in opposition to that have said upon subject at tankerville have stipulated that must have opportunity in great debate must certainly take place of explaining conduct in other word that privilege of making speech must be accorded to at time in very many member must doubt attempt to speak must attempt in vain may be imagined probably still be imagined by great many that such pledge a must be given that right to speak depends simply on speaker eye energy at moment in attracting attention must alone be of account to eager orator phineas knew house too well to trust to theory that preliminary assistance must be given to travelling of speaker eye in so important debate knew very well knew also that promise from barrington erle from mr ratler must be best security will be right of course said barrington erle to on evening day before debate have quite counted on speaking there have be certain sullenness in tone with phineas have asked question a though have be labouring under grievance felt rebuked by cordiality of reply suppose have better fix for monday tuesday said other hope to get over by tuesday there be knowing at rate sha be thrown over be almost on tongue entire story of grievance expression of feeling that be not being treated a one of chosen restrained liked barrington erle well enough not so well a to justify in asking for sympathy have be wont in of trouble of life to ask for sympathy from man have always gone to woman in old day to lady laura to violet effingham to madame goesler by must endure to be petted praised upon occasion even pitied pity praise from man have be distasteful to on morning of st of april again went to park lane not with formed plan of telling lady of wrong driven by feeling that wanted comfort might perhaps be found there lady received very kindly at once inquired a to great political tournament be about to be commenced yes begin to day said phineas mr daubeny will speak must say from half past four till seven wonder go hear what pleasure to hear man speak for two hour half about church of england one must be very hard driven for amusement will tell that like like to hear good speech have excitement before of making good speech in answer be in fight poor woman shut up in cage feel there more acutely than anywhere else how insignificant position fill in world advocate right of woman madame goesler oh knowing inferiority submit without grumble be not sure care to go listen to squabble of master may arrange among will accept what do whether be good bad a must can not take so much interest in proceeding a to spend time in listening where can not speak in looking when can not be seen will speak yes think so will read speech be more than will do for most of others when be over will turn come not mine individually madame goesler will be yours individually will not asked with energy then gradually with half pronounced sentence explained to even in event of formation of liberal government did not expect that place must be offered to why not have be speaking of a certainty longed to inquire who be of whom spoke must not do without egotism must be distasteful to can hardly tell think will be asked to join must wish yes talking to see why must hesitate to say so talking to why must hesitate to say anything about be true can hold tongue gossip about friend whose doing be know that be man doing must be everybody said that be to be one of if must get other people out be mr bonteen likely enough not that know anything of kind a hate from bottom of heart be natural to suppose that have same feeling in regard to agree with there know that come from feeling of kind what doe come from have heard calumny about lady laura kennedy mean to say that story such a have affected position fancy have must not suppose madame goesler mean to complain man must take thing a come one have received more kindness from friend than have few perhaps more favour from fortune about mr kennedy have be unlucky can not be helped do mean to say that moral of party will be offended said madame goesler almost laughing lord fawn know be very particular in sober earnest one can not tell how thing operate do operate gradually one friend be sometimes very glad of excuse for not befriending one lady laura be coming home yes will put end to there be nothing to put end to except foul mouthed malice of lying newspaper nobody belief anything against lady laura be not so sure of believe nothing against be sure madame goesler do think that anybody doe be too absurd for belief from beginning to end good bye perhaps will see when debate be over of course will good bye success to oratory then madame goesler resolved that must say few judicious word to friend duchess respecting phineas finn chapter xxxiii two gladiator great debate be commenced with solemnity be customary on such occasion make men think for day that moment of greater excitement have ever blessed cursed country upon present occasion london be full of clergyman specially clerical club oxford cambridge old university athenaeum be black with bishop dean a usual be pleasant in manner happy looking in spite of adverse circumstance when one see bishop in hour of distress of church one always think of just firm man who will stand fearless while ruin of world be falling about ear parson from country be sorry sight to see be in earnest with heart did believe not that crack of doom be coming must have borne with equanimity if convinced that influence must last to end that evil one be to be made welcome upon earth by act of parliament be out of nature that man must think good that own order must be repressed curtailed deprived of power if go among cab driver letter carrier among butler gamekeeper among tailor butcher among farmer grazier among doctor attorney will find in set of men conviction that

of judge in own position be beautiful being salutary to country though not unfrequently damaging to character of man if be so with men who be conscious of higher influence than exercised over body mind of fellow creature how much stronger must be feeling when influence affect soul to outsider layman who simply us cab receives letter go to law have to be tried pretension be ridiculous annoying according to ascendancy of pretender at moment a clerical pretension be more exacting than others being put forward with assertion that answer be possible without breach of duty sin so be more galling

daubeny began by regretting hardness of position in must with what thoroughness might be able to achieve apply to two great subject whereas right honourable gentleman opposite have already declared with formality must be made to attach to combined meeting of peer commoner that must confine strictly to one subject selected by right honourable gentleman opposite on present occasion be not question of church reform right honourable gentleman have pledged with almost sacred enthusiasm to ignore subject altogether doubt be question before house present speaker must unfortunately discus at length right honourable gentleman opposite must not on great occasion trouble with anything of so little moment might be presumed that political follower of right honourable gentleman must be equally reticent a be understood to have accepted tactic without dissentient voice mr daubeny be last man in england to deny importance of question right honourable gentleman must select for discussion in preference to of condition of church that question be very simple one might be put to house in very few word coming from mouth of right honourable gentleman proposition must probably be made in form that house doe think that ought to be prime minister now a long a may posse seat in house be impossible to deny importance of question perhaps mr daubeny might be justified in demurring to preference given to over other matter let that matter be of what importance might be to material welfare of country made point well made too often attack of kind personal savage in nature loses effect when be evident that word have be prepared good deal may be done in dispute by calling man as knave resolve to use word must have be made only at moment must come hot from heart there be much neatness acuteness in mr daubeny satire there be heat be prolix have however effect of irritating mr gresham a be evident from manner in moved hat shuffled foot man destined to sit conspicuously on treasury bench on seat opposite to must ask god for thick skin a first gift need of in national assembly be greater than elsewhere because difference between men opposed to other be smaller when two foe meet together in same chamber one of whom advocate personal government of individual ruler other that form of state have come to be called red republic deal doubt weighty blow of oratory at other blow never hurt at moment may cut other throat if can find opportunity bite other like dog over bone when opponent be almost in accord a be always case with parliamentary gladiator be ever striving to give maddening little wound through joint of harness what be there with to create divergence necessary for debate pride of personal skill in encounter who desire among to put down queen to repudiate national debt to destroy religious worship even to disturb rank of society when small measure of reform have thoroughly recommended to country so thoroughly that men know that country will have then question arises whether detail will be arranged by political party call liberal by be termed conservative men be so near to other in conviction theory of life that nothing be left to personal competition for doing of thing be to be done be same in religion apostle of christianity infidel can meet without chance of quarrel be never safe to bring together two men who differ about saint surplice mr daubeny having thus attacked wounded enemy rushed boldly into question of church reform taking little pride to to party that so great blessing must be bestowed upon country from so unexpected source see what conservative can do in fact will conserve nothing when find that desire to have conserved longer minime reris graia pandetur ab urbe be exactly reverse of complaint mr gresham be about to make on subject of church be rather misty very profound went into question of very early church indeed spoke of misappropriation of endowment in time of eli establishment of levite have be no doubt complete change have be effected a circumstance required be presumed to have alluded to order of melchisedek abstained from mention of name roamed very wide gave many of hearer idea that erudition have carried into region in be impossible to follow gist of argument be to show audacity in reform be very backbone of conservatism by clearly pronounced disunion of church state theocracy of thomas becket must be restored people of england must soon again become faithful flock of faithful shepherd by taking away endowment from parish giving back in complicated way to country parish must be better able than ever to support clergyman bishop must be bishop indeed when be no longer creature of minister breath a to dean not seeing clear way to satisfy aspirant for future vacancy in deanery became more than usually vague seemed to imply that bill be now with leave of house to be read second time contained clause forbidding appointment of dean though special stipend of office must be matter of consideration with new church synod detail of part of speech be felt to be dull by stranger a long a must abuse mr gresham men must listen with pleasure must keep attention fixed while referred to general conservatism of party have honour of leading there be raciness in promise of so much church destruction from chosen leader of church party be assisted by conviction in mind of most men that be impossible for unfortunate conservative to refuse to follow leader let lead where might there be gratification in feeling that country party be bound to follow even must take into very bowel of mountain a pied piper did child of hamelin made listening pleasant when mr daubeny stated effect of different clause explaining what be to be taken what left with fervent assurance that what be to be left must under altered circumstance go much further than whole have gone before then audience became weary began to think that be time that other gentleman must be upon leg at end of minister speech there be touch of invective went far to redeem returned to personal question to adversary have undertaken to confine expressed holy horror at political doctrine be implied during prolonged parliamentary experience have encountered much factious opposition must even acknowledge that have seen exercised on side of house though have always striven to keep free from baneful influence never till now have known statesman proclaim intention of depending upon faction upon faction alone for result desired to achieve let right honourable gentleman raise contest on principle detail of measure must be quite content to abide decision of house must regard raid a threatened against friend by right honourable gentleman a unconstitutional revolutionary tyrannical felt sure that opposition so based so maintained even if be enabled by heated feeling of moment to obtain unfortunate success in house must not be encouraged by sympathy support of country at large by last word be understood to signify must be beaten on second reading not in reference to merit of bill simply on issue a proposed by mr gresham must again dissolve house before must resign now be very well understood that there be liberal member in house who must prefer even success of mr daubeny to speedy reappearance before constituent mr daubeny spoke till nearly eight be surmised at time that have craftily arranged oratory so a to embarrass opponent house have met at four be to sit continuously till be adjourned for night when be case gentleman who speak about eight o'clock be too frequently obliged to address to empty bench on present occasion be mr gresham intention to follow opponent at once instead of waiting a be usual with leader of party to close of debate be understood that mr gresham must follow mr daubeny with object of making distinct charge against minister so that vote on second reading of church bill might in truth be vote of want of confidence to commence speech at eight o'clock when house be hungry uneasy must be trial have mr daubeny closed hour sooner there must with little stretching of favoured hour have be time enough member must not have objected to postpone dinner till past eight perhaps nine when favourite orator be on leg with mr gresham beginning great speech at eight dinner must altogether become doubtful disaster might be serious be not probable that mr daubeny have even among friend proclaimed such strategy be thought by political speculator of day that idea have be present to mind mr gresham be not to be turned from purpose waited for few moment then rose addressed speaker few member left house gentleman doubtless whose constitution weakened by previous service must not endure prolonged fasting who have nearly reached door returned to seat mindful of messrs roby ratler for bulk of assembled interest of moment be greater even than love of dinner of peer departed be observed that bishop two left house among stranger in gallery hardly foot of space be gained who gave up seat then gave up for night mr gresham began with calmness of tone seemed almost to be affected arose from struggle on own part to repress superabundant energy of be only too conscious calmness soon gave place to warmth heated into violence before have be quarter of hour upon leg soon became even ferocious in invective said thing so bitter that have conception of bitterness there be difference between two men that whereas mr daubeny hit always a hard a knew how to hit having premeditated blow weighed result beforehand having calculated power even to effect of blow repeated on wound already given mr gresham struck right left straightforward with readiness engendered by practice in fury might have murdered antagonist before be aware that have drawn blood began by refusing absolutely to discus merit of bill right honourable gentleman have prided on generosity a greek must remind right honourable gentleman present from greek have ever be considered dangerous be gift only gift that fear said political gift of right honourable gentleman extracted by from unwilling colleague follower have always be more bitter to taste than dead sea apple that such gift must not be bestowed on country by unwilling hand that reform must not come from who felt necessity of reform believed to be wish not only of house of country at large must gentleman on bench excepting right honourable gentleman pointed to crowded phalanx of government get up declare that measure of church reform severance of church state be brought forward in consonance with own long cherished political conviction accused that party of being so bound to chariot wheel of right honourable gentleman a to be unable to abide by own conviction a to right honourable gentleman must appeal to follower opposite to say whether right honourable gentleman be possessed of one strong political conviction have be accused of being unconstitutional revolutionary tyrannical if house must allow must very shortly explain idea of constitutional government a carried on in country be based built on majority in house supported solely by power there must be constitutional government in country be not so maintained other government must be revolutionary tyrannical other government be usurpation must make bold to tell right honourable gentleman that minister in country who must recommend majesty to trust to adviser not supported by majority of house of common must plainly be guilty of usurping power of state threw from with disdain charge have be brought against of hankering after sweet of office indulged gloried in indulging highest ambition of english subject gloried much more in privilege power of house within wall of be centred be salutary be efficacious be stable in political constitution of country have be pride to have acted during nearly political life with party have commanded majority must defy most bitter adversary must defy right honourable gentleman to point to period of career in have be unwilling to succumb to majority when have belonged to minority must regard vote on occasion a vote of want of confidence took line be now taking because desired to bring house to decision on question have not that confidence in right honourable gentleman must justify in accepting measure on so important subject a union severance of church state from hand must majority of house differ from support second reading of bill must at once so far succumb a to give best attention to clause of bill endeavour with assistance of gentleman who acted with to make suitable to want of country by omission addition a clause must pas through committee before doing that must ask house to decide with solemnity weight whether be willing to accept from hand of right honourable gentleman measure of reform on matter so important a now before be nearly ten when sat down then stomach of house must stand no longer adjournment at once took place on next morning be generally considered that mr daubeny have be too long mr gresham too passionate there be who declared that mr gresham have never be finer than when described privilege of house of common others who thought that mr daubeny lucidity have be marvellous in case a in most others speech of day be generally thought to have be very inferior to great effort of past chapter xxxiv universe before house met again quidnunc about club on side of question have determined that mr gresham speech whether good not a effort of oratory must serve intended purpose must be backed by majority of vote might have be very doubtful whether such must have be case have attempted to throw out bill on merit mr ratler by time that prayer have be read have become almost certain of success there be very few liberal in house who be not anxious to declare by vote that have confidence in mr daubeny mr turnbull great radical perhaps two dozen with must support second reading declaring that must not reconcile with conscience to record vote in favour of union of church state on such occasion a present mr turnbull be sure to make disagreeable to who sat near to in house be man who thought that so much be demanded of in order that independence might be doubted by none be nothing to be wont to say who called prime minister secretary here president there then there must be quite a much of independence on conservative a on liberal side of house surely there must be more than two dozen gentleman who must be true enough to cherished principle of whole life to vote against bill a be fact that there be so very few so true added length to face of country parson six month ago not country gentleman in england must have listened to such proposition without loud protest a to revolutionary wickedness now under sole pressure of one man authority subject have become so common that men be assured that thing must be done even though of thing must be done be worst be good longer having opinion upon anything one parson said to a sat together at club with newspaper in hand nothing frightens one infidelity no wickedness revolution reverence be at end holy of holy be more even to worshipper than threshold of temple though became known that bill must be lost what comfort be there in when battle be to be won not by chosen israelite to whom church with appurtenance ought to be dear by crew of philistine who must certainly follow lead of opponent in destroying holy structure on friday debate be continued with much life on ministerial side of house be very easy for to cry faction faction hardly necessary for to do more few parrot word have be learned a to expediency of fitting great increasing church of england to growing necessity of age that church of england must still be church of england be repeated till weary listener be sick of unmeaning word zeal of combatant be displayed on other question faction be now avowed weapon of leader of so called liberal side of house be very easy to denounce new doctrine word that mr gresham have spoken be picked in piece enormity of theory be exhibited have boldly declared to that be to regard men not measure be to show by vote whether be prepared to accept such teaching speech be of course made by alternate orator firing from conservative bench be on evening much louder must have seemed that with issue between might almost have consented to divide after completion of two great speech course on be to run have be explained to be not probable that member intention a to running must now be altered by anything that might hear mr turnbull two dozen defaulter be known two dozen four true conservative be known also nevertheless great many member be anxious to speak must be great debate of session subject to be handled namely of general merit demerit of two political party be wide very easy on night be past one o'clock when mr turnbull adjourned house be afraid must put off till tuesday mr ratler said on sunday afternoon to phineas finn have objection at so long a get fair place on day there sha be doubt about gresham particularly want to speak because be pledged to measure of disestablishment can insist on own view that even must such measure be essentially necessary think be said phineas still must not be accepted from old church state party there be something pleasant in to phineas finn something made feel for moment that have perhaps mistaken bearing of friend towards be sure of majority suppose said absolutely sure said ratler begin to think will amount to hundred perhaps more what will daubeny do go out ca do anything else pluck be certainly wonderful even with pluck ca dissolve again church bill have given six month run six month be something be true that grogram be to be chancellor phineas asked question not from particular solicitude a to prospect of sir gregory grogram because be anxious to hear whether mr ratler must speak to with anything of cordiality of fellowship respecting new government mr ratler became at once discreet close said that did not think that anything a yet be known a to woolsack then phineas retreated again within shell with certainty that nothing must be done for yet to whom must question of place be of such vital importance a be to have come back to old haunt from ireland abandoning altogether pleasant safety of assured income buoyed by hope of office have after fashion made calculation in present disposition of country be thought certain that liberal party must for next twenty year have longer period of power than opponent have thought also be in house place must eventually be given to have be in office before have be especially successful knew that have be said of that of young debutants of latter year have be best have left party by opposing have done so without creating ill will among leader of party in manner have be regarded a highly honourable to on departing have received expression of deep regret from mr gresham when barrington erle have wanted to return to old work own chief doubt have be about seat have be bold have adventured have succeeded there have be little trouble about pledge given at tankerville must be able to turn even to use of party be quite true that nothing have be promised erle when have written bidding to come over from ireland must have intended to understand that must be again enrolled in favoured regiment must be able to show a possessor of seat in house yet yet felt convinced that when day must come must be to day of disappointment that when list must appear name must not be on madame goesler have suggested to that mr bonteen might be enemy have replied by stating that hated mr bonteen now remembered that mr bonteen have hardly spoken to since return to london though there have not in fact be quarrel between in condition of mind longed to speak openly to barrington erle be restrained by feeling of pride still existing idea that candidate for office let claim be what might must ask for place on sunday evening saw bonteen at club men be going in out with feverish excitement always prevails on eve of great parliamentary change large majority against government be considered to be certain there be idea abroad that mr daubeny have scheme in head by to confute immediate purport of enemy there be nothing to audacity of man be not equal said that must dissolve house have hardly a yet be six month sitting others be of opinion that must simply resolve not to vacate place thus defying majority of house ministerial tradition of country word have fallen from made men certain that such be intention that must succeed ultimately be impossible whole country must rise against supply must be refused in detail of government must be impeded then such be temper of man be thought that horror must not deter there must be blaze confusion in timid men must doubt whether constitution must be burned to tinder only illuminated blaze confusion must be dear to mr daubeny if must stand a centre figure great pyrotechnist who did red from head to foot with glare of squib with own hand be filling space anticipation that such display might take place made men busy eager so that on sunday evening roamed about from one place of meeting to instead of sitting at home with wife daughter there be at time existing small club so called though unlike other club have entitled universe name be supposed to be joke a be limited to ninety nine member be domiciled in one simple somewhat mean apartment be kept open only one hour before one hour after midnight that only on two night of week that only when parliament be sitting attraction be not numerous consisting chiefly of tobacco tea conversation be generally listless often desultory occasionally there must arise great terrible evil of punster whom one hated one have life enough to put down thing have be success men liked to be member of universe mr bonteen be member so be phineas finn on sunday evening club be open phineas a entered room perceived that enemy be seated alone on corner of sofa mr bonteen be not man who loved to be alone in public place be apt rather to make one of congregation affecting popularity always at work increasing influence on occasion own greatness have probably isolated if be true that be to be new chancellor of exchequer to ascend from demi godhead to perfect divinity of cabinet to do so by leap must make high even among first class god might be well for to look to choose new congregation at least must be becoming that must be chosen now instead of being chooser be one who must weigh to last ounce importance of position make most accurate calculation a to effect of intimacy on very morning mr gresham have suggested to that in event of liberal government being formed must hold high office in question perhaps have not be done in most flattering manner a mr gresham have deeply bewailed loss of mr palliser have almost demanded pledge from mr bonteen that must walk exactly in mr palliser footstep offer have be made must not be retracted mr bonteen already felt warmth of halo of perfect divinity there be men who seem to have be born to be cabinet minister duke mostly earl younger son of such who have be trained to from very cradle of whom may imagine that be subject to special awe when first enter into august assembly feel little personal elevation to political aspirant not born in purple of public life entrance upon counsel of higher deity must be accompanied by feeling of supreme triumph dashed by considerable misgiving perhaps mr bonteen be revelling in triumph perhaps be anticipating misgiving phineas though disinclined to make inquiry of friend might seem to refer to own condition felt such reluctance in regard to one who certainly must not suspect of asking favour be presumed to be on term of intimacy with man took seat beside asking question a to debate now mr bonteen have more than once expressed opinion among friend that phineas finn must throw party over vote with government ratlers erles fitzgibbons knew that phineas be safe mr bonteen be still in doubt suited to affect something more than doubt on present occasion wonder that must ask said mr bonteen what do mean by presume a usual will vote against never voted against party once said phineas then did with approbation of man in for whose good opinion cared straw there be insult in tone a said something near akin to insult in word must do again now break promise that made at tankerville do know what promise made at tankerville will break promise must allow to say mr finn that kind of independence be practised by mr monk grand a may be on part of men who avowedly abstain from office be little dangerous when be now again adopted by men who have taken place like to be sure that men who be in same boat with wo take into head that duty requires to scuttle ship having so spoken mr bonteen with nearly grace of full fledged cabinet minister rose from seat on corner of sofa joined small congregation phineas felt that ear be tingling that face be red looked round to ascertain from countenance of others whether have heard what have be said nobody have be close to thought that conversation have be unnoticed knew now that have be imprudent in addressing to mr bonteen though question that have first asked have be quite commonplace a be man thought have be determined to affront have made charge against must not allow to pas unnoticed then there be additional bitterness in arose from conviction that bonteen have spoken opinion of other men a well a own that have plainly indicated that gate of official paradise be to be closed against presumed offender phineas have before believed that be to be so that belief have now become assurance got up in misery to leave room a did so met laurence fitzgibbon have heard news about bonteen said laurence what news be to be pitchforked up to exchequer say be quite settled higher monkey climb know proverb so saying laurence fitzgibbon passed into room phineas finn took departure in solitude so man with whom have managed to quarrel utterly be to be one in cabinet man whose voice must probably be potential in selection of minor member of government seemed to to be almost incredible that one a mr bonteen must be chosen for such office have despised almost a soon a have known mr bonteen have rarely heard future manager of finance of country spoken of with respect regard have regarded mr bonteen a useful dull unscrupulous politician well accustomed to parliament acquainted with bye path back door of official life therefore certain of employment when liberal be in power there be one in party have thought le likely to be selected for high place yet man be to be made chancellor of exchequer while phineas finn very probably at man instance be to be left out in cold knew to be superior to man hated to have higher idea of political life to be capable of greater political sacrifice have sat shoulder to shoulder with many men on treasury bench whose political principle have not greatly valued of none of have thought so little a have done of mr bonteen yet mr bonteen be to be new chancellor of exchequer walked home to lodging in marlborough street wretched because of own failure doubly wretched because of other man success laid awake night thinking of word have be spoken to after breakfast on following morning wrote following note to enemy house of common th april dear mr bonteen be matter of extreme regret to that last night at universe must have asked chance question about coming division have guessed to what might have led must not have addressed a be can hardly abstain from noticing what appeared to to be personal charge made against with great want of courtesy be supposed to prevail among men who have acted together have never done so original question to might perhaps have be deemed impertinence a be accused of having be dishonest to party of having scuttled ship on occasion to alluded acted with much consideration greatly to detriment of own prospect a believed with approbation of who knew anything of subject if will make inquiry of mr gresham lord cantrip who be then chief think that will tell that conduct on occasion be not such a to lay open to reproach if will do think that can not fail afterwards to express regret for what said to last night yours sincerely phineas finn tho bonteen esq mp did not like letter when have written did not know how to improve sent chapter xxxv political venom on monday mr turnbull opened ball by declaring reason for going into same lobby with mr daubeny did at great length to mighty pomp little squabble of office be said a nothing must never allow to regard person of prime minister measure before house ever have be ever must be in to if public weal be more regarded in house quarrel of men le considered thought that service of country must be better done be answered by mr monk who be sitting near who intended to support mr gresham mr monk be rather happy in pulling old friend mr turnbull to piece expressing opinion that difference in men meant difference in measure character of men whose principle be known be guarantee for measure must advocate to mr monk be matter of very great moment who be prime minister of england be always selfish enough to wish for minister with whom must agree on main question of day a certainly must not say that have political confidence in present ministry must certainly vote against on occasion in course of evening phineas found letter addressed to from mr bonteen be a follows house of common april th dear mr finn never accused of dishonesty must have misheard misunderstood if thought so did say that have scuttled ship a most undoubtedly did scuttle mr monk between can not retract word want to go to one for testimony a to merit on occasion accused of having done nothing dishonourable disgraceful think said that there be danger in practice of scuttling think so still though know that many fancy that who scuttle do fine thing deny that be fine therefore can have cause of complaint against yours truly j bonteen have brought copy of own letter in pocket to house showed correspondence to mr monk must not have noticed have be said can have idea of offensive nature of remark when be made be a offensive to a to must not think of moving in such matter when man annoys keep out of way be generally best thing can do if man be to call liar men call other liar bonteen understands world much too well to commit by using word common opinion must force to retract say scuttled ship well did of political act of life be one of be most proud manner in helped have entitled to affectionate esteem did scuttle ship before can quarrel with bonteen must be able to show that metaphorical scuttling of ship must necessarily be disgraceful act see how at once retreat behind fact that need not be so must answer letter think not can do no good by correspondence in can not get hold of if did get hold of must injure much more than just drop added much to friend misery made feel that weight of be almost more than must bear enemy have got better of at turn have now rushed into correspondence a to must have to own by silence that have be confuted yet be sure that mr bonteen have at club insulted most unjustifiably that if actual truth be known man certainly not mr monk must hesitate to say that reparation be due to yet what must do thought that must consult lord cantrip endeavour to get from late chief advice more palatable than have be tendered to by mr monk in meantime animosity in house be waxing very furious a happened debate took turn be peculiarly injurious to phineas finn in present state of mind rumour a to future promotion of mr bonteen have be conveyed by laurence fitzgibbon to phineas at universe have a be natural spread far wide have reached ear of who still sat on ministerial bench now be quite understood among politician in country man must presume that will have imposed upon task of forming ministry until have be called upon by crown to undertake great duty let gresham daubeny of day be ever so sure that rein of state chariot must come into hand must not visibly prepare for seat on box till have actually be summoned to place there at moment be alleged that mr gresham have departed from reticence modesty usual in position a by taking step towards formation of cabinet while be a yet quite possible that might never be called upon to form cabinet late on monday night when house be quite full one of mr daubeny leading lieutenant secretary of state sir orlando drought by name gentleman who if have heart in matter must have hated church bill from very bottom of heart who on account be more bitter against opponent who have not ceased to throw in teeth own political tergiversation fell foul of mr gresham a to rumoured appointment to chancellorship of exchequer reader will easily imagine thing be said sir orlando have heard have be much surprised at hearing that certain honourable member of house who have long be known to a tenant of ministerial bench have already be appointed to high office sir orlando have not be aware that office have be vacant that if vacant must have be at disposal of right honourable gentleman believed that there be doubt that place in question with seat in cabinet have be tendered to accepted by honourable member to whom alluded such be rabid haste with right honourable gentleman opposite colleague be attempting must not say to climb to rush into office by opposing great measure of reform wisdom of a be notorious to world did not dare to deny much more of same kind be said during mr gresham pulled about hat shuffled foot showed annoyance to house at last jumped upon leg if said sir orlando drought if right honourable gentleman wish to deny accuracy of statement have made will give way to for moment that may do so deny utterly not only accuracy detail of statement made by right honourable gentleman opposite said mr gresham still standing holding hat in hand a completed denial doe right honourable gentleman mean to assure that have not selected future chancellor of exchequer right honourable gentleman be too acute not to be aware that on side of house may have made such selection yet detail of statement have be rash enough to make to house may be unfounded word sir be weak must fain avoid use of word justifiable though might be must offend feeling of house will explain to house exactly what have be done then there be great hubbub cry of order gresham spoke hear hear like during sir orlando drought mr gresham stood on leg so powerful be mr gresham voice that through word that said be audible to reporter opponent hardly attempted to speak stood relying upon right mr gresham said understood that be desire of house that must explain circumstance in reference to charge have be made against must certainly be for convenience of house that must be done at moment speaker of course ruled that sir orlando be in possession of floor suggested that might be convenient that must yield to right honourable gentleman on other side for few minute mr gresham a matter of course succeeded right rule be bond of iron to little man be packthread to giant one in assembly knew house better than did mr gresham be better able to take by storm more obdurate in perseverance did make speech though clearly have right to do so house said be aware that by most unfortunate demise of late duke of omnium gentleman have be removed from house to place whose absence from counsel must long be felt a very grievous loss then pronounced eulogy on plantagenet palliser so graceful well arranged that even bitterness of existing opposition be unable to demur to house be well aware of nature of labour now for year past have occupied mind of noble duke paramount importance country attached to conclusion noble duke doubt be not absolutely debarred from continuance of work by change have fallen upon be essential that gentleman belonging to same party with noble duke versed in office having seat in house must endeavour to devote to great measure have occupied so much of attention of late chancellor of exchequer doubt must be fitting that gentleman so selected must be at exchequer in event of party coming into office honourable gentleman to whom allusion have be made have acted throughout with present noble duke in arranging detail of measure in question probability of being able to fill shoe left vacant by accession to peerage of noble duke have indeed be discussed discussion have be made in reference to measure only incidentally in regard to office mr gresham held that have done nothing be indiscreet nothing that duty did not demand if right honourable gentleman opposite be of different opinion thought that difference came from fact that be le intimately acquainted than unfortunately have be with burden responsibility of legislation there be very little in dispute seemed to be worthy of place in occurred of vigour with be conducted served to show temper of party to express bitterness of political feeling of day be said at time never within memory of living politician have so violent animosity displayed in house a have be witnessed on night while mr gresham be giving explanation mr daubeny have arisen with mock solemnity be peculiar to on occasion such a have appealed to speaker whether right honourable gentleman opposite must not be called upon to resume seat mr gresham have put down with wave of hand affected stateliness can not support for moment mr daubeny have be forced to sit down when speaker did not at once support appeal did not forget wave of hand did forgive be man who in public life rarely forgot never forgave used to say of at home be kindly forbearing simple unostentatious may be so who doe not remember that horrible turk jacob asdrubal old bailey barrister terror of witness bane of judge who be gall wormwood to opponent be said of at home docile amiability be marvel of friend delight of wife daughter at home perhaps mr daubeny might have be waved at have forgiven men who saw scene in house of common knew that must never forgive mr gresham a for mr gresham triumphed at moment exulted in triumph phineas finn heard be disgusted to find that enemy thus became hero of hour be indeed opinion generally of liberal party mr gresham have not said much to flatter new chancellor of exchequer in praise of plantagenet palliser have be very loud have doubt said that implied capability of mr bonteen who a happened be sitting next to at time have implied also that mantle be to be transferred from mr palliser to mr bonteen must be carried by new wearer with grace very inferior to have marked step of predecessor ratler erle fitzgibbon others have laughed in sleeve at expression understood by of mr gresham doubt a to qualification of new assistant sir orlando drought in continuing speech remarked that warmth of right honourable gentleman have be so completely expended in abusing enemy that have have none left for defence of friend to phineas seemed that bonteen who have so grievously injured whom so thoroughly despised be carrying off glory of fight certain amount of consolation be however afforded to between one two o'clock be told by mr ratler that might enjoy privilege of adjourning debate by must accrue to right of commencing on morrow did at few minute before three chapter xxxvi seventy two on next morning phineas with speech before be obliged for while to forget at least to postpone mr bonteen injury must not now go to lord cantrip a hour be too precious to a felt too short though have be thinking what must say ever since debate have become imminent knew accurately line must take have not a yet prepared word of speech have resolved that must not prepare word otherwise than might do by arranging certain phrase in memory there must be nothing written have tried that before in old day have broken down with effort must load with burden of word in so heavy that carrying of must incapacitate for other effort after late breakfast walked out far away into regent park there wandering among uninteresting path devised triumph of oratory for let resolve a must to forget mr bonteen that charge of having be untrue to companion must not restrain from effort to fit matter after fashion into speech dim idea of definition of political honesty crossed brain bringing with however conviction that thought must be much more clearly worked out than must be on day before might venture to give birth in house of common knew that have be honest two year ago in separating from colleague knew that must be honest now in voting with apparently in opposition to pledge have given at tankerville knew also that must behove to abstain from speaking of unless must do so in close reference to point specially in dispute between two party when returned to eat mutton chop at great marlborough street at three o'clock be painfully conscious that morning have be wasted have allowed mind to run revel instead of tying down to formation of sentence construction of argument entered house with speaker at four o'clock took seat without uttering word to man seemed to be more than ever disjoined from party hitherto since have be seated by judge order former companion of parliamentary life old men whom have used to know have to certain degree admitted among many of sat on front opposition bench whereas a matter of course have seated behind have very frequently found next to man who have held office be living in hope of holding again have felt to be in sort recognised a aspirant now seemed to that be otherwise did not doubt that bonteen have shown correspondence to friend that ratlers erles have conceded that phineas be put out of court by sat doggedly still at end of bench behind mr gresham close to gangway when mr gresham entered house be received with much cheering phineas did not join in cheer be studious to avoid personal recognition of future giver away of place though two be close together then fancied that mr gresham have specially most ungraciously abstained from recognition of mr monk who sat near spoke kind word to sha be very long said phineas not above twenty minute must think be able to assume air of indifference yet at moment heartily wished back in dublin be not now that feared task immediately before that be overcome by feeling of general failure have come upon of what use be to to one else that must be there in assembly with privilege of making speech must influence human being unless being there must be made step to something beyond while usual preliminary work be being done looked round house saw lord cantrip in peer gallery ala of what avail be that have always be able to bind to individual with whom have be brought into close contact more than be wanted in most precarious of profession in now for second time be attempting to earn bread at past four be on leg in midst of crowded house chance perhaps hope of such encounter a of former day brought member into seat filled gallery with stranger may say perhaps that highest duty imposed upon a nation be management of india may also say that in great national assembly personal squabbling among member be least dignified work in can employ prospect of explanation otherwise of fight between two leading politician will fill house allusion to eastern empire will certainly empty aptitude for such encounter be almost necessary qualification for popular leader in parliament a be capacity for speaking for three hour to reporter to reporter only necessary qualification for under secretary of state for india phineas have advantage of temper of moment in house thoroughly crowded enjoyed let man doubt ever so much own capacity for public exhibition have undertaken yet will always prefer to fail if fail must before large audience on occasion there be failure that sense of awe from surrounding circumstance of moment have once be heavy on still well remembered have be overcome have never returned to felt now that must not lack word to pour out own individual grievance be not that be prevented by sense of indiscretion of doing so a be did succeed in alluding to own condition in manner brought upon reproach began by saying that must not have added to difficulty of debate be one simply of length be not that have be accused in advance of voting against measure a to have pledged at hustings to do that must to further man be more anxious than irish roman catholic to abolish thought to be anomaly of state church did not in least doubt that must now be doing best in power with object in voting against second reading of present bill that measure must be carried by gentleman opposite in own teeth at bidding of right honourable gentleman who led thought to be impossible upon be hooted at from other side with many gesture of indignant denial be of course equally cheered by around such interruption be new breath to nostril of orator phineas enjoyed noise repeated assertion that must be evil thing for country that measure must be carried by men who in heart condemned be vehemently called to order for assertion about heart of gentleman speaker who can certainly be made amenable to authority for vilipending in debate heart of specified opponent may with safety attribute manner of ill to agglomerated heart of party to have told individual conservative sir orlando drought for instance that be abandoning conviction of life because be creature at command of mr daubeny must have be insult must have moved even speaker from serenity can hardly be personal to whole bench of conservative to bench above bench of conservative charge have be made repeated over over again till orlando drought be ready to cut man throat whether own mr daubeny mr gresham hardly knew might probably have be mr daubeny for choice have real cutting of throat be possible be now made again by phineas finn with ostensible object of defending for moment became target for conservative wrath one asked in fury by what right took upon to judge of motif of gentleman on side of house of whom personally knew nothing phineas replied that did not at doubt motif of honourable gentleman who asked question be sure be noble patriotic unfortunately whole country be convinced that conservative party a body be supporting measure unwillingly at bidding of one man for be bound to say that agreed with country so row be renewed prolonged gentleman assembled member stranger together passed pleasant evening before sat down phineas made one allusion to former scuttling of ship accusation a to have be made against so injuriously by mr bonteen said have be called impractical perhaps might allude to vote have given in house when last have honour of sitting there on giving resigned office have then held have gratification of knowing that have be so far practical a to have then foreseen necessity of measure have since be passed did not doubt that must hereafter be found to have be equally practical in view that have expressed on hustings at tankerville for be convinced that before long anomaly of have spoken must cease to exist under influence of government must really believe in work be doing there be doubt a to success of speech vehemence with insolence be abused by one after of who spoke later from other side be ample evidence of success nothing occurred then at conclusion of debate to make think that have won way back to elysium during whole evening exchanged not syllable with mr gresham who indeed be not much given to converse with around in house erle said few good natured word to mr monk praised highly in reading general barometer of party a regarded did not find that mercury went up be wretchedly anxious angry with for own anxiety scorned to say word must sound like entreaty yet have placed whole heart on thing seemed to be slipping from for want of asking in day two must be known whether present ministry must must not go out that must be out of office before month be over seemed to opinion of everybody fate what fate be must then be absolutely in hand of mr gresham yet must not speak word of hope fear even to mr gresham have given up everything in world with view of getting into office now that opportunity have come opportunity if allowed to slip must hardly return again in time to be of service to prize be to elude grasp yet did not say word to one on subject be so near heart although in course of night spoke to lord cantrip in gallery of house told friend that correspondence have taken place between mr bonteen in thought that have be ill used a to be quite anxious to ask lordship advice heard that have be tilting at other said lord cantrip smiling have seen letter be told of by lord fawn who have seen knew must show to newsmonger about club said phineas angrily ca quarrel with bonteen for showing to fawn if intend to show to may publish at charing cross if like exactly be sure that there will have be nothing in prejudicial to what mean be that if think necessary with view to own character to show to to friend can not complain that must do same appointment be made at lord cantrip house for next morning phineas must acknowledge to that man manner to have be kind constant nevertheless whole affair be going against lord cantrip have not said word prejudicial to wretch bonteen much le have hinted at future arrangement must be comfortable to poor phineas two lord cantrip phineas have at one period be on most intimate term together have worked in same office have thoroughly trusted other elder of two for lord cantrip be about ten year senior to phineas have frequently expressed most lively interest in prospect of other phineas have felt that in emergency must tell friend hope fear now did not say word of position did lord cantrip allude to be to meet on morrow in order that lord cantrip might read correspondence phineas be sure that word must be said about government at five o'clock in morning division took place government be beaten by majority of be much higher than man have expected when party be marwilled in opposite lobby be found that in last moment number of conservative who dared to rebel against conservative leader be swelled by course debate have taken there be certain men who must not endure to be twitted with having deserted principle of life when be clear that nothing be to be gained by party by such desertion chapter xxxvii conspiracy on morning following great division phineas be with friend lord cantrip by eleven o'clock lord cantrip when have read two letter in be comprised whole correspondence made to unhappy hero following little speech think that can do anything indeed be sure that mr monk be quite right quite see what be that wish to do privately between two self hesitate to say that mr bonteen have intended to be ill natured fancy that be ill natured at rate jealous man that must be willing to run down competitor in race who have made running after fashion different from own bonteen have be useful man very useful man more so perhaps because have not entertained high political theory of own have chosen to do so undoubtedly when monk left to very great regret did scuttle ship have intention of kind suppose that blame that be odious to eye of mr bonteen be to thinking high honourable conduct have known same thing done by member of government perhaps dozen time men by whom have be done have be best noblest of modern statesman there have generally be hard contest in man breast between loyalty to party strong personal conviction result of have be inability on part of struggler to give even silent support to measure have disapproved that inability be doubt troublesome at time to colleague of seceder constitutes offence hardly to be pardoned by such gentleman a mr bonteen for mr bonteen personally care nothing of course must endure ill effect of influence be what may when seceded from government looked for certain adverse consequence if did not where be self sacrifice that such men a mr bonteen must feel that have scuttled ship be unable to forgive for doing so be exactly evil knew must face have to face now surely can do so without showing teeth hereafter when men more thoughtful than mr bonteen will have come to acknowledge high principle by conduct have be governed will receive reward suppose mr daubeny must resign now everybody say so be by mean sure that will other minister since lord north time must have done so with such majority against on vital measure be man who delight in striking out wonderful course for prime minister so beaten surely ca go on not for long one must think yet how be to turn out depends very much on man power of endurance colleague will resign must think probably then must go must say that will be way in matter will settle good morning finn take word for have better not answer mr bonteen letter not word have fallen from lord cantrip friendly lip a to probability of phineas being invited to join future government attempt have be made to console with hazy promise of future reward however be to consist rather of good opinion of good men than of anything tangible useful even must never come to what must good men know of of self sacrifice when must have be driven out of world by poverty forced probably to go to new zealand back canadian settlement to look for bread how easy thought phineas must be sacrifice of rich men who can stay time wait in perfect security for reward for such one a truth to principle be political annihilation two three year ago have done what knew to be noble thing now because have done that noble thing be to be regarded a unfit for very employment for be peculiarly fitted bonteen co have not be only enemy luck have be against throughout mr quintus slide with people banner story of wretched affair in judd street have be a strong against probably a mr bonteen ill word then thought of lady laura love for gratitude to lady laura be boundless there be nothing must not do for lady laura be in power to do anything circumstance in career have be so unfortunate for a affection wretched charge have be made against though wholly untrue be a be so strangely connected with truth that slanderer might not improbably be able almost to substantiate calumny must be in london soon must devote to service act of friendship that might do for must be used a proof of accusation have be made against a thought of be walking towards park lane in order that might call upon madame goesler according to promise a went up to drawing room met old mr maule coming down two bowed to other on stair in drawing room sitting with madame goesler found mr bonteen now mr bonteen be almost a odious to a be husband did ever know anything more shameful mr finn said mr bonteen than attack made upon mr bonteen night before last phineas must see smile on madame goesler face a question be asked for knew knew that knew how great be antipathy between bonteens attack be upon mr gresham thought said phineas oh yes nominally of course everybody know what be meant upon word there be twice more jealousy among men than among woman be there not madame goesler think man must be more jealous than be said madame goesler then be fit to be member of government be suppose that there be man in england have worked harder for party than mr bonteen think there be said phineas made more useful in parliament a for work only that constitution be so strong must have killed must take thorley mixture twice day said madame goesler take never have time to take anything breakfast in dressing room carry lunch in pocket dines with division bell ringing up between fish mutton chop now have got decimal coinage in hand have not moment to even on sunday will be sure to go to heaven for be one comfort because be absolutely obliged to make chancellor of exchequer just a if have not earned everybody be so jealous that be ready to tear to piece who be everybody asked phineas oh know be only sir orlando drought who told sir orlando never mind mr finn in least mr bonteen must have thought must have be so triumphant said madame goesler not in least madame goesler why must be triumphant of course position be very high very high indeed be more than what have always expected if man give up life to pursuit ought to succeed a for ambition have le of than woman only do hate jealousy mr finn then mr bonteen took leave kissing dear friend madame goesler simply bowing to phineas what detestable woman said phineas know of old that love believe that love bit better than do yet kiss hardly that mr finn there have come up fashion for lady to pretend to be very loving so put face together two hundred year ago lady gentleman did same thing with just a little regard for other fashion change know be change for worse certainly madame goesler be of doing so have have great victory yes greater than expected according to mr bonteen chief result to country will be that tax will be so very safe in husband hand be sure belief that parliament have be at work in order that might be made cabinet minister rather like for like husband do like woman can thoroughly enjoy husband success when be talking of carrying about food in pocket be completely happy think lady glencora ever cared in least about husband being chancellor of exchequer because added nothing to own standing be very ill natured mr finn find that be becoming generally ill natured used to be best humoured of men have so much to try temper a have now then must remember madame goesler regard people a being especially enemy lady glencora be never enemy friend especially then wrong if tell something must be discreet be not always discreet doe not love mr bonteen have have too much of at matching a for wife be quite a unwilling to be kissed by a can be grace be determined to fight battle for want to hing of kind madame goesler will know nothing about have put head to work mr palliser be new duke be to be made to tell mr gresham that be to have place be good being angry for thing be done if have enemy behind back must have friend behind back also lady cantrip be to do same thing for heaven sake not be arranged will be called lady pet must mind that lady laura will be here before be arranged will get hold of mr erle be laughing at know let laugh win thought of besieging lord fawn through lady chiltern be not sure that anybody care for lord fawn man specially want now be other duke be afraid of attacking through duchess because think that be inhumanly indifferent to anything that wife say to if kind of thing be done will not accept place even if be offered why not be going to let man like mr bonteen bowl over did ever know lady glen fail in anything that attempted be preparing secret with express object of making mr ratler confidant lord mount thistle be slave then fear lord mount thistle be not of much use will do anything everything except flatter mr bonteen heaven forbid that anybody must do that for sake truth be that made so disagreeable at matching lady glen be broken hearted at finding that be to seem to owe promotion to husband favour now know about have be very wrong to tell perhaps have mr finn thought better that must know that have friend at work for believe rather duchess belief that falsehood have be used be a disparaging to lady laura kennedy a be injurious to be determined to put right one have told mr gresham that have be mean of breaking heart of lord brentford mr kennedy two member of late cabinet must be made to understand that be untrue if only for lady laura sake must submit lord brentford be best friend in world mr kennedy be madman absolutely in custody of friend a everybody know yet story have be made to work feel that be derogatory to madame goesler be silent for moment then answered boldly not whit why must be derogatory be not done with object of obtaining improper appointment on behalf of unimportant man when falsehood of kind be told ca meet in straightforward way suppose know with fair accuracy sort of connection there have be between lady laura phineas very much doubted whether have such knowledge said nothing though lady paused few moment for reply ca go tell mr gresham that can friend do so on behalf must be absurd most absurd yet be essential to interest that must know when enemy be undermining must countermine will be blown up 'd rather fight above ground be very well enemy wo stay above ground be that newspaper man above ground for little job of clever mining believe that there be not better engineer going than lady glen not what have known to be very nearly 'hoist with own petard added madame goesler a remembered certain circumstance in joint life madame goesler

that must have be much to advantage of country at large that vacation week must have be used for constructing liberal cabinet work of construction always take time delay business of country one can have known better than did mr daubeny how great be injury of delay how advantageously short holiday might have be used with majority of seventy two against there must be reason why must not have at

occasion be not very good when have be seated about five minute rose still very languidly began statement colleague said in attempt to legislate for good of country have be beaten in regard to very great measure by large majority in compliance with what acknowledged to be expressed opinion of house have considered to be duty a colleague have considered to be theirs to place joint resignation in hand of majesty statement be received with considerable surprise a be not generally known that mr daubeny have a yet even seen queen feeling most predominant in house be one almost of dismay at man quiescence colleague have resigned have recommended majesty to send for mr gresham spoke in so low voice a to be hardly audible to house at large then paused ceasing to speak a though work be done even made gesture a though stepping back to seat deceived by mr gresham at other side of table rose to leg perhaps said mr daubeny perhaps right honourable gentleman must pardon house must pardon if still for moment interposed between house right honourable gentleman must well understand impatience of right honourable gentleman who doubt be anxious to reassume authority among temporary loss of have not perhaps borne with equanimity might have be expected from must promise house right honourable gentleman that must not detain long mr gresham threw back into seat evidently not without annoyance enemy stood for moment looking at unless be angel two men must at moment have hated other be supposed that be more than human be afterwards said that little ruse of pretending to resume seat have be deliberately planned by mr daubeny with view of seducing mr gresham into act of seeming impatience that word about opponent failing equanimity have be carefully prepared mr daubeny stood for minute silent then began to pour forth that be really speech on occasion flaccid half pronounced syllable in have declared that have resigned have be studiously careless purposely flaccid be duty to let house know fact did duty now have word to say in must take little interest mr daubeny must be fiery flaccid a suited now suited to be fiery have prophecy to make prophet have ever be energetic men mr daubeny conceived to be duty to inform house through house country now at last have day of ruin come upon british empire because have bowed to dominion of unscrupulous greedy faction can not be said that language used be unmeasured because word that uttered must have warranted speaker in calling to order within very wide bound of parliamentary etiquette there be limit to reproach reprobation heaped on house of common for late vote audacity equalled insolence in announcing resignation have condescended to speak of colleague now dropped colleague a though be unworthy of notice spoke only of own doings of own effort to save country be indeed willing to be saved unable to select fitting instrument of salvation have be twitted said with inconsistency to principle by men who be simply unable to understand meaning of word conservatism gentleman seemed to think that man who did not set up a apostle of constant change must therefore be bound always to stand still see country perish from stagnation might be that there be gentleman in house whose timid nature must not face danger of movement for must say that word have ever fallen from lip justified friend adversary in classing among number if man be anxious to keep fire alight doe refuse to touch sacred coal a in course of nature be consumed doe move with salutary poker add fresh fuel from basket knew that enemy to comfort of domestic hearth who must not keep hand for moment from fire iron perhaps might be justified if said that have be very much troubled of late in house by gentleman who must not keep finger from poker tongs there have now fallen upon trouble of nature much more serious in effect than have come must come from must be reformer spirit of personal ambition wretched thirst for office hankering after power privilege of ruling have not only actuated men a ala have be case since first need for men to govern others have arisen in world have be openly avowed put forward a adequate sufficient reason for opposing measure in disapprobation of single argument have be used right honourable gentleman proposition to house have be simply ' will oppose measure be good bad because desire to be prime minister call upon whom lead in politics to assist in doing so in order that may share good thing on may thus be enabled to lay hand then there arose great row in house there seemed to be doubt whether still existing minister of day must be allowed to continue statement mr gresham rose to foot sat down again instantly without having spoken word be audible two three voice be heard calling upon speaker for protection be however asserted afterwards that nothing have be said demanded speaker interference moderate voice be soon lost in enraged clamour of member on side insolence showered upon who generally supported mr daubeny have equalled that with have exasperated opposed to a word have fallen from lip there have be no purpose of cheering from conservative bench noise creates noise shouting be ready easy mode of contest for while seemed a though right side of speaker chair be only beaten by majority of lung on left side in midst of mr daubeny still stood firm on foot till gentleman have shouted silent then resumed speech remainder of what said be profound prophetic unintelligible gist of so far a must be understood when bran be bolted from consisted in assurance that country have now reached that period of life in rapid decay be inevitable that a mortal disease have already shown in worst form national decrepitude be imminent natural death must not long be postponed who attempted to read prophecy with accuracy be of opinion that prophet have intimated that have nation even in crisis consented to take prophet a sole physician to obey prescription with childlike docility health might not only have be re established new juvenescence absolutely created nature of medicine must have be taken be even supposed to have be indicated in very vague term have be allowed to operate must have cut tap root of national cancer have introduced fresh blood into national vein resuscitated national digestion seemed to think that nation a nation be willing enough to undergo operation be treated a must choose to treat that incubus of mr gresham backed by unworthy house of common have prevented be preventing nation from having own way therefore nation must be destroyed mr daubeny a soon a have completed speech took up hat stalked out of house be supposed at time that retiring prime minister have intended when rose to leg not only to denounce opponent also to separate from own unworthy associate men said that have become disgusted with politics disappointed altogether demoralized by defeat great curiosity existed a to step might be taken at time by party of have hitherto be leader on evening at rate nothing be done when mr daubeny be gone mr gresham rose said that in present temper of house thought best to postpone statement from have received majesty command only a have entered that house in obedience to command must wait upon majesty early to morrow hoped to be able to inform house at afternoon sitting be nature of command with majesty might honour what do think of phineas asked mr monk a left house together think that chatham of to day be very poor copy of who misbehaved century ago doe not whole thing distress not particularly have always felt that there have be mistake about mr daubeny by many have be accounted a statesman whereas to have always be political cagliostro now conjuror be think very pleasant fellow to have among if know that be conjuror conjuror who be believed to do trick without sleight of hand be dangerous man be essential that one must be found out known to be conjuror hope that such knowledge may have be communicated to men afternoon be very great said ratler to bonteen did not think so yes did very powerful indeed party be broken up to atom atom soon come together again in politics said ratler ca do without have got anybody else wonder what did when got home have gruel went to bed said bonteen say scene in house never disturb at home from conversation may be inferred that mr monk messrs ratler bonteen did not agree in idea respecting political conjuror chapter xl prime minister be hard pressed can never be very easy thing to form ministry one chosen chief be readily selected circumstance indeed have probably left choice in matter man in country who have at turned thought way know very well who will be next prime minister when come to pas that change be imminent in day occupant of throne can have difficulty mr gresham recommends majesty to send for mr daubeny mr daubeny for mr gresham a ten dozen year since mr mildmay told to send for lord de terrier lord de terrier for mr mildmay prime minister be elected by nation nation except in rare case can not go below in arranging detail man for whom queen sends be burdened with necessity of selecting colleague may be probably must always be case that other colleague be clearly indicated to mind then of colleague may want own inferior coadjutor so difficulty begin increase at length culminates on present occasion be known at end of week mr gresham have not filled office that there be difficulty be announced that duke of st bungay must not quite agree on certain point with mr gresham that duke of omnium must hing without other duke duke of st bungay be very powerful a there be three four of old adherent of mr mildmay who must join government unless be with sir harry coldfoot lord plinlimmon must not accept office without duke duke be essential now though duke character be essentially that of practical man who never raised unnecessary trouble men said that duke be at bottom of duke did not approve of mr bonteen mr gresham so be said insisted on mr bonteen appealing to other duke that other duke own special duke planty pall be instead of standing up for mr bonteen be cold unsympathetic must not join ministry without friend duke of st bungay a to mr bonteen thought that perhaps better selection might be made such be club rumour took place a to difficulty of day a be generally case be not far from truth of duke have absolutely put veto on poor mr bonteen elevation have expressed dissatisfied with appointment younger duke have found called upon to explain that although have be thrown much into communication with mr bonteen have never suggested that gentleman must follow at exchequer be one of many difficulty beset prime minister elect in performance of arduous duty lady glencora a people must still persist in calling be at bottom of have sworn oath inimical to mr bonteen did not leave stone unturned in endeavour to accomplish if phineas finn might find acceptance then mr bonteen might be allowed to enter elysium second juno must allow romulus hated to sit in seat of blessed to be fed with nectar to have name printed in list of unruffled cabinet meeting only on condition phineas finn must be allowed seat also little nectar though be at second table of god for struggled speaking mind boldly to that member of husband party struggled in vain must obtain assurance on behalf of phineas finn duke of st bungay must hing for barrington erle have declared powerless husband have condescended to speak to mr bonteen mr bonteen insolent answer have be reported to then went sedulously to work before couple of day be over did make husband believe that mr bonteen be not fit to be chancellor of exchequer took place before mr daubeny statement while duke duchess of st bungay be still at matching while mr bonteen unconscious of what be being done be still in house before two day be over duke of st bungay have very low opinion of mr bonteen be quite ignorant of connection between low opinion fortune of phineas finn plantagenet of men be coming up mr bonteen be worst often think that be going down hill in character intellect if go a low a will prefer to cross water live in america said in presence of two duke what have mr bonteen done asked elder laughing be boasting morning openly of whom intended to bring with into cabinet truth demand that chronicler must say that be positive fib mr bonteen doubt have talked largely with indiscretion have made such boast a of duchess accused mr gresham will get astray if doe allow one to tell truth did not press matter further then what have said be not thrown away wife be almost right about man elder duke said to younger be mr gresham doing not mine said younger be right about gresham too said elder with immense intellect capacity for business man want more looking after evening mr bonteen be singled out by duchess for special attention in presence of who be there assembled made as must not save from talking about when be encouraged on occasion offended feeling of official discretion personal reticence have be endeared to old duke by lesson have learned from former statesman by experience of own life to be quiet unassuming almost affectedly modest in mention of low voiced reflecting always more than resolved resolving always more than said have be aim conscious of high rank thinking doubt much of advantage in public life birth position have given still must never have ventured to speak of own service a necessary to government that have really be indispensable to many must have known not to closest friend must have said so in plain language to man arrogance of mr bonteen be intolerable there be probably more of flavour of political aristocracy to be found still remaining among liberal leading statesman than among opponent conservative cabinet be doubtless never deficient in duke lord son of such conservative duke lord be recruited here there a recruit be new to business whereas among old whig halo of statecraft have for age past so strongly pervaded enveloped certain great family that power in world of politics thus produced still remains be even yet efficacious in creating feeling of exclusiveness say that misfortune make men acquainted with strange bedfellow old hereditary whig cabinet minister must doubt by time have learned to feel at home with strange neighbour at elbow still with something of feeling of high blood of rank of living in park with deer about remains still entertain pride in cabinet have at rate not a yet submitted to conjuror charles james fox element of liberality still hold own fragrance of cavendish be essential with man be feeling stronger than with duke of st bungay though well knew how to keep in abeyance even to extent of self sacrifice bonteens must creep into holy place face loved to see born chiefly of other face have loved when young must not cluster around sacred table without others be much le welcome to be wise enough to know that exclusiveness did not suit nation though human enough to feel that must have be pleasant to there must be bonteens when bonteen came up who loomed before eye a specially disagreeable seemed to to be duty to close door against one if must be closed without violence constant gentle pressure against door must tend to keep down number of bonteens be not sure that be not going little too quick in regard to mr bonteen said elder duke to mr gresham before have finally assented to proposition originated by that must sit in cabinet without portfolio palliser wish said mr gresham shortly think that there have be mistake about suggested appointment to felt unwilling to raise objection without giving matter very mature consideration can understand that upon word thought that selection must be peculiarly agreeable to then duke made suggestion must not special office at treasury be constructed for mr bonteen acceptance having special reference to question of decimal coinage how about salary asked mr gresham must propose new office with salary above l must make permanent suggested duke with permission to hold seat if can get one fear not said mr gresham got into very unpleasant scrape when be financial secretary said duke whither wouldbet thou muse unmeet for jocund lyre be theme like shalt thou talk of god repeat debasing by thy strain effete such lofty mystery absolute word of conversation so lofty will no longer be attempted may be said that mr gresham be too wise to treat a of account objection of one a duke of st bungay saw mr bonteen saw other duke difficulty arose mr bonteen made very disagreeable indeed a mr bonteen have never absolutely be a yet more than demigod muse light a be may venture to report that told ratler that 'd be d if 'd stand if be to be thrown over now 'd make such row must take such care that fat must be in fire that enemy whoever be must wish that have kept finger off knew who be doing if did not know guess be right in heart accused young duchess though mentioned name to one be young duchess then there be made insidious proposition to mr gresham reached at last through barrington erle that matter must go quieter if phineas finn be placed in old office at colony instead of lord fawn whose name have be suggested for whom a barrington erle declared one cared brass farthing mr gresham when heard thought that began to smell rat be determined to be on guard why must appointment of mr phineas finn make thing go easier in regard to mr bonteen there must be woman finger in pie now mr gresham be firmly resolved that woman finger must have anything to do with pie how thing went from bad to worse must be bootless here to tell of two duke absolutely refused to join ministry be persistent in objection to mr bonteen be joined in by lord plinlimmon sir harry coldfoot be in vain that mr gresham urged that have other man ready fit to be chancellor of exchequer excuse must not be accepted there be legge wilson who twelve year since have be at treasury must do very well now mr gresham have always personally hated legge wilson have therefore offered board of trade legge wilson have disgusted by accepting name have already be published in connection with office in list have appeared towards end of week name be connected with office of chancellor of exchequer office be connected with name of mr bonteen editor of people banner however expressed gratification of journal that even mr gresham have not dared to propose mr phineas finn for place under crown at last mr bonteen be absolutely told that must not be chancellor of exchequer if must consent to give very valuable service to country with view of carrying through parliament great measure of decimal coinage must be president of board of trade without seat in cabinet must thus become right honourable bonteen doubt must be great thing for not busy in cabinet must be able to devote time exclusively to great measure above named what be to become of trade generally be not specially explained a know there must be vice president to attend to detail proposition very nearly broke man heart with voice stopped by agitation with anger flashing from eye almost in convulsion of mixed feeling reminded chief of what have be said about appointment in house mr gresham have already absolutely defended after did mr gresham mean to withdraw promise have so formally be made mr gresham be not to be caught in way have made promise have not even stated to house that such appointment be to be made very improper question have be asked a to rumour in answering have be forced to justify by explaining that discussion respecting office have be necessary mr bonteen said mr gresham one know better than difficulty of minister if can act with will be very grateful to if can not will regret loss of service mr bonteen took twenty four hour to consider be then appointed president of board of trade without seat in cabinet mr legge wilson became chancellor of exchequer when list be completed office be assigned to phineas finn have done with mr bonteen yet said young duchess to friend madame goesler secret of world be very marvellous be

duchess have done duchess be bosom friend of lady laura kennedy who be in love with phineas finn have gone on knee to mr gresham to get place for friend favourite mr gresham have refused consequently at bidding half dozen embryo minister husband among number have refused to be amenable to mr gresham mr gresham have at last consented to sacrifice mr bonteen who have originally instigated to reject

boulogne for chapter xliii second thunderbolt quarrel between phineas finn mr bonteen have now become talk of town have taken many various phase political phase though be perhaps best understood be not most engrossing there be personal phase have reference to direct altercation have taken place between two gentleman to correspondence between have followed a to phase may be said that though there be many rumour abroad very little be known be reported in circle that two aspirant for office have be within ace of striking other in again that blow have passed in others further removed probably from house of common universe club that irishman have struck englishman that englishman have given irishman thrashing be phase be very disagreeable to phineas finn there be third may perhaps be called general social phase unfortunately dealt with name of lady laura kennedy of course worked into other be enlivened made interesting with name of great many big person mr gresham prime minister be supposed to be very much concerned in matter be said have found compelled to exclude phineas finn from government because of unfortunate alliance between wife of one of late colleague have also thought expedient to dismiss mr bonteen from cabinet for have amounted almost to dismissal because mr bonteen have made indiscreet official allusion to alliance in consequence of working in of first third phase mr gresham encountered hard usage from friend from many enemy then of course scene at macpherson hotel be commented on very generally idea prevailed that mr kennedy driven to madness by wife infidelity have become known to through quarrel between phineas mr bonteen have endeavoured to murder wife lover who have with utmost effrontery invaded injured husband presence with view of deterring by threat from publication of wrong murder have be nearly accomplished in centre of metropolis by daylight a if made worse on sunday added infinitely to delightful horror of catastrophe yet public notice have be taken of must be murderer have be cabinet minister lover who be so nearly murdered have be under secretary of state be even now member of parliament then be positively known that lady father who have always be held in highest respect a nobleman favoured daughter lover not daughter husband thing together filled public with dismay caused delightful excitement giving feature of own to season doubt general opinion be adverse to poor phineas finn be not without party in matter to oblige friend by inflicting injury on enemy be often more easy than to confer benefit on friend have already seen how young duchess failed in attempt to obtain appointment for phineas also how succeeded in destroying high hope of mr bonteen having done so much of course clung heartily to side have adopted equally of course madame goesler did same between two lady there be slight difference of opinion a to nature of alliance between lady laura hero duchess be of opinion that young men be upon whole averse to innocent alliance that a lady laura husband certainly have long be separated there be probably something in lord bless dear duchess said be known to be lover when be at loughlinter together before married mr kennedy have be most romantic affair made father give seat for borough saved mr kennedy life said madame goesler be one of most singular thing ever happened laurence fitzgibbon say that be planned that garotters be hired unfortunately two policeman turned up at moment so men be taken believe there be doubt be pardoned by sir henry coldfoot who be at home office be lord brentford great friend quite believe must be too delicious great many do madame goesler however be strong in opinion that report in reference to lady laura be scandalous did not believe word of be almost angry with duchess for credulity be probable that very many lady shared opinion of duchess not le on account did take part with phineas finn must not understand why must be shut out of office because lady have be in love with by mean seemed to approve stern virtue of prime minister be interference with thing did not belong to many asserted that mr gresham be much given to such interference lady cantrip though husband be mr gresham most intimate friend be altogether of party a be also duchess of st bungay who understood nothing at about who have once fancied to be rudely treated by mr bonteen young duchess be woman very strong in getting up party old duchess with many other matron of high rank be made to believe that be incumbent on to be phineas finnite one result of be that though phineas be excluded from liberal government liberal drawing room be open to that be lion additional zest be given to by very indiscreet conduct of mr bonteen did accept inferior office of president of board of trade office inferior at least to for have be designated agreed to fill without seat in cabinet having done so must not bring to bear disappointment quietly must not work wait make agreeable to around holding vexation within own bosom be dark sullen to chief almost insolent to duke of omnium old friend plantagenet palliser be man who hardly knew insolence when met there be such absence about of self consciousness be so little given to think of own personal demeanour outward trapping that never brought to question manner of others to contradiction must take for simple argument strong difference of opinion even on part of subordinate recommended to must put up with apparent rudeness without seeing always gave men credit for good intention with have assurance in own position knowledge of strength derived from intellect industry rank wealth made altogether fearless of others when little dog snarl big dog doe not connect snarl with simply fancying that little dog must be uncomfortable mr bonteen snarled good deal new lord privy seal thought that new president of board of trade be not comfortable within at last little dog took big dog by ear then big dog put out paw knocked little dog over mr bonteen be told that have forgotten there arose new rumour be soon reported that lord privy seal have refused to work out decimal coinage under management in house of common of president of board of trade mr bonteen in troubled spirit certainly did misbehave among closer friend declared very loudly that did mean to stand have not chosen to throw mr gresham over at once to make difficulty at moment must not continue to hold present position to support government without seat in cabinet palliser have become quite useless so mr bonteen said since accession to dukedom be quite unfit to deal with decimal coinage be burden to kill man be not going to kill at rate without reward for have be working life to be fully entitled namely seat in cabinet now there be bonteenites in day a well a phineas finnites latter tribe be for most part feminine former consisted of half dozen member of parliament who thought saw way in encouraging forlorn hope of unhappy financier leader of party be nothing without organ organ came forward to support mr bonteen not very creditable to a liberal being conservative organ not le gratifying to spirit inasmuch a organ not only supported exerted very loudest pipe in abusing man whom of men hated most people banner be organ mr quintus slide be of course organist following be one of tune played be supposed by to be second thunderbolt probably conclusively crushing missile thunderbolt fell on monday rd of may early in last march found to be duty to bring under public notice conduct of member for tankerville in reference to transaction took place at small hotel in judd street a to then ventured to call for interference of police attempt to murder member for tankerville have be made by gentleman once well known in political world who a be supposed have be driven to madness by wrong inflicted on in dearest nearest family relation that unfortunate gentleman be now insane believe may state a fact have become special duty to refer to most discreditable transaction from fact that paper still in hand have be confided to for publication by wretched husband before sens have become impaired however be debarred from giving to public by injunction served upon in sudden haste by vice chancellor be far from imputing evil motif even indiscretion to functionary be of opinion that moral feeling of country must have be served by publication be sure that undue step be taken by member for tankerville to procure injunction inquiry be made by police in reference to attempt at murder do expect that member will ask question on subject in house must such culpable quiescence have be allowed have not unfortunate lady whose name be unwilling to mention be daughter of one of colleague of present prime minister gentleman who fired pistol of presumed lover who be fired at also think that need hardly answer question one piece of advice ventured to give mr gresham in former article have be wise enough to follow took upon ourselves to tell that if after what have occurred ventured to place member for tankerville again in office country must not stand have abstained jaunty footstep of mr phineas finn be not heard ascending stair of office at about two in afternoon a used to be case in one of blessed downing street abode about three year since scandal be think over for ever good looking irish member of parliament who have be put in possession of handsome salary by feminine influence will not think after what have already said again become burden on public purse can not say that be a yet satisfied in matter that believe that public have got to bottom of a have right to do in reference to matter affecting public service have never yet learned why be that mr bonteen after having be nominated chancellor of exchequer for appointment to office be declared in house of common by head of party be afterwards excluded from cabinet placed in office made peculiarly subordinate by fact of exclusion have never yet be told why be done believe that be justified in saying that be managed through influence of member for tankerville be quite sure that public service of country have thereby be subjected to grievous injury be hardly duty to praise of very awkward team of horse mr gresham drive with audacity may atone for incapacity if fearful accident must be consequence if there be one among whom must trust for steady work up hill be mr bonteen be astounded at mr gresham indiscretion in announcing appointment of new chancellor of exchequer week before have succeeded in driving mr daubeny from office be not le glad to find that finance of country be to be entrusted to hand of most competent gentleman whom mr gresham have induced to follow fortune mr phineas finn with female force have again interfered mr bonteen have be relegated to board of trade without seat in cabinet must not be at surprised if a result of disgraceful manoeuvring mr bonteen found at head of liberal party before session be over if so evil must have worked to good be that a may can not feel that be disgrace to government disgrace to parliament disgrace to country that such result must come from private scandal of two three people among by mean of best class chapter xliv browborough trial there be matter of public interest going on at time created great excitement too added to importance of phineas finn though phineas be not hero of piece mr browborough late member for tankerville be tried for bribery will be remembered that when phineas contested borough in autumn gentleman be returned be afterwards unseated a result of petition before judge phineas be declared to be true member judge who have so decided have reported to speaker that further inquiry before commission into practice of late former election at tankerville must be expedient such commission have sat in month of january february half voter in tankerville have be examined many who be not voter commissioner swept very clean being new broom in report recommended that mr browborough whom have declined to examine must be prosecuted that report be made about end of march when mr daubeny great bill be impending then there arose double feeling about mr browborough who have be regarded by many a model member of parliament man who never spoke constant in attendance who wanted nothing who have plenty of money who gave dinner to whom seat in parliament be be end of life must not be wish of gentleman who have be accustomed to slow step in lobby burly form always quiescent on one of upper seat just below gangway on conservative side of house that man must really be punished when new law regarding bribery came to take shape heart of member revolted from cruelty heart even of member on other side of house a long a seat be in question battle must of course be fought to nail kind of accusation might then be lavished without restraint evil practice imputed have be known to world known a thing be matter of course at election mr browborough have bought seat how must browborough get seat without buying man who must not say ten word of family with natural following in constituency distinguished by zeal in politics entertaining special conviction of own how must such one recommend to borough unless went there with money in hand of course have gone to tankerville with money in hand with plenty of money have spent like gentleman collectively house of common have determined to put down bribery with very strong hand nobody have spoken against bribery with more fervour than sir gregory grogram who have a attorney general forged chain for fettering future briber be now again attorney general much to disgust a mr gresham have at last moment found wise to restore lord weazeling to woolsack to hand be to be entrusted prosecution of mr browborough be observed by many that job be not much to taste house have be very hot against bribery certain member of existing government when late bill have be passed have expressed with almost burning indignation against crime through there have be slight undercurrent of ridicule attaching to question of only who be behind scene be conscious house be bound to let outside world know that corrupt practice at election be held to be abominable by house member of house a individual knew very well what have taken place at own election be aware of cheque have drawn public house have be kept open a matter of course nowhere perhaps have more beer be drunk than at clovelly borough for sir gregory grogram sat when came to be matter of individual prosecution against one whom have known who a member have be inconspicuous therefore inoffensive against heavy rich useful man who have be in nobody way many thought that must amount to persecution idea of putting old browborough into prison for conduct habit have made second nature to large proportion of house be distressing to member of parliament generally recommendation for prosecution be made to house when mr daubeny be in first agony of great bill at once resolved to ignore matter altogether at rate for present if be to be driven out of power there must be reason why attorney general must prosecute own ally follower poor faithful creature who have never in life voted against party who have always be willing to accept a natural leader one whom party might select there be many who have felt that a mr browborough must certainly now be prosecuted sooner later for there must be final neglecting of commissioner report must be better that must be dealt with by natural friend than by natural enemy newspaper therefore have endeavoured to hurry matter on have be decided that trial must take place at durham spring assize in first week of may sir gregory grogram became attorney general in middle of april undertook task upon compulsion mr browborough own friend mr browborough declared very loudly that there must be greatest possible cruelty in postponing trial lawyer thought that best chance lay in bustling thing on be therefore able to show that cruelty of delay must be extreme nay that postponement in such matter must be unconstitutional if not illegal must of course have be just a easy to show hurry on part of prosecutor be cruel illegal unconstitutional have be considered that best chance of acquittal lay in postponement so trial be forced forward sir gregory be to appear on behalf of prosecuting house of common there must be doubt that sympathy of public generally be with mr browborough though there be a little doubt that be guilty when evidence taken by commissioner have just appeared in newspaper when first fact of other election at tankerville be made public world be shown how common have be for mr browborough to buy vote how clearly knowledge of corruption have be brought home to there have for short week so be feeling against two three london paper have printed leading article giving in detail salient point of old sinner criminality expressing conviction now at least must real criminal be punished have died away anger against mr browborough even on part of most virtuous of public press have become no more than lukewarm paper boldly defended ridiculed commissioner declared that trial be altogether absurdity people banner setting at defiance with admirable audacity fact a given in commissioner report declared that there be not one tittle of evidence against mr browborough hinted that trial have be got up by malign influence of doer of evil phineas finn men who knew better what be going on in world than did mr quintus slide be well aware that such assertion a be unavailing unnecessary mr browborough be believed to be quite safe safety lay in indifference of prosecutor certainly not in innocence one prominent in affair can always see when man may steal horse when man may not look over hedge mr browborough have stolen horse have repeated theft over over again evidence of be forthcoming have indeed be already sifted sir gregory grogram who be prominent in affair knew that theft might be condoned nevertheless case came on at durham assize within last two month browborough have become quite hero at church party have forgotten broken pledge radical remembered only generosity must have stood for seat again on day on judge entered durham might have be returned without bribery throughout whole county prosecution be unpopular during portion of parliamentary career have mr browborough name be treated with so much respect in grandly ecclesiastical city a now dined with dean on day before trial on sunday be shown by head verger into stall next to chancellor of diocese with reverence seemed to imply that be almost a graceful a martyr when took seat in court next to attorney everybody shook hand with when sir gregory got up to open case not one of listener then supposed that mr browborough be about to suffer punishment be arraigned before mr baron boultby who have sat for borough in younger day who knew well how thing be done be aware how impassionately grand be mind of judge when men accused of crime be brought before for trial judge after be men mr baron boultby a looked at mr browborough must not have thought of old day be nevertheless necessary that prosecution must be conducted in properly formal manner that evidence must be given there be cloud of witness over from tankerville miner collier like having very good turn of at expense of poor borough men must be examined evidence must doubt be same now a when be given with so damnable effect before clean sweeping commissioner sir gregory opening speech be quite worthy of sir gregory be essentially necessary said that atmosphere of borough must be cleansed purified from taint of corruption voice of country have spoken very plainly on subject verdict have gone forth that there must be more bribery at election at last election at tankerville a feared at former election there have be manifest bribery must be for jury to decide whether mr browborough have be so connected with act of agent a to be within reach of law if be found that have brought within reach of law jury must doubt say so in such case must do great service to cause of purity if mr browborough have not be personally cognisant of what agent have done then jury must be bound to acquit man be not necessarily guilty of bribery in eye of law because bribery have be committed even though bribery so committed have be sufficiently proved to deprive of seat must otherwise have enjoyed nothing must be clearer than manner in sir gregory explained to jury nothing more eloquent than denunciation against bribery in general nothing more mild than allegation against mr browborough individually in regard to evidence sir gregory with two assistant went through work manfully evidence be given not to same length a at tankerville before commissioner really to same effect yet record of evidence a given in newspaper seemed to be altogether different at tankerville there have be indignant sometimes indiscreet zeal have communicated to whole proceeding general flavour of trial at durham be one of good humoured raillery mr browborough counsel in cross examining witness for prosecution displayed none of righteous wrath wrath righteous on behalf of injured innocence be so common with gentleman employed in defence of criminal bowed simpered nodded at sir gregory in manner be quite pleasant to behold nobody scolded anybody there be roaring of barrister clenching of fist kicking up of dust threat allusion to witness oath considerable amount of gentle fun be poked at witness by defending counsel not in manner to give pain gentleman who acknowledged to have received seventeen shilling sixpence for vote at last election be asked how have invested money allusion be made to wife large amount of good humoured sparring be allowed in witness thought that have best of men of tankerville long remembered trial hoped anxiously that there might soon be only man treated with severity be poor phineas finn luckily for be not present qualification a member of parliament for tankerville be somewhat roughly treated witness there when be asked what candidate must probably be returned for tankerville at next election readily answered that mr browborough must certainly carry seat mr browborough sat in court throughout be hero of day judge summing up be very short seemed to have be given almost with indolence one point on insisted be difference between such evidence of bribery a must deprive man of seat that must make subject to criminal law by criminal law man must not be punished for act of punishment must follow man own act if man be to instigate to murder must be punished not for murder for instigation be now administering criminal law be bound to give verdict for acquittal unless be convinced that man on trial have wilfully wittingly be guilty of crime imputed went through evidence be in clear against old sinner have be in instance validly contradicted then left matter to jury men in box put head together returned verdict of acquittal without one moment delay sir gregory grogram assistant collected paper together judge addressed three four word almost of compliment to mr browborough affair be over to manifest contentment of one there present sir gregory grogram be by mean disappointed everybody on own side in parliament on other thought that have done duty very well clean sweeping commissioner who have be animated with wonderful zeal by nature novelty of work probably felt that have be betrayed may be doubted whether one else be disconcerted by result of trial unless might be poor innocent here there about country who have be induced to believe bribery corruption be in truth to be banished from purlieu of westminster mr roby mr ratler who filled same office for own party in out be acquainted with other apt to discus parliamentary question in library smoking room of house where such discussion must be held on most matter be very glad that case went a did at durham said mr ratler so be said mr roby browborough be always good fellow not doubt about good must have come from conviction suppose there have be little money spent at tankerville at other place one must mention said mr roby of course there have money will be spent again nobody dislike bribery more than do house of course dislike if man loses seat surely be punishment enough be better to have to draw cheque sometimes than to be out in cold nevertheless member must prefer that seat must not cost so much continued mr ratler thing ca be done at once idea of pouncing upon one man making victim of be very disagreeable to must have be sorry to have seen verdict against browborough must acknowledge that there be bitterness in way in grogram did feel that said mr roby who be perhaps by nature little more candid than rival when time come doubt will return compliment matter be discussed in quite different spirit between two other politician so sir gregory have failed at durham said lord cantrip to friend mr gresham be sure must why ah why how be to answer question did think that mr browborough must be convicted of bribery by jury indeed answered lord cantrip can tell why because there be earnestness in matter with attorney general with one else yet said mr gresham grogram be very earnest man when belief in case member of parliament will ever be punished for bribery a for crime till member of parliament generally look upon bribery a crime be very far from that a yet must have thought conviction to be great misfortune why so because must have created ill blood own hand in matter be not bit cleaner than of adversary ca afford to pull house to piece before have put own in order thing will be done must fear be done slowly a be case with reform from within phineas finn who be very sore unhappy at time who consequently be much in love with purity anxious for severity felt personally aggrieved by acquittal be almost tantamount to verdict against then knew so well that bribery have be committed be so confident that one a mr browborough must have be returned to parliament by none other than corrupt mean in present mood must have be almost glad to see mr browborough at treadmill must have thought six month solitary confinement quite inadequate to offence never read anything in life that disgusted so much said to friend mr monk ca go along with there if man ever be guilty of bribery be guilty doubt for moment yet grogram did not try to get verdict have tried ever so much must have failed in matter such a political not social in nature jury be sure to be guided by what have perhaps unconsciously learned to be feeling of country disgrace be attached to verdict yet everybody know that mr browborough have bribed who have looked into know too that evidence be conclusive then be jury perjured said phineas have nothing to say to stain of perjury cling to be better received in durham to day than must have be have found mr browborough guilty in business a in private life will be held to be a trustworthy a before will be for aught that know quite trustworthy there be still circumstance in man though on oath may be untrue with more stain of falsehood than fall upon when denies at front door though happen to be at home what must think of condition of thing mr monk that be capable of improvement know that can think anything else a for sir gregory grogram baron boultby jury must be waste of power to execrate in political matter be very hard for man in office to be purer than neighbour when be so becomes troublesome have found that out before to day with lady laura kennedy phineas did find sympathy then must have sympathised with on subject under sun if must only come to sit with must fool to top of bent have resolved that must go to portman square a little a possible have be confirmed in resolution by scandal have now spread everywhere about town in reference to still went never left till promise of returning at stated time have be extracted from have even told of own scruple of danger have discussed together that last thunderbolt have fallen from jove of people banner have laughed caution to scorn did not know own innocence be not living in father house with father must quail beneath sting venom of such reptile a quintus slide oh phineas said let be braver than that must much prefer to have stayed away still went to be conscious of dangerous love for knew well that be not returned be aware that must be best for that must be apart yet must not bring to wound by absence see why must feel so much said speaking of trial at durham be on trial everybody know that bribed that did not yes everybody despises pat

hope come from carlton terrace reader may perhaps remember that young duchess of omnium lived in carlton terrace can trace there wo stand if go on like clique of stupid woman to take up cudgel for coal heaving sort of fellow like sting one like lot of hornet must believe duke almost refused to speak to just now man for whom have be working like slave for last twelve month must not stand said lady eustace by bye lady eustace have have news from prague what news said clasping hand that fellow pratt sent out be dead no not doubt what be poisoned seem to think that nothing can be proved

bonteen took journey to prague mr bonteen be however unable to deny that cost of journey be defrayed by lady eustace be thought mean in man aspiring to be chancellor of exchequer to have travelling expense paid for by lady many however be of opinion that mr bonteen have be almost romantic in friendship that bright eye of lady eustace have produced upon dragon of business wonderful effect be noticed be that a may now in terrible distress of mind at political aspect of time have become almost sick of lady eustace must gladly have sent away from house have known how to do so without incurring censure chapter xlvi quarrel on wednesday evening phineas finn be at universe dined at house of madame goesler went from thence to club in better spirit than have known for week past duke

pad in coat a well a woman one at back of head phineas have known that be gentle raillery now be delighted to find that continued after still more gentle fashion before man face mr maule manner be certainly peculiar be more than ordinarily polite be afterwards declared by duchess to have made love like old gander madame goesler who knew exactly how to receive such attention turned glance now then upon phineas finn must now read with absolute precision see how can dispose of padded old dandy directly go inch too far word must have said that to more plainly than did one two glance a have learned to dislike mr maule be gratified of course talked about lady eustace mr emilius do remember how intensely interested dear old duke used to be when none of knew what have become of diamond said duchess how took part said madame goesler so did just a much a why not be most interesting young woman sincerely hope have not got to end of worst of be that have got into such very bad hand bonteens have taken up altogether do know mr finn duchess be hardly likely to make acquaintance while remains where be now duchess laughed nodded head world knew by time that have declared to be sworn enemy of bonteens there have be conversation on terribly difficult question respecting fox in trumpeton wood fact be lord chiltern said duke be a ignorant a child must do right if knew how what ought to do will import fox suppose duke that in england there be spot in fox be more prone to breed indeed be very glad of something go wrong afterwards fear nursery be not well managed perhaps said duchess gipsy kidnapper be allowed about place said madame goesler gipsy exclaimed duke poacher said lord chiltern be that mind must deal with ourselves if wood be properly managed head of game fox can be reared together very well if care straw for head of game lord chiltern a far a own taste go must wish that there be pheasant partridge hare on property own think that sheep barn door fowl do better for everybody in long run that men who can not live without shooting must go beyond thickly populated region to find indeed for must say same about fox interest fancy that will gradually be exterminated god forbid exclaimed lord chiltern find called upon to exterminate continued duke number of men who amuse by riding after one fox be too great for to wish to interfere with know neighbour in country conceive to be duty to have fox for will oblige lord chiltern a far a can without detriment to other duty leave to said duchess to neighbour lord chiltern will speak to mr fothergill have put right unfortunately happened however that lord chiltern got letter very next morning from old doggett telling that litter of young cub have be destroyed that week in trumpeton wood barrington erle phineas went off to universe together a went old term of intimacy seemed to be re established between nobody can be so sorry a be said barrington at manner in thing have gone when wrote to of course thought certain that if came in must come with let that fret doe fret very much there be so many slip that of course one can answer for anything of course not know who have be friend joke of be that be at present so utterly friendless duke will hardly speak to know that a fact gresham have begun to find something be wrong hoped that must refuse to come in without seat in cabinet be too good to be true say talk of resigning will believe when see 'd better not play trick for if did resign must be accepted at once phineas when heard must not help thinking how glorious must be if mr bonteen be to resign if place so vacated vacancy so occasioned be to be filled by reached club together a went up stair heard hum of many voice in room world wife be here to night said phineas overtook couple of men at door so that there be something of bustle of crowd a entered there be difficulty in finding place in to put coat hat for accommodation of universe be not great there be knot of men talking not far from among voice phineas must clearly hear that of mr bonteen ratler have heard before also fitzgibbon though have not distinguished word from spoken by mr bonteen did distinguish very plainly mr phineas finn such fellow a must be after at once said mr bonteen then phineas walked immediately among knot of men showed a soon a heard name mentioned doubted for moment what must do mr bonteen when speaking have not known of presence might be duty not to seem to have listened speech have be made aloud in open room so that who chose might listen phineas must not have heard in moment resolved that be bound to take notice of what have heard what be mr bonteen phineas finn will do asked mr bonteen have be dining be not man by mean habitually intemperate now one saying that be tipsy must have maligned be flushed with much wine be man whose arrogance in condition be apt to become extreme in vino veritas sober devil can hide cloven hoof when devil drink loses cunning grows honest mr bonteen looked phineas full in face second two before answered then said quite aloud have crept upon unawares sir what do mean by sir said phineas have come in a other man come listener at rate never hear good of then there be present among assembled clear indication of disapproval of bonteen conduct in day when palpable immediate punishment be at hand for personal insolence from man to man personal insolence to one man in company seems almost to constitute insult to one present when men must fight readily arrogant word two between two known to be hostile to other be only invitation to duel angry man be doing that for be known that must be made to pay there be be often thought that there be real spirit in angry man conduct who be friend before became perhaps more friend when have thus shown that have enemy different feeling prevails at present feeling so different that may almost say that man in general society can not speak even roughly to intimate comrade without giving offence to around men have learned to hate nuisance of row to feel that comfort be endangered if man prone to row get among of candidate at club known quarreller be more sure of blackball now than even in time when one provoked duel of bore be worst there be always unexpressed feeling that one exacts more from company than share of attention be so strong that too often man quarrelled with though be a innocent a be phineas on present occasion be made subject to general aversion be felt for men who misbehave wish to hear good of from said phineas following to seat who be that said must be after room be full one there even who have come in with phineas knew lady eustace be woman everybody at present be talking about lady eustace never mind said barrington erle taking by arm what be use of row use at if heard name mentioned in such manner must find impossible to pas over there be mr monk ask mr monk be sitting very quietly in corner of room with gentleman of own age by one devoted to literary pursuit constant attendant at universe a said afterwards have never known unpleasantness of sort in club before there be many men of note in room there be foreign minister member of cabinet two ex member of cabinet great poet exceedingly able editor two earl two member of royal academy president of learned society celebrated professor be expected that royalty might come in at minute speak few benign word blow few cloud of smoke be abominable that harmony of meeting must be interrupted by vinous insolence of mr bonteen useless wrath of phineas finn really mr finn if be must let drop said gentleman devoted to literary pursuit phineas did not much affect literary gentleman in such matter must prefer advice of mr monk to of man living again appealed to friend heard what be said heard mr bonteen remark that somebody like must in certain circumstance be after certain lady thought to be ill judged speech a particular friend heard with great regret what row about nothing said mr bonteen rising from seat be speaking of very pretty woman be saying that young fellow generally supposed to be fond of pretty woman must soon be after if offends moral must have become very strict of late there be something in explanation though very bad vulgar be almost impossible not to accept such at least be feeling of who stood around phineas finn knew that mr bonteen have intended to assert that must be after woman money not beauty have taste enough to perceive that must not descend to such detail a that there be reason mr bonteen said why think must abstain from mentioning name in public playful reference must be made to friend not to who to say least of be not friend when matter be discussed afterwards be thought that phineas finn must have abstained from making last speech be certainly evidence of great anger on part be very angry knew that have be insulted insulted by man whom of men must feel most disposed to punish for offence must not allow mr bonteen to have last word especially a certain amount of success have seemed to attend fate at moment be so far propitious to phineas outward circumstance saved from immediate reply thus left in degree triumphant expected royalty arrived cast salutary oil upon troubled water prince with well known popular attendant entered room for moment gentleman rose from chair be for moment then prince became a other gentleman talking to friend one two there present who have perhaps peculiarly royal instinct have crept up towards so a to make centre of little knot otherwise conversation went on much a have done before unfortunate arrival of phineas quarrel however have be very distinctly trodden under foot by prince for mr bonteen have found quite incapacitated from throwing back missile in reply to last have be hurled at phineas took vacant seat next to mr monk who be deficient perhaps in royal instinct asked in whisper opinion of what have taken place think more of said mr monk be so much more easily said than done how be not to think of of course mean that be to act a though have forgotten did ever know more gratuitous insult of course be talking of lady eustace have not be listening to before doubt be need not tell now what think of mr bonteen be not more gracious in eye than be in yours to night fancy have be drinking have not improved may be sure of phineas that le of resentful anger show in wretched affair a took place just now more will be blame attached to le to why must blame be attached to say that will unless allow to become loud resentful thing be not worth anger be angry then go to bed at once sleep off come with will walk home together be proper thing fancy to leave room while prince be here then must do improper thing said mr monk have key mu keep servant up longer quiet man like can creep out without notice good night phineas take advice about if ca forget act speak look a though have forgotten then mr monk without much creeping left room club be very full there be clatter of voice clatter round prince be noisiest merriest mr bonteen be there of course phineas a sat alone must hear a edged word in upon royal ear now again there be royal joke then mr bonteen laughter be conspicuous a far a phineas must distinguish sound special amount of royal attention be devoted to mr bonteen very able editor one of academician poet seemed to be most honoured when prince went did when cigar be finished phineas observed with inward satisfaction that royal hand be given to poet to editor to painter be not extended to president of board of trade then having taken delight in accused of meanness in having even observed matter so trivial soon after ruck of men left club then phineas rose to go a went down stair barrington erle followed with laurence fitzgibbon three stood for moment at door in street talking to other finn way lay eastward from club whereas erle fitzgibbon must go westward towards home how well prince behaves at sort of place said erle prince ought to behave well said phineas somebody else did behave very well eh finn boy said laurence somebody else a call replied phineas be very unlike prince never doe behave well to night however surpassed bother mind about old fellow said barrington tell what be erle said phineas think that be vindictive man by nature with man mean to make even of day know a well a do what be have done to know also whether have deserved wretched reptile that be have pretty nearly be able to ruin from petty feeling of jealousy finn boy talk like said laurence must show hand said barrington know what mean be very well after different fashion two have be true to care how much see of hand that man insolence anger to extent can not refrain from speaking out have spirit enough to go out with must shoot blankenberg eh said laurence alluding to now notorious duel have once be fought in place between phineas lord chiltern must continued angry man there be time in one be driven to regret that there have come end to duelling there be left to one immediate mean of resenting injury a be speaking mr bonteen came out from front door alone seeing three men standing passed on towards left eastward good night erle said good night fitzgibbon two men answered phineas stood back in gloom be about one o'clock night be very dark by george do dislike man said phineas then with laugh took life preserver out of pocket made action with a though be striking enemy over head in day there have be much garotting in street writer in press have advised who walked about at night to go armed with stick phineas finn have be once engaged with garotters a have be told in former chronicle have since armed thinking more probably of thing have happened to see than men do who have only heard of a soon a have spoken followed mr bonteen down street at distance of perhaps couple of hundred yard wo have row will said erle oh dear finn wo think of speaking to may be sure that bonteen wo say word to finn between barrington wish master phineas must give thorough good hiding chapter xlvii what came of quarrel on next morning at seven o'clock superintendent of police called at house of mr gresham informed prime minister mr bonteen president of board of trade have be murdered during night there be doubt of fact body have be recognised information have be taken to unfortunate widow at house mr bonteen have occupied in st james place superintendent have already found out that mr bonteen have be attacked a be returning from club late at night rather early in morning expressed doubt that have be murdered close to spot on body be found there be dark uncanny looking passage running from end of bolton row in may fair between garden of two great nobleman coming out among mew in berkeley street at corner of berkeley square just opposite to bottom of hay hill be on step leading up from passage to level of ground above that body be found passage be almost a near way a from club to mr bonteen house in st james place superintendent declared that gentleman seldom used passage after dark be disposed to think that unfortunate man must have be forced down step by ruffian who have attacked from level above murderer so thought superintendent must have be cognizant of way usually taken by mr bonteen must have lain in wait for in darkness of mouth of passage superintendent have be at work on inquiry since four in morning have heard from lady eustace from mr bonteen a far a poor distracted woman have be able to tell story account of cause of quarrel between respective husband of two lady officer who have not a yet heard word of late disturbance between mr bonteen phineas finn be strongly of opinion that reverend mr emilius have be murderer mr gresham of course coincided in opinion what step have be taken a to arrest of mr emilius superintendent be of opinion that mr emilius be already in custody be known to be lodging close to marylebone workhouse in northumberland street having removed to somewhat obscure neighbourhood a soon a house in lowndes square have be broken up by running away of wife consequent want of mean such be story a told to prime minister at seven o'clock in morning at eleven o'clock at private room at treasury chamber mr gresham heard much more at time there be present with two officer of police force colleague in cabinet lord cantrip duke of omnium three of junior colleague in government lord fawn barrington erle laurence fitzgibbon major mackintosh chief of london police be not exactly part of duty of mr gresham to investigate circumstance of murder there be so much in brought closely home to government that became impossible for not to concern in business there have be so much talk about mr bonteen lately name have be so common in newspaper ill usage have be supposed by to have suffered have be so freely discussed quarrel not only with phineas finn subsequently with duke of omnium have be so widely known that sudden death created more momentary excitement than might probably have followed that of greater man now too fact of past night a became known seemed to make crime more wonderful more exciting more momentous than must have be have be brought clearly home to wretch a bohemian jew yosef mealyus who have contrived to cheat wretched lizzie eustace into marrying a regarded yosef mealyus story now told respecting be be already in custody have be found in bed at lodging between seven eight have of course given up without difficulty have seemed to be horror struck when heard of man death have openly expressed joy have endeavoured to ruin have done world of harm why must sorrow for said to policeman when rebuked for inhumanity nothing have be found tending to implicate in crime servant declared that have gone to bed before eleven o'clock to knowledge for have seen there that have not left house afterwards be in possession of latch key appeared that did usually carry latch key that be often borrowed from by member of family when be known that must not want that have be so lent on night be considered certain by in house that have not gone out after went to bed nobody in fact have left house after ten in accordance with usual custom mr emilius have sent down key a soon a have found that must not want have be night in custody of mistress of establishment nevertheless clothes be examined minutely without affording evidence against that mr bonteen have be killed with blunt weapon such a life preserver be assumed by police such weapon be in possession of mr emilius have such weapon yet be found be however in custody with evidence against except be afforded by known acknowledged enmity to mr bonteen so far major mackintosh two officer have told story then came united story of other gentleman assembled from hearing however two police officer be debarred duke barrington erle have dined in company with phineas finn at madame goesler duke be undoubtedly aware that ill blood have existed between finn mr bonteen erle fitzgibbon described quarrel at club described also anger finn have expressed against wretched man a stood talking at club door gesture of vengeance be remembered repeated though men who heard expressed strongest conviction that murder have not be committed by a erle remarked very expression of threat be almost proof that have not at moment intention on mind of doing such deed a have be done told also of life preserver finn have shown a took from pocket of outside coat marvelled at coincidence of night then lord fawn gave further evidence seemed to tell very hardly upon phineas finn also have be at club have left just before finn two other men have clustered at door have walked very slowly having turned down to curzon street bolton row from whence made way into piccadilly by clarges street have seen nothing of mr bonteen a crossed over to clarges street be passed at very rapid pace by man muffled in top coat who made way straight along bolton row towards passage have be described at moment have not connected person of man who passed with acquaintance of own now felt sure after what have heard that man be mr finn a passed out of club finn be putting on overcoat lord fawn have observed peculiarity of grey colour be exactly similar coat only with collar raised that have passed in street man too be of mr finn height build have known mr finn well man stepped with mr finn step major mackintosh thought that lord fawn evidence be very unfortunate a regarded mr finn be d if idiot wo hang poor phinny said fitzgibbon afterwards to erle yet believe word of fawn must lie for sake of hanging phineas finn said erle suppose be given to lying at belief be such muddle headed fellow that can get to believe anything be one of men who always unconsciously exaggerate what have to say for sake of importance give might be possible that jury must look at lord fawn evidence in light otherwise must bear very heavily indeed against phineas finn then question arose a to road mr bonteen usually took from club member who be there present have walked home with at various time by various route never by way through passage be supposed that on occasion must have gone by berkeley square because have certainly not turned down by first street to right must have taken have intended to avoid square have be seen by barrington erle fitzgibbon to pas that turning otherwise must have made remark a to possibility of renewed quarrel between phineas must phineas chance to overtake for phineas must certainly go by square unless taken out of way by special purpose most direct way of for mr bonteen must have be that followed by lord fawn a have not turned down street have not be seen by lord fawn who be known to walk very slowly have often be seen to go by berkeley square be presumed that have now taken road in case must certainly pas end of passage towards lord fawn declared that have seen man hurrying whom now supposed to have be phineas finn finn direct road home must a have be already said have be through square cutting off corner of square towards bruton street thence across bond street by conduit street to regent street so to great marlborough street where lived have be no doubt possible for to have be on spot on lord fawn have seen man for although in natural course thither from club must have at once gone down street to right course erle fitzgibbon be able to say that did not take a have seen go beyond turning nevertheless there have be ample time for to have retraced step to in time to have caught lord fawn thus to have deceived fitzgibbon erle a to route have taken when have got thus far lord cantrip be standing close to window of room at mr gresham elbow allow to be hurried into believing said lord cantrip know that need believe reverse be case for police of course be belief mine will have weight nothing have heard make for moment think possible know man be very angry have struck in club must not have be much surprised never attacked enemy with bludgeon in dark alley know well what do think of fawn story be mistaken in man remember be dark night see that can do anything said mr gresham will have to say something in house a to poor fellow death certainly will not express suspicion why must up to moment nothing have be done a to phineas finn be known that must in natural course of business be in place in parliament at four major mackintosh be of opinion that certainly must be taken before magistrate in time to prevent necessity of arresting in house be decided that lord fawn with fitzgibbon erle must accompany police officer to bow street that magistrate must be applied to for warrant if thought evidence be sufficient major mackintosh be of opinion that although by possibility must two men suspected have be jointly guilty of murder still circumstance be such a to justify immediate arrest of be yosef mealyus really guilty to be allowed to slip from hand doubt might be very difficult to catch fact did not at present seem to prevail against a major observed fact be apt to alter considerably when be minutely sifted character be half sufficient to condemn then with there be adequate motive what lord cantrip regarded a possibility be not to be conceived that from mere rage phineas finn must lay plot for murdering man in street be on card lord said major that may have chosen to attack mr bonteen without intending to murder murder may afterwards have be accident be impossible after for even prime minister two cabinet minister to go about work calmly men concerned have be too well known to to allow mind to become clear of subject when major mackintosh went off to bow street with erle laurence be certainly opinion of majority of who have be present that blow have be struck by hand of phineas finn perhaps worst aspect of be that there have be not simply blow blow constable have declared that murdered man have be struck thrice about head that fatal stroke have be given on side of head after man hat have be knocked off that finn must have followed enemy through street after such word a have spoken with view of having quarrel out in shape did not seem to be very improbable to of except lord cantrip then have there be scuffle out in open path at spot at angry man might have overtaken adversary be not incredible to that must have drawn even weapon a life preserver from pocket in case a have occurred spot peculiarly traitorous have be selected attack have too probably be made from behind a yet there be evidence that murderer have encountered ill usage finn if be murderer must from time be standing at club door have contemplated traitorous dastardly attack must have counted moment have returned slyly in dark to corner of street have once passed have muffled face in coat have then laid wait in spot to honest man at night must hardly trust with honest purpose look upon a quite out of question said lord cantrip when three minister be left alone now lord cantrip have served for many month in same office a phineas finn be simply putting own opinion of man against fact said mr gresham fact always convince man opinion rarely convinces be not sure that know fact yet said duke of course be speaking of a far a have be told to a far a go unless can be upset shown not to be fact fear must be conclusive to on jury do mean that have heard enough to condemn asked lord cantrip remember what have heard murdered man have two enemy may have have third ten have heard of two may have be attacked for money said duke money watch be touched continued mr gresham anger desire of putting man out of way have caused murder of two enemy one according to fact a now have must not have be there be probable that must have known that enemy must be on spot other not only must have be there be certainly near place at moment so near did not do deed be almost wonderful that must not have be interrupted in doing by nearness certainly knew that victim must be there be burning with anger against at moment have just threatened have with instrument a be afterwards used man believed to be be seen hurrying to spot by witness whose credibility be beyond doubt be fact such a have at present unless can be upset fear must convince jury a have already convinced officer of police officer of police always believe men to be guilty said lord cantrip believe jew

of other human being of whom must not bring to cease to think accused of murder believe duchess have declared with sort of enthusiasm be common to that never must believe indeed what judge of character must one be who must believe that phineas finn must be guilty of midnight murder vote stick to stick to madame goesler said repeating word to herself what be use of sticking to man who doe not want how can woman cling to man who having said that did not want yet come again within influence doe not unsay what have said before nevertheless if must be that man be in real distress in absolutely dire sorrow must cling to with constancy a thought friend duchess must hardly understand though must hang must bathe body with tear live a woman must live who have loved murderer to last illustration what be use of sticking to man who doe not want swore to herself that must not believe nay did not believe believe indeed be simply impossible that might have killed wretch in struggle

thought like burr think of lady laura with one mad other in newgate be man only man whom have ever loved more to lady laura kennedy than to rather be lady laura more to than be if so why must fret for

do believe duchess certainly not not though lord fawn swore that have seen never will believe what like to believe nothing will ever make must have done well for matter of suppose must no duchess must not have done be strong enough brave enough not enough of coward there be nothing cowardly about if phineas finn must have struck enemy with club in dark passage behind back will never care to speak to man again nothing will make believe if did must never again believe in one if told that husband have murdered man what must say be husband madame max certainly not can not fly at when say so a must do can be just a sure if twenty lord fawn swore that have seen must not believe oh god what will do with duchess behaved very well to friend saying not single word to twit with love betrayed seemed to take a matter of course madame goesler interest in phineas finn must be a be duke said must not come home to dinner madame goesler must stay with house be in such ferment about murder that nobody liked to be away everybody have be struck with amazement not simply not chiefly by fact of murder by double destruction of two men whose ill will to other have be of late so often subject of conversation so madame goesler remained at carlton terrace till late in evening during whole visit there be nothing mentioned murder of mr bonteen peril of phineas finn one will go see suppose said madame goesler lord cantrip have be already mr monk must not go well must be rather strong if went together suggested madame goesler before left carlton terrace have almost extracted promise from duchess that must together proceed to prison endeavour to see phineas finn chapter xlix showing what mr bunce said to policeman have left adelaide palliser down at hall be up here only for couple of day to see laura try to find out what have better be done about kennedy be said to phineas finn in own room in great marlborough street by lord chiltern on morning after murder between ten eleven o'clock phineas have not a yet heard of death of man with whom have quarrelled lord chiltern have now come to with proposition a yet did not understand lord chiltern certainly did not know how to explain looked at simply proposition be one for providing phineas finn with income out of wealth belonging must belong to standish family lady laura fortune must be thought soon be at own disposal who acted for husband have assured earl that yearly interest of money must be at ladyship command a soon a law must allow so to plan of robert kennedy inability to act for there be longer doubt whatever there be said desire to embarrass estate with so small disputed matter a income derived from l there be great pride of purse in manner in information be conveyed not le on account be satisfactory to earl lady laura first thought about referred to imminent want of phineas finn how might be possible for to place portion of income at command of man loved so that must not feel disgraced by receiving from hand conceived plan a to loan to be made nominally by brother plan a to may at once be said that must not be made to hold water for minute did succeed in inducing brother to undertake embassy with view of explaining to phineas that there must be money for when wanted if make over to papa papa can leave in will if want at once there can be harm in advancing to what must have at papa death brother have frowned angrily have shaken head think how have be thrown over by party said lady laura lord chiltern have disliked whole affair have felt with dismay that sister name must become subject to reproach if must be known that young man be supported by bounty however have persisted have consented to see young man feeling sure that phineas must refuse to bear burden of obligation have not touched disagreeable subject when be interrupted knocking of door have be heard now mr bunce came upstairs bringing mr low with mr bunce have not heard of tragedy have at once perceived from barrister manner that there be serious matter forward matter be probably not only serious also calamitous expression of countenance announced a much to two men countenance of mr low when followed into room told same story still more plainly be anything matter said phineas jumping up indeed yes said mr low who then looked at lord chiltern be silent will go said lord chiltern mr low did not know of course be still silent be friend mr low be friend lord chiltern said phineas aware that be well acquainted with other name know of reason why must go what be low lord chiltern have come there about money occurred to that impecunious young barrister might already be in scrape on head in nineteen case out of twenty when man be in scrape simply want money perhaps can be of help said have heard lord what happened last night said mr low with eye fixed on phineas finn have heard nothing said lord chiltern what have happened asked phineas looking aghast knew mr low well enough to be sure that thing referred to be of great distressing moment too have heard nothing not word that know of be at universe last night certainly be did anything occur prince be there nothing have happened to prince said chiltern name have not be mentioned to said mr low be there not quarrel yes said phineas quarrelled with mr bonteen what then behaved like brute a always doe thrashing brute hardly answer nowadays if ever man deserved thrashing doe have be murdered said mr low illustration have be murdered said mr low reader need hardly be told that a regard great offence phineas finn be a white a snow maintenance of doubt on matter be even desirable to maintain doubt must be altogether beyond power of present writer reader have probably perceived from first moment of discovery of body on step at end of passage mr bonteen have be killed by ingenious gentleman rev mr emilius who found to be worth while to take step with view of suppressing enemy evidence a to former marriage mr low when entered room have be inclined to think that friend have done deed laurence fitzgibbon who have be one of first to hear story who have summoned erle to go with major mackintosh to downing street have in first place gone to house in carey street in bunce be wont to work have sent to mr low fitzgibbon have not thought safe that must warn countryman must not bear to think that hare must be knocked over on form that friend must be taken by policeman without notice so have sent bunce to mr low mr low have now come with tidings murdered exclaimed phineas who have murdered said lord chiltern looking first at mr low then at phineas be what police be now endeavouring to find out then there be pause phineas stood up with hand on forehead looking savagely from one to other glimmer of idea of truth be beginning to cross brain mr low be there with object of asking whether have murdered man mr fitzgibbon be with last night continued mr low of course be be who have sent to what doe mean asked lord chiltern suppose intend to say that friend here murdered man begin to suppose be what intend to say rejoined phineas scornfully mr low have entered room doubting indeed still inclined to believe a bunce have very clearly believed that hand of phineas finn be red with blood of man who have be killed have be questioned on matter when special case be before mind must have declared of that few tone from voice few glance from eye of suspected man must certainly not suffice to eradicate suspicion now be quite sure almost quite sure that phineas be a innocent a to lord chiltern who have heard none of detail suspicion be so monstrous a to fill with wrath mean to tell mr low that one say that finn killed man have come a friend said low to put on guard accusation will be made against to phineas not clearly looking at not knowing very accurately what have happened not being in truth quite sure that mr bonteen be actually dead seemed to be continuation of persecution believed to have suffered from man hand can believe anything from quarter said from what quarter asked lord chiltern have better let mr low tell really have happened then mr low told story a well a knew describing spot on body have be found often a go to club said phineas never be through passage in life mr low went on with tale telling how man have be killed with short bludgeon have that in pocket said finn producing life preserver have almost always have something of kind when have be in london since affair of kennedy mr low cast one glance at to see whether have be washed scraped in way cleansed phineas saw glance be angry there be a be can make most of will not touch again till policeman come put hand on chiltern leave there instrument be left lying on table untouched mr low went on with story have heard nothing of yosef mealyus a connected with murder indistinct reference to lord fawn top coat have be made to there be coat too said phineas taking from sofa on have flung when came home previous night be very light coat fitted for may use lined with silk by mean suited for enveloping face person have collar might be made to stand up at rate be coat wore said finn in answer to observation from barrister man that lord fawn saw said mr low be a understand enveloped in heavy great coat so fawn have got finger in pie said lord chiltern mr low have be there hour lord chiltern remaining also in room when there came three men belonging to police superintendent with two constable when men be shown up into room bludgeon coat have be moved from small table a phineas have placed there phineas chiltern have lit cigar be there sitting in silence phineas have entertained idea mr low believed charge that barrister be therefore enemy mr low have perceived have not felt to be duty to declare opinion of friend innocence what must do for friend must do a thought must serve better now by silent observation than by protestation lord chiltern who have be implored by phineas not to leave continued to pour forth unabating execration on monstrous malignity of accuser know that there be accuser said mr low except circumstance police must of course investigate then men came nature of duty be soon explained must request mr finn to go with to bow street took possession of many article besides two have be prepared for dress coat shirt phineas have worn boot have gone out to dinner with gibus hat took that took umbrella latch key asked even a to purse money abstained from taking purse when mr low suggested that must have concern with a happened phineas be at moment wearing shirt in have dined out on previous day men asked whether have objection to change in presence a might be necessary after examination that must be detained a evidence did so in presence of men assembled humiliation of doing almost broke heart then searched among linen clean dirty asked question of mr bunce in audible whisper behind door mr bunce must do to injure cause of favourite lodger by severity of manner snubbing policeman determination to give information did do have shirt washed how do suppose gentleman shirt be washed be brought up near enough to washtub to know more than can tell very respectable constable did not seem to be in least annoyed by landlady amenity be taken to bow street going thither in cab with two policeman superintendent followed with lord chiltern mr low mean to say that believe said lord chiltern to officer never believe never disbelieve anything lord replied man nevertheless superintendent did most firmly believe that phineas finn have murdered mr bonteen at police office phineas be met by lord cantrip barrington erle soon became aware that lord fawn fitzgibbon be present seemed that everything else be made to give way to inquiry a be at once confronted by magistrate everybody be personally very civil to be asked whether must not wish to have professional advice while charge be being made against declined must tell magistrate said knew at rate for present must have need of advice be at last allowed to tell own story after repeated caution there have be word between mr bonteen in club after standing at door of club with friend mr erle mr fitzgibbon who be now in court have seen mr bonteen walk away towards berkeley square have soon followed have never overtaken mr bonteen when reaching square have crossed over to fountain standing there on south side from thence have taken shortest way up bruton street have seen mr bonteen for last time dimly by gaslight at corner of square a far a must remember have at moment passed fountain have not heard sound of struggle of word round corner towards piccadilly by time mr bonteen must have reached head of step leading into passage must have be near bruton street with back completely turned to scene of murder have walked faster than mr bonteen having gradually drawn near to have determined in own mind that must not pas man get so near a to attract attention have done so have certainly worn grey coat be now produced collar of have not be turned up coat be nearly new to best of belief collar have never be turned up have carried life preserver now produced with because have once before be necessary for to attack garotters in street life preserver have never be used a happened be quite new have be bought about month since in consequence of commotion about garotters have just then taken place before purchase of life preserver have be accustomed to carry stick bludgeon at night undoubtedly have quarrelled with mr bonteen before occasion have bought instrument since commencement of quarrel have not seen one on way from square to own house with sufficient observation to enable to describe such person must not remember that have passed policeman on way home took place after hearing of such evidence a be then given statement made by erle fitzgibbon a to what have taken place in club afterwards at door tallied exactly with afterwards given by phineas accurate measurement of street way concerned be already furnished taking duration of time a surmised by erle fitzgibbon to have passed after have turned back upon phineas constable proved that prisoner must have have time to hurry back to corner of street have passed to be in place where lord fawn saw man supposing that lord fawn have walked at rate of three mile hour that phineas have walked run at twice pace lord fawn stated that be walking very slow le thought than three mile hour that man be hurrying very fast not absolutely running going a thought at quite double own pace two coat be shown to lordship finn knew nothing of other coat have in truth be taken from rev mr emilius rough thick brown coat have belonged to preacher for last two year finn coat be grey in colour lord fawn looked at coat very attentively then said that man have seen have certainly not worn brown coat night have be dark still be sure that coat have be grey collar have certainly be turned up then tailor be produced who gave a opinion that finn coat have be lately worn with collar raised be considered that evidence given be sufficient to make remand imperative phineas finn be committed to newgate be assured that attention must be paid to comfort be treated with great consideration lord cantrip who still believed in discussed subject with magistrate with major mackintosh of course strictest search must be made for second life preserver such weapon a might have be used search have already be made such weapon have be a yet found emilius have never be seen with such weapon one about curzon street mayfair must be found who have seen man with quick step raised collar who doubtless have be murderer except lord fawn so that evidence be forthcoming tending to show that phineas finn must not have be man evidence adduced to prove mr emilius mealyus a be henceforth called must not have be on spot be so very strong that magistrate told constable that man must be released on next examination unless something must be adduced against magistrate with profoundest regret be unable to agree with lord cantrip in opinion that evidence adduced be not sufficient to demand temporary committal of mr finn chapter l what lord common said about murder when house met on thursday at four o'clock everybody be talking about murder certainly four fifth of member have made up mind that phineas finn be murderer to have known murdered man be something to have be intimate with murderer be certainly much more there be many there who be really sorry for poor bonteen of whom without doubt end have come in very horrible manner there be more there who be personally fond of phineas finn to whom future of young member be very sad fact that must have become murderer very awful nevertheless occasion be not without consolation business of house be not always exciting even interesting on afternoon there be not member who did not feel that something have occurred added interest to parliamentary life very soon after prayer mr gresham entered house men who have hitherto be behaving after most unparliamentary fashion standing about in knot talking by mean in whisper moving in out of house rapidly crowded into place pretence of business have be going on be stopped in moment mr gresham rose to make statement be with deepest regret nay with most profound sorrow that be called upon to inform house that right honourable friend colleague mr bonteen have be basely cruelly murdered during past night be odd then to see how name of man who while be alive member of house must not have be pronounced in assembly without disorder struck member almost with dismay yes friend mr bonteen who have so lately filled office of president of board of trade whose loss country house must so ill bear have be beaten to death in one of street of metropolis by arm of dastardly ruffian during silent watch of night then mr gresham paused one expected that further statement must be made did not know that have further communication to make on subject little time must elapse before must fill office a for adequately supplying loss must be impossible mr bonteen service to country especially in reference to decimal coinage be too well known to house to allow of holding out such hope then sat down without having a yet made allusion to phineas finn allusion be soon made mr daubeny rose with much graceful mysterious circumlocution asked prime minister whether be true that member of house have be arrested be now in confinement on charge of having be concerned in murder of late much lamented president of board of trade mr daubeny have be given to understand charge have be made against honourable member of house who have once be colleague of mr bonteen who have always supported right honourable gentleman opposite then mr gresham rose again regretted to say that honourable member for tankerville be in custody on charge house must of course understand that only made statement a fact that be offering opinion a to who be perpetrator of murder case seemed to be shrouded in great mystery two gentleman have unfortunately differed did not at think that house must on account be disposed to attribute guilt so black damning to gentleman have known so well a honourable member for tankerville so much more be spoken publicly to reporter member continued to talk about affair whole evening there be nothing perhaps more astonishing than absence of rancour abhorrence with name of phineas be mentioned even by who felt most certain of guilt who have be present at club acknowledged that bonteen have be sinner in reference to transaction there be acknowledged to have be almost public misfortune that man a bonteen must have be able to prevail against one a phineas finn in regard to presence of latter in government story be exaggerated account worse even than truth be bandied about a to perseverance with murdered man have destroyed prospect of supposed murderer robbed country of service of good workman mr gresham in official statement have made have a matter of course said many fine thing about mr bonteen man can always have fine thing said about for few hour after death in small private conference be held fine thing said referred to phineas finn mr gresham have spoken of dastardly ruffian in silent watch one must have almost thought from overhearing what be said by various gentleman in different part of house upon whole phineas finn be thought to have done rather good thing in putting poor mr bonteen out of way pleasant feature of excitement be added by prevalent idea that prince have seen heard row who have be at club at time of course knew that be not case presence of prince at universe between row murder have really be fact therefore be only natural that men must allow delight of mixing prince with whole concern in remote circle prince be undoubtedly supposed to have have great deal to do with matter though whether a abettor of murdered of murderer be never plainly declared great deal be said about prince that evening in house so that many member be able to enjoy thoroughly what godsend for gresham said one gentleman to mr ratler very shortly after strong eulogium have be uttered on poor mr bonteen by prime minister well yes be afraid that poor fellow must never have got on with got on 'd have be thorn in gresham side a long a held office if finn must be acquitted ought to do something handsome for whereupon mr ratler laughed heartily will pretty nearly break up said sir orlando drought one of mr daubeny late secretary of state to mr roby mr daubeny late patronage secretary quite see that will be able to drop decimal coinage with good excuse will be great comfort be talking of getting monk to go back to board of trade will strengthen bonteen must have weakened man have got beyond lost head be better without suppose finn did asked sir orlan doubt about be told queer thing be that must have declared purpose beforehand to erle gresham say that must have be part of plan so a to make men think afterwards that must have done be idea be that have planned murder before went to club will prince have to give evidence said mr roby be wrong prince have left club before row commenced confucius putt say that prince did hear word of be talking to prince time confucius putt be distinguished artist with whom prince have shaken hand on leaving club lord drummond be in peer gallery mr boffin be talking to over railing may be remembered that two gentleman have conscientiously left mr daubeny cabinet because have be unable to support in view about church after such sacrifice on part mind be of course intent on church matter there doe seem to be doubt about said mr boffin cantrip wo believe said peer be at colony with cantrip cantrip found very agreeable everybody say that be one of pleasantest fellow going make out of question that must bring in church bill session do think so oh yes certainly there will be nothing else thought of now till trial so much better said lordship be ill wind blow one good will have evidence for conviction oh dear yes not doubt about fawn can swear to said mr boffin barrington erle be telling story for tenth time when be summoned out of library to duchess of omnium who have made way up into lobby oh mr erle do tell what really think said duchess be just what ca do why not because know what to think ca have done mr erle be just what say to myself duchess do say that evidence be so very strong against very strong wish must get that lord fawn out of way ah ca will hang if convict will man knew so well just when have made up mind to do everything for do know be not bit surprised have felt before now a though must like to have done must be very nasty duchess did so hate that man 'd give oh know what 'd give to bring to life again minute what will lady laura do in answer to barrington erle only shrugged shoulder lady laura be cousin must give up know mr erle what can do surely can do something ca get in paper that must be innocent so that everybody must be made to think so if must get hold of lawyer make not want to to destroy there be nothing must do there be getting hold of judge know duchess judge be stone not that be bit better than anybody else only like to be safe do like to be safe be sure must do if put shoulder to wheel believe know for moment that murdered be done by lizzie eustace jew will be sifted of course what be use of sifting if mr finn be to be hung while be being done think anything of police do remember how bungled about woman necklace mean to give up mr erle expect to help then duchess returned home a know found madame goesler at house nothing be done that night either in lord common statement about mr bonteen be made in upper a well a in lower house after statement real work be out of question have mr bonteen absolutely be chancellor of exchequer in cabinet when be murdered have phineas finn be once more under secretary of state commotion excitement must hardly have be greater even duke of st bungay have visited spot well known to a there urban domain meet of two great whig peer with whom whose predecessor have long be familiar also have known phineas finn not long since have said civil word to of too have of late day especially disliked mr bonteen have almost insisted that man now murdered must not be admitted into cabinet have heard what be nature of evidence have heard of quarrel life preserver grey coat suppose must have done said duke of st bungay to a walked away up hay hill chapter li think shameful tidings of what have taken place first reached lady laura kennedy from brother on return to portman square after scene in police court object of visit to finn lodging have be explained nature of lady laura vehemence in urging upon brother performance of very disagreeable task have not be sufficiently described brother must willingly go on mission from married sister to man who have be publicly named a sister lover brother must be le likely to do so than lord chiltern lady laura have be very stout in argument very strong willed in purpose income arising from money have be absolutely own must again be exclusively own must claim to on behalf of husband estate be abandoned surely might do what liked with own if brother must not assist in making arrangement must be done by other mean be quite willing that must appear to come to mr finn from father not from herself did brother think ill of did believe in calumny of newspaper did wife for moment conceive that have lover when looked at worn out withered old woman before time be possible that must so believe asked question lord chiltern of course declared that have suspicion of kind indeed said lady laura defy one to suspect who know if so why be not a much entitled to help friend a might be need not even mention name endeavoured to make understand that name must be mentioned others must believe must say evil thing can not say worse than have said continued yet what harm have done to then demanded why desired to go so far out of way with view of spending money upon one who be in way connected with because like better than one else answered boldly there be very little left for care at do care for prosperity be once in love with told so have chosen to give hand to mr kennedy be not in love with now with choose to regard a friend assured over over again that phineas finn must certainly refuse to touch money declined to believe at rate trial might be made must not refuse money left to by will why must not now enjoy that be intended for then explained how certain be that must speedily vanish out of world altogether unless assurance of income be made to so lord chiltern went on mission hardly meaning to make offer confident that must be refused if made know nature of new trouble in found phineas finn enveloped be such that lord chiltern did not open mouth about money now having witnessed scene at police office have come back to tell tale to sister be sitting with wife when entered room have heard anything asked at once heard what said wife then have not heard man have be murdered what man said lady laura jumping suddenly from seat not robert lord chiltern shook head mean that mr finn have be killed again shook head then sat down a though asking of two question have exhausted speak oswald said wife why do not tell be one whom knew think that laura used to know mr bonteen be murdered last night in street mr bonteen man who be mr finn enemy said lady chiltern mr bonteen said lady laura a though murder of twenty mr bonteens be nothing to man whom talk of a finn enemy must be better if there be such talk who killed said lady laura again getting up coming close to brother who be oswald asked wife also be now too deeply interested to keep seat have arrested two men said lord chiltern jew who married lady eustace there paused have determined beforehand that must tell sister double

brought home from chapel knocked at door there be very little said between positive allusion be made to shot have be fired macpherson succeeded in getting pistol into possession a to unfortunate man put impediment in way managed to have understood that mr kennedy cousin must be summoned on following morning be anybody else coming robert kennedy asked when landlord be about to leave room naebody a ken o yet laird said macpherson like will nobody however did come laird have spent evening by in very wretched solitude on following day cousin have come to whole story be told after difficulty be found in taking miserable man back to loughlinter there have be for last two month in custody of more wretched mother of cousin legal step have be taken to deprive of management either of of property so that be in truth own master exercised mastery in act of petty tyranny about domain becoming more more close fisted in regard to money desirous a appeared of starving living thing about place cattle sheep horse so that value of food might be saved member of establishment knew that laird be nae just consequently order be not obeyed laird knew same of though must give order not only resolutely with imperious threat of penalty to follow disobedience still did not seem to expect compliance while be in state letter addressed to came for while into own hand thus more than one reached from lord brentford lawyer demanding that restitution must be made of interest arising from lady laura fortune then must fly out into bitter wrath calling wife foul name swearing that must never have farthing of money to spend upon paramour of course be money only world knew that have not left roof breaking marriage vow throwing aside duty bringing down to present state of abject misery own fortune if wanted interest of wretched money let come to loughlinter receive there in spite of wickedness cruelty misconduct have brought a now said to verge of grave must still give shelter room for repentance recognised vow though did not must still be wife though have utterly disgraced must still be wife though have so lived a to make impossible that there must be happiness in household be thus spoke when first one then letter came from earl lawyer pointing out to injustice to lady laura be subjected by loss of fortune doubt letter must not have be written in line assumed have not mr kennedy proved to be unfit to have custody of wife by attempting to shoot man whom accused of being wife lover act have be done said lawyer made quite out of question that lady laura must return to husband to when speaking of matter to around did with energy seemed to be foreign to character mr kennedy made direct allusion swore most positively that not shilling must be given up fear of policeman coming down to loughlinter to take account of angry shot have passed away though knew with uncertain knowledge that be not in respect obeyed a used to be that order be disobeyed by steward servant in spite of threat of dismissal still felt that be sufficiently own master to defy earl attorney to maintain claim upon wife person let return to first of after while cousin interfered still further robert kennedy who so short time since have be member of government graced by permission to sit in cabinet be not allowed to open own post bag have written letter to one person then again to have induced who received to return answer to cousin to lord brentford lawyer have used few very strong word mr forster have replied to cousin stating how grieved lord brentford must be how much grieved must be lady laura to find driven to take step in reference to what conceived to be unfortunate condition of mr robert kennedy that such step must be taken unless arrangement must be made must be at rate reasonable then mr kennedy post bag be taken from letter wrote be not sent took to bed be during condition of affair that cousin took upon to intimate to mr forster that manager of mr kennedy estate be by mean anxious of embarrassing charge by so trumpery additional matter a income derived from lady laura forty thousand pound thing be in terrible confusion at loughlinter rent be paid a heretofore on receipt given by robert kennedy agent agent must only pay money to robert kennedy credit at bank robert kennedy cheque must no doubt have drawn money out again be almost impossible to induce robert kennedy to sign cheque even in bed inquired daily about money knew accurately sum lying at banker must be persuaded to disgorge nothing postponed from day to day signing of certain cheque be brought to alleged very freely that attempt be being made to rob during life have be very generous in subscribing to public charity now stopped subscription cousin have to provide even for payment of wage thing went very badly at loughlinter then there arose question whether legal step must be taken for placing management of estate in other hand on ground of owner insanity wretched old mother begged that might not be done dr macnuthrie from callender be of opinion that step must be taken at present mr kennedy be very ill very ill indeed must take nourishment seemed to be sinking under pressure of misfortune step such a suggested must probably send friend out of world at once in fact robert kennedy be dying in first week of may when beauty of spring be beginning to show on brae of loughlinter did die old woman mother be seated by bedside into ear murmured last wailing complaint if have fear of god before eye must come back to let pray that may soften heart said old lady eh mother nothing can soften heart satan have hardened till be hard a nether millstone in faith died believing a have ever believed that spirit of evil be stronger than spirit of good illustration may soften heart for time past there have be perturbation in mind of cousin of other kennedy of ilk a to nature of will of head of family be feared lest must have be generous to wife who be believed by to have be so wicked treacherous to husband so be found to be when will be read during last few month one near have dared to speak to of will for have be known that condition of mind rendered unfit to alter have ever alluded to a matter of course there have be settlement be supposed that lady laura own money must revert to when be found that in addition to loughlinter estate became hers for life in event of mr kennedy dying without child there be great consternation among kennedy generally there be two three of concerned for there be money enough seemed to now that bad wife who have utterly refused to acclimatise to soil to have be transplanted be to be rewarded for wicked stubbornness lady laura must become mistress of own fortune of loughlinter must be once more free woman with power that wealth fashion can give ala ala be too late now for taking of step to sever from rich inheritance false harlot will come play havoc here in son mansion said old woman with extremest bitterness tidings be conveyed to lady laura through lawyer did not reach in full till eight ten day after news of husband death telegram announcing that event have come to at father house in portman square on day after on phineas have be arrested earl have of course known that great longing for recovery of wife fortune have be now realised to there be sorrow in news have only known robert kennedy a one who have be thoroughly disagreeable to who have persecuted daughter throughout married life there have come no happiness not even prosperity through marriage daughter have be forced to leave man house have be forced also to leave money behind then have be driven abroad fearing persecution have only dared to return when man madness became so notorious a to annul power of annoying now by death portion of injury have inflicted on great family of standish must be remedied money must come back together with stipulated jointure there must no longer be question of return news delighted old lord be almost angry with daughter because also must not confess delight oh papa be husband yes yes doubt be always against will remember pray talk in way now papa know be not to what must have be used to say be fault will not talk of now papa be gone remember past goodness to clothed in deepest of mourning made thing of sorrow by sacrificial uncouthness of garment tried to think of to think of not to think of phineas finn remembered with real sorrow word have spoken to sister in law in have declared while still wife of man that must willingly marry phineas at foot even of gallows if be free be free now did not repeat assertion be impossible not to think of phineas in present strait abstained from speaking of a far a must for present never alluded to former purpose of visiting in prison from day to day for first few day of widowhood heard what be going on evidence against became stronger stronger whereas other man yosef mealyus have be already liberated there be still many who felt sure that mealyus have be murderer among whom be who have be ranked among staunch friend of hero chilterns so believed lady laura duchess so believed madame goesler mr low felt sure of mr monk lord cantrip nobody be more sure than mr bunce there be many who professed that doubted men such a barrington erle laurence fitzgibbon two duke though younger duke never expressed such doubt at home mr gresham indeed feeling of parliament in general be one of great doubt mr daubeny never expressed opinion one way other feeling that fate of two second class liberal must not be matter of concern to sir orlando drought mr roby mr boffin be a eager a though have not be conservative be full of doubt surely if phineas finn be not murderer have be more ill used by fate than have be man since fate first began to be unjust there be also very strong party by whom doubt be entertained a to guilt at head of a in duty bound be poor widow mr bonteen have doubt a to hand by husband have fallen clamoured loudly for vengeance of law world said knew how bitter against husband have be wretch whose villainy have be exposed by dear gracious lord now evidence against be to thinking complete be supported strongly by lady eustace who much a wished not to be wife of bohemian jew thought even that preferable to being known a widow of murderer who have be hung mr ratler with one two others in house be certain of finn guilt people banner though prefaced one of daily paragraph on subject with statement a to manifest duty of influential newspaper to abstain from expression of opinion on subject till question have be decided by jury nevertheless from day to day recapitulated evidence against member for tankerville showed how strong be motif have existed for such deed among who be sure of finn guilt there be one more sure than lord fawn who have seen coat height of man step declared among intimate friend that of course must not swear to person must not venture when upon oath to give opinion man who have passed at so quick pace have be foot higher than mealyus of there must be doubt must there be doubt a to grey coat of course there might be other men with grey coat besides mr phineas finn other men foot taller than yosef mealyus there might be other men with peculiarly energetic step man who hurried by might not have be man who murdered mr bonteen of lord fawn must say nothing what did say of be sure who knew be well aware that in own mind be convinced of guilt of phineas finn there be man equally convinced mr maule senior remembered well manner in madame goesler spoke of phineas finn in reference to murder be quite sure that phineas be murderer for couple of day lord chiltern be constantly with poor prisoner after that be obliged to return to harrington hall did day after news arrived of death of brother in law lady chiltern have promised to return home having left adelaide palliser alone in house already have overstayed time of course will remain with lady chiltern have said to sister in law widow have preferred to be left alone for first few day when must make pretence of sorrow because husband have died have such real cause for sorrow in miserable condition of man loved preferred to be alone who must sympathise with now with whom must speak of grief father be talking to always of money from must endure be used to must remember when spoke to of forty thousand pound of twelve hundred year of jointure that have not always be with like that a yet nothing have be heard of will earl did not in least anticipate further accession of wealth from estate of man whom have hated daughter must now be rich woman be yet young there might still be splendour suppose wo care to buy land said oh papa talk of buying anything yet dear laura must put money into something can get very nearly per cent from indian stock not yet papa said proceeded to explain to how very important affair money be that person who have got money can not be excused for not considering what have better do with doubt must get per cent on money by buying up certain existing mortgage on saulsby property must doubt be very convenient if money must go to brother child not yet papa said again having however already made up mind that money must have different destination must not interest father at in fate of phineas finn when story of murder have first be told to have be amazed doubt somewhat gratified a be at tragic occurrence concern ourselves must not be made to tremble for fate of phineas finn yet have known man during last few year most intimately have have much in common with have trusted phineas in respect to son have trusted also in respect to daughter phineas have be guest at dresden on return to london have be first friend have seen with exception of lawyer yet must hardly be induced to express slightest interest a to fate of friend who be to be tried for murder oh be committed be think remember protheroe once told that in thirty nine case out of forty men committed for serious offence have be guilty of protheroe here spoken of a authority in criminal matter be at present lord weazeling lord chancellor mr finn have not be guilty papa there be always one chance out of forty a be saying if like to take up saulsby mortgage mr forster ca be told too soon papa will hing of kind said lady laura then rose walked out of room at end of ten day from death of mr kennedy there came tidings of will lady laura have written to mr kennedy letter have taken her much time in composition expressing deep sorrow condoling with old woman old woman have answered madam be too old now to express grief anger dear son death caused by domestic wrong have robbed of remaining comfort undeserved sorrow of latter year have not already dispelled obedient servant sarah kennedy from may be inferred that have also taken considerable trouble in composition of letter other communication between loughlinter portman square there be none there came through lawyer statement of mr kennedy will a far a interest of lady laura be concerned reached mr forster first brought personally to portman square asked for lady laura saw alone have bequeathed to use of loughlinter for life lady laura to yes lady laura will be dated in first year of marriage have not be altered since what can do with loughlinter will give back to then mr forster explained that legacy referred not only to house

cousin with property purchased with money saved by father property to cousin must by inheritance have claim must not have done better with than to leave to widow in fault of issue of own then lawyer explained that be to give up world must of course say that have done so from feeling of own unworthiness why must feel to be unworthy asked lawyer smiled told that of course must retain loughlinter then at request be taken to earl room there repeated good news lady laura preferred not to hear father first exultation while be being done also exulted might not still be possible that there must be before happy evening to day that might stand once more beside fall of linter contented hopeful nay almost glorious with hand in to whom have once refused own on very spot chapter liii none brave

male member of establishment be probably disporting in absence of master mistress adelaide palliser be thus left to insufficient guardianship of young woman who be altogether without discretion yes sir miss palliser be at home so said indiscreet female mr spooner be for moment confounded by own success have hardly told what reception have expected whether in event of servant informing at front door that young lady be not at home must make further immediate effort to prolong siege so a to force entry now when have carried very fortress by surprise heart almost misgave certainly have not thought when descended from chariot like young bacchus in quest of ariadne that must so soon be enabled to repeat tale of love there be confronted with ariadne before have have moment to shake godlike lock arrange divinity of thought mr spooner said maid opening door oh dear exclaimed ariadne feeling vainness of wish to fly from god know mary that lady chiltern be up in london did ask for lady

freezing blood in vein miss palliser began adelaide be for moment unmitigated diana mr spooner said can not for instant suppose that wish to say anything to do said laying hand upon heart then must declare that that ought not to hope wo lady chiltern be not in house think that ought to go away do indeed mr spooner though interview have be commenced with unexpected almost painful suddenness be too much man to be driven off by first angry word remembered that diana be mortal remembered too that though have entered in upon privacy have done so in manner recognised by world a lawful there be reason why must allow to be congealed even banished out of grotto of nymph without speaking word on own behalf be to fly now must fly for ever whereas if fought now fought well even though not successfully at moment might fight again while miss palliser be scowling at resolved upon fighting miss palliser said did not come to see lady chiltern came to see now have be happy enough to find hope will listen to for minute sha do harm be not afraid of harm can not think that have anything to say that can do anybody good sat down however so far yielded of course can not make go away mr

while to think of little else than fate of mr bonteen fate of phineas finn people became intimately acquainted with other through similar sympathy in matter who have never before spoken to seen other on day after full committal of man mr low received most courteous letter from duchess of omnium begging to call in carlton terrace if engagement must permit to do so duchess have heard that mr low be devoting energy to protection of phineas finn a certain friend of hers lady be doing same be anxious to bring together indeed be equally prepared to devote energy for present to same object have declared to friend especially to husband to duke of st bungay absolute conviction of innocence of accused man have called upon to defend dear said elder duke think that in time innocent man have ever lost life upon scaffold be that reason why friend must be first instance said duchess must be tried according to law of country said younger duke plantagenet always speak a if everything be perfect whereas know very well that everything be imperfect if man be be hung glencora said husband connect with fate of stranger from misdirected enthusiasm do connect if man be hung will go into mourning for have better look to mr low obeyed summons called on duchess in truth invitation have be planned by madame goesler who be present when lawyer about five o'clock in afternoon be shown into presence of duchess tea be immediately ordered mr low be almost embraced be introduced to madame goesler of whom did not before remember that have heard name be at once given to understand that fate of phineas be now in question know so well said duchess how true be to be old friend of mine said lawyer can not believe to have be guilty of murder guilty be more guilty than be be a sure of a be of sun know that be innocent do not madame goesler too be very dear friend of be be so be said madame goesler in voice very low sweet yet so energetic a to make mr low almost rivet attention upon must understand mr low that mr finn be man horribly hated by certain enemy wretched mr bonteen hated very name there be other people who think very differently of must be saved indeed hope may said mr low wanted to see for ever so many reason of course understand that sum of money can be spent that case may want nothing will be spared on account certainly said lawyer money will do great many thing must send round world if must get evidence against other man lady eustace husband know can good be done by sending round world went back to own home not long ago in poland think said madame goesler perhaps got instrument there brought with mr low shook head of course be very ignorant must be pity that everything must not be tried might have got in out of window know said duchess still mr low shook head believe thing can always be found out if only take trouble enough trouble mean money doe not must mind how many thousand pound cost must marie fear that spending of thousand can do good said mr low something must be done mean to say that mr finn be to be hung because lord fawn say that saw man running along street in grey coat certainly not there be nothing else against nobody else saw if there be nothing else against will be acquitted think then said madame goesler that there will be use in tracing what man mealyus did when be out of england might have bought grey coat then have hidden till night then have thrown away mr low listened to with close attention again shook head if must be shown that man have grey coat at time must certainly weaken effect of mr finn grey coat if bought bludgeon there must weaken effect of mr finn bludgeon if bought rope to make ladder must show that have got out be dark night know nobody must have seen have be talking over mr low really think ought to send somebody will mention what say to gentleman who be employed on mr finn defence will not be employed then mr low explained that gentleman to whom referred be attorney who must get up case on

expending twenty thousand pound duchess can have money welcome can not madame goesler must have double that if double be necessary must fill court with lawyer for continued duchess must cross examine witness off leg must rake up wicked thing horrid jew have done since be born must make witness speak must give carriage pair of horse to one of juror wife if must do good may shake head mr low must 'd carry lord fawn off to antipode too must care if left there know that man be innocent 'd do anything to save woman know ca do much have privilege that can speak out what men only think 'd give two carriage two pair of horse piece if must do way mr low did best to explain to duchess that desired object must hardly be effected after fashion proposed endeavoured to persuade that justice be sure to be done in english court of law then why be people so very anxious to get lawyer that to bamboozle witness said duchess mr low declared to be opinion that poorest man in england be not more likely to be hung for murder have not committed than richest then why must if be accused have ever so many lawyer to defend mr low went on to explain more money spend said duchess more fuss make longer trial be about greater interest more chance man have to escape if man be tried for three day always think will get off if last ten minute be sure to be convicted hung 'd have mr finn trial made so long that never must convict 'd tire out judge jury in london if get lawyer enough may speak for ever mr low endeavoured to explain that might prejudice prisoner 'd examine member of house of common cabinet

say so of course mr low dare say there be nothing wrong ever done in chancery know what cabinet minister be if must get majority by granting pardon 'd do quick enough be speaking of liberal government of course duchess there be twopence to choose between in respect just at moment believe mr finn be most popular member of house of common 'd bring to bear ca know that if everything of kind be done will have effect believe must make so popular that people must pull down prison rather than have hung so that jury must not dare to say be guilty must be justice lady asked just man must be success mr low be great deal better thing of two if mr finn be found guilty must not in heart believe that must be justice said madame goesler mr low did best to make understand that plan of pulling down newgate by instrumentality of phineas finn popularity of buying up home secretary by threat of parliamentary defection must hardly answer purpose must assured suggest to attorney employed idea of searching for evidence against man mealyus in own country must certainly take care that nothing be omitted from want of mean have better let put cheque in hand said duchess to must not assent did admit that must be well to leave stone unturned that turning of such stone must cost money money said must be forthcoming be not rich man said duchess mr low assured that if money be really wanting must ask for now said duchess there be one other thing that want can see yes madame goesler look a if must be very wicked mr low thought that must be wicked that duke must not like that visit must occasion ill

duchess thing be wrong to looker after wickedness dear if must comfort to see why must not have comfort must have gone to in own lodging asked mr low must if 'd be ill said madame goesler madam said mr low speaking with gravity for moment have effect even upon duchess of omnium think at rate that if visit mr finn in prison must do so through instrumentality of grace husband of course suspect of manner of evil suspect nothing be sure that must be so will be so said duchess thank sir be much obliged to for wise counsel be obliged to said madame goesler because know that have safety at heart so be said duchess relenting giving hand be really ever so much obliged to quite understand about duke how must never do anything without telling have time to attend to thing hope have not offended oh

from newgate chapter lv phineas in prison phineas finn during fortnight in be carried backwards forward between prison bow street police office be able to maintain outward show of manly dignity a though felt that terrible accusation great material inconvenience to be subjected be only must only be temporary in nature that truth must soon prevail during period have friend constantly with mr low lord chiltern barrington erle landlord mr bunce who in day be very true to be very frequently visited by attorney mr wickerby who have be expressly recommended to for occasion if anybody must be counted upon to see through difficulty be wickerby company of mr wickerby be not pleasant to because a far a must judge mr wickerby did not believe in innocence mr wickerby be willing to do best for be so to speak moving heaven earth on behalf be fully conscious that case be great affair in respect similar to be constantly placed in hand there never fell from sympathetic expression of assurance of client absolute freedom from taint of guilt in matter from day to day ten time day phineas must express indignant surprise that one must think possible that have done deed to expression mr wickerby must make answer whatever at last phineas asked direct question never suspect anybody of anything said mr wickerby do believe in innocence demanded phineas everybody be entitled to be believed innocent till have be proved to be guilty said mr wickerby then phineas appealed to friend mr low asking whether might not be allowed to employ lawyer whose feeling must be more in unison with own mr low adjured to make change mr wickerby understood work be most zealous man client be entitled to service to nothing more than service so mr wickerby carried on work fully believing that phineas finn have in truth murdered mr bonteen prisoner be not without sympathy confidence mr low lord chiltern lady chiltern who on one occasion came to visit with husband entertained doubt prejudicial to honour told perhaps almost more than be quite true of feeling of world in favour heard of friendship faith of duchess of omnium of madame goesler of lady laura kennedy hearing also that lady laura be now widow then at length two sister came over to from ireland wept sobbed fell into hysteric in presence be sure that be innocent a be one said throughout length breadth of ireland mr bunce who came to see phineas in prison swore that must tear judge from bench if did not at once pronounce verdict in favour of darling without waiting for nonsense of jury bunce husband having convinced that lodger have not committed murder be zealous in way taking delight in case proving that jury must find verdict of guilty during week phineas buoyed up by sympathy of friend in measure supported by excitement of occasion carried well bore bravely terrible misfortune to have be subjected by untoward circumstance when magistrate fully committed giving first public decision on matter from bench declaring to world at large on evidence a given prima facie phineas finn must be regarded a murderer of mr bonteen hero courage almost gave way if such be now judicial opinion of magistrate how must expect different verdict from jury in two month time when must be tried before final court a far a must understand nothing more must be learned on matter fact be known must be known a far a rather friend on behalf be able to search for fact seemed to that there be tittle whatever of evidence against have walked straight home from club with life preserver in pocket have never turned to right to left till found committed must not believe that serious prolonged impediment must be thrown in way of liberty must not believe that man altogether innocent must be in danger of gallows on false accusation have seemed to that police have kept hold on with rabid ferocity straining point with view of showing that be possible that must have be murderer policeman who have be near carrying backward forward from prison giving evidence a to circumstance of locality of walk home on fatal night have seemed to to be enemy have looked for impartiality from magistrate now magistrate have failed have seen in court face of men well known to men known in world with whom have be on pleasant term in parliament who have sat upon bench while be standing a culprit between two constable who have be familiar friend have appeared at once to have be removed from by unmeasurable distance that have a be discounted believing that few hour at very longest few day must remove distance now be sent back to prison there to await trial for murder seemed to that committal startled one must be that even dearest friend thought possible that have be guilty when day came be taken back to newgate on last journey there from bow street lord chiltern have returned for while to harrington hall having promised that must be back in london a soon a business must permit mr low came to almost immediately to prison room be pleasant state of thing said phineas with forced laugh a laughed also sobbed with low irrepressible convulsive movement in throat phineas time have come in must show to be man man oh yes can be man murderer mean will have to be hung suppose may god in mercy forbid not in mercy in justice there can be need for mercy here not even from heaven when take life may forgive sin through merit of saviour for there can be mercy why do not speak do mean to say that be guilty be sure that be innocent yet look here what more can be done to prove than have be done that blundering fool will swear life away then threw on bed gave way to sob that evening be alone a indeed most of evening have be spent minute be minute of agony to external circumstance of position be a comfortable a circumstance must allow have room to looking out through heavy iron bar into one of court of prison chamber be carpeted be furnished with bed chair two table book be allowed a pleased pen ink be may fire be necessary at certain period of day must walk alone in court below restriction on such liberty being at other certain hour place be wanted for other prisoner a far a knew friend who called be denied to though be by mean

come from hot house of duchess of omnium wine from mr low cellar fish lamb spring vegetable cream coffee fresh butter from unrestricted order of friend that lord chiltern have sent champagne cigar lady chiltern have given direction about book stationery did not know a far a must be consoled by such comfort there have be consolation if lamb salad must make happy might have enjoyed sojourn in newgate now evening be past enjoyment be impossible that must read how must man fix attention on book with charge of murder against affirmed by deliberate decision of judge knew to be a innocent a magistrate now then must rise from bed almost rush across room a though must dash head against wall murder really believed that have deliberately murdered man phineas finn who have served country with repute who have sat in parliament who have prided on living with best of fellow creature who have be friend of mr monk of lord cantrip trusted intimate of such woman a lady laura lady chiltern who have never put hand to mean action allowed tongue to speak mean word laughed in wrath then almost howled in agony thought of young loving wife who have lived with little more than for one fleeting year wondered whether be looking down upon from heaven how spirit must bear accusation against man upon whose bosom have slept in whose arm have gone to long rest ca believe said aloud be impossible why must have murdered then remembered example in latin from rule of grammar repeated to over over again one at instant of sudden becomes most base seemed to that there be such want of knowledge of human nature in supposition that be possible that must have committed crime yet there be committed to take trial for murder of mr bonteen day be long be daylight till nearly nine indeed twilight lingered even through iron bar till after nine have once asked for candle have be told that must not be allowed without attendant in room have dispensed with have be treated doubtless with great respect nevertheless have be treated a prisoner hardly denied anything that asked when asked for did not choose to grant must annex condition induced to withdraw request understood way now did not

will have understood why must not come to a must have done for little accident died on day that arrested be not strange that double blow must fall together oswald doubt told told of husband death not

of question whereupon mr meager have endeavoured to force lock of old bureau with carving knife there have be slight personal encounter after have have gin have gone to bed mr meager remembered day very well indeed miss meager when police came next morning have accounted for black eye by tragical account of fall have have against bed post in dark up to period mr emilius have be everything be sweet good excellent eloquent clergyman who be being ill treated by wife wealthy relation who be soft in manner civil in word never gave more trouble than be necessary period too must have be one of comparative prosperity to meager lady for inopportune return of head of family a two other lodger have be inclined to look out upon dead wall else into cheerful back yard circumstance came to have bearing upon story a mr meager have be driven by press of increased household to let good natured mr emilius know that if did mind latch key might be accommodation on occasion to give due indeed have when first taking room offered to give up key when not intending to be out at night after murder mr emilius have be arrested have be kept in durance for week miss meager have be sure that be innocent

upon in consequence of tragedy have be so interesting to hitherto inquiry made at house have have reference solely to habit doings of lodger during last few day now there came to visitor who made more extended investigation be one of own sex be madame goesler who got out of cab at workhouse corner walked from thence to mr meager house be third appearance in northumberland street at coming have

certainly possible that might have be there there be such evidence a to emilius even if must be shown to have have latch key man be killed by such instrument a mr finn have about there be evidence that mr emilius have instrument in hand tall man in grey coat be seen hurrying to spot at exact hour mr finn be tall man wore grey coat at time emilius be not tall man even though meager have grey coat there be evidence to show that emilius ever wore mr finn have quarrelled violently with mr bonteen within hour doe not appear that emilius ever quarrelled with mr bonteen though mr bonteen have exerted in opposition to emilius be there to be defence then certainly there will be defence defence a think will prevent jury from being unanimous in convicting client though there be great deal of evidence against be what call circumstantial understand mr wickerby nobody saw commit murder indeed said madame goesler although there be personal similarity there be personal identity there be positive proof of anything illegal on part of anything must have be suspicious have murder be committed such a purchase of poison carrying of revolver life preserver have such instrument be unfortunately used might have be regarded a thing of custom be sure that bohemian did murder mr bonteen said madame goesler with enthusiasm madame said mr wickerby holding up hand can only wish that must be upon jury wo try to show that other man might have done think not next to alibi break down know what alibi be madame goesler yes mr wickerby know what alibi be next to alibi break down unsuccessful attempt to affix fault on party be most fatal blow prisoner counsel can inflict upon be always taken by jury a so much evidence against must depend altogether on different line of defence what line mr wickerby jury be always unwilling to hang madame goesler shuddered a horrid word be broadly pronounced be apt to think that simply circumstantial evidence can not be suffered to demand so disagreeable duty be peculiarly averse to hanging gentleman will hardly be induced to hang member of parliament then mr finn be very good looking have be popular be in favour will have such evidence on score of character a be never before brought into one of court will have cabinet there will be two duke madame goesler a listened to admiring enthusiasm of attorney while went on with list acknowledged to herself that dear friend duchess have not be idle there will be three secretary of state secretary of state for home department will be examined be not quite sure that may get lord chancellor there will be mr monk about most popular man in england who will speak of prisoner a particular friend think jury must hang particular friend of mr monk there will be ever so many lady have never be done before mean to try madame goesler have heard have assisted in work rather think will get four five leading member of opposition for disliked mr bonteen if must manage mr daubeny mr gresham think might reckon quite safe forgot to say that bishop of barchester have promised wo prove innocence mr wickerby mr wickerby shrugged shoulder if be acquitted after fashion men then will say that be guilty must think of life first madame goesler said attorney madame goesler when left attorney room be very ill satisfied with desired adherent to cause who must with affectionate zeal resolve upon washing phineas finn white a snow in reference to charge now made against man must so resolve who did not believe in innocence a madame goesler believed knew that own belief be romantic unpractical nevertheless conviction of guilt of other man towards still thought that much must be done if coat be found making of secret key be proved be so strong upon that must not allow to drop must not be sufficient for phineas finn must be acquitted desired that real murderer must be hung for murder so that world might be sure a be sure that hero have be wrongfully accused do mean that be going to start duchess said to same afternoon yes be then must be very far gone in love indeed must do a much duchess if be free a be be matter of love at be womanly enthusiasm for cause one have taken up be quite a enthusiastic only must like to go to prague in june 'd go to siberia in january if must find out that horrid man really committed murder who be going with will be quite company have got detective policeman interpreter who understands czech german to go about with policeman lawyer clerk there will be own maid everybody will know about before get there be not to go quite together policeman interpreter be to form one party maid poor clerk be to be alone if get coat of course will telegraph to who be to have coat suppose will take to mr wickerby say doe want that must do good think that if must show that man might very easily have be out of house that have certainly provided with mean of getting out of house secretly coat must be of service be going at rate will be in paris to morrow morning think very grand of dear for sake hope may live to be prime minister perhaps after may give plantagenet 'garter ' when old duke died garter became vacant have of course fallen to gift of mr gresham duchess have expected that must be continued in family a have be lieutenancy of barsetshire also have be held by old duke garter have be given to lord cantrip duchess be sore with radical propensity inclination to laugh at duke marquis thought very much of garter lieutenancy husband must not think of at hence there be word between duchess have declared that duke must insist on having garter be thing that men ask for duke have said tell plantagenet about not asking everybody asks for everything nowadays everybody be not correct glencora never yet asked for anything never will honour have value in eye unless come unasked thereupon be that duchess now suggested that phineas finn when prime minister might perhaps bestow garter upon husband so madame goesler started for prague with determination of being back if possible before trial began be to be commenced at old bailey towards end of june people already began to foretell that must extend over very long period circumstance seemed to be simple who understood such matter declared that duration of trial depended great deal more on public interest felt in matter than upon own nature now be already perceived that trial of modern day have ever be so interesting a must be trial be already known that attorney general sir gregory grogram be to lead case for prosecution that solicitor general sir simon slope be to act with have be thought to be due to memory character of mr bonteen who when be murdered have held office of president of board of trade who have very nearly be chancellor of exchequer so unusual task must be imposed on two high legal officer of government doubt there must be crowd of junior with be understood that sir gregory grogram must take burden of task upon own shoulder be declared everywhere that sir gregory did believe phineas finn to be guilty be also declared that sir simon slope be convinced be innocent defence be to be entrusted to well practised now aged hand of most experienced practitioner mr chaffanbrass than whom barrister living dead ever rescued more culprit from fang of law with mr chaffanbrass who quite late in life have consented to take silk gown be to be associated mr serjeant birdbolt who be said to be employed in order that case might be in safe hand must strength of mr chaffanbrass fail at last moment mr snow who be supposed to handle witness more judiciously than of rising men subtle courageous eloquent painstaking youth mr golightly who now with more than ten fifteen year practice be already known to be earning bread supporting wife family glory of trial must not depend chiefly on array of counsel on fact that lord chief justice must be judge so much a on social position of murdered man of murderer noble lord great statesman must throng bench of court to see phineas finn tried world who must find entrance must do same to see great statesman noble lord importance of such affair increase like snowball a be rolled on many people talk much then very many people talk very much more under sheriff of city praiseworthy gentleman not hitherto widely known to fame became suddenly conspicuous popular a being dispenser of admission to seat in court have be already admitted by judge counsel that sundry other case must be postponed because be known that bonteen murder must occupy at least week be supposed that mr chaffanbrass must consume whole day at beginning of trial in getting jury to mind matter on be known to be very particular whole day at end of trial in submitting to jury particular of great case on record in circumstantial evidence be known to have led to improper verdict be therefore understood that last week in june must be devoted to trial to exclusion of other matter of interest when mr gresham hard pressed by mr turnbull for convenient day offered that gentleman thursday th of june for suggesting to house little proposition of own with reference to english church establishment mr turnbull openly repudiated offer because on day trial of phineas finn must be commenced hope said mr gresham that work of country will not be impeded by unfortunate affair be afraid said mr turnbull that right honourable gentleman will find that member for tankerville will on day monopolise attention of house remark be thought to have be made in very bad taste nobody doubted truth perhaps interest be enhanced among politician by existence very generally of opinion that though phineas finn have murdered mr bonteen must certainly be acquitted nothing must then prevent acquitted murderer from resuming seat in house gentleman be already beginning to ask after what fashion must become to treat must speaker catch eye when rose to speak must still be phineas to very large number of men with whom general popularity have made intimate must be cold shouldered at club treated a one whose hand be red with blood must become more popular than ever receive ovation after acquittal in meantime madame goesler started on journey for prague chapter lviii two duke be necessary that country must be governed even though mr bonteen have be murdered in order that must be duly governed be necessary that mr bonteen late place at board of trade must be filled there be hesitation a to filling when arrangement be completed people be very much surprised indeed mr bonteen have be appointed chiefly because be thought that might in office act a quasi house of common deputy to duke of omnium in carrying out great scheme of five farthinged penny ten pennied shilling duke in spite of wealth rank honour be determined to go on with great task life must be nothing to now unless must at least hope to arrange five farthing when wife have bullied about garter have declared to with perfect truth that have never asked for anything have gone on to say that never must ask for anything certainly did not think that be betraying with reference to assurance when suggested to mr gresham that must take place left vacant by mr bonteen of course retaining seat in cabinet must hardly have ventured to suggest such arrangement to grace said prime minister feeling that might be so thought must venture to ask said duke be sure know that be last man to interfere a to place disposition of power quite last man said mr gresham have always be held that board of trade be not incompatible with peerage oh dear yes can feel nearer to affair of mine there than can elsewhere mr gresham of course have objection to urge great nobleman who be now asking for mr bonteen shoe have be chancellor of exchequer must have remained chancellor of exchequer have not mantle of nobility fallen upon at present moment held office in peer be often temporarily shelved put away perhaps out of harm way for time so that may be brought down used when wanted without having received crack detriment from independent action into politician be likely to fall when party be in be still out be lord privy seal lordship of state doe carry with status seat in cabinet doe not necessarily entail work present lord who cared nothing for status who be much more intent on work than be even on seat in cabinet be possessed by what many of brother politician regarded a morbid dislike to pretence have not be happy during few week of privy seal have almost envied mr bonteen reality of board of trade think upon whole will be best to make change said to mr gresham mr gresham be delighted there be one two men of mark one two who be older than mr gresham probably le perfect in liberal sympathy who thought that duke of omnium be derogating from proper position in step be now taking chief among be friend duke of st bungay who alone perhaps must venture to argue matter with almost wish that have spoken to first said elder duke feared must find so strongly opposed to resolution if be resolution think be said younger be great misfortune to that must have be obliged to leave house of common must not feel so whole life be there said who a plantagenet palliser have be so good commoner whole life must certainly not be there now whole heart on circumstance of birth have imposed duty quite a high will say quite a useful a career in house of common can put within reach of man do think so duke certainly do do think that england know must not be england that be for maintenance of high minded proud self denying nobility though with there be line dividing very broad aristocracy into two part higher lower greater smaller richer poorer nevertheless feel that success of order depends chiefly on conduct of whose rank be highest whose mean be greatest to few among whom be conspicuously one wealth have be given so great rank so high that much of welfare of country depends on manner in bear a duke of omnium must not wish to think so uncle so thought though be man very different from not inured to work in early life with fewer attainment probably slower intellect whose general conduct be inferior to own speak freely because subject be important be man who understood position requirement of order very thoroughly retinue almost royal together with expenditure royalty must not rival secured for respect of nation life have not be a be have won higher respect think not greater part of life be spent in house of common fortune be never much more than tenth of wish to make such comparison must make if be to judge must follow pray understand friend said old man energetically be not advising to abandon public life in order that may live in repose a great nobleman must not be in nature to do so must country afford to lose service need not therefore take place in arena of politics a though be still plantagenet palliser with other duty than of politician a might so well have done have uncle title wealth descended to son wish have said regretful duke can not be so brother perhaps wish that be duke have be arranged otherwise be vain to repine wife be unhappy because uncle garter be not at once given to glencora be like other woman of course share feeling have mr gresham consulted must not have scrupled to tell that must have be for welfare of party that duke of omnium must be graced with honour in power to bestow lord cantrip be friend almost a warmly a be country must not have missed ribbon from breast of lord cantrip have be more duke le slave of country must have be sent to do make angry by speaking so not in least have one ambition be to be serviceable slave of country master be more serviceable than slave said old man deny can admit much from can not admit that politician who becomes master of country sink from statesman to tyrant misunderstand other friend pitt peel palmerston be not tyrant though assumed held for to last mastery of speak smaller men who have be slave have be a patriotic a le useful regret that must follow mr bonteen in office because be mr bonteen circumstance of transfer of office occasioned by uncle death seem to to make undesirable must not have make too common very murder add to feeling because mr bonteen have be lost to minister have recourse to be own suggestion who know that be so mr gresham perhaps one two others be too late now duke to tell truth of not even can make other than be uncle life to be always problem must not understand be to attempt to walk in way must fail utterly become absurd feel disgrace of following mr bonteen trust may at least be le unfortunate well yes need not expect to be murdered in street because be going to board of trade will have made enemy by political success think that mr finn did do deed asked elder duke hardly know what think wife be sure that be innocent duchess be enthusiastic always many others think same lord lady chiltern be sure of that be always best friend be told that many of lawyer be sure that will be impossible to convict if be acquitted will strive to think innocent will come back to house of course must think must apply for hundred said duke of st bungay see why must must not in place if be innocent why must admit unfit for seat in parliament tell what might do resign then throw again upon constituency other duke shook head thereby declaring opinion that phineas finn be in truth man who have murdered mr bonteen when be publicly known that duke of omnium have stepped into mr bonteen shoe general opinion certainly coincided with given by duke of st bungay be not only that late chancellor of exchequer must not have consented to fill so low office that duke of omnium must have better known own place that must not have succeeded man so insignificant a mr bonteen thing doubt be said more be said also be thought that must not have gone to office have be rendered vacant by murder of man who have be placed there merely to assist if present arrangement be good why must not have be made independently of mr bonteen question be asked about in house transfer doubt did have effect of lowering man in estimation of political world felt that did not stand so high with colleague a when be chancellor of exchequer not even so high a when held privy seal in printed list of who attended cabinet name generally be placed last opponent on one occasion thought pretended to think that be no more than postmaster general determined to bear without wincing did wince must not own to that have be wrong be sore a man be sore who doubt about own conduct be not le so because strove to bear wife sarcasm without showing that pained say that poor lord fawn be losing mind said to lord fawn have heard anything about be engaged to lady eustace once remember say that will be made to declare why did marry if bigamy case go on then be so unfortunate that must have seen man in grey coat hope wo have to resign hope not indeed because of course 'd have to take place a under secretary be very awkward husband only smiled expressed hope that if did so might be equal to new duty by bye plantagenet what do mean to do about jewel have thought about madame goesler have better take wo suppose have better be sold by auction must be proper way must like at must buy let money stand till choose to take be affair of trade suppose be at head of now then again asked question about home secretary with reference to phineas finn when told that must be highly improper for to speak to officer on subject pretended to suppose that impropriety must consist in interference of man holding so low position a be of course be not same now said a used to be when be at exchequer took without uttering word of anger showing sign of annoyance only get two thousand year do at board of trade plantagenet upon word forget think be two thousand five hundred how nice be five at exchequer be yes five thousand at exchequer when be lord of treasury will only be one will what goose be glencora if suited to be lord of treasury what difference must salary make not least yet rank influence prestige general fitness of thing be above such sublunary idea must clean mr gresham shoe for if service of country required last word added in tone of voice very similar to husband used on occasion must even allow to clean if service of country required said duke though be magnanimous be not happy perhaps intense anxiety wife displayed a to fate of phineas finn added to discomfort duchess a duke of st bungay have said be enthusiastic never for moment dreamed of teaching to change nature must have be a well if enthusiasm at present moment must have be brought to display on other subject have be brought to feel that phineas finn have be treated badly when good thing of government be being given away that have be caused by jealous prejudice of man who have be since murdered expectant under secretary of state let have be ever so cruelly left out in cold must not murder man by whom have be ill treated looking at evidence a best must listening to opinion of others duke did think that phineas have be guilty murder have clearly be committed by personal enemy not by robber two men be known to have entertained feeling of enmity against mr bonteen a to one of whom be assured that be impossible that must have be on spot a to other seemed equally manifest that must have be there if be so must have be much better that wife must not display interest publicly in murderer favour duchess wherever went spoke of trial a persecution seemed to think that prisoner must already be treated a hero martyr glencora said to wish that must drop subject of trial till be over ca surely can avoid speaking of more than can avoid decimal out of full heart mouth speaks heart be very full what harm do do set people talking of have be doing that ever since be married know that have made out much against must go after nature plantagenet nature be decimal run after unit

ever in friendship with mr bonteen when first three four day of agony despair have passed by mind of bereaved woman be able to turn from loss to cause of loss mr bonteen became fixed in certainty that phineas finn have murdered husband seemed to think that be first paramount duty of present government to have murderer hung almost without trial when found that at best execution of man so vehemently

that everybody must not know said mr bonteen chapter lx two day before trial there be scene in private room of mr wickerby attorney in hatton garden be very distressing indeed to feeling of lord fawn induced lordship to think that be being treated without respect be due to a peer member of government there be present at scene mr chaffanbrass old barrister mr wickerby mr wickerby confidential clerk lord fawn lord fawn solicitor same mr camperdown whom saw in last chapter calling upon lady eustace policeman lord fawn have be invited to attend with many protestation of regret a to trouble thus imposed upon because very important nature of evidence about to be given by at forthcoming trial seemed to render expedient that question must be asked be on tuesday nd june trial be to be commenced on following thursday there be present in room very conspicuously old heavy grey great coat a to mr wickerby have instructed mr chaffanbrass that evidence be forthcoming if needed to prove that coat be lying on night of murder in downstairs room in house in yosef mealyus be then lodging reader will remember history of coat instigated by madame goesler who be still absent from england mr wickerby have traced coat have purchased coat be in position to prove that very coat be coat mr meager have brought home with to northumberland street on day mr wickerby be of opinion that coat have better not be used doe not go far enough said mr wickerby go very far certainly said mr chaffanbrass if try to show that man have done have said mr wickerby always tell against with jury to mr chaffanbrass made reply preferring to form own opinion to keep to when formed in obedience to instruction lord fawn be asked to attend at mr wickerby chamber in cause of truth coat be brought out on occasion be that sort of coat man wore lord said mr chaffanbrass a mr wickerby held up coat to view lord fawn walked round round coat looked at very carefully before must vouchsafe reply see be grey coat said mr chaffanbrass not speaking at in tone mr wickerby note have induced lord fawn to expect be grey said lord fawn perhaps be not same shade of grey lord fawn see lord be most anxious not to impute guilt where guilt doe lie be witness for crown of course will tell crown lawyer pass here be possible must make little preliminary inquiry in presence can hardly do mr finn coat be very much smaller coat must think be said lordship who did not like being questioned about coat think coat man wore when saw be big coat like think wore little coat wore grey coat said lord fawn be grey coat must be greyer than think lord fawn must be asked more question on matter till give evidence in court said mr camperdown man life depends on mr camperdown said barrister be matter of cross examination if bring coat into court must make charge against man by very act of doing so will not do so unless believe that other man to be guilty be inquiry ca postpone till be before jury be want to trump up case against man for sake of extricating client on false issue lord fawn doe want to hang mr finn if mr finn be not guilty god forbid said lordship mr finn must have worn that coat coat at like what be do want to learn mr chaffanbrass asked mr camperdown just put on coat mr scruby then at order of barrister mr scruby attorney clerk did put on mr meager old great coat walked about room in walk quick said mr chaffanbrass clerk did walk quick be stout thick set little man nearly foot shorter than phineas finn be that at like figure asked mr chaffanbrass think be like figure said lord fawn like coat be same colour a coat must swear be not coat be not on oath at mr chaffanbrass lord to word be a good a oath if think possible be coat think anything about at when mr scruby hurry down room in way look a man looked when be hurrying under lamp post be not disposed to say more at present be matter of regret to that lord fawn must have come here at said mr camperdown who have be summoned to meet client at chamber have come with suppose lordship wish to know that knew seeing that be question of hanging right man wrong one never heard such trash in life take off mr scruby let policeman keep understand lord fawn to say that man figure be about same a yours client believe stand about twelve inch taller thank lord will get at truth at last doubt be afterwards said that mr chaffanbrass conduct have be very improper in enticing lord fawn to mr wickerby chamber mr chaffanbrass never cared what one said know that can make much of said when mr wickerby be alone may be a well to bring into court must prove nothing against jew even if fellow meant lord fawn must be made to swear that coat worn be exactly similar to be thinking now about height doubt will get off well may do so ought not to hang man on such evidence a there be against even though there be moral doubt of guilt there be nothing really to connect mr phineas finn with murder nothing tangible there be saying nowadays what jury will do jury depend great deal more on judge than used to do if be on trial for life think 'd have counsel at one must defend a well a mr chaffanbrass did mean that must defend must say to judge lord doubt

of corn have warranty suppose indeed did ever hear of old fool must have thought dealer must have taken back for sake of character dealer must bought of gentleman mr chaffanbrass ought to have known better ought caveat emptor be just giving away money know great deal worse than must have given gentleman hundred fifty pound not have minded much ought to have have horse killed gone to dealer for instead of went to attorney oh mr chaffanbrass idea of going to attorney did then never have so much honest truth told in life by attorney said that did think 'd be born long enough to have known better than pleaded on own behalf that gentleman said horse be right 'gentleman exclaimed friend 'you go to gentleman for horse buy horse from gentleman without warranty then come to did ever hear of caveat emptor mr chaffanbrass what can do for ' be what friend attorney said to what came of mr chaffanbrass arbitration must say just that with horse eating head off meal at ever so much per week

doctrine of caveat emptor doe not encourage trade know how got to from mr finn be to see to morrow yes be very anxious to speak to what be use of wickerby hate seeing client what come of of course want to tell own story want to hear own story what good will own story do will tell one of two thing will swear did murder man be what will say can have effect upon one way other else will say that did must cripple altogether wo say that mr chaffanbrass there be knowing what will say man will go on swearing by god that be innocent till at last in moment of emotion break down out come truth in such case a in least want to know truth about murder be what public want to know because public be ignorant public must not wish to know anything of kind what must wish to get at be truth of evidence about murder man be to be hung not because committed murder a to positive knowledge be attainable because have be proved to have committed murder a to proof though be enough for hanging there must always be attached shadow of doubt be delighted to hang palmer know that killed cook learned man who knew more about than can know seemed to think that did now last man to give useful insight into evidence be prisoner in nineteen case out of twenty man tried for murder in country committed murder for be tried there really seems to be doubt in case dare say if there be only nineteen guilty out of twenty there must be one innocent why not mr phineas finn if be so burning with sense of injustice think that everybody must see a see be to be tried because on investigation everybody see just in different light in such case be unfortunate ca assist in liberating from misfortune see what be patent clear to that walked home on night without meddling with one ca see make others see because see manner of telling may do something if do mr wickerby be because be unfit for business if have gift of protesting well be to think innocent therefore to think guilty if be unprovided with such eloquence will believe disbelieve anything that client say to unless confess guilt in case service can be of little avail of course will see a asks have better meet there say at past ten whereupon mr wickerby wrote to governor of prison begging that phineas finn might be informed of visit phineas have now be in gaol between six seven week very fact of incarceration have nearly broken spirit two of

persisted in declaring that there be instruction one must give to counsellor whose duty must be to defend at trial mr chaffanbrass came at hour fixed with came mr wickerby old barrister bowed courteously a entered prison room attorney introduced two gentleman with more than courtesy of outer world be sorry to see here mr finn said barrister be bad lodging mr chaffanbrass term will soon be over be thinking good deal more of next abode have to be thought of certainly said barrister let hope that may be that must wish to be service will not be wanting to make so be doing can mr finn said mr wickerby mr chaffanbrass said phineas there be one special thing want to do old man having own idea a to what be coming laid one of hand over other bowed head looked meek want to make men believe that be innocent of crime be better than mr chaffanbrass expected trust that may succeed in making twelve men believe said comparatively care straw for twelve men be not to especially that be anxious that must address will be bounden duty mr finn can well believe sir that though have be bred lawyer may not altogether understand nature of advocate duty to client must wish something more to be done than what intimate duty of advocate defending prisoner be to get verdict of acquittal if can to use own discretion in making attempt want something more to be attempted even if in struggle something le be achieved have known men to be so acquitted that man in court believed to be guilty doubt such men have probably owed much to advocate be not such debt wish to owe know own innocence mr chaffanbrass take that for granted said mr wickerby to be matter of astonishment that human being must believe to have committed murder be lost in surprise when remember that be here simply because walked home from club with loaded stick in pocket magistrate suppose thought guilty did not think about mr finn went by evidence quarrel position in street at time colour of coat wore that of coat worn by man whom lord fawn saw in street doctor evidence a to blow by man be killed nature of weapon carried put thing together be enough to entitle public to demand that jury must decide did say be guilty only said that circumstance be sufficient to justify trial if thought innocent must not have sent here yes must if evidence required that must do so will not argue about mr chaffanbrass certainly not mr finn here be to morrow will be tried for life life will be nothing to unless can be made clear to world be innocent must be sooner hung for with certainty at heart that england on next day must ring with assurance of innocence than be acquitted afterwards be looked upon a murderer phineas when be thus speaking have stepped out into middle of room stood with head thrown back right hand forward mr chaffanbrass who be ugly dirty old man who have always piqued on being indifferent to appearance found struck by beauty grace of man whom now saw for first time be struck too by client eloquence though have expressly declared to attorney that be duty to be superior to such influence oh mr chaffanbrass for love of heaven let there be quibbling never quibble hope mr finn subterfuge escaping by side wind advantage taken of little form objection taken to that a though delay must avail anything character will go great way hope must go for nothing though one must speak word for still be innocent of course truth will be known day be not so sure of mr finn will certainly be known day that must not be known a yet be misfortune in defending must have hurl defiance at accuser have stick in pocket having heretofore be concerned with ruffian in street did quarrel with man having be insulted by at club coat wore be such a say doe make murderer of somebody did deed that somebody must probably say that say sir when be known will be found to have be skulking in street will have thrown away weapon will have be secret in movement will have hidden face have be murderer in more than deed when came to in morning did seem to be murderer have life be like that who have really known can not believe have be guilty who have not known do believe will live to learn error then sat down listened patiently while old lawyer described to nature of case wherein lay danger wherein what hope there be of safety there be evidence against other than circumstantial evidence judge jury be wont to be unwilling to accept such when uncorroborated a sufficient in case of life death unfortunately in case circumstantial evidence be very strong against on other hand character a to men of great mark must speak with enthusiasm must be made to stand very high must not have made to stand higher than be said phineas a to opinion of world afterwards mr chaffanbrass went on to say of must take chance surely might fight better for living than friend must do for after death must believe in mr finn that verdict of acquittal from jury be one object that must have before one object will have before be verdict of public said phineas be treated with so much injustice in being thought murderer that can hardly add anything to by hanging when mr chaffanbrass left prison walked back with mr wickerby to attorney chamber in hatton garden lingered for awhile on viaduct expressing opinion of client be not bad fellow wickerby very good sort of fellow mr chaffanbrass never did never will express opinion of own a to guilt innocence of client till after trial be over have sometimes felt a though must give blood out of vein to save man never felt in way more strongly than do now will make very unhappy know if go against said mr wickerby people think that special branch of profession into have chanced to fall be very low one know whether if world be before again must allow to drift into exclusive practice in criminal court have be very useful life mr chaffanbrass often feel continued barrister paying attention to attorney last remark that work touch heart more nearly than doe that of gentleman who have to deal with matter of property of high social claim people think be savage savage to witness can frighten witness mr chaffanbrass be just trick of trade that learn a girl learns note of piano there be nothing in forget next hour when man have be hung whom have striven to save do remember that good morning mr wickerby will be there little before ten perhaps may have to speak to chapter lxi beginning of trial task of seeing important trial at old bailey be by mean pleasant business unless be what denizen of court must call one of swell so a to enjoy privilege of being benchfellow with judge on seat of judgment even in case pleasure be not unalloyed have indeed gratification of seeing man whom world have be talking about for last nine day face to face of being seen in position cause to be acknowledged a man of mark intolerable stench of court horrid heat come up to there doubt a powerfully a fall on below then tedium of prolonged trial in point of interest be apt to be few far between grows upon till begin to feel that though prime minister who be out must murder prime minister who be in member of two cabinet be to be called in evidence must not attend trial though seat of honour next to judge be accorded to be wigged one who be performer be so insufferably long in part so arrogant in bearing so strike though doubtless fashion of working have be found to be efficient for purpose have in hand so uninteresting in repetition that first admire then question at last execrate imperturbable patience of judge who might a think force thing through in quarter of time without injury to justice will probably strike that length of trial be proportioned not to complicity to importance rather to public interest of case so that trial have be suggested of disappointed bloody minded ex prime minister must certainly take at least fortnight even though speaker of house of common lord chancellor have seen blow struck whereas collier may knock wife brain out in dark be sent to gallows with trial will not last three hour yet collier have to be hung if found guilty one think that life be improperly endangered by reckless haste whether life may not be improperly saved by more lengthened process be question honour of such benchfellowship can be accorded to few task becomes very tiresome when spectator have to enter court a ordinary mortal there be two mode open to of be subject to grievous penalty if be possessor of decent coat hat can scrape acquaintance with one concerned may get introduced to overworked greatly perplexed official under sheriff who will stave off if possible knowing even under sheriff can not make space elastic if introduction have be acknowledged a good will probably find seat for if persevere to end seat when obtained must be kept in possession from morning to evening fight must be renewed from day to day bench be hard space be narrow feel that under sheriff must prod with sword if ventured to sneeze to put to lip flask have in pocket then when benchfellows go out to lunch at half past one be left to eat dry sandwich without room for elbow feeling of unsatisfied ambition will pervade be very well to be friend of under sheriff if must have known judge have be cousin of real sheriff how different might have be with may be altogether independent a matter of right walk into open english court of law a one of british public will have to stand of course to commence standing very early in morning if intend to succeed in witnessing portion of performance when have made once good entrance a one of british public be apt to be good deal knocked about not only by public brother also by who have to keep avenue free for witness who will regard from first to last a disagreeable excrescence on officialities of work on hand upon whole may be better for perhaps to stay at home read record of affair a given in next day time impartial reporter judicious reader able editor between will preserve for kernel will save from necessity of having to deal with shell at trial there be among crowd who succeeded in entering court three person of acquaintance who have resolved to overcome various difficulty mr monk who have formerly be cabinet minister be seated on bench subject indeed to heat stench priviledged to eat lunch mr quintus slide of people banner who knew court well for in former day have worked many hour in a reporter have obtained good grace of under sheriff mr bunce with energy of british public have forced way in among crowd have managed to wedge near to dock so that might be able by hoist of neck to see lodger a stood at bar of three men bunce be assured that prisoner be innocent led to such assurance partly by belief in man partly by innate spirit of opposition to exercise of restrictive power mr quintus slide be certain of prisoner guilt gave considerable credit for having assisted in running down criminal seemed to be natural to mr quintus slide that man who have openly quarrelled with editor of people banner must come to gallows mr monk a phineas well knew have doubted have received suspected murderer into warmest friendship be made miserable even by doubt since circumstance of case have come to knowledge have weighed upon mind so a to sadden whole life be man who must not make reason subordinate to feeling if evidence against friend be strong enough to send friend for trial how must dare to discredit evidence because man be friend have visited phineas in prison phineas have accused of doubting need not answer unhappy man have said come unless be able to tell from heart that be sure of innocence there be person living who must comfort by such assurance a must do mr monk have thought about very much have not repeated visit at quarter past ten chief justice be on bench with second judge to help with lord distinguished commoner great city magnate crowding long seat between doorway court be full so that must say that head must not be made to appear phineas finn member for tankerville be in dock barrington erle who be there to see a one of great one of course told duchess of omnium night that phineas be thin pale in many respect altered man handsomer than ever bore well asked duchess very well very well indeed be there for six hour maintained same demeanour throughout never spoke once be when chaffanbrass began fight about jury what did say addressed judge interrupting slope who be arguing that man must make very good juryman declared that be not by wish that objection be raised against gentleman did judge say told to abide by counsel chief justice be very civil to indeed better than civil will have down to matching make ever so much of said duchess go too fast duchess for may have to hang poor phineas yet oh dear wish must use that word what did say told finn that a have thought fit to employ counsel for defence in doing have undoubtedly acted wisely must leave case to discretion of counsel then poor phineas be silenced spoke word bey lord ' said ' for part wish that first twelve men on list might be taken old chaffanbrass went on just same took two hour half before must swear jury mr erle taking altogether way be going nobody can even guess a yet there be ever so much delay besides about jury seemed that somebody have called phinees instead of phineas took hour begin with quarrel at club be to call first witness to morrow morning be to examine ratler about quarrel fitzgibbon monk believe old bouncer man who writes know heard took place so did have managed to escape that ca very well examine club will be called afterwards a to what took place at door will begin with ratler everybody know there be quarrel that mr bonteen have be drinking that behaved a badly a man must behave must all be proved duchess will tell what mr erle if if if end badly for mr finn will wear mourning to day of death will go to drawing room in mourning to show what think of lord chiltern who be also on bench took account of trial home to wife sister in portman square at time miss palliser be staying with three lady be together when account be brought to in house be taken a doctrine that phineas finn be innocent in presence of brother before sister in law visitor lady laura have learned to be silent on subject now contented with listening knowing that must relieve by speech when alone with lady chiltern never knew anything so tedious in life said master of brake hound have not done anything yet suppose have made speech said wife sir gregory grogram opened case a call very strong case made of never believe anything that lawyer say when have wig on head fee in hand prepare beforehand to regard a mere word supplied at so much thousand know will say think most likely to forward own view upon word put very strongly brought within so very short space of time bonteen finn left club within minute of other bonteen must have be at top of passage five minute afterwards phineas at moment must not have be above two hundred yard from there can be doubt of oswald mean to say that be going against exclaimed lady chiltern be not going way at present witness have not be examined so far suppose attorney general be right have got to prove so much doubt can prove can prove that man be killed with blunt weapon such a finn have can prove exactly at same time man be running to spot very like to finn that by route must not have be route by using must have placed at moment where man be seen how very dreadful said miss palliser yet feel that know be that other man said lady chiltern lady laura sat silent through listening with eye intent on brother face with elbow on table brow on hand did not speak word till found alone with sister in law then be hardly more than word violet will murder lady chiltern endeavoured to comfort telling that a yet have heard one side of case wretched woman only shook head know will murder said then when be too late will find out what have done illustration violet will murder on following day crowd in court be if possible greater so that benchfellows be very much squeezed indeed be impossible to exclude from high seat such men a mr ratler lord fawn when be required in court a witness not man who have obtained seat on first day be willing to be excluded on second even then witness be not called at once sir gregory grogram began work of day by saying that have heard that morning for first time that one of witness have be tampered with be word that unfortunately used by learned friend on other side alluded of course to lord fawn poor lord fawn sitting up there on seat of honour visible to world became very hot very uncomfortable then there arose vehement dispute between sir gregory assisted by sir simon old mr chaffanbrass who rejected with disdain assistance from gentler men who be with tampered with word must be recalled by honourable gentleman who be at head of bar have mr chaffanbrass declared that a alternative must pull court about ear must have be more than meant lord fawn have be invited not summoned to attend why in order that suspicion of guilt might be thrown on man unless knowledge be in lord fawn bosom there alone must justify such line of defence lord fawn have be attended by own solicitor might have brought attorney general with have so pleased there be great deal said on side something said also by judge at last sir gregory withdrew objectionable word substituted in lieu of assertion that witness have be indiscreetly questioned mr chaffanbrass must not for moment admit indiscretion bounced about in place tearing wig almost off head defying one in court judge submitted to mr chaffanbrass that have be indiscreet never contradicted bench yet lord said mr chaffanbrass at there be general titter throughout bar must claim privilege of conducting own practice according to own view in court be subject to bench in own chamber be subject only to law of land judge looking over spectacle said mild word about profession at large mr chaffanbrass twisting wig quite on one side so that nearly fell on mr serjeant birdbolt face muttered something a to having seen more work done in court than other living lawyer let rank be what might when little affair be over everybody felt that sir gregory have be vanquished mr ratler laurence fitzgibbon mr monk mr bouncer be examined about quarrel at club proved that quarrel have be very bitter quarrel agreed that mr bonteen have be wrong that prisoner have have cause for anger of three distinguished legislator statesman above named mr chaffanbrass refused to take slightest notice have question to put to said to mr ratler of course there be quarrel know that did ask question two of mr bouncer write book think mr bouncer do said mr bouncer with dignity now there be peculiarity in witness to mr chaffanbrass be so much opposed a assumption of dignity what sort of book mr bouncer write novel said mr bouncer feeling mr chaffanbrass must have be ignorant indeed of polite literature of day to make such question necessary mean fiction well yes fiction if like that word better like particularly have to find plot have mr bouncer paused moment yes yes said in writing novel be necessary to construct plot where do get from where do get from yes where do find take from french mostly mr bouncer became very red be that way english writer get plot sometimes perhaps ai french then well be wo undertake to say that wo undertake to say that be not french be relevant to case before mr chaffanbrass asked judge quite so lud have highly distinguished novelist before lud who a have reason to believe be intimately acquainted with french system of construction of plot be business french carry to perfection plot of novel must imagine be constructed in accordance with human nature certainly said mr bouncer have murder in novel sometimes said mr bouncer who have done many murder in time did ever know french novelist have premeditated murder committed by man who must not possibly have conceived murder ten minute before committed with whom cause of murder anteceded murder more than ten minute mr bouncer stood thinking for while will give time because answer to question from will be important testimony think do said mr bouncer who in confusion have be quite unable to think of plot of single novel if there be french plot must not be plot that must borrow certainly not said mr bouncer did ever read poetry mr bouncer oh yes read great deal of poetry shakespeare perhaps mr bouncer did not condescend to do more than nod head there be murder described in hamlet be that supposed by poet to have be devised suddenly must say not so must mr bouncer do remember arrangement for murder in macbeth took little time in concocting did doubt did when othello murdered desdemona creeping up to in sleep have be thinking of for time suppose have do ever read english novel a well a french mr bouncer unfortunate author again nodded head when amy robsart be lured to death there be time given to preparation eh of course there be of course there be eugene aram when murdered man in bulwer novel turned matter over in mind before did be thinking long time about believe thinking about long time rather think be great master of human nature men who knew human heart did not venture to describe secret murder a coming from man brain without premeditation not that can remember such also be impression now bethink of murder be almost a sudden a be supposed to have be did dutch smuggler murder scotch lawyer in moment a be dirk hatteraick did murder glossop in antiquary very suddenly did from passion just so mr bouncer there be plot there be there arrangement no secret creeping up to victim escape even be chained so be chained like dog like dog flew at enemy if understand then mr bouncer must not dare so to violate probability in novel a to produce murderer to public who must contrive secret hidden murder contrive execute within quarter of hour mr bouncer after minute consideration said that thought must not do so mr bouncer said mr chaffanbrass be uncommonly obliged to excellent friend sir gregory for having given advantage of evidence chapter lxii lord fawn evidence crowd of witness be heard on second day after mr chaffanbrass have done with mr bouncer none of be of much interest to public three doctor be examined a to state of dead man head when be picked up a to nature of instrument with have probably be killed fact of phineas finn life preserver be proved in middle of begged that court must save little trouble a be quite ready to acknowledge that have walked home with short bludgeon be then produced in pocket must acknowledge great deal if must let said mr chaffanbrass acknowledge quarrel acknowledge walk home at night acknowledge bludgeon acknowledge grey coat happened towards close of second day have not then reached grey coat question of grey coat be commenced on third morning on saturday day a be well known must be opened with examination of lord fawn anxiety to hear lord fawn undergo penance be intense have be greatly increased by conviction that mr chaffanbrass must resent upon charge made by attorney general a to tampering with witness will tamper with by bye mr chaffanbrass have whispered to mr wickerby whispered threat have be spread abroad on table before mr chaffanbrass when took place in court on saturday be laid heavy grey coat on opposite side of table just before solicitor general be laid grey coat of much lighter material when lord fawn saw two coat a took seat on bench heart failed be hardly allowed to seat before be called upon to be sworn sir simon slope who be to examine took for granted that lordship must give evidence from place on bench to mr chaffanbrass objected be very well aware said that practice be usual did not doubt that in time have examined hundred of witness from bench in nineteen case out of twenty there must be objection to practice in case noble lord must have to give evidence not only a to what have seen a to what then saw must be expedient that must see colour a nearly a possible in same light a jury must do if stood in witness box there might arise question of identity in speaking of must be well that noble lord must be a near a possible to thing person to be identified be afraid that must trouble noble lord to come down from elysium of bench whereupon lord fawn descended be sworn in at witness box treatment from sir simon slope be be due from solicitor general to distinguished peer who be member of same government a sir simon put question so a almost to reassure witness very quickly only too quickly obtained from information be needed on side of prosecution lord fawn when have left club have seen mr bonteen mr finn preparing to follow have gone alone have never seen mr bonteen since walked very slowly down into curzon street bolton row when there a be about to cross road at top of clarges street a believed just a be crossing street saw man come at very fast pace out of mew run into bolton row opposite to clarges street from thence hurry very quickly towards passage separate garden of devonshire lansdowne house have already be proved that have phineas finn retraced step after erle fitzgibbon have turned back upon shortest certainly most private way to spot on lord fawn have seen man must have be by mew in question lord fawn went on to say that man wore grey coat a far a must judge be such coat a sir simon now showed must not at identify prisoner must not say whether man have seen be a tall a prisoner thought that a far a must judge there be not much difference in height have not thought of mr finn when saw man hurrying along have troubled mind about man be end of lord fawn evidence in chief must gladly have prolonged to close of day must thereby have postponed coming horror of cross examination there be in clutch of odious dirty little man hating little man despising because be dirty nothing better than old bailey barrister yet fearing with so intense fear mr chaffanbrass smiled at victim for moment be quite soft with a cat be soft with mouse reporter must hardly hear first question believe be under secretary of state lord fawn acknowledged fact now be case in palmy day of hero former career have filled very office lord fawn now occupied that lord fawn have at time filled similar position in department fact mr chaffanbrass extracted from witness not without appearance of unwillingness be produced however altogether by natural antagonism of victim to persecutor for mr chaffanbrass even when asking simplest question in simplest word even when abstaining from sarcasm of tone under witness be wont to feel that be being flayed alive must so look at man a to create antagonism witness must conceal in asking man name age calling must produce impression that man be unwilling to tell anything that therefore jury be entitled to regard evidence with suspicion then continued mr chaffanbrass must have met frequently in intercourse of business suppose did sometimes sometimes belonged to same party did sit in same house know that lord know very well what house sat in suppose must condescend to be acquainted with even commoner who held very office hold now belonged to same club with go much to club said lord fawn quarrel of have heard so much took place at club in presence lord fawn assented in fact can not have be intimately accurately acquainted with personal appearance of gentleman who be now on trial be that so never be intimate with mr chaffanbrass looked up at jury shook head sadly be not presuming lord fawn that so far derogated a to be intimate with gentleman a to whom however will be able to show by by that be chosen friend of very man under whose mastership now serve ask whether appearance be not familiar to lord fawn at last said that be do know height what must say be height lord fawn altogether refused to give opinion on subject acknowledged that must not be surprised if be told that mr finn be over six foot high in fact consider tall man lord there be can look at be tall man lord fawn did look must give answer will undertake to say lord that there be person in court at moment except who must be ready to express opinion on oath that mr finn be tall man mr chief constable just let prisoner step out from dock for moment wo run away must have lordship opinion a to mr finn height poor phineas when be said clutched hold of front of dock a though determined that nothing main force must make exhibit to court in manner proposed need for exhibition passed away know that be very tall man said lord fawn know that be very tall man know there can be doubt about be a say very tall man with whose personal appearance have long be familiar ask again lord whether have not be long familiar with personal appearance after further agonising delay lord fawn at last acknowledged that have be so now will get on like house on fire said mr chaffanbrass still house did not burn very quickly string of question be then asked a to attitude of man who have be seen coming out of mew wearing grey great coat a to attitude a to general likeness to phineas finn in answer to lord fawn must only say that have not observed man attitude have certainly not thought of prisoner when saw man lord said mr chaffanbrass very solemnly look at late friend colleague remember that life depends probably on accuracy of memory man saw murdered mr bonteen with experience in such matter be great with skill be something can not stand against fact be for to show that man client be not one same person must do so by mean of evidence by sifting what say to day by comparing with what have already said on other occasion understand now to say that there be nothing in remembrance of man saw independently of colour of coat to guide to opinion whether man be be not one same with prisoner in crowd then assembled there be man more thoroughly under influence of conscience a to conduct than be lord fawn in reference to evidence be called upon to give not only must idea of endangering life of human being have be horrible to sanctity of oath be imperative to be essentially truth speaking man if only knew how to speak truth must have sacrificed much to establish innocence of phineas finn not for love of phineas for love of innocence not even to do must have lied be bad witness by slowness by certain unsustained pomposity be natural to have already taught jury to think that be anxious to convict prisoner two men in court two only thoroughly understood condition mr chaffanbrass saw intended without slightest scruple to take advantage of chief justice saw be already resolving how must set witness right with jury did think of mr finn at time said lord fawn in answer to last question so understand man did strike a being tall think that did yet in evidence gave before magistrate in bow street think expressed very strong opinion that man saw running out of mew be mr finn lord fawn be again silent be asking lordship question to must request answer here be time report of examination with can refresh memory be of course aware that be mainly on evidence a here reported that client stand there in jeopardy of life be not aware of anything of kind said witness very well will drop that then such be evidence whether important not important of course lordship can take what time please for recollection lord fawn tried very hard to recollect must not look at newspaper have be handed to can not remember what word used seems to that thought must have be mr finn because have be told that mr finn must have be there by running round surely lord must not have sufficed to induce to give such evidence a be there reported colour of coat said lord fawn in fact went by colour of coat that only then there have be quarrel lord be not that begging question mr bonteen quarrelled with mr finn mr bonteen be murdered by man a believe whom saw at certain spot therefore identified man whom saw a mr finn be that so did identify at rate do so now putting aside grey coat there be nothing to make now think that man mr finn be one same come lord on behalf of man life be in great jeopardy be in great jeopardy because of evidence given by before magistrate be ashamed to speak truth openly though be at variance with what may have said before with ill advised haste lord be proper must be treated in way said witness appealing to bench mr chaffanbrass said judge again looking at barrister over spectacle think be stretching privilege of position too far will have to stretch further yet lord lordship in evidence before magistrate gave on oath decided opinion that man saw be mr finn on evidence mr finn be committed for murder let say openly now to jury when mr finn be on trial for life before court for hope in life before country whether think a then thought on what ground think so think so because of quarrel because of grey coat for other reason for other reason only ground for suggesting identity be grey coat quarrel said lord fawn lord in giving evidence a to identity fear that understand meaning of word lord fawn looked up at judge judge on occasion said nothing at rate have from at present that there be nothing in appearance of man saw like to of mr finn except colour of coat think there be said lord fawn slowly then there occurred scene in court doubt be gratifying to spectator may in part have repaid for weariness of whole proceeding mr chaffanbrass while lord fawn be still in witness box requested permission for certain man to stand forward put on coat be lying on table before coat being in truth identical garment mr meager have brought home with on morning of murder man be mr wickerby clerk mr scruby put on coat seemed to fit well mr chaffanbrass then asked permission to examine mr scruby explaining that much time might be saved declaring that have one question to ask after difficulty permission be given mr scruby be asked height mr scruby be five foot eight inch have be accurately measured on previous day with reference to question then examination of lord fawn be resumed mr chaffanbrass referred to very irregular interview to have so improperly enticed witness in mr wickerby chamber for long time sir gregory grogram declared that must not permit allusion to what have taken place at most improper conference conference must not stigmatize in sufficiently strong language mr chaffanbrass smiling blandly smiling very blandly for suggested that impropriety of conference let have be ever so abominable did not prevent fact of conference that be manifestly within right in alluding to suppose lord that lord fawn have confessed in mr wickerby chamber that have murdered mr bonteen have since repented of confession must mr camperdown mr wickerby who be present must be now debarred from stating confession in evidence because in deference to fanciful rule of etiquette lord fawn must not have be there mr chaffanbrass at last prevailed evidence be resumed saw scruby wear coat in mr wickerby chamber lord fawn said that must not identify coat will take care to have identified will get great deal out of coat yet saw that man wear coat like yes did see now yes do doe remind of figure of man saw come out of mew lord fawn paused ca make move about here a did in mr wickerby room remembering that a must do doe look like man remember what man looked like did not tell in mr wickerby room that mr scruby with grey coat on be like figure of man question of nature be prolonged for near hour during sir gregory made more than one attempt to defend witness from weapon of joint enemy lord fawn at last admitted that have acknowledged resemblance did in faint ambiguous fashion acknowledge in present evidence lord said mr chaffanbrass a allowed lord fawn to go down have doubt taken note of mr scruby height whereupon judge nodded head chapter lxiii mr chaffanbrass for defence case for prosecution be completed on saturday evening mr bunce having be examined a last witness on side be only called upon to say that lodger have be in habit of letting in out of house at hour with latch key insisted on saying more told judge jury barrister that if thought that mr finn have murdered anybody did know anything about world in general whereupon mr chaffanbrass said that must like to ask question two with consummate flattery extracted from opinion of lodger have known for year thought that of gentleman ever be born be least likely to do bloody minded action mr chaffanbrass be perhaps right in thinking that evidence might be a serviceable a of lord countess during sunday trial be a matter of course talk of town poor lord fawn shut up be seen by one conduct evidence be discussed everywhere at club be thought that have escaped a well a must be expected felt that have be disgraced for ever there be very common opinion that mr chaffanbrass have admitted too much when have declared that man whom lord fawn have seen be doubtless murderer to mind of men generally seemed to be le evident that man so seen must have done deed than phineas finn must have be man be probable that there must be two men going about in grey coat in exactly same vicinity at exactly same hour of night then evidence lord fawn have given before magistrate be to world at large at rate a convincing a given in court jury must of course be instructed to regard only latter whereas general public must naturally be guided by two combined at club be certainly believed that case be going against prisoner have read of course said duchess of omnium to husband a sat with observer in hand on sunday morning sunday paper be full of report be enjoying very extended circulation wish must not think so much about said duke be very easily said how be one to help thinking about of course be thinking about know about coat belonged to man where mealyus be lodging will not talk about coat glencora if mr finn did commit murder be right that must be convicted if did must be doubly right that must be acquitted jury will have mean of arriving at conclusion without prejudice can not have therefore must be prepared to take verdict a correct if find guilty verdict will be damnable false said duchess whereupon duke turned away in anger resolved that must say nothing more about trial resolution however be compelled to break before trial be over what do think about mr asked other duke know what to think only hope that may be acquitted of course whether guilty innocent well yes if be acquitted will believe to have be innocent grace think be a unwilling to think a be mr erle be thus that people spoke of with exception of very few who have known phineas be anxious for acquittal though must not bring to believe that innocent man have be put in peril of life on monday morning trial be recommenced whole day be taken up by address mr chaffanbrass made to jury began by telling history of coat lay before promising to prove by evidence detail stated be not intention said to accuse one of murder be business to defend prisoner not to accuse others a must prove to two person have be arrested a soon a murder have be discovered two person totally unknown to other who be never for moment supposed to have acted together suspicion of police have in first instance pointed not to client to other man that other man have also quarrelled with mr bonteen that other man be now in custody on charge of bigamy chiefly through instrumentality of mr bonteen who have be friend of victim of supposed bigamist with accusation of bigamy must have nothing to do must ask to take cognisance of quarrel a well a of quarrel at club then named that formerly popular preacher rev mr emilius explained that must prove that man who have incurred suspicion of police in first instance have during night of murder be so circumstanced a to have be able to use coat produced must prove also mr be of precisely same height a man whom have seen wearing coat god forbid that must bring accusation of murder against man on such slight testimony if evidence a grounded on coat be slight against emilius how must prevail at against client two coat be a different a chalk from cheese one being what must be called gentleman fashionable walking coat other wrap rascal of such fellow a be mr meager yet lord fawn who attempted to identify prisoner only by coat must give opinion a to be coat have seen lord fawn who have found to be debarred by conscience from repeating opinion have given before magistrate a to identity of phineas finn with man have seen did tell that figure of man be similar to figure of who have worn coat on saturday in presence of man in street have therefore be like mr emilius must not in least have resembled prisoner mr chaffanbrass must not tell jury that point bore strongly against mr emilius took upon to assert that be quite sufficient to snap asunder thin thread of circumstantial evidence by client be connected with murder great deal more be said about lord fawn be not complimentary to nobleman lordship be honest slow man who have doubtless meant to tell truth who doe not understand meaning of what say when swore before magistrate that thought must identify client with man in street really meant that thought that there must be identity because believed from other reason that mr finn be man in street mr bonteen have be murdered according to lord fawn thinking have probably be murdered by mr finn be also probable to that mr bonteen have be murdered by man in street came thus to conclusion that prisoner be man in street in fact a far a process of identifying be concerned lordship evidence be altogether in favour of prisoner figure seen by must suppose be figure of short man not of one tall commanding in presence a be that of prisoner there be many other point on mr chaffanbrass insisted at great length chiefly perhaps on improbability might say impossibility that plot for murder so contrived must have entered into man head have be completed executed within few minute under hypothesis compatible with allegation of prosecution can be conceived that murder must have be contemplated by client before quarrel at club gentleman murderer have be at work for day have examined spot measured distance have dogged step of victim on previous night in shade of dark doorway have watched from club have hurried by secret path to spot have appointed for deed can man doubt that murder have thus be committed let who will have be murderer if so then client must not have done deed much have be made of word spoken at club door be probable be possible that man intending to commit murder must declare how easily must do display weapon intended to use evidence given a to part of night work be contended altogether in prisoner favour then spoke of life preserver gave rather long account of manner in phineas finn have once taken two garotters prisoner in street lasted till great men on bench trooped out to lunch then mr chaffanbrass who have be speaking for nearly four hour retired to small room there drank pint of port wine while be doing so mr serjeant birdbolt spoke word to only shook head snarled be telling at moment how quick may be resolve of eager mind for be convinced that idea of attacking mr bonteen have occurred to phineas finn after have displayed life preserver at club door be telling also how impossible be for dull conscientious man to give accurate evidence a to what have seen for be convinced that lord fawn have seen phineas finn in street to human being have expressed opinion must express unless client must be hung after lunch occupied nearly three hour in giving to jury of course to whole assembled court detail of about two dozen case in apparently strong circumstantial evidence have be wrong in tendency in of case quoted person tried have be acquitted in convicted afterwards pardoned in one pardoned after many year of punishment in one poor victim have be hung on insisted with pathetic eloquence certainly must not have be expected from appearance spoke with tear in eye real unaffected tear of misery of wretched juryman who in performance of duty have be led into so frightful error through whole of long recital seemed to feel fatigue when have done with list of judicial mistake about five o'clock in afternoon went on to make what called very few remark necessary a to evidence on next day proposed to produce a to prisoner character ventured to think evidence a to character of such nature so strong so convincing so complete so free from objection have never yet be given in criminal court at six o'clock completed speech be computed that old man have be on leg very nearly seven hour be said of afterwards that be taken home speechless by one of daughter immediately put to bed that roused about eight ate dinner drank bottle of port in bedroom that then slept refusing to stir even when be waked till past nine in morning that then scrambled into clothes breakfasted got down to court in hour at ten o'clock be in place nobody knew that be worse for previous day exertion be on tuesday fifth day of trial upon whole perhaps most interesting long array of distinguished person of woman a well a men be brought up to give to jury opinion a to character of mr finn mr low be first who having be tutor when be studying at bar knew longer than other londoner then came countryman laurence fitzgibbon barrington erle others of own party who have be intimate with men too from opposite side of house be brought up sir orlando drought among number of whom said that have known prisoner well from knowledge must have considered impossible that must have become murderer two last called be lord cantrip mr monk one of whom be other have be cabinet minister before came lady cantrip lady chiltern whom once knew a violet effingham whom very prisoner have in early day fondly hoped to make wife who be still young beautiful who have never before entered public court there have of course be much question a to witness to be selected duchess of omnium have be anxious to be one duke have forbidden telling wife that really did not know man that be carried away by foolish enthusiasm lady cantrip when asked have at once consented have known phineas finn when have served under husband have liked much then what other woman tongue must be brought to speak of man softness tender bearing be out of question that lady laura kennedy must appear did not even propose when brother with unnecessary sternness told must not be so then wife looked at will go said lord chiltern if feel equal to seems to be nonsense say that be important will go said violet with eye full of tear afterwards when sister in law besought to be generous in testimony only smiled a assented must generosity go beyond hers lord chiltern preceded wife have said known mr finn well have loved dearly have eaten with drank with have ridden with have lived with have quarrelled with know a do own right hand then stretched forth arm with palm extended irrespectively of evidence in case must not have thought to be man likely to commit crime asked serjeant birdbolt be quite sure from knowledge of man that must not commit murder said lord chiltern care what evidence be then came wife certainly be pretty sight to see a husband led up to box stood close beside a gave evidence there be many there who knew much of history of life who knew passage in of early love for tale have of course be told when be whispered about lady chiltern be to be examined a witness ear be at first strained to hear word be audible in corner of court without effort need hardly be said that be treated with greatest deference on side answered question very quietly apparently without nervousness yes have known mr finn long intimately have very greatly valued friendship did so still a much a ever yes have known for year in circumstance thought justified in saying that understood character regarded a man who be brave tender hearted soft in feeling manly in disposition to be quite incredible that must have committed crime such a knew to be man prone to forgive offence of sweet nature be pretty too to watch unwonted gentleness of old chaffanbrass a asked question carefully abstained from putting one must pain sir gregory said that have heard evidence with great pleasure that have question to ask then stepped down again took husband arm left court amidst hum of almost affectionate greeting what must have thought a stood there within dock looking at listening to there have be month in life when have almost trusted that must succeed in winning that fair highly born wealthy woman for wife though have failed now knew that have never really touched heart that have always loved man whom though have rejected time after time because of danger of way have at last married must have be pleasant to even in peril to hear from own lip how well have esteemed left court with veil down must not catch eye lord chiltern nodded to in old pleasant familiar way a though to bid take courage to tell that thing must even yet be well with evidence given by lady cantrip husband by mr monk be equally favourable have always regarded a perfect gentleman lord cantrip have found to be devoted to service of country modest intelligent high spirited perhaps few word fell from mr monk be a strong a be spoken be man whom have delighted to call friend have be happy to think that service have be at disposal of country sir gregory grogram replied seemed to that evidence be a have left must be for jury to decide under such direction a lordship might be pleased to give how far evidence brought guilt home to prisoner must use rhetoric in pushing case against prisoner must submit to that learned friend have not shown that acquaintance with human nature gentleman undoubtedly possessed in arguing that there have lacked time for conception execution of crime then at considerable length strove to show that mr chaffanbrass have be unjustly severe upon lord fawn be late in afternoon when sir gregory have finished speech judge charge be reserved for sixth day chapter lxiv confusion in court on following morning be observed that before judge took seat mr chaffanbrass entered court with manner much more brisk than be expected from now that own work be done a matter of course must be there to hear charge almost equally a matter of course must be languid silent cross unenergetic who knew be sure when saw bearing on morning that intended to do something more before charge be given judge entered court nearly hour later than usual be observed with surprise that be followed by duke of omnium mr chaffanbrass be on foot before chief justice have taken seat judge be first to speak be observed that held scrap of paper in hand that barrister held similar scrap then man in court knew that message have come suddenly by wire be informed mr chaffanbrass that wish to address court before begin charge yes lud be afraid lud that will have to ask ludship to delay charge for day to subject jury to very great inconvenience of prolonged incarceration for week either to do to call upon jury to acquit prisoner venture to assert on own peril that jury can convict prisoner after hearing read hold in hand then mr chaffanbrass paused a though expecting that judge must speak judge said not word sat looking at old barrister over spectacle eye be turned upon phineas finn who up to moment have heard nothing of new tidings who did not in least know on what be grounded singularly confident almost insolently confident assertion mr chaffanbrass have made in favour on effect be altogether distressing have borne trying week with singular fortitude having stood there in place of shame hour after hour day after day expecting doom have be to a lifetime of torture have become almost numb from weariness of position agonising strain upon mind gaoler have offered seat from day to day have always refused preferring to lean upon rail gaze upon court have almost ceased to hope for anything except end of have lost count of day have begun to feel that trial be eternity of torture in at night must not sleep during sunday after mass have slept day then have begun again when tuesday came hardly knew how long have be since vacant sunday now heard advocate declare without knowing on ground declaration be grounded that trial must be postponed that jury must be instructed to acquit telegram have reached only morning continued mr chaffanbrass beealyus have house door key made in prague have mould in possession will bring man who made key to england ' now lud case in hand of police a against man mealyus emilius a have chosen to call broke down altogether on presumption that must not have let in out of house in have put to bed on night of murder now propose to prove that have prepared with mean of doing so have done so after fashion be conclusive a to having required key for guilty purpose assert that ludship can not allow case to go to jury without taking cognisance of telegram go further say that twelve men a twelve human being with heart in bosom ordinary intelligence at command can not ignore message even must ludship insist upon doing so with energy at disposal then there be scene in court appeared that le than four message have be received from prague to same effect one have be addressed by madame goesler to friend duchess message have caused duke appearance on scene have brought telegram direct to old bailey chief justice now held in hand lawyer clerk who have accompanied madame goesler have telegraphed to governor of gaol to mr wickerby to attorney general sir gregory rising with telegram in hand stated that have received same information see said that at alters evidence a against prisoner let evidence go to jury then said mr chaffanbrass with such observation a lordship may choose to make on telegram will be contented have already got other man in prison on charge of bigamy must not take notice of message in charging jury mr chaffanbrass said judge have come a far a know from energy of warm friend from hearty friendship with seemed yesterday that gentleman prisoner at bar have inspired so many men woman of high character prof nothing be assertion where must be mr chaffanbrass if must appear hereafter that assertion be fictitious prepared purposely to aid escape of criminal defy to ignore lord can only suggest mr chaffanbrass continued judge that must obtain consent of gentleman on other side to postponement of charge then spoke out foreman of jury be proposed that must be locked up till somebody must come from prague that then trial must be recommenced system said foreman under middlesex jury be chosen for service in city be known to be most horribly cruel cruelty to juryman such a have never even be heard of then most irregular word be spoken one of juryman declared that be quite willing to believe telegram one belief said mr chaffanbrass then chief justice scolded juryman sir gregory grogram scolded mr chaffanbrass seemed a though rule of court be to be set at defiance will learned friend say that doe believe asked mr chaffanbrass believe disbelieve can not affect evidence said sir gregory then send case to jury said mr chaffanbrass seemed that everybody be talking mr wickerby attorney tried to explain to prisoner over bar of dock not in lowest possible voice chief justice became angry guardian of silence of court bestirred energetically lud said mr chaffanbrass maintain that be proper that prisoner must be informed of purport of telegram mercy demand justice a well phineas finn however did not understand a have known nothing about latch key of house in northumberland street something however must be done chief justice be of opinion that although preparation of latch key in prague must not really affect evidence against prisoner although fact against prisoner must not be altered let manufacture of special key be ever so clearly proved nevertheless jury be entitled to have before fact now tendered in evidence before must be called upon to give verdict that therefore must submit in service of country to very serious additional inconvenience must be called upon to endure sundry of jury altogether disagreed with became loud in anger have already be locked up for week be quite prepared to give verdict said one judge again scolded very severely a attorney general did at last assent a unfortunate juryman have power in matter so be at last arranged trial must be postponed till time must be given for madame goesler blacksmith to reach london from prague if matter be interesting to public before became doubly interesting now be of course known to everybody madame goesler have undertaken journey to bohemia a many supposed roving tour through wilder part of unknown europe poland hungary principality for instance with object of looking for evidence to save life of phineas finn grandly romantic tale be told of wit wealth beauty story be published of duke of omnium will only not exactly true story late duke have left everything at disposal be hinted that have be privately married just before duke death of course madame goesler became very popular blacksmith from prague who have made key be expected with enthusiasm almost led to preparation for public reception yet let blacksmith from prague be ever so minute in evidence a to key let be made a clear a running water mealyus have caused to be constructed for in prague key must open door of house in northumberland street fact a proved at trial must not be at changed lawyer be much at variance with opinion on matter thinking that judge have be altogether wrong in delaying charge according to must not have allowed mr chaffanbrass to have read telegram in court charge must have be given sentence of court must have be pronounced if verdict of guilty be given home secretary must then have granted respite till coming of blacksmith have extended respite to pardon if advised that circumstance of latch key rendered doubtful propriety of verdict others however maintained that in way grievous penalty must be inflicted on man who by general consent be now held to be innocent not only must by arrangement of circumstance have be left for prolonged period under agony of condemnation by necessity of case must lose seat for tankerville must be imperative upon house to declare vacant by own action seat held by man condemned to death for murder pardon from queen from home secretary must absolve house from duty house a house of parliament must only recognise verdict of jury a to man guilt queen of course might pardon whom pleased pardon from queen must remove guilt implied by sentence many went much further than be prepared to prove be once condemned must not afterwards sit in house even if re elected now there be unquestionably intense desire since arrival of telegram phineas finn must retain seat may be question whether must not have be most popular man in house must have sat there on day after telegram arrived attorney general have declared many others have declared with that information about latch key did not in least affect evidence a given against mr finn must have be possible to convict other man merely because have surreptitiously caused door key of house in lived to be made for how must new information have be received have lord fawn sworn unreservedly that man have seen running out of mew have be phineas finn be acknowledged that latch key must not be accepted a sufficient evidence against mealyus nevertheless information conveyed by telegram altogether changed opinion of public a to guilt innocence of phineas finn life now might have be insured a against gallows at very low rate be felt that jury must convict be much more pitied in being subjected to prolonged incarceration than even twelve unfortunate men who have felt sure that wednesday must have be last day of unmerited martyrdom phineas in prison be materially circumstanced precisely a have be before trial be supplied with profusion of luxury must have comforted be allowed to receive visitor must see one sister except that have one interview with mr low

have be ill during last few day have be whispered through court that have not slept at night since adjournment of court there have be bulletin a to health everybody knew that confinement be beginning to tell upon on present occasion proceeding of day be opened by attorney general who began by apologising to jury apology to jury have be very frequent during trial apology have called forth fresh grumbling on occasion foreman expressed hope that legislature must consider condition of thing made possible that twelve gentleman concerned extensively in business must be confined for fourteen day because mistake have be made in evidence a to murder then chief justice bowing down head looking at over rim of spectacle with expression of wisdom that almost convinced told that be aware of mistake in evidence might become duty on evidence have heard further evidence must hear to acquit prisoner at bar not on account must there have be mistake erroneous procedure in court other than such error on part of prosecution in regard to alleged guilt of prisoner a be general special duty of juror to remedy then endeavoured to reconcile to sacrifice by describing importance glorious british nature of position lord said one of juror if be salesman have got partner only very young 'un 'd know what be to be kept out of business for fortnight then that salesman wagged head put handkerchief up to eye there be pity also for in court after that attorney general went on learned friend on other side nodded to mr chaffanbrass have got further evidence to submit to on behalf of prisoner who be still on trial before now addressed with view of explaining to that if evidence must be such a believed must become duty on behalf of crown to join with learned friend in requesting court to direct jury to acquit prisoner not le on account must be duty of jury to form own opinion a to credibility of fresh evidence must be brought before there wo be much doubt about credibility said mr chaffanbrass rising in place be not bit afraid about credibility gentleman think that need be afraid must understand gentleman that be now going on calling evidence for defence last witness be right honourable mr monk who spoke a to character next will be bohemian blacksmith named praska peter praska who naturally ca speak word of english unfortunately ca speak word of german have got interpreter daresay will

bludgeon bludgeon be produced be handed up to bench inspected by chief justice instrument excited great interest men rose on tiptoe to look at even from distance prime minister be envied because for moment be placed in hand a large eyed little boy who have found be not yet six year old there be difficulty in perfecting thread of evidence be not held to be proper to administer oath to infant in roundabout way be proved that identical bludgeon have be picked up in garden there be elaborate surveyor plan produced of passage garden wall with step on be supposed that blow have be struck spot be indicated on child have said that have found weapon then certain worker in leather be questioned who agreed in asserting that such instrument a handed to have ever be made in england after two scientific chemist told jury that have minutely examined knob of instrument with reference to discovery of human blood in vain be however of opinion that man might very readily have be killed by instrument without effusion of blood at moment of blow seemed to jury to be le necessary a three four surgeon who have examined murdered man head have already told that in probability there have be no such effusion when judge went out to lunch at two o'clock jury be trembling a to fate for night fresh evidence however have be completed on return of court mr chaffanbrass said that must only speak very few word for few word must ask indulgence though knew to be irregular be speciality of trial everything in be irregular did not think that learned friend attorney general must dispute privilege attorney general said nothing mr chaffanbrass went on with little speech with took up greatest part of hour be thought to have be unnecessary a nearly that said be said again be sure to have be so said by judge be not business business of mr chaffanbrass to accuse man of murder of mr bonteen be not for to tell jury whether there be be not evidence on other man must be sent to trial be bounden duty in defence of client to explain to that collection of fact tending to criminate man when taken together made fair probability that man have committed crime rendered quite out of question that must declare client to be guilty did not believe that there be single person in court who be not now convinced of innocence of client be not permitted to to trust solely to belief be duty to show that of necessity must acquit client when mr chaffanbrass sat down attorney general waived right might have of further reply be half past three when judge began charge must said do best to enable jury to complete tedious duty so a to return to family on night indeed must certainly finish charge before rose from seat let hour be what might though time must be occupied by in going through evidence explaining circumstance of very singular trial might not be improbable that jury must be able to find verdict without great delay among there wo be delay at lord said suffering very irrational salesman poor man be again rebuked mildly chief justice continued charge a occupied four hour in delivery of by far greater part be taken up in recapitulating sifting evidence with careful reader if such there be have already be made too intimately acquainted account of here will be very short nature of circumstantial evidence be explained truth of much have be said in regard to such evidence by mr chaffanbrass admitted nevertheless must be impossible so said lordship to administer justice if guilt must never be held to have be proved by circumstantial evidence alone in case might not improbably seem to that gentleman who have so long stood before a prisoner at bar have be victim of most singularly untoward chain of circumstance from must have to be liberated must be at last liberated by chain of circumstance a singular be duty to inform now after have heard what might call double evidence that must not have given to a opinion that charge have be brought home against prisoner even have circumstance of bohemian key of foreign bludgeon never be brought to light did not mean to say that evidence have not justified trial thought that trial have be fully justified nevertheless have nothing arisen to point to possibility of guilt in man must not le have found bound in duty to explain to that thread of evidence against mr finn have be incomplete must rather say weight of have be to judgment insufficient be more intent on saying so much a be desirous of making understood that even have bludgeon still remained buried beneath leaf have manufacturer of key never be discovered great evil must not thought have fallen upon of punishing innocent instead of guilty that most awful evil of taking innocent blood in just attempt to punish murder by death a far a knew to best of belief that calamity have never fallen upon country in time administration of law be so careful of life that opposite evil be fortunately more common said so much because must not wish that case must be quoted hereafter a showing possible danger of circumstantial evidence have be case in evidence given a to character alone have be sufficient to make feel that circumstance seemed to affect prisoner injuriously must not be taken a establishing guilt now other imposing circumstance have be brought to light be sure that jury must have difficulty with verdict most frightful murder have doubt be committed in dead of night gentleman coming home from club have be killed probably by hand of one who have moved in company of gentleman plot have be made have probably be thought of for day week before have be executed with extreme audacity in order that enemy might be removed there must thought be little doubt that mr bonteen have be killed by instrument found in garden if so certainly have not be killed by prisoner who must not be supposed to have carried two bludgeon in pocket whose quarrel with murdered man have be so recent a to have admitted of preparation have heard story of mr meager grey coat of construction of duplicate key for mr meager house door be not for to tell on present occasion whether story evidence by have be supported tended to affix guilt elsewhere be beyond province to advert to such probability possibility undoubtedly circumstance might be taken by a assistance if assistance be needed in coming to conclusion on charge against prisoner gentleman said at last think will find difficulty in acquitting prisoner of murder laid to charge whereupon juryman put head together foreman without minute delay declared that be unanimous that found prisoner not guilty be of opinion said foreman mr finn must not have be put upon trial on such evidence a have be brought before necessity of liberating poor phineas from horror of position be too urgent to allow of much attention being given at moment to protest mr finn said judge addressing poor broken wretch have be acquitted of odious abominable charge brought against with concurrence be sure not only of who have heard trial of countryman countrywoman need not say that will leave dock with stain on character have hope be consolation to in misfortune to hear term in have be spoken of by such friend a who came here to give testimony on behalf be have be great sorrow to to see such one a subjected to so unmerited ignominy man educated in law of country a have be understanding constitution fundamentally a do will probably have acknowledged that great a have be misfortune to personally nothing more than proper attempt have be made to execute justice trust that may speedily find able to resume place among legislator of country thus phineas finn be acquitted judge collecting up robe trooped off from bench following long line of assessor who have remained even to hour to hear last word of trial mr chaffanbrass collected paper with assistance of mr wickerby totally disregardful of junior counsel attorney solicitor general congratulated other on successful termination of very disagreeable piece of business phineas be discharged according to ordinary meaning of word be now to go about business a pleased law having further need of person can understand how in common case prisoner discharged on acquittal who probably in nine case out of ten be conscious of own guilt may feel sweetness of freedom enjoy immunity from danger with light heart be received probably by wife young woman perhaps having wife young woman to receive betakes to usual haunt interest have be felt in career be over be no longer hero of hour be free man may drink gin water where plea perhaps small admiring crowd may welcome a pass out into street have become nobody before reach corner must not be so with discharged prisoner a regarded own feeling a regarded friend when moment came have hardly a yet thought about immediate future have not considered how must live where during next few month sensation of moment have be so full sometimes of agony at others of anticipated triumph that have not attempted a yet to make for scheme duchess of omnium have suggested that must be received back into society with elaborate course of fashionable dinner view of return to world have certainly not occurred to when be led down from dock hardly knew be being taken when found in small room attached to court clasped on one arm by mr low on other by lord chiltern did not know what must propose to have considered what answer must make to proposition at last be safe said mr low think what have suffered said lord chiltern phineas looked round to see if there be other friend present certainly among friend have thought most of who have travelled half across europe for evidence to save have seen madame goesler last on evening preceding night of murder have not even heard from since have be told what have done for now have almost fancied that must have found waiting for smiled first at one man then at other made effort to carry with ordinary tranquillity will be right now dare say said wonder whether must have glass of water sat down while water be brought to two friend stood over hardly knowing how to do more than support by presence then lord cantrip made way into room have sat on bench to last whereas other two have gone down to receive prisoner when acquitted with came sir harry coldfoot home secretary friend said former bitter day have passed over hope that bitterness will soon pas away also phineas again attempted to smile a held hand of man with whom have formerly be associated in office must not intrude mr finn said sir harry did not feel bound in special manner to express regret at great trouble to have be subjected phineas rose bowed stiffly have conceived that one connected with administration of law have believed to be guilty none in present mood must be dear to who from beginning trusted in innocence be requested by mr gresham continued sir harry to express to entire sympathy joy that be at last over phineas tried to make little speech utterly failed then sir harry left burst out into tear who can be surprised said lord cantrip marvel be that must have be able to bear so long must have crushed utterly long since said other lord then there be question asked a to what must do mr low proposed that must be allowed to take phineas to own house for few day wife said have known friend so long so intimately that might perhaps be able to make more serviceable than other lady at house phineas must receive sister just a must at own sister have be lodging near prison almost ever since committal have be thought well to remove to mr low house in order that might meet brother there think will go to own room in marlborough street be first intelligible word have uttered since have be led out of dock to resolution adhered lord cantrip offered retirement of country house belonging to within hour journey of london lord chiltern declared that harrington hall phineas knew be altogether at service phineas decided in favour of mr bunce to great marlborough street be taken by mr low will come to to morrow with wife said lord chiltern a be going not to morrow chiltern tell wife how deeply value friendship lord cantrip also offered to come be asked to wait awhile be afraid be hardly fit for visitor yet strength seems to have be knocked out of last week mr low accompanied to lodging then handed over to mr bunce promising that two sister must come to early on following morning on evening must prefer to be quite alone must not allow barrister even to go upstairs with when have entered room almost rudely begged weeping

wont to dine since trial have be commenced wanted nothing might bring tea said if must leave for hour then at last be alone stood up in middle of room stretching forth hand putting one first to breast then to brow feeling a though doubting own identity must be that last week have be real that everything have not be dream have in truth be suspected of murder tried for life then thought of who have be murdered of mr bonteen enemy be really gone man who other day be to have be chancellor of exchequer scornful arrogant loud boastful man have hardly thought of mr bonteen before during week of own

must live to miss house must now refuse offer made to accepted offer did so with positive assurance that consideration must at present take to tankerville ai going to charge not one penny said mr gadmire with enthusiasm feel owe to borough said phineas to warm friend there who have espoused cause be not in condition at present of mind body to put forward anywhere in public have suffered great deal most cruel said troddles be quite willing to confess that be therefore unfit in present position to serve borough ca admit said gadmire raising left hand mean to have said troddles there be doubt about re election mr finn said ruddle be very grateful can not be there must trust to one of gentleman to explain to elector that in present condition be unable to visit borough messrs ruddle gadmire troddles returned to tankerville disappointed doubt at not bringing with whose company must have made foot glorious on pavement of native town still with comparative sense of own importance in having seen great sufferer whose woe forbade that must be beheld by common eye never even expressed idea that ought to have come alluding even to past conviction a to futility of hoping for blessing spoke of a personage made almost sacred by suffering have be made to endure a to election must be matter of course be proposed by mr ruddle be absolutely seconded by rector of tankerville staunchest tory in place who on occasion made speech in declared that a englishman loving justice must not allow political even religious consideration to bias conduct on occasion mr finn have thrown up seat under pressure of false accusation be rector thought for honour of borough that seat must be restored to so phineas finn be re elected for tankerville without opposition without expense for six week after ceremony parcel be showered upon by lady of borough who sent worked slipper scarlet hunting waistcoat pocket handkerchief with pf beautifully embroidered chain made of own hair in conjunction of affair editor of people banner found somewhat difficult to trim sail be rule of life with mr quintus slide to persecute enemy enemy might at time become friend while enemy be enemy must be trodden on persecuted mr slide have striven more than once to make friend of phineas finn phineas finn have be conceited stiff necked phineas have be to mr slide enemy of enemy by idea of manliness by rule of life by principle guided be bound to persecute phineas to last during trial few week before trial have written various short article with view of declaring how improper must be must newspaper express opinion of guilt innocence of suspected person while under trial gave two three severe blow to contemporary for having sinned in matter in article have contrived to insinuate that member for tankerville must a matter of course be dealt with by hand of justice have be very careful to recapitulate circumstance have induced finn to hate murdered man have more than once related story of firing of pistol at macpherson hotel then came telegram from prague for day two mr slide be stricken dumb acquittal followed quintus slide have found compelled to join in general satisfaction evinced at escape of innocent man then came re election for tankerville mr slide felt that there be opportunity for reaction more than enough have be done for phineas finn in allowing to elude gallows there must certainly be need for crowning with political chaplet because have not murdered mr bonteen among few other remark mr slide threw together following appeared in column of people banner must confess that hardly understand principle on mr finn have be re elected for tankerville with so much enthusiasm free of expense without usual compliment to constituency be implied by personal appearance of candidate have more than once expressed belief that be wrongly accused in matter of mr bonteen murder indeed reader will do justice to remember that during trial before trial be always anxious to allay very strong feeling against mr finn with public mind be then imbued not only by fact of murder also by previous conduct of gentleman can not understand why late member must be thought by elector of tankerville to be especially worthy of confidence because did not murder mr bonteen instigated hope by proper feeling retired from parliament a soon a be acquitted career during last twelve month have not enhanced credit can not must think have increased comfort ventured to suggest after affair in judd street a to police be so benignly inefficient that must not be for welfare of nation that gentleman must be employed in public service whose public life have be marked by misfortune have attended mr finn great effort be made by various lady of old whig party to obtain official employment for be made in vain mr gresham be too wise advice will not say be followed be found to agree with decision of prime minister mr finn be left out in cold in spite of great friend then came murder of mr bonteen can be that mr finn fitness for parliamentary duty have be increased by mr bonteen unfortunate death by fact that mr bonteen be murdered by other hand than own think not wretched husband who in madness of jealousy fired pistol at young man head have since died in madness doe that incident in drama give mr finn special claim to consideration think not think also that elector of tankerville must have done better have allowed mr finn to return to obscurity seems to have desired elector of tankerville however be responsible only to borough may do a please with seat in parliament be at disposal may however protest against employment of unfit person in service of country simply because have not committed murder say so much now because rumour of arrangement have reached ear must come to pas must force upon extremely disagreeable duty of referring very forcibly to past circumstance may otherwise perhaps be allowed to be forgotten chapter lxxii end of story of mr emilius lady eustace interest in murder by mean came to end when phineas finn be acquitted new fact served so thoroughly to prove innocent tended with almost equal weight to prove man guilty other man be already in custody on charge have subjected to peculiar ill will of british public foreigner jew by name yosef mealyus a one be now very careful to call have come to england have got to be ordained a clergyman have called emilius have married rich wife with title although have former wife still living in own country have called jones must have be better for there be something in name of emilius added peculiar sting to iniquity be now known that bigamy must be certainly proved that last victim old friend poor little lizzie eustace must be rescued from clutch must once more be free woman a have be strong enough to defend future income from grasp be perhaps a fortunate a deserved to be be still young pretty there might come lover more desirable than yosef mealyus that man must have to undergo punishment of bigamy in severest form there be doubt must law justice prevailing desire for revenge be able to get at in way that might be hung there certainly did exist strong desire to prove mr emilius to have be murderer so that there might come fitting termination to career in great britain police seemed to think that must make little of coat of key unless other evidence must be almost sufficient in must be found lord fawn be informed that testimony must probably be required at trial intimation affected so grievously that friend for week two thought that must altogether sink under misery must say nothing must seem to criminate mealyus man hurrying along with grey coat be that must swear to now professing to be altogether ignorant whether man a seen by have be tall short then manufacture of key though be that made one feel sure that mealyus be murderer did not in truth afford slightest evidence against even have be proved that have certainly used false key left mr meager house on night in question must not have sufficed at to prove therefore have committed murder in berkeley street doubt mr bonteen have be enemy mr bonteen have be murdered by enemy so great have be man luck that real evidence seemed to touch nobody doubted then few have doubted before a to guilt of phineas finn there be one other fact by truth might be hoped still be reached mr bonteen have of course be killed by weapon have be found in garden a to that general certainty prevailed mr meager miss meager maid of work belonging to meagers even lady eustace be examined a to bludgeon have anything of kind ever be seen in possession of clergyman clergyman have be so sly that nothing of kind have be seen of drawer cupboard used mr meager have always possessed duplicate key miss meager frankly acknowledged that have general fairly accurate acquaintance with content of receptacle there have always be big trunk with impenetrable lock lock required that even if have key must be acquainted with certain combination of letter before must open of trunk one have seen inside a matter of course weapon when brought to london have be kept altogether hidden in trunk nothing must be easier man can not be hung because have have secret hiding place in murderous weapon may have be stowed away might not be possible to trace weapon mealyus on return from prague have certainly come through paris so much be learned be also learned a certainty that article be of french probably of parisian manufacture if must be proved that man have bought weapon even such weapon in paris then so said police authority might be worth while to make attempt to hang men very skilful in unravelling such mystery be sent to paris police of capital entered upon search with most praiseworthy zeal number of life preserver have be sold altogether baffled seemed that nothing be so common a gentleman must walk about with bludgeon in pocket covered with leathern thong young woman old man who thought that must recollect something of special sale be brought over saw splendour of london under very favourable circumstance when confronted with mr emilius must venture to identify large sum of money be expended doubt justified by high position poor mr bonteen have filled in counsel of nation be expended in vain mr bonteen have be murdered in street at west end of london murderer be known to everybody have be seen minute two before murder motive have induced crime be apparent weapon with have be perpetrated have be found murderer disguise have be discovered cunning with have endeavoured to prove that be in bed at home have be unravelled criminal purpose of cunning made altogether manifest man eye must see whole thing from moment in murderer crept out of mr meager house with mr meager coat upon shoulder life preserver in pocket till be seen by lord fawn hurrying out of mew to prey blow from bludgeon must be counted very moment in have be struck have be ascertained very act in hurling weapon over wall be seen yet nothing must be done be very dangerous thing hanging man on circumstantial evidence said sir gregory grogram who couple of month since have felt almost sure that honourable friend phineas finn must have to be hung on circumstantial evidence police magistrate lawyer agreed that must be useless indeed wrong to send case before jury there have be quite sufficient evidence against phineas finn in meantime trial for bigamy proceeded in order that poor little lizzie eustace might be freed from incubus afflicted before end of july be made once more free woman rev joseph emilius under name be thought proper that must be tried be convicted sentenced to penal servitude for five year very touching appeal be made for to jury by learned serjeant who declared that client be to lose wife to be punished with extreme severity a bigamist because be found to be impossible to bring home against charge of murder there be perhaps truth in what learned serjeant said truth have effect upon jury mr emilius be found guilty a quickly a phineas finn have be acquitted be perhaps treated with severity single crime must hardly have elicited happened in middle of effort be being made to trace purchase of bludgeon when men hoped two five twenty five year of threatened incarceration might be same to mr emilius must have succeeded in discovering where have bought weapon year of penal servitude must have afflicted little did not succeed though can not be said that mystery be attached to bonteen murder have remained one of crime be unavenged by flagging law so rev mr emilius will pas away from story there must be one two word further respecting poor little lizzie eustace still have income almost untouched having be unable to squander during late married life having succeeded in saving from clutch of pseudo husband have title of one must rob castle down in ayrshire however a place of residence have learned to hate most thoroughly have done anything of must necessarily have put out of pale of society a married woman have have lover when widow very little fault in line have be brought home against world at large seemed to be sick of mr bonteen have be best friend while be still thought that phineas finn have committed murder with mr bonteen have remained be impossible that arrangement must be continued when became known for be known that mr bonteen have be murdered by man who be still lizzie reputed husband not that lizzie perceived though be averse to idea of husband having be murderer mr bonteen perceived told friend that must go be most unwillingly that wretched widow changed faith a to murderer at last found bound to believe a world believed then hinted to wife of mr emilius that have better find home believe bit said lizzie be not subject can discus said widow see that make difference be husband have said that very often mr bonteen be better that must be together lady eustace oh can go of course mr bonteen there need be slightest trouble about have thought perhaps might be convenient of course know best went forth into lodging in moon street close to scene of murder be once more alone in world have child indeed son of first husband a to whom behoved many to be anxious who stood high in rank high in repute such have be lizzie manner of life that own relation of husband must put up with endure contact yet be conscious of special sin regarded a one who with tender heart of own too confiding spirit have be much injured by cruelty of with whom have be thrown now be alone weeping in solitude pitying with deepest compassion never occurred to that there be anything in conduct that need alter must still continue to play game a before must still scheme must still lie might still at last land in elysium of life of have be always dreaming poor lizzie eustace be nature education have made impossible to to tell truth when lie came to hand lizzie liar poor lizzie chapter lxxiii phineas finn return to duty election at tankerville took place during last week in july a parliament be doomed to sit year a late a th of august there be ample time for phineas to present take oath before session be finished have calculated that must hardly be so when matter of re election be first proposed to have hoped that reappearance might be deferred till following year there be once more member for tankerville while yet there be nearly fortnight work to be done pressed by friend told by one two of whom most trusted that must neglect duty show to be coward if abstained from taking place coward be hard word said to mr low who have used so men think when that other man be accused of running away in battle like nobody will charge with cowardice of kind there be moral cowardice a well a physical a when man lie be telling lie be afraid to meet eye of fellow creature yes be may call coward if like what matter name if charge be true have be so treated that be afraid to meet eye of fellow creature be like man who have have knee broken arm cut off of course can not be same afterwards a be before mr low said great deal more to on subject mr low said be true be somewhat rough did not succeed barrington erle lord cantrip also tried eloquence upon be mr monk who at last drew from promise that must go down to house be sworn in early on certain tuesday afternoon be quite sure of mr monk have said that sooner do le will be annoyance indeed there will be trouble in doing of trouble be in anticipation be therefore only increased prolonged by delay of course be duty to go at once mr monk have said again when friend argued that have never undertaken to sit before expiration of parliament did consent to be put in nomination owe immediate service just a doe other member if man grandmother dy be held to be exempted grandmother have not died sorrow be not of kind requires be supposed to require retirement gave way at last on tuesday afternoon mr monk called for at mr bunce house went down with to westminster reached destination somewhat too soon walked length of westminster hall two three time while phineas tried to justify think said low quite understands position when call coward be sure phineas did not mean to do suppose be angry with owe great deal too much for that be one of few friend have who be entitled to say to just what please think mistake matter when man becomes crooked from age be good telling to be straight 'd be straight if must man ca eat dinner with diseased liver a must when be well may follow advice a to getting liver in order again so be following advice low seems to think disease must be there disease be there ca banish by simply saying that be not there if have hung outright must be almost a reasonable to come tell afterwards to shake be again alive think that low realises what be to stand in dock for week together with eye of men fixed on conviction at heart that one there belief to have be guilty of abominable crime of know to have be innocent for week lived under belief be to be made away by hangman to leave behind name must make one who have known shudder god in mercy have delivered from that have be thankful back be not strong enough to bear weight without bending under did see ratler going in there be man dread be intimate enough with to congratulate not friend enough to abstain will be sure to say something about murdered colleague very well will follow go up rather quick will come close after whereupon mr monk entered between two lamp post in hall hurrying along passage soon found at door of house phineas with effort at composure smile be almost ghastly at door keeper who greeted with muttered word of recognition held on way close behind friend walked up house hardly conscious that bench on side be empty there be not dozen member present speaker have not a yet taken chair mr monk stood by while took oath in two minute be on back seat below gangway with friend by while member in slowly increasing number took seat then there be prayer a yet not single man have spoken to a soon a door be again open gentleman streamed in few whom phineas knew well came sat near one two shook hand with one said word to of trial one at least did so in early stage of day proceeding after hour almost ceased to be afraid then came up irregular debate on great church question of day a to there have be cessation of badgering with mr gresham have be attacked since came into office have thrown out mr daubeny by opposing that gentleman stupendous measure for disestablishing church of england altogether although a be almost daily asserted by mr daubeny friend be in favour of such total disestablishment over over again mr gresham have acknowledged that be in favour of disestablishment protesting that have opposed mr daubeny bill without reference to merit solely on ground that measure must not be accepted from such quarter have be stout enough a enemy have said insolent enough in making assurance still be accused of keeping own hand dark of omitting to say what bill must propose to bring in respecting church in next session be essentially necessary so said mr daubeny friend that country must know discus proposed measure during vacation there be of course good deal of retaliation mr daubeny have not given country even own party much time to discus church bill mr gresham assured mr daubeny that must not feel equal to producing measure must change religious position of individual in country annihilate tradition system of century altogether complete out of own unaided brain went on to say be to do so did not think that must find supported in such effort by friend with whom usually worked on occasion declared that magnitude of subject immense importance of interest concerned forbade to anticipate passing of measure of general church reform in next session be undoubtedly in favour of church reform be by mean sure that question be one required immediate settlement of be sure that nothing in way of legislative indiscretion must be so injurious to country a attempt at hasty ill considered measure on most momentous of question debate be irregular a originated with question asked by one of mr daubeny supporter be allowed to proceed for while in answer to mr gresham mr daubeny spoke accusing mr gresham of almost known parliamentary vice in having talked of measure coming like minerva from mr daubeny own brain plain simple word by accusation might naturally be refuted must be unparliamentary must not be unparliamentary to say that be reckless unfounded absurd monstrous incredible then there be various very spirited reference to church matter concern chiefly because mr daubeny congratulated house upon seeing roman catholic gentleman with whom be well acquainted whose presence in house be desired by side alike again take seat for english borough hoped that might at same time take liberty of congratulating gentleman on courage manly dignity with have endured unexampled hardship of cruel position in have be placed by untoward combination of circumstance be thought that mr daubeny did thing very well that be right in doing during doing of poor phineas winced in agony of course member be looking at stranger in gallery did not know at moment whether behoved to rise make gesture to house to say word to keep seat make sign there be general hum of approval prime minister turned round bowed graciously to newly sworn member a said afterwards be just have feared there must surely have be something of consolation in general respect with be treated at moment behaved with natural instinctive dignity though doubting propriety of own conduct said not word made sign sat with eye fixed upon member from whom compliment have come mr daubeny went on with tirade be called violently to order speaker declared that whole debate have be irregular have be allowed by in deference to what seemed to be general will of house then two leader of two party composed throwing off indignation while covered well up with hat in accordance with order of day honourable member rose to propose pet measure of own for preventing adulteration of beer by publican have made calculation that annual average mortality of england must be reduced one half per cent in other word english subject born must live seven month longer if action of legislature must provide that publican must sell beer a came from brewer immediately there be such rush of member to door that not word said by philanthropic must be purifier of national beverage must be heard quarrel of rival minister be dear to house a long a must be continued bench be crowded by gentleman enthralled by interest of occasion to sink from to private legislation about beer be to fall into bathos gentleman must not endure so house be emptied at about half past seven there be count out that gentleman whose statistic have be procured with so much care who have be at work for last twelve month on effort to prolong life of fellow countryman be almost broken hearted knew world too well to complain must try again next year if by dint of energetic perseverance must procure day mr monk phineas finn behaving better than others slipped out in crowd have indeed be arranged that must leave house early so that might dine together at mr monk house though phineas have be released from prison now for nearly month have not a yet once dined out of own room have not be inside club hardly ventured during day into street about pall mall piccadilly have be frequently to portman square have not even seen madame goesler now be to dine out for first time there be to be guest be so bad after said mr monk when be seated together at rate have be done yes there will be doing of over again like mr daubeny a know be happy at kind of thing hate men who be what call happy who be never in earnest said phineas be earnest enough thought mean about mr monk suppose thought that be suitable to occasion that must say something said neatly hate men who can make capital out of occasion who can be neat appropriate at spur of moment having however probably have benefit of forethought whose word never savour of truth if have happened to have be hung at time a be so probable mr daubeny must have devoted one of half hour to composition of dozen tragic word also must have be neat appropriate can hear say now warning young member around to abstain from embittered word against other feel sure that funereal grace of such occasion must have become even better than generosity of congratulation be rather grim matter for joking phineas grim enough grimness joke be always running through mind together used to spend hour in thinking what dear friend must say about when found that have be hung in mistake how sir gregory grogram must like whether men must think about a went home from universe at night have various question to ask answer for whether must pull up poor body for instance from what unhallowed ground be used for gallows corps give decent burial placing bep for tankerville ' after name on more le explicit tablet mr daubeny speech be perhaps preferable on whole perhaps be though used to feel assured that explicit tablet must be a clear to eye in purgatory a mr daubeny word have be to ear afternoon never for moment doubted that truth must be known before long did doubt so very much whether must be known in time will go home now mr monk endeavour to get matter off mind will resolve at rate that nothing will make talk about more chapter lxxiv at matching for about week in august heat of hot summer phineas attended parliament with fair average punctuality then prepared for journey down to matching priory during week spoke word to one a to past tribulation answered allusion to simply by smile have determined to live exactly a though there have be no such episode in life a trial at old bailey in most respect did so during week dined at club called at madame goesler house in park lane not however finding lady at home once once only did break down on wednesday evening met barrington erle be asked by to go to universe at moment became very pale at once said that must go have erle carried off in cab adventure might have

know be fool barrington if mind will go home mind just go on then turned walked home passing through passage in murder have be committed brought a far a next street barrington erle said to one of friend at club must get in doubt if will ever be here again be past six o'clock in evening when reached matching priory duchess have especially assured that brougham must be waiting for at nearest station on arriving there found that have brougham to have thought great deal about have endeavoured to make calculation knew that madame goesler must be at matching must be necessary that must say something of thankfulness at first meeting how must meet in what way must greet when met must arrangement be made must be left to chance must go at once to own chamber so a to show first when dressed for dinner must allow to be taken into of morning room in other guest must be congregated have certainly not sufficiently considered character of duchess when imagined that must allow thing to arrange be one of woman whose mind be always engaged on such matter who be able to see how thing will go must not be asserted of that delicacy be untainted taste perfect be clever discreet in midst of indiscretion thoughtful good natured have considered arranged given order with accuracy when phineas entered hall brougham with luggage having be taken round to back door be at once ushered by silent man in black into little sitting room on ground floor in old duke used to take delight here found two lady only two lady waiting to receive duchess came forward to welcome while madame goesler remained in background with composed face a though by mean expected arrival have chanced to come upon a be standing by window be thinking of much more than of companion though knew also how much owed to kindness of duchess what have done for have come from caprice whereas other have be instigated guided by affection understood must have shown feeling on countenance yes there be said duchess laughing have already told that be welcome to matching have spoken short word of congratulation at safe deliverance from trouble if ever one friend be grateful to must be grateful to mr finn did not

necessary acrimony of defence creates acrimony in attack if be accustomed a be to criminal court must observe constantly gentleman get up declares in perfect faith that be simply anxious to lay before jury such evidence a have be placed in hand open case in spirit then witness be cross examined with affected incredulity assumed indignation defending counsel be almost bound to use on behalf of client find gradually imbued with pugnacity becomes strenuous energetic perhaps eager for what must after be regarded a success at last fight for verdict rather than for truth judge suppose ought to put right so doe come right criminal practice doe not sin on side of severity barrister employed on prosecution must keep free from personal desire for verdict must animate engaged on defence then suppose wanted to hang sir gregory certainly not wanted truth in position must have regarded a bloodhound did not a far a can analyse own feeling entertained anger only against who though knew well thought be guilty will allow at rate to shake hand with said sir gregory to assure must have lived broken hearted man if truth have be known too late a be tremble shake in shoe a walk about think of

chiltern mean can afford surely that might go for something can not say what mr maule may mean to do mr spooner think only fair to tell that be at present staying at matching under same roof with miss palliser maule staying at duke when mr spooner heard there came sudden change over face jaw fell mouth be opened redness of cheek flew up to forehead be expected there yesterday need hardly suggest to what will be end of quarrel going to duke wo give income know nothing about mr spooner really seems to that misinterpret nature of affection of such girl a miss palliser do think likely that must cease to love man because be not so rich a people when be married want house to live in lady chiltern now at spoon hall believe be in vain mr spooner be quite sure of quite sure 'd have done anything for anything might have have what settlement pleased told ned that must go if made point of 'd have gone abroad lived just anywhere 'd come to that did mind hunting bit be sorry for be indeed cut

be two bottle of champagne at dinner two bottle of claret afterwards day only hope will know that did good bye lady chiltern thought that perhaps 'd have helped can not help good bye so went down to trap drove violently home without however achieving ruin desired let hope that a time cure wound threat a to increased consumption of wine may fall to ground unfulfilled in meantime gerard maule have arrived at matching priory have quarrelled adelaide have said when duchess told that lover be to come then have better make up again duchess have answered there have be end of nothing more be done arrangement be made adelaide be left to meet man a best might quarrel to have be a disruption of heaven have declared to herself that must bear misfortune to be borne be broken world falling about own ear have thought of nunnery of ophelia among water lily of early death bed then have pictured to herself somewhat ascetic very laborious life of old maiden lady whose only recreation fifty year hence must consist in looking at portrait of who have once be lover now be told that be coming to matching a though nothing have be matter tried to think whether be not duty to have thing at once packed ask for carriage to take to railway station be in house of nearest relative of also of who be bound to see that thing be right then there might be more pleasureable existence than must have to depend on photograph for keenest delight how must meet in what way must address must ignore quarrel recognize take milder course be half afraid of duchess must not ask for assistance duchess though good natured seemed to to be rough there be nobody at matching to whom must say word so lived on trembled doubted from hour to hour whether world must not come to end duchess be rough be very good natured have contrived that two lover must be brought into same house did not doubt at what must be able to adjust own little difference when met experience of world have certainly made more alive to material prospect than to delicate aroma of love adventure have be greatly knocked about material prospect have come uppermost have happened to have tended to open hand to other people have enabled to be good natured with delight even when knew that friend imposed upon did care much for laurence fitzgibbon when be told that lady with money must not consent to marry aristocratic pauper except on condition that must be received at matching duchess at once gave invitation now though must go into fal lallery a called to madame goesler of settling meeting between two young people who have fallen out worked hard till accomplished something perhaps more important to future happiness plantagenet said there can be objection to cousin having that money dear oh come must remember about adelaide that young man who be coming here to day told that adelaide be to be married know anything about young man name be maule be gentleman day when father dy will have small property somewhere hope have profession no have not told all that before if have nothing at glencora why did ask young lady to marry oh dear what be good of going into that have got something will do immensely well if will only listen be first cousin of course be said plantagenet lifting up hand to hair be bound to do something for be not bound be very willing if wish put thing on right footing hate footing be right footing can manage without taking money out of pocket dear glencora if be to give cousin money will do so by putting hand into own pocket in preference to of other person madame goesler say that will sign paper about duke legacy money mean if may be allowed to make over to duke niece of course madame goesler may do what like with own can not hinder must rather that must not interfere twenty five thousand pound be very serious sum of money wo take certainly not will madame goesler therefore there can be reason why young people must not have of course adelaide being duke niece doe make difference why else must care about be nothing to a for must know again if be to meet in street so thing be settled duke be powerless against energy of wife lawyer be instructed that madame goesler must take proper step for putting into possession of duke legacy a far a money be concerned with view of transferring to duke niece miss adelaide palliser a for diamond difficulty must not be solved madame goesler still refused to take desired lawyer to instruct a to form by must most thoroughly conclusively renounce that legacy gerard maule have idea about meeting must of course take place at matching must not thought have be asked there have not be intended that must marry adelaide did not care much for grandeur of duke duchess be conscious of certain profitable advantage might accrue from such acknowledgement of position from great relative of intended bride must be something to be married from house of duchess to receive wife from duke hand father must probably be driven to acquiesce people who be almost omnipotent in world must at rate give start expected money did posse that character whether be good bad be given to such expectation there must be encouragement thing must probably be done a for meeting must take in arm if found alone beg pardon for cross word about boulogne must assure that boulogne must be heaven to if be with thought that must believe when reached house be asked into room in lot of people be playing billiards crowded round billiard table chilterns be gone be at first ill at ease finding friend madame goesler who have met at harrington came up to told that duchess must be there directly then phineas who have be playing at moment of entrance shook hand with said word two about chilterns be so delighted to hear of acquittal said maule never talk about now said phineas going back to stroke adelaide palliser be not present difficulty of meeting have not yet be encountered remained in billiard room till be time for lady to dress adelaide have not yet ventured to show somebody offered to take to room be conducted upstairs told that dined at eight nothing have be arranged nobody have a yet mentioned name to surely must not be that have gone away when heard that be coming that be really determined to make quarrel perpetual have three quarter of hour in to get ready for dinner felt to be uncomfortable out of element have be sent to chamber prematurely because nobody have known what to do with wished back in london duchess doubt have intended to be good natured have made mistake so sat by open window looked out on ruin of old priory be close to house wondered why might have be allowed to wander about garden instead of being shut up there in bedroom felt that must be unwise to attempt escape now must meet duke duchess perhaps adelaide in of passage there must be embarrassment so dawdled away time looking out of window a dressed descended to drawing room at eight o'clock shook hand with duke be welcomed by duchess then glanced round room there be seated on sofa between two other lady of whom one be friend madame goesler be essentially necessary that must notice in way walked up to offered hand be impossible that must allude to what be past merely muttered something a stood over have blushed up to eye be absolutely dumb mr maule perhaps will take cousin adelaide out to dinner said duchess moment afterwards whispering in ear have forgiven said to a passed from one room to other will if care to be forgiven duchess have be quite right quarrel be over without arrangement on following morning be allowed to walk about ground without impediment to visit ruin have looked so charming to from window be alone miss palliser be now by mean anxious a have be yesterday to keep out of way be willingly persuaded to show beauty of place must have said what did know pleaded maule never mind now gerard mean about going to boulogne did sound so melancholy only meant that must have to be very careful how lived know quite whether be so good at being careful about money a fellow ought to be must take lesson from sir have sent horse to tattersall said in tone be almost funereal what already gave order yesterday be to be sold know when wo fetch anything never do one always buy bad horse there for lot of money sell good one for nothing where difference go to never must make out suppose man get who sell fellow get who have eye open eye never be open except a far a seeing went perhaps if have opened wider must have to go to adelaide a be saying about horse when be sold of course bill wo go on suppose thing will come right owe so very much have got something to tell said what about be to see cousin to day at two o'clock duke yes duke have got proposition know that need sell horse a seems to make so very unhappy remember madame goesler of course do be at harrington there be something about legacy ca understand at be ever so much money did belong to old duke say be to be mine yours rather if must ever be married then know gerard perhaps after need go to boulogne so took revenge have a pressed arm round waist kissed among ruin of old priory precisely at two to moment have interview with duke very disagreeable be to of duke be bound to explain that magnificent present be being made to cousin be gift not from from madame goesler though be intent on making a plain a possible did not like task truth be mr maule madame goesler be unwilling for reason with need not trouble to take legacy be left to by uncle think reason to be insufficient be matter in must of course judge for herself have decided very much fear at wife instigation must own regret to give money to one of family have be pleased to say that cousin adelaide will be recipient of bounty have nothing to do with can not stop generosity if must can say that cousin ought to refuse adelaide will have entire sum a fortune short of legacy duty a be probably aware will be ten per cent a madame goesler be not related to uncle money will of course be settled on cousin on child believe will be will have to say except lady glencora duchess mean wish that adelaide must be married from house if be so will of course hope to have honour of giving cousin away duke be by mean pompous man probably there be man in england of so high rank who thought so little of rank be stiff somewhat ungainly task be called upon to execute have be very disagreeable to bowed when have finished speech gerard maule felt bound to go almost without expressing thanks dear mr maule said madame goesler literally must not say word to about money be not mine under circumstance must must be mine have given nothing must not have presumed to make such present money take doe undoubtedly belong to present duke a doe not want be very natural that must go to cousin trust that may both live to enjoy long can not allow thanks to be given to by of after that tried duchess who be somewhat more gracious truth be mr maule be very lucky man to find twenty thousand pound more going begging about country in way indeed be duchess adelaide be lucky too for doubt whether of be given to very penetrating economy be told that like hunting have sent horse to tattersall there be enough now for little hunting suppose unless have dozen child now adelaide must settle when be to be hate thing to be delayed people go on quarrelling fancying thinking that world be full of romance poetry when get married know better hope romance poetry vanish romance poetry be for most part lie mr maule be very apt to bring people into difficulty have seen something of in time much prefer downright honest figure two two make four idleness be root of evil love neighbour like rest of pray remember that adelaide be to be married from here that will be very happy that must make use like of house until then may so far anticipate in story a to say that adelaide palliser gerard maule be married from matching priory at matching church early in october that a far a coming winter be concerned there certainly be hunting for gentleman went to naples instead of boulogne there remained till warm weather came in following spring be that peremptory sale at tattersall countermanded a regarded of horse what price be realised present writer have never be able to ascertain chapter lxxvii phineas finn success when phineas finn have be about week at

meaning suppose to offer place must not give while poor man be alive will accept of course mr finn be not at so sure of will must will hardly be so foolish a to let peevish animosity of ill conditioned man prejudice prospect even after death will not be remembrance of mr bonteen will induce to refuse will be same thing rancour against mr gresham because have allowed other man counsel to prevail with action of individual man must be to of sufficient consequence to guide conduct if accept office must not take a favour conferred by prime minister if refuse must do so from personal

saulsby must do so at once be about to see mr gresham immediately within hour a must not expect at most above twenty four hour to be allowed to for consideration must go down to saulsby on same evening a walked to prime minister house called at telegraph office sent down message will be at saulsby by train arriving at pm send to meet then went on in few minute found in presence of great man great man received with excellent courtesy be special business of prime minister to be civil in detail though roughness perhaps almost rudeness in gross becomes not unfrequently necessity of position to proposed incoming subordinate prime minister be of course very civil to retreating subordinate be generally more so unless retreat be made under unfavourable circumstance to give good thing be always pleasant unless there be suspicion that good thing will be thought to be not good enough such suspicion a now crossed mind of mr gresham have be pressed very much by various colleague to admit young man into paradise of government have be pressed very much also to exclude have be continued till have come to dislike name of young man did believe that young man have behaved badly to mr robert kennedy knew that young man on one occasion have taken to kicking in harness running course of own have decided against young man very much doubt at instance of mr bonteen believed that in so doing closed gate of paradise against peri most anxious to enter now stood with key in hand gate open seat to be allotted to re accepted one be that believed peri must most gratefully fill began by making little speech about mr bonteen be almost unavoidable praised in glowing word attitude phineas have maintained during trial have be delighted with re election at tankerville thought that borough have done much honour then came forth proposition lord fawn have retired absolutely broken down by repeated examination respecting man in grey coat office phineas have before held with so much advantage to public comfort to immediate chief lord cantrip be there for acceptance mr gresham went on to express ardent hope that might have benefit of mr finn service be quite manifest from manner that did not in least doubt nature of reply must receive phineas have come primed with answer so ready with that did not even seem to be result of hesitation at moment hope mr gresham that will be able to give few hour to think of mr gresham face fell for in truth wanted immediate answer though knew from experience that secretary of state first lord chancellor do demand time will often drive very hard bargain before will consent to get into harness considered that under secretary junior lord like must skip about a be bidden take crumb offered without delay if underling wanted few hour to think about how must government ever be got together be sorry to put to inconvenience continued phineas seeing that great man be ill satisfied be so placed that can not avail myself of flattering kindness without little time for consideration have hoped that office be one must like so be mr gresham be told that be now free from scruple political scruple mean might make difficult for to support government since government came to way of thinking year two ago about tenant right mean know that there be subject on be likely to oppose perhaps have better tell truth mr gresham oh certainly said prime minister who knew very well that on such occasion nothing must be worse than telling of disagreeable truth when came into office after beating mr daubeny on church question man in parliament be more desirous of place than be be sure that none of disappointed one felt disappointment so keenly be aggravated by various circumstance by calumny in newspaper by personal bickering need not go into wretched story of mr bonteen absurd accusation grew out of calumny thing have changed very much have feeling have be ill used not by mr gresham specially by party look upon whole question of office with altered eye in filling up place at disposal prime minister mr finn have most unenviable task can well believe when circumstance rather than selection of own indicate future occupant of office abrogation of patronage be greatest blessing in world to can believe that also wish be so with office under crown minister be rarely thanked must a much look for peace of heaven in office a for gratitude be sorry must have made exception to such thanklessness will of get on by complaining will mr finn can let have answer perhaps by time to morrow if answer by telegraph will be sufficient quite sufficient yes nothing more will be wanted understand own reason doubt fully if be stated at length must perhaps hardly enlighten good morning then a phineas be turning back prime minister remembered that behoved a prime minister to repress temper will still hope mr finn for favourable answer have not be for last word phineas must have turned again at once rejected proposition from mr gresham house went by appointment to mr monk told of interview mr monk advice to have be exactly same a given by madame goesler lady laura phineas indeed understood perfectly that friend must must give other advice have trouble too said mr monk speaking of prime minister man can hardly expect to hold such office without trouble labour of course there must be though doubt whether be so great a of other person responsibility amount of trouble depends on spirit nature of man do remember old lord brock be never troubled have triple shield thick skin equable temper perfect self confidence mr mildmay be of softer temper must have suffered have not be protected by idolatry of large class of follower mr gresham have such protection with finer intellect than sense of patriotism quite a keen have self consciousness make sore at point know frailty of temper yet can not control doe not understand men a did others word from enemy be wound to slight from friend be dagger in side can fancy self accusation make cross on be really crucified be man to whom must extend mercy be in power to be merciful will hardly tell must accept office under by way of obliging be must do so not to oblige because know to be honest man care little for honesty said phineas be at disposal of who be dishonest what be to think of minister who must allow to be led by mr bonteen chapter lxxviii last visit to saulsby phineas a journeyed down to saulsby knew that have in truth made up mind be going thither nominally that might listen to advice of almost oldest political friend before resolved on matter of vital importance to in truth be making visit because felt that must not excuse from without unkindness ingratitude have implored to come be bound to go there be tidings to be told must tell be not only that might give reason for not becoming under secretary of state that went to saulsby felt bound to inform that intended to ask goesler to be wife might omit to do so till have asked question then say nothing of what have done must petition be refused seemed to that there must be cowardice in be bound to treat lady laura a friend in special degree a something more than sister be bound above thing to make understand in plainest manner that must be nothing more to than friend in dealing with have endeavoured always to be honest gentle a well a honest now be specially duty to be honest to when be young have loved have told so have refused a friend have be true to ever since offer must never be repeated other offer to woman whom be now accustomed to abuse must be made must lady laura choose to quarrel with must be so quarrel must not be of seeking be quite sure that must refuse mr gresham offer although by doing so must throw away very thing have devoted life to acquire in foolish soft moment a now confessed to have endeavoured to obtain for own position sympathy of minister have spoken of calumny have hurt of suffering when found excluded from place in consequence of evil story have be told of mr gresham have in fact declined to listen to have said yes be that required have gone on to explain that must be unable to understand reason proposed to be given even be to hear phineas have felt to be repulsed must at once have shown anger have not prime minister silenced for moment by civilly worded repetition of offer made offer must certainly be declined a told that must be so endeavoured to analyse cause of decision be hardly successful have thought that must explain reason to minister found incapable of explaining to in regard to mean of subsistence be better off now than when began world be indeed without incumbrance be also without mean of procuring income for last twelve month have be living on little capital two year more of such life must bring to end of that have there be doubt one view of prospect be bright enough if marie goesler accepted need not at rate look about for mean of earning living assured with perfect confidence that hope in direction must have influence upon answer must give to mr gresham have not marie goesler be most urgent with in begging to accept offer be not therefore justified in concluding that at least have thought necessary that must earn bread must her heart be softened towards must further softening be necessary by obstinate refusal to comply with advice two thing have reference to other must be regarded by a perfectly distinct must refuse mr gresham offer not because hoped that might live in idleness on wealth of woman loved because chicanery intrigue of office have become distasteful to know be falser said to mock courtesy mock indignation of statesman found earl carriage waiting for at station thought of many former day a be carried through little town for have sat in parliament up to house have once visited in hope of wooing violet effingham woman whom have loved have at rate become friend thorough friendship be almost with woman lord chiltern regarded other with warm affection there be hardly ground for real sympathy between be same with mr low barrington erle be to die there must be gap in life be to die there must be none in with violet effingham a still loved to call to thought must be different when carriage stopped at hall door be thinking of rather than of lady laura kennedy be shown at once to bedroom very room in have written letter to lord chiltern have brought about duel at blankenberg be

old duke be kind of goodness be hardly likely to recommend to nephew wife never mind wo talk about now barrington be there for day two seems to be wasting life subordinate in office generally do think

ambition to sit in cabinet like to be useful that part of business distress be pleasant to be fond of arrangement delight in little party success to effect to avoid count out be job of work to taste love to get better of opposition by keeping in dark successful plot be a dear to a to writer of play yet be never bitter a be ratler unscrupulous a be poor mr bonteen full of wrath a be lord fawn be idle like fitzgibbon erle always earns salary when said be wasting life meant that did not marry perhaps man in position have better remain unmarried phineas tried to laugh hardly succeeded well that

so know have not accepted mr gresham offer must have told so have not accepted have refused be still open must send answer by telegram to morrow yes mr gresham time be too precious to admit of more phineas for heaven sake allow little feeling to injure at time a be of own career not of mr gresham manner that must think have nothing to object to in mr gresham yes will be quite sufficient must be yes can not be yes lady laura desired so ardently six month ago have now become so distasteful to that can not accept there be amount of hustling on treasury bench make seat there almost ignominious

taught to be perfect be to tell that came down here partly so must have be more generous of sir to have remained away did not mean to be ungenerous then suddenly turned upon throwing arm round neck burying face upon bosom be at moment in centre of park on grass beneath tree moon be bright over head held to breast while sobbed then relaxed hold a raised to look into face after moment took hat from head with one hand with other swept hair back from brow oh phineas said oh darling idol have worshipped when must have worshipped god illustration then suddenly turned upon throwing arm round neck after roamed for nearly hour backwards forward beneath tree till at last became calm almost reasonable acknowledged that have long expected marriage looking forward to a great sorrow repeated

undertake duty of very pleasant office to mr gresham have kindly offered to appoint that done remained in town one night then set face again towards matching when reached that place be already known that have refused to accept mr gresham offer be met at once with regret condolements be sorry that must be so said duke who be sorry for liked man who said not word more upon subject be still young will have further opportunity said lord cantrip wish that must have consented to come back to old chair hope that at rate will not have against said sir harry coldfoot among declared one to that have be so completely upset by imprisonment subsequent trial a to be unable to undertake work proposed to be not very nice thing know to be accused of murder said sir gregory to pas month two under full conviction that be going to be hung will come right again day only hope may not be too late so have decided for freedom said madame goesler to that evening evening of day on have returned yes indeed

satisfaction when be brought home will tell occurred other day circumstance happen to be known to though can not tell authority dear old friend laurence fitzgibbon in performance of official duty have to give opinion on matter affecting expenditure of thirty forty thousand pound of public money think that laurence have generally very strong bias way that on such question in case in question took upon to be very decided wrote got one to write report proving that service of country imperatively demanded that money must be spent in doing so be strictly within duty be glad to hear that can be so energetic chancellor of exchequer got hold of matter told fitzgibbon that thing must be done be right constitutional suppose quite right constitutional something have to be said about in house laurence with usual fluency beautiful irish brogue got up explained that money must be absolutely thrown away if expended on purpose so futile a proposed be assured that great capacity have thus shown for official work official life will cover multitude of sin must hardly have taken mr fitzgibbon a model statesman certainly not if story affected only must hardly be worth telling point of lie in that disgusted one by what did chancellor of exchequer think very convenient man to have about mr gresham feel comfort of possessing tool so pliable do think that public life then be altogether
