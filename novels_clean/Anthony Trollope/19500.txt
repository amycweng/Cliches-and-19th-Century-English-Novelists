repute though have succeeded in earning perhaps might better say in obtaining livelihood have married lady somewhat older than who be in possession of four hundred year who be related to big people to whom have alluded who be special nature of relationship will be called upon to explain hereafter at present will suffice to say that alice macleod gave great offence to friend by marriage did not however give much time for indulgence of anger having given birth to daughter within twelve month of marriage died leaving in abeyance question a to whether fault of marriage must must not be pardoned by family when man marries heiress for money if money be within own control a be case with miss macleod fortune be generally well for speculating lover that lady friend must quarrel with with be thereby driven to throw entirely into gentleman arm thus becomes possessed of wife money without abominable nuisance of stringent settlement macleod though quarrelled with alice did not quarrel with l'outrance snubbed chosen husband did not so far separate from affair a to give up charge of possession four hundred year be settled very closely on on child without even life interest having be given

with lord chancellor argued that westminster hall lincoln inn to boot have right to call upon to degrade by signing name to account in answer to memorial be offered alternative of freedom with income

so respectably then upon word be very much obliged to ladyship wonder whether considered that married respectably when took lord midlothian now lady midlothian have be unfortunate in marriage having united to man of bad character who have used ill from whom have now be for year separated alice might have spared allusion to misfortune when speaking of countess to cousin who be so fond of be angered by application of odious word respectable to own prospect perhaps more angered a be somewhat inclined to feel that epithet did suit own position engagement have sometimes told herself be very respectable have a often told that lacked other attraction must have possessed be not quite pleased with in having accepted john grey rather perhaps be not satisfied with in having loved in many thought on subject always admitted to herself that have accepted simply because loved that have given quick assent to quick proposal simply because have won heart be sometimes almost angry with herself that have permitted heart to be thus easily taken from have rebuked herself for girlish facility marriage must be at rate respectable mr grey be man of high character of good though moderate mean be too well educated of good birth gentleman man of talent one must deny that marriage must be highly respectable father have be more than satisfied why miss vavasor be not quite satisfied will hope in time make appear in meanwhile can be understood that lady midlothian praise must gall alice be uncharitable said lady macleod severely may have be lady midlothian misfortune one can say have resulted from own fault yes can aunt if married man whom knew to be scapegrace because be very rich earl be daughter of nobleman herself only married in own degree want to discus that meant to be good natured when mentioned marriage must take a be meant after be only mother second cousin dear aunt make claim on cousinship admits claim be quite anxious that must know have be at trouble to find out everything about mr grey told that nothing must be more satisfactory upon word be very much obliged to lady macleod be woman of much patience possessed also of considerable perseverance for half hour went on expatiating on advantage must accrue to alice a married woman from acquaintance with noble relative endeavouring to persuade that better opportunity than present must present there must be place in lady midlothian carriage a none other of daughter be going lady jane lady midlothian must take quite a compliment concert be not like ball customary party unmarried girl might very properly go to concert under such circumstance a now existed without special invitation lady macleod ought to have known adopted niece better alice be immoveable a matter of course be immoveable lady macleod have seldom be able to persuade to anything ought to have be well sure that of thing must not have persuaded to then at last came to subject a to lady macleod declared that have specially come on special morning forgetting probably that have already made same assertion with reference to concert in truth last assertion be correct one on other subject have be hurried on to say more than meant by eagerness of moment morning have be full of matter on be now about to speak have discussed quite at length with lady midlothian though be by mean prepared to tell alice vavasor that such discussion have taken place from concert effect lady midlothian countenance might have upon mr grey future welfare got by degree round to projected swiss tour alice be about to make of swiss tour have heard before have not heard who be to be miss vavasor companion until lady midlothian have told how have come to pas lady midlothian have interested so much in concern of person whom did not know on whom in greatness must not be expected to call can not say from quarter have learned who be proposed companion of alice vavasor tour have told lady macleod that did not at approve of arrangement when do go alice said lady macleod early in july believe will be very hot kate must be back by middle of august kate vavasor be alice first cousin oh kate be to go with of course be must not go alone with one george indeed be kate who made up party of course must not go alone with george said lady macleod very grimly now george vavasor be kate brother be therefore also first cousin to alice be heir to old squire down in westmoreland with whom kate lived father being dead nothing must seem must be more rational than alice must go to switzerland with cousin lady macleod be clearly not of opinion looked very grim a made allusion to cousin george seemed to be preparing for fight be exactly what say answered alice indeed be simply going a escort to kate a like role of unprotected female be very good natured of seeing how much time be taken up thought never did anything be because know aunt certainly know did not add that have wish to know mr george vavasor looked have father be told that be going of course have doe lady macleod hesitated little before went on then finished question with little spasmodic assumption of courage doe mr grey know that be going alice remained silent for full minute before answered question during lady macleod sat watching grimly with eye very intent upon niece face if supposed such silence to have be in degree produced by shame in answering question be much mistaken may be doubted whether understood character of girl whom thought knew so well be probable that did make such mistake might tell simply that doe said alice at last seeing wrote to yesterday letting know that such be arrangement feel must not thus answer question mean to ask want to know whether mr grey will approve of a only wrote yesterday of course have not heard therefore can not say can say aunt that much a might regret disapproval must make change in plan must not then must tell be very wrong ought to make change what disapproval of man be going to marry make change in plan not in matter come aunt if must discus matter let do at rate fairly in ordinary way if mr grey have asked to give up for reason trip altogether must have given up certainly a must give up other indifferent project at request of so dear friend friend with whom be so so so closely connected if asked not to travel with cousin george must refuse absolutely without word of parley on subject simply because of nature closeness of connection with suppose understand what mean aunt suppose do mean that must refuse to obey on very subject on have right to claim obedience have no right to claim obedience on subject said alice a spoke aunt macleod jumped up with little start at vehemence of word of tone in be expressed have heard that tone before might have be used to nevertheless little jump be involuntary at present have no right to obedience on subject least of on said alice advice may give be quite sure will not ask for obedience if advises will slight advice if tell that have better not travel with cousin george will certainly not take advice moreover must be careful to let know how much be offended by such counsel from must show littleness on part suspicion of can not suppose to be capable alice a said got up from seat walked about room when have finished stood at one of window with back to visitor there be silence between for minute two during lady macleod be deeply considering how best might speak terrible word a alice nearest female relative felt bound to utter at last collected thought courage spoke out dear alice need hardly say that if have mother living person with filling place of mother must not interfere in matter of course aunt macleod if think be wrong have quite right to say so do think be wrong very wrong indeed if persist in be afraid must say that will think wicked of course mr grey can not like to travel with george vavasor why not aunt alice a asked question turned round confronted lady macleod boldly spoke with steady voice fixed eye upon old lady face a though determined to show that have fear of what might be said to why not alice surely wish to say why not do wish to say why not how can defend till accusation be made be now engaged to marry mr grey with consent approbation of friend two year ago have have have what aunt if mean to say that two year ago be engaged to cousin george be mistaken three year ago told that under certain condition must become engaged to condition did not suit engagement be ever made mr grey know history of whole thing a far a be possible have told everything took place fact be alice that george vavasor mode of life be such that engagement with must have be absolute madness dear aunt must excuse if say can not discus george vavasor mode of life if be thinking of becoming wife must have perfect right to discus because of constant kindness to a matter be be simply cousin a like have better say nothing about must say after what have passed at present crisis of life dear aunt be not in crisis yes be alice in most special crisis of girl life be still girl be promised wife of very worthy man who will look to for domestic happiness george vavasor have name at least of being very wild worthy man wild man must fight out between if be going away with george by there might be something in what say must be monstrous monstrous not be what be about to do kate have put purse together be going to have outing for special fun gratification a must be poor traveller alone george have promised to go with sister papa know about never thought of making objection lady macleod shook head did not like to say anything against mr vavasor before daughter shaking of head be intended to signify mr vavasor assent in such matter be worth nothing can only say again said lady macleod think mr grey will be displeased that will have very great cause for displeasure think moreover that approbation ought to be chief study believe dear will ask to let jane get cab sha have bit too much time to dress for concert alice simply rang bell said further word on subject have be discussing when lady macleod got up to go away alice kissed a be customary with old lady a went uttered customary valediction god bless dear good bye will come to morrow if can there be therefore quarrel between of felt that word have be spoken must probably lead to diminution of past intimacy when lady macleod have gone alice sat alone for hour thinking of what have passed between thinking rather of two men worthy man wild man whose name have be mentioned in close connection with john grey be worthy man man worthy at point a far a knew told be so told also that cousin george be wild very wild yet thought be fear on whole more kindly towards cousin than towards lover have declared to aunt that john grey must be incapable of such suspicion a must be shown by objection on part to arrangement made for tour have said so have so believed yet continued to brood over position affair must take if did make objection lady macleod anticipated told over over again that under such circumstance must not give way inch be free to go said to herself if doe not trust be quite free to go may almost be said that came at last to anticipate from lover very answer to own letter have declared to be incapable of making chapter iii john grey worthy man mr grey answer to alice vavasor letter be duly sent by return of post duly received on morning after lady macleod visit may perhaps be taken a giving sample of worthiness be dated from nethercoats small country house in cambridgeshire belonged to at already spent much of time at intended to live altogether after marriage nethercoats june dearest alice be glad have settled affair foreign affair mean so much to mind a to home affair be not to thinking quite so satisfactorily arranged a be party interested in latter opinion may perhaps have undue bias touching tour quite agree with that kate must have be uncomfortable alone be very fine theory that of woman being able to get along without men a well a with like other fine theory will be found very troublesome by who first put in practice gloved hand petticoat feminine softness general homage paid to beauty stand in way of success thing may perhaps day be got rid of possibly with advantage while young lady be still encumbered with male companion will always be found to be comfort quite know whether cousin george be best possible knight might have chosen must consider to be infinitely preferable have going be upon card be in danger of meeting paynim foe doubt must kill off much quicker than must do must be much more serviceable in liberating from dungeon of oppressor even from stray tiger in swiss forest doubt being punctual with luggage will want kate to keep account if be kept will be slow in getting glass of water at railway station will always keep waiting at breakfast hold that man with two lady on tour must be absolute slave to will not fully enjoy must simply be upper servant with privilege of sitting at same table with mistress have doubt a to whether cousin be fit for place a to myself be just thing be made for luckily however kate be without will of own perhaps may be able to reduce mr vavasor to obedience a to home affair have very little to say here in letter will of course run up see before start will probably stay week in town know ought not to do so a will be week of idleness yet not week of happiness sooner have hour with in country than whole day in london always feel in town that have too much to do to allow of doing anything if be sheer idleness must enjoy be feverish idleness in one be driven here there expecting gratification not only never come never even begin to come will however undergo week of say last seven day of month will trust to to recompense by a much of a town doings will permit now again a to home affair if say nothing now believe will understand why refrain have cunningly just left to imply from what say that argument have be of avail answer even tell that have decided will therefore imply nothing still trust to personal eloquence for success rather not trust not trust hope garden be going on very well be rather short of water therefore not quite a bright a have hoped be preparing with untiring industry for future brightness command have be obeyed in thing morrison always say mistress did mean mistress did intend that god bless mistress be what now say send home to own home to flower fruit house husband a soon a may be with more of delay be to so grievous seem to to be so unnecessary that be prayer yours ever always j g did give command alice said to herself a sat with letter at solitary breakfast table asked how liked thing of course be obliged to say be obliged to seem to care even if did care such be first thought a put letter back into envelope after reading second time when opened did quickly not pausing moment lest must suspect herself of fearing to see what might be content mind be full of rebuke aunt have anticipated have almost taught to expect have torn letter open rapidly have dashed at content with quick eye in moment have seen be nature of reply respecting proposed companion of tour then have completed reading slowly enough gave command repeated to herself a though might thereby absolve from blame in reference to possible future accusation might perhaps be brought against under certain circumstance be contemplating then considered letter bit by bit taking backwards sipping tea now then amidst thought have home no house there have husband not a yet spoke of engagement a though be betrothal a betrothal used to be of yore a though be already in sort married such betrothal be not made now day there still remained to to certain liberty of extricating from engagement must come to say that found that contemplated marriage must not make happy must not release without word of reproach must not regard a much more honourable in doing so than in adhering to marriage be distasteful to if must so judge judge certainly acquit be not reasonable that under similar circumstance must expect similar acquittal then declared to herself that carried on argument within own breast simply a argument induced to do so by assertion on part that be already husband that house be even now home have intention of using power be still hers have wish to go back from pledged word thought that have such wish loved much admired even more than loved be noble generous clever good so good a to be almost perfect nay for aught knew be perfect must that have fault must

default in not doing so have intended to fight bravely to have maintained excellence of present position a affianced bride of mr grey felt that have failed felt that have in sort acknowledged that

soon found that amusement must interfere with lady dress affair have become too serious to allow of trivial interruption really think mr cheesacre anxious mother have said that 'd better give up water off nasty cord have got over maria dress already maria made faint protest that did not signify in least fishing be given up not without inward feeling on part of mr cheesacre that if maria chose to come out with in boat having be invited especially to fish ought to have put up with natural result there be people who like to take everything never like to give anything said to kate afterwards a be walking up with to picnic dinner be unreasonable unjust girl have graced party with best hat freshest muslin not that might see catch mackerel that might flirt dance to best advantage ca suppose that girl will like to be drenched with sea water when have taken so much trouble with starch said kate then must come fishing said mr cheesacre hate such air when arrived at old boat mr greenow shone

matter have not chance against mr greenow be disposed to think that must have reigned even though have not contributed to eatable with point in favour be able to make supreme jeannette too be servant be great thing mr cheesacre soon gave way though bustled about be conspicuous bustled about in obedience to order received became head servant captain bellfield also made useful drove mr cheesacre

mr greenow constantly have head in same hamper by mean intend to insinuate that there be anything wrong in people engaged together in unpacking pie cold chicken must have head in same hamper great intimacy be thereby produced widow seemed to have laid aside altogether that prejudice of hers with reference to washerwoman there be long table placed on sand sheltered by upturned boat from land side open towards sea over supported on pole there be awning upon whole arrangement be not uncomfortable one for people who have selected so very uncomfortable dining room a sand of sea shore much be certainly due to mr cheesacre for expenditure have incurred something perhaps to captain bellfield for ingenuity in having suggested now came placing of guest for dinner mr cheesacre made great effort will tell what said aloud bellfield will take two end of table mr greenow will sit at right hand be not only boldly done there be propriety in at first sight seemed to be irresistible much a have hated did hate captain have skilfully made proposition in such way a to flatter seemed for few moment a though be going to have own way captain bellfield be not man to submit to defeat in such matter a without effort think will do said mr greenow give dinner cheesacre give wine must have at two end of table be sure mr greenow wo refuse to allow to hand to place belongs to will sit at right hand be minister mr greenow did not refuse so matter be adjusted mr cheesacre took seat in despair be nothing to that have kate vavasor at left hand liked talking to kate very well must not enjoy that pleasure while captain bellfield be in very act of making progress with widow one must think that have given must said to maria mother who sat at right hand lady did not in least understand given what said why music wine rest of there be people full of kind of impudence how manage to carry on without ever paying shilling never must tell know have to pay way something over beyond generally maria mother said yes indeed have other daughter there besides maria be looking down table to see whether be judiciously placed beauty youngest one ophelia be sitting next to ne'er do well joe fairstairs made unhappy ophelia dear be dreadfully in draught there be seat up here just opposite where will be more comfortable there be draught here mamma said ophelia without slightest sign of moving perhaps ophelia liked society of lanky idle useless young man mirth of table certainly came from mr greenow end widow have hardly taken place before got up again changed with captain be found that captain must better carve great grouse pie from end than from side cheesacre when saw absolutely threw down knife fork violently upon table be anything matter said maria mother matter said then shook head in grief of heart vexation of spirit resumed knife fork kate watched be greatly amused never saw man so nearly broken hearted said in letter to alice next day eleven thirteen eighteen twenty one said cheesacre to reckoning up in misery number of pound sterling must have to pay for being ill treated in way lady gentleman said captain bellfield a soon a eating be over if may be permitted to get upon leg for two minute be going to propose toast to real patron of feast have actually not yet swallowed last bit of cheese thing be indecent in violence of injustice illustration captain bellfield proposes toast if please captain bellfield said patron indifferent to cheese in throat will propose toast nothing on earth must be better dear fellow said captain be sure must be last man in world to take job out of hand of one who must do so much better than can a be health that be going to drink really see how be to do cheesacre grunted sat down certainly must not propose own health did complain of honour be to be done be very proper that health must be drunk have now to think of word in must return thanks extent of horror may be imagined when bellfield got up made most brilliant speech in praise of mr greenow for full five minute went on without mentioning name of cheesacre yarmouth said have never in day be so blessed a have be year by presence of lady who be now with have come among declared forgetful of herself of great sorrow with sole desire of adding something to happiness of others then mr greenow have taken out pocket handkerchief sweeping back broad ribbon of cap over shoulder altogether scene be very affecting cheesacre be driven to madness be very word that have intended to speak hate kind of thing said to kate be so fulsome after dinner speech never mean anything said kate at last when bellfield have come to end of praising mr greenow told guest that wished to join friend mr cheesacre in toast more so a must hardly be hoped that mr greenow must herself rise to return thanks there be better fellow than friend cheesacre whom have known for must not say how many year be quite sure must have most sincere pleasure in joining health of mr cheesacre with of mr greenow then there be clattering of glass murmuring of health mr cheesacre slowly got upon leg be very much obliged to company said to friend bellfield who really be perhaps doe signify now have have greatest pleasure in getting up little thing 'd made up mind to propose mr greenow health h be have doubt have be in better hand perhaps considering thing bellfield might have waited with such subject on hand must wait moment did interrupt captain bellfield perhaps will let go on without interrupting have drunk mr greenow health be sure be very much obliged so be for honour have done have taken trouble in getting up little thing hope like think somebody said something about liberality beg to assure that think of for moment somebody must pay for sort of thing be always very glad to take turn dare say bellfield will give next picnic if will appoint day before end of month will be happy to be one of party then sat down with inward satisfaction fully convinced that have given enemy fatal blow nothing on earth must give so much pleasure said bellfield after that turned again to mr greenow went on with private conversation there be more speaking be there much time for other after dinner ceremony three horn cymbal triangle drum be soon heard tuning up behind banqueting hall lady went to further end of old boat to make preparation for dance then be that thoughtful care of mr greenow in having sent jeannette with brush comb clean handkerchief other little knick knackeries became so apparent be said that widow actually changed cap be considered by to be very unfair a there have be understanding that there must be dressing on such occasion lady be generally willing to forego advantage of dressing on condition that other lady will forego same advantage when compact be broken by special lady treason be thought to be very treacherous be a though fencer must remove button from end of foil mr greenow be so good natured in tendering service of jeannette to young lady be so willing to share with others good thing of toilet care have provided that cap be forgiven by most of present when lady have made up mind to dance will dance let

well for venus to make promise when making knew that adonis must not keep her to word let lightest limbed nymph try will find that leaf most palpable footing sand in question be doubtless compact firm sufficiently moist to make walking on comfortable ruffled most uncomfortably under unwonted pressure to be subjected nevertheless friend did dance on sand finding however that quadrille sir roger de coverley suited better than polka waltz friend mr greenow said to mr cheesacre when gentleman endeavoured to persuade to stand up kate will be delighted be sure to join a for must excuse mr cheesacre be not inclined at moment to ask kate vavasor to dance with be possessed by undefined idea kate have snubbed a kate fortune be a said literally nothing be not at disposed to court favour at expense of such suffering to be not quite sure that will dance said seating in corner of tent by mr greenow side captain bellfield at moment be seen leading miss vavasor away to new place on sand be followed by score of dancer mr cheesacre saw that now at last might reap reward for have laboured be alone with widow having be made bold by wine have opportunity of fighting battle than none better must ever be found be by mean poor man despised poverty in others be well that there must be poor gentry in order that might act a satellite to who like have money a to mr greenow money there be doubt knew to fraction have spread for herself one else have spread for report that wealth be almost unlimited forty thousand pound be fact such innocent fault a little fiction might well be forgiven to woman endorsed with such substantial virtue be handsome too mr cheesacre a regarded matured charm sometimes felt that must have be smitten even without forty thousand pound by george there be flesh blood have once said to friend bellfield before have begun to suspect man treachery admiration must then have be sincere for at time forty thousand pound be not ascertained fact looking at matter in bearing mr cheesacre thought that must do better wooing must be fair honest above board be thriving man what might not two do in norfolk if put wealth together oh mr cheesacre must join said mr greenow will

go to lady macleod at cheltenham before end of month be in truth prompted to by resolution of be hardly conscious that must not at period of life be in way guided by cousin having made up mind about mr grey be right that must let cousin know purpose must never be driven to confess to herself that kate have influenced in matter must go to cheltenham lady macleod must doubt vex by hourly

matter since sunday morning on saw in own room in cecil street can turn into capital to morrow if plea have said to when thinking of income have also reminded that grandfather must probably enable to settle income out of property upon alice in event of being married then have also felt that must have greater triumph than walking atop of john grey a called return for chelsea district must hardly be sweeter to than that must have thought have vanished out of world said george coming up to with extended hand alice be confused hardly knew how to address somebody told that be shooting said after pause so be shooting be not like shooting of great nimrod men who be hunter upon earth two day among grouse two more among partridge be about extent of capel court be preserve in be usually to be found alice knew nothing of capel court said oh indeed have heard from kate george asked yes once twice be still at yarmouth with aunt greenow be going to norwich a say kate seems to have made league

wine business must have done anything pleased for grandfather obstinacy put out of now be beginning world again be comparatively wonder whether think be wrong in trying to get into parliament quite right admire for be just what must do in place be unmarried have right to run risk be so glad to hear speak like said have now managed to take up friendly confidential almost affectionate tone of talking have so often used when abroad with have failed to assume when first entering room have always thought so have never said have thought have not heartily like know that people abuse own people grandfather probably father saying that be reckless rest of do risk everything for object know that one can blame unless be kate to whom else do owe anything kate doe not blame sympathizes with only unless be then paused for answer made none be brave enough to give hearty sympathy perhaps for very reason ought to be more chary in endangering only support that be like to have what be ninety pound year for maintenance of single lady hope that kate will always live with said alice be a soon a have lost home at vavasor hall have be very crafty have laid trap for have laid trap for have fallen into have determined not to be induced to talk of herself have brought thing round so cunningly that word be out of mouth before remembered whither must lead did remember a be speaking then be too late what at nethercoats said neither doubt love few men must like such intruder a into household of men mr grey whose nature be retiring must like least be not thinking of nethercoats said alice ah be see kate say so often to that when be married will be alone in world think will ever find that will separate from not by will of own poor kate can not be surprised that must think of marriage with dread how much of life have be made up of companionship with best of too ought not to be angry with for regarding withdrawal into cambridgeshire with dismay alice must not act lie now seemed to be incumbent on must not let talk of nethercoats a though be to be future home made struggle found that must not do be unable to find word must tell lie to ear must yet deceive kate may still live with said slowly everything be over between mr grey alice be that true yes george be true if will allow to say so must rather not talk about not just at present doe kate know kate know uncle yes papa know also alice how can help speaking of how can not tell that be rejoiced that be saved from thraldom have long felt sure must break heart pray talk of further well if be forbidden will of course obey own be hard to how can not congratulate to answered nothing beat with foot upon floor a though be impatient of word yes alice understand be angry with continued yet have right to be surprised that when tell must think of passed between in switzerland surely cousin who be with then have right to say what think of change in life at rate may do so if a in case approves altogether of what be doing be glad of approval george pray let be end to after that two sat silent for minute two be waiting for to go must not bid leave house be angry with in have allowed to tell of altered plan be angry with because must not understand that ought to be spared conversation on subject so sat looking through window at row of gaslight a be being lit remained in chair with elbow on table head resting on hand do remember asking whether ever shivered said at last whether ever thought of thing made shiver remember on bridge at basle yes remember well alice one cause for shivering be over wo say more than now will remain long at cheltenham just month then come back here suppose so papa will probably go down to vavasor hall before christmas how much before can not say will see at rate after return from cheltenham of course kate will know will tell yes kate will know suppose will stay here when come up from norfolk good bye good bye alice will have fewer fit of inward shivering that spoke of many le on account of what have now heard god bless alice good bye good bye george a went took hand pressed closely between own in day when be lover engaged lover close long continued pressure of hand have be most eloquent speech of love have not be given to many kiss not even to many word of love must take hand hold even a looked away from remembered well touch of palm be ever cool cool with surface smooth a woman small hand have firm grip there have be day when have loved to feel that own be within when trusted in intended that must be staff through life now distrusted a thought of old day came upon remembrance of touch be recalled drew hand away rapidly not for have driven from a honest man a have ever wished to mate with woman george vavasor have never so held hand since day when have parted now on first occasion of freedom felt again what did think of did suppose that must transfer love in way a flower may be taken from one buttonhole placed in read knew that be hurrying on too quickly can understand well said in whisper what present feeling be think will be really angry with because have be unable to repress joy at what can not regard a release from great misfortune then went release said seating on chair from have risen release from misfortune fall from heaven oh what man be that must have loved must have driven away from thought travelled off to sweetness of home at nethercoats to excellence of master who might have be hers then in agony of despair told that have be idiot fool a well a traitor have wanted in life that must have thus quarrelled with a happy lot a ever have be offered to woman have not be mad when sent from side only man that loved only man that have ever truly respected for hour sat there alone putting out candle servant have lighted for leaving untasted tea be brought to poor alice hope that may be forgiven be special fault that when at rome longed for tibur when at tibur regretted rome not that cousin george be to be taken a representing joy of great capital though mr grey may be presumed to form inconsiderable part of promised delight of country now that have sacrificed tibur because have seemed to that sunny quiet of pasture lacked excitement necessary for happiness of life be again prepared to quarrel with heartlessness of rome already be again sighing for tranquillity of country sitting there full of regret declared to herself that must wait for father return then throwing upon love upon mercy must beg to go to mr grey ask for pardon for must be very humble to said be so good that may dare to be humble before so waited for father waited till twelve till one till two still did not come later than that did not dare to wait for feared to trust on such business returning so late a after so many cigar after perhaps superfluous beaker of club nectar temper at moment must not be fit for such work a hers if be late in coming home who have sent away from home in unhappiness between two three went to bed on following morning left queen anne street for great western station before father be up chapter xv paramount crescent lady macleod lived at paramount crescent in cheltenham where occupied very handsome first floor drawing room with bedroom behind looking over stable yard small room must have be dressing room have late sir archibald be alive be at present called dining room in lady macleod did dine whenever larger room be to be used for purpose of evening company vicinity of stable yard be not regarded by tenant a among attraction of house have effect of lowering rent lady macleod be woman who regarded such matter income though small must have sufficed to enable to live removed from such discomfort be one of woman who regard a duty to leave something behind even though be left to who at want lady macleod be woman who wilfully neglected duty so pinched inhaled effluvium of stable squabbled with cabman in order that might bequeath thousand pound two to lady midlothian who cared perhaps little for must hardly thank memory for money have alice consented to live with must have merged that duty of leaving money behind in other duty of finding home for adopted niece alice have gone away therefore money be due to lady midlothian rather than to saving however be postponed whenever alice must consent to visit cheltenham bedroom be secured for did not look out over stable accommodation be also found for maid much better than provided for lady macleod own maid be hospitable good old woman painfully struggling to do best must in world be pity that be such bore pity that be so hard to cabman others pity that suspected tradesman servant people generally of rank of life inferior to own pity that be disposed to condemn for ever ever so many of own rank because played card on week day did not go to church on sunday pity a think above while be so suspicious of poor be so lenient to vice of earl earl son such like alice having fully considered matter have thought most prudent to tell lady macleod by letter what have done in regard to mr grey there have be many objection to writing of such letter there appeared to be stronger objection to telling face to face must have be forced upon have not written there must in such case have arisen on lady macleod countenance sternness of rebuke alice did not choose to encounter same sternness of rebuke must come upon countenance on receipt of written information must come in most aggravated form on immediate receipt of letter of bitterness must have passed away before alice arrival think that alice be right be better for party that great offence must be confessed by letter alice trembled a cab drew up at paramount crescent met aunt a be usual just inside drawing room door saw at once that if bitterness have passed away from face original bitterness must indeed have be bitter have so timed letter that lady macleod must have opportunity of answering answer be written there in mingled anger sorrow of austere feature alice said a took niece in arm kissed oh alice what be yes aunt be very bad know poor alice tried to make jest of young lady be very wicked when know own mind if have known have be wicked what can do repent repent said lady macleod yes hope will repent poor mr grey what must think of can only hope aunt that wo think of at for very long that be nonsense dear of course will think of of course will marry will aunt of course will why alice have be settled among family lady midlothian knew particular of just a well a did be not word pledged to really understand what mean see how be possible must go back gentleman when do kind of thing be put out of society really think be worse in woman then may if please put out of society only that know be particularly in wickedness of thing alice be obliged to say so when talk to about society aunt about lady midlothian give up to willingly more willingly perhaps because care much for one other here lady macleod tried to say word failed alice went on boldly looking up into aunt face became shade more bitter than ever when tell about wickedness conscience then must be own judge be conscience fear of committing wickedness have made do must submit to be guided by elder alice elder in such matter a can not teach can not be right must go to man house be wife if think that can make happy then why did accept because be mistaken be not going to defend that if choose to scold for that may do so aunt will not answer a to marrying not marrying now a to must judge for be pity did not know own mind earlier be pity great pity have done injury be quite irretrievable know be prepared to bear have done too injustice regret with whole heart can only excuse by saying that might have done worse injustice be said at very moment of arrival greeting did not seem to promise much for happiness of next month perhaps be better for that attack defence must thus be made suddenly at first meeting be better to pull string at once when be in shower bath not to stand shivering thinking of inevitable shock can only postpone for few minute lady macleod in case have pulled string thus reaped advantage of alacrity well dear said ladyship suppose will like to go up stair take off bonnet mary will bring tea when come down so alice escaped when returned to comfort of cup of tea in drawing room fury of storm have passed away sat talking of other thing till dinner though lady macleod did during evening make one allusion to poor mr grey subject be allowed to drop alice be very tender a to aunt ailment be more than ordinarily attentive to long list of cheltenham iniquity be displayed to refrained from combating of aunt religious view after while got upon subject of aunt greenow for whose name lady macleod have special aversion a indeed have for vavasor side of alice family then alice offered to read did read to aunt many page out of one of terrible book of wrath from time to time come forth tell that there be hope for lady macleod liked to be so told a now poor woman must not read at night enjoyed evening lady macleod doubt did enjoy niece sojourn at cheltenham think must have be pleasant to alice on second day nothing be said about mr grey alice hoped that by continual reading in book of wrath aunt heart might be softened towards seemed that lady macleod measured period of respite for on third day on fifth returned to attack did john grey still wish that match must go on asked categorically be in vain that alice tried to put aside question begged that matter might not be discussed lady macleod insisted on right to carry on examination alice be driven to acknowledge that believed did wish must hardly say otherwise seeing that have at moment letter from in pocket in still spoke of engagement a being absolutely binding on expressed hope that change from london to cheltenham must bring round set everything to right certainly did in fashion wave hand over a kate have said of letter alice have resolved that must not answer must probably write again must beg to desist instead of cheltenham bringing round cheltenham have made firmer than ever in resolution be inclined to think that best mode of bringing round at moment must have be course of visit from cousin george series of letter from cousin kate lady macleod injunction must certainly not bring round after ten day ten terrible day devoted to discussion on matrimony in morning to book of wrath in evening relieved by two tea party in sin of cheltenham be discussed at length lady macleod got letter from mr grey mr grey kindest compliment to lady macleod believed that lady macleod be aware of circumstance of engagement with miss vavasor might call on miss vavasor at lady macleod house in cheltenham might also hope to have pleasure of making lady macleod acquaintance alice have be in room when aunt received letter aunt have said nothing alice have not known from whom letter have come when aunt crept away with after breakfast have suspected nothing have never imagined that lady macleod in privacy of own room looking out upon stable have addressed letter to nethercoats letter have be addressed to nethercoats mr grey have be informed that must be received in paramount crescent with great pleasure mr grey have even indicated day on must come on morning of day lady macleod have presided over two teacup in state of nervous excitement be quite visible to alice more than once alice asked little question not supposing that be specially concerned in matter have caused aunt fidgety restlessness observing so plainly that be almost impossible not to allude to there be nothing matter dear at at last lady macleod said a said so be making up mind that moment have not come in must apprise alice of mr grey intended visit a alice have questioned at breakfast table must say nothing about then waited till teacup be withdrawn till maid have given last officious poke to fire then began have mr grey letter in pocket a prepared to speak pulled out held on little table before alice said expect visitor here to day alice knew instantly who be expected visitor probably girl under such circumstance must have known equally well visitor aunt said managed to hide knowledge admirably yes alice visitor must have told before only thought thought have better not be mr mr grey indeed aunt be coming to see well be desirous doubt of seeing more especially have expressed wish to make acquaintance can not under circumstance think be unnatural of course alice must want to talk over affair with friend wish must have spared said alice wish must have brought letter here can see if please be very nicely written a far a be concerned must not think of refusing to see now come question what be to do with be to ask to dinner take for granted that will not expect to offer bed a know that live in lodging oh aunt certainly will not expect that ought to ask to dinner must be most happy to entertain though know how very scanty mean of doing so be really know how might be between mean must not fight aunt suppose not if can not be affectionate in manner to will not answer for manner aunt may be sure of must be affectionate in heart will always regard a dearly loved friend though for many year doubt will be unable to express friendship may be very well alice will not be what will want think upon whole have better not ask to dinner perhaps not aunt be period of day in special constraint among people be more disagreeable than at other time then at dinner servant must see think there might be awkwardness if be to dine here really think there must said alice anxious to have subject dropped hope wo think that be inhospitable must be so happy to do best must for for regard alice quite a though be to be husband when anybody at connected with have come to cheltenham always have asked to dine then have gubbins man to come wait at table a know of men in world mr grey be last to think about must only make more careful think must perhaps be more comfortable if be to come in evening much more comfortable aunt suppose will be here in afternoon before dinner have better wait at home for dare say will want to see alone therefore will retire to own room looking over stable dear old lady if wish will receive first then martha martha be alice maid can fetch down discussion a to propriety impropriety of giving lover dinner have not be pleasant to alice nevertheless when be over felt grateful to lady macleod there be attempt in arrangement to make mr grey visit a little painful a possible though such discussion at time might a well have be avoided decision to ladyship have at last come with reference to dinner management of visit be doubt right one lady macleod have be quite correct in anticipation at three o'clock mr grey be announced lady macleod alone received in drawing room have intended to give great deal of good advice to bid still keep up heart a be hold up head to confess to how very badly alice be behaving to express entire concurrence with theory of bodily ailment a cause origin of conduct found that mr grey be man to whom must not give much advice be who did

come in here have asked often enough said maxwell not because like because want so often to make up rubber like george vavasor know who doe like better than dummy 'd sooner play whist with men like grindems than 'd not play at bystander might have thought from tone of mr maxwell voice that be alluding to mr grindley mr grindley did seem to take in light be true of course said ca pick men just a please certainly did think that 'd make out for season club breakfasted next morning at nine o'clock in order that might start at half past for meet at edgehill edgehill be twelve mile from roebury

vavasor if be said grindley never have anything be right round who have said maxwell a took into plate second mutton chop have just be brought up hot into room especially for be mistake men make about horse be why there be so much cheating never ask for warranty with horse very often have horse examined yet do a well a others ca have perfect horse more than can perfect men perfect woman put up with red hair bad teeth big foot sometimes with devil of voice man when want horse wo put up with anything therefore who have got horse to sell must lie when go into market with three hundred pound expect perfect animal a never do now never expect perfect animal like to see like to have four leg like to have little wind much mind anything else by jove be about right said calder jones reader will therefore readily see that mr maxwell banker reigned a king in club vavasor have sent two horse on in charge of bat smithers followed on pony about fourteen hand high have ridden a cover hack for last four year did not start till near ten be able to catch bat with two horse about mile half on side of edgehill have managed to come along pretty clean master asked a came up with servant be most beastly road in england said bat who always found fault with county in happened to be located will warrant be cleaner than most on what for county must make such road a never must tell road about there be bad certainly very bad suppose must have be better have providence sent better material what do think of brown horse bat well sir said more that said with drawl be a fine animal to look at a ever put eye on said george be said bat be got lot of pace too be sure have sir tell ca beat at jumping can mostly do sir if be well handled see be deal over weight yes be mr vavasor be fourteen stoner fifteen said vavasor perhaps may sir there be knowing what 'orse can carry till be tried george asked groom more question felt sure that have better sell brown horse if must now here protest that there be nothing specially amiss with brown horse towards end of preceding season have overreached have be lame have be sold by owner with more money than brain who have not cared to wait for cure then there have gone with bad character vague suspicion have attached to a there doe to hundred of horse be very good animal in way have come thus to tattersall vavasor have bought cheap thinking that might make money of from form action have found nothing amiss with indeed have bat smithers character went with therefore bat smithers thought well to be knowing george vavasor knew a much of horse a most men can a perhaps a man can who be not dealer veterinary surgeon like men doubted own knowledge though on subject must never admit that doubted therefore took bat word felt sure that horse be wrong will have run from big wood said george if make un break will sir said bat at rate will ride brown horse said george then a soon a be settled between roebury club overtook there be now rush of horse on road altogether be within quarter of mile of edgehill church close to be meet bat with two hunter fell little behind others trotted on together other groom with animal be on in advance be by time employed in combing out forelock rubbing stirrup leather horse leg free from dirt of road bat smithers be like master did not congregate much with other men vavasor be sure to give order to servant different from order given by others be well mounted year maxwell asked of george vavasor indeed never be what call well mounted yet generally have one horse three four cripple brown horse behind there be pretty good believe see man have got old chestnut mare with be one of cripple not what be a sound a bell a good hunter a ever wish to ride make little noise when be going so that can hear three field off said grindley five if field be small enough ear be sharp enough said vavasor same must change for best horse ever saw under have there grindems said maxwell no did said grindley did have at horse grindley be always up to work have to do said george know what man want more than have again grindems said maxwell can ride against day said grindley yes against brick wall if horse did know better said george have again grindems said maxwell whereupon mr grindley trotted on round corner by church into field in hound be assembled fire have become too hot for thought best to escape have be vavasor alone must have turned upon snarled must not afford to exhibit ill temper to king of club mr grindley be not popular be maxwell to turn openly against sporting life down at roebury must decidedly be failure life of such men a mr grindley men who be tolerated in daily society of others who be accounted superior seem to have many attraction yet how many such men doe one see in almost set why mr grindley must have be inferior to mr maxwell banker to stone to prettyman who be brewer even to mr pollock heavy weight literary gentleman can hardly say attorney by trade be at rate a good a brewer there be many attorney who hold head high anywhere grindley be rich man at rate rich enough for life led know much about birth believe be a good a maxwell be not ignorant fool whereas rather think maxwell be fool grindley have made own way in world maxwell must certainly not have made banker if father have not be banker before must bank have gone on prospered have there not be partner there who be better men of business than friend grindley knew that have better intellect than maxwell yet allowed maxwell to snub toadied maxwell in return be not on score of riding maxwell claimed held superiority for grindley did not want pluck one knew maxwell have lived freely that nerve be not what have be think have come from outward look of men from form of from gait visage in one be good in other insignificant nature of such dominion of man over man be very singular be certain that when once obtained in manhood may be easily held among boy at school same thing be even more conspicuous because boy have le of conscience than men be more addicted to tyranny when weak be le prone to feel misery disgrace of succumbing who have be through large school doe not remember maxwell grindleys tyrant slave who domineered who submitted be even then personal strength always superior courage gave power of command be intellect thoughtfulness by mean such quality a make men boy lovable be said by many who have have to deal with boy certain among claim obtain ascendancy by spirit within doubt whether ascendancy be not rather thrust on than claimed by here again think outward gait of boy go far towards obtaining for submission of fellow tyrant boy doe not become tyrant man slave boy slave man because outward visage have be noble mean in one change becomes so often mean noble in other by george there be pollock said maxwell a rode into field by church will bet crown that be come down from london morning that be up all night last night that tell so three time before hound go out of paddock mr pollock be heavy weight sporting literary gentleman chapter xvii edgehill of sight in world there be think none more beautiful than of pack of fox hound seated on winter morning round huntsman if place of meeting have be chosen with anything of artistic skill must be in grassy field field must be small must not be absolutely away from building hedgerow must not have be clipped pared made straight with reference to modern agricultural economy there must be tree near ground must be little uneven so a to mark certain small space a exact spot where dog servant of hunt must congregate there be well known grand meet in england in park of nobleman before house even on what be called lawn magnificent affair have little of beauty of speak such assembly be too grand too ornate moreover much too far removed from true sporting propriety at equipage be shining lady dress be gorgeous crowd of tradesman from neighbouring town have come there to look at grand folk to eye there be nothing beautiful in meet speak of be arranged with view to sport accident of locality may make prettiest thing in world such in special degree be case at edgehill at whole village consisted of three four cottage there be small old church with old grey tower narrow green almost dark churchyard surrounded by elm tree road from roebury to meet passed by church stile turning just beyond came upon gate led into little field in hound felt a much at home a in kennel there might be six seven acre in field be long narrow so that huntsman have space to walk leisurely up down with pack clustering round when considered that longer sitting might chill church tower be close at hand visible through tree field be green soft though never splashing with mud heavy with hole edgehill be favourite meet in country partly because fox be very abundant in great wood adjacent partly because whole country around be grass land partly doubt from sporting propensity of neighbouring population a regard own taste know do like beginning day with great wood if not beginning certainly not ending be hard to come upon cream of hunting a be upon cream of other delight who can always drink lafitte of finest can always talk to woman who be beautiful witty can always find right spirit in poetry read man have usually to work through much mud before get nugget be so certainly in hunting big wood too frequently afflicts sportsman a mud doe miner small gorse cover be happy much envied bit of ground in gold be sure to show readily without wood gorse must not hold fox without mud gold must not have found resting place a have said edgehill be popular meet a regarded meet be eminently picturesque on present occasion little field be full of horseman moving about slowly chatting together smoking cigar getting off from hack mounting hunter giving order to servant preparing for day there be old country gentleman there greeting other from far side of county sporting farmer who love to find alongside landlord to feel that pleasure of country be common to men down from town like friend of roebury club who made hunting chosen pleasure who formed in number perhaps largest portion of

baronet be just descending a maxwell calder jones vavasor rode into field illustration edgehill hope see well sir william said maxwell greeting master calder jones also made little speech so did vavasor humph well yes be pretty well thank'ee just move on will mare ca stir here then one else spoke to only grunted in answer having slowly be assisted up on to horse for be over seventy year of age trotted off to hound while farmer round touched hat to mind be laden with affair of import noticed one in whispered voice gave instruction to huntsman who said yes sir william sir william doubt sir william one long eared long legged fellow in hunting cap scarlet coat hung listening by anxious to catch something of order for morning who devil fellow be breech boot said sir william aloud to one near a huntsman moved off with hound sir william knew man well enough be minded to punish for discourtesy where will find first sir william said calder jones in voice be really very humble how mischief be to know where fox be said sir william with oath calder jones retired unhappy for moment altogether silenced yet sir william be most popular man in county more courteous gentleman ever sat at bottom of own table mild man be too when out of saddle one by mean disposed to assume special supremacy master of hound if have long held country sir william have held for more than thirty year obtains power that of other potentate can equal may say do what plea tyranny be always respected conspiracy against have chance of success sedition will meet with sympathy be if be successful in showing sport if man be sworn at abused put down without cause let bear think that have be victim for public good let never be angry with master rough tongue be necessity of master position used to say that captain must manage ship without swearing at men be captain trouble in comparison with of master of hound captain men be under discipline can be locked up flogged have grog stopped master of hound can not stop grog of offender can only stop tongue horse of such one by very sharp word well pollock when did come said maxwell by george said literary gentleman just down from london by from euston square got over here from winslow in trap with two fellow never saw in life before came tandem in fly did nineteen mile in hour come athenian draw mild said maxwell did indeed wonder whether will pay share of fly have to leave onslow crescent at quarter before eight did three hour work before started then did by candle light said grindley of course did why must do suppose one can work by candle light except lawyer suppose fellow be playing whist drinking hard be uncommon glad be with for will be able to ride bet pound said jones if there be run see more of than will take bet with jones said grindley vavasor will be judge gentleman hound ca get out if will stop up gate said sir william then pack passed through trotted on for four mile to cranby wood vavasor a rode on to wood be alone speaking from time to time few word to servant will ride chestnut mare in wood said do keep near bea to be galloping up down ride suppose said bat almost contemptuously sha gallop up down ride do mark to know where be so that can change if fox must go away will be here day sir that belief if so wo ride brown horse at do take care to let have if there be chance do understand oh yes understand sir there ai difficulty in understanding only think sir will ever get fox out of wood to day why stand to reason wind from north east cranby wood be very large there being in truth two three wood together be nearly twelve before found then for hour there be great excitement among men who rode up down ride a hound drove fox from one end to of enclosure once twice poor animal did try to go away then there be great hallooing galloping jumping over unnecessary fence be headed back again changed mind not liking north east wind of bat smithers have predicted such bad thing after one crowd of men became rather more indifferent clustered together in broad spot eating lunch smoking cigar chaffing other be singular to observe amazing quantity of ham sandwich of sherry have be carried into cranby wood on day groom appeared to have be laden with case men be a well armed with flask at saddle bow a used to be with pistol maxwell pollock formed centre of one of crowd chaffed other with utmost industry till tired of having inflicted wound turned upon grindley drove out of circle will make man cut throat if go on at said pollock will said maxwell then will certainly stick to for sake of humanity in general during time vavasor sat apart quite alone bat smithers grimly kept place about three hundred yard from sha do good to day said grindley coming up to vavasor be sure know said vavasor that old fellow have got to be so stupid doe know what be about said grindley meaning sir william how can make fox break said vavasor a voice be by mean encouraging grindley rode away lunch cigar lasted till two during hour hound huntsman whip old sir william be hard at work a also be few others who persistently followed chance of game from till three there be two three flash in pan false report a to fox have gone away first set men galloping then made very angry after three men began to say naughty thing to abuse cranby wood to wish violently that have remained at home gone elsewhere to speak irreverently of ancient master be cussidest place in creation said maxwell often said 'd not come here more now say again yet will be here next meet said grindley who have sneaked back to old companion in weariness of spirit grindems know sight too much said maxwell do indeed ordinary fellow have chance with grindley be again going to catch be on time saved by appearance of huntsman who came galloping up one of ride with lot of hound at heel be away tom surely said maxwell be out of wood somewhere said tom off went vavasor changed horse getting on to brown one giving up chestnut mare to bat smithers who suggested that might a well go home to roebury now vavasor gave answer trotting on to point where ride met stopped moment listened carefully then took path diverging away from that by huntsman crowd of horseman have gone made best of way through wood at end of came upon sir william who with one near servant be standing in pathway of little hunting gate hold hard said sir william hound be not out of wood yet be fox away sir what be good of if ca get hound out yes be away passed out where be standing then began to blow horn lustily by degree other men few hound came down ride then tom with horse almost blown made appearance outside wood soon there came rush of men nearly on top of one pushing on not knowing whither keenly alive to fact that fox have at last consented to move quarter tom touched hat looked at master inquiringly be gone for claydon said master try up that hedgerow tom did try up hedgerow in minute hound came upon scent then might see men settling hat on head feeling foot in stirrup moment for have so long waited have come yet there be many who must now have preferred that fox must be headed back into cover have little confidence in half blown horse with many waiting though so abused anathematized be in truth more to taste than run with others excitement have gone by gallop over field two be necessary before must be restored with most men at moment there be little nervousness fear of making bad start dread lest others must have more of success of hunt than fall to there be great rush mighty bustle a hound made out game sir william felt called upon to use rough side of tongue to more than one delinquent then certain sly old stager might be seen turning off to left instead of following course of game a indicated by hound be men who have felt air a came out knew that fox must soon run down wind whatever might do for first half mile so men who knew also be shortest way to claydon by road ah satisfaction that there be when men be thrown out dead knowledge proved to be of avail if fox will only run straight heading from cover on real line very sagacious gentleman seldom come to much honour glory in present instance beast seemed determined to go straight enough for hound ran scent along three four hedgerow in line have managed to get for full ten minute start have be able to leave cover enemy well behind before bethought a to best way to purposed destination here from field to field there be little hunting gate at men crowded lustily poking shoving other horse hating other with bitterness of hatred be think known nowhere else hunting man ever want to jump if can help hedge near gate be not alluring few there be who made line for taking next field to right scrambling through corner of fence while rush be going on at gate among be george vavasor never rode in crowd always keeping somewhat away from men a well a hound must often be thrown out then men must hear more of for day on such occasion did not show a other men do twenty minute after fox have be killed run to ground betook home by going through byeways lane thus leaving report of failure to be spoken of by compeer a long a line of gate lasted crowd continued a thick a ever best man be whose horse must shove hardest after passing four five field in way came out upon road scent holding strong dog crossed without demurring then came doubt into mind of men many of whom before must venture away from position on lane narrowly watched leading hound to see whether there be indication of turn to one side other sir william whose seventy odd year excused turned sharp to left knowing that must make claydon way very many be submissive horseman who followed few took road to right having in mind little game of own hardest rider there have already crossed from road into country be going well to hound ignorant of of brook before others unheeding foremost among be burgo fitzgerald burgo fitzgerald whom man have ever known to crane at fence to hug road to spare own neck horse yet poor burgo seldom finished well coming to repeated grief in matter of hunting a did so constantly in other matter of life almost neck neck with burgo be

declared that be a ignorant of hunting a tailor must ride when must ride must tumble men said that of must ride a long a beast under must go few knew sad misfortune poor pollock sometimes encountered muddy ditch in be left despair with must stand by unfortunate horse when poor brute must no longer move across deep ploughed field mile that must walk at night beside tired animal a made way slowly back to roebury then came tom huntsman with calder jones close to grindley intent on winning sovereign vavasor have also crossed road somewhat to left carrying with one two who knew that be safe man to follow maxwell have be ignominiously turned by hedge together with ditch formed fence such a men love at beginning of run have turned from acknowledging cause by george said be too big for yet awhile there be end of river at bottom so have followed master down road whom have named managed to get over brook pollock horse barely contriving to get up hind leg from broken edge of bank nag refused rider thus lost chance of sport for day such be lot of men who hunt man pay five six pound for day amusement be ten to one that occurrence of day disgust rather than gratify one two got in

asked of countryman countryman must not tell that fellow with second horse be riding hunt with great satisfaction to george vavasor found that horse went with uncommonly well taking fence almost in stride of gallop giving unmistakeable sign of good condition wonder what be be amiss with said george to resolving however that must sell day if got opportunity straight went line of fox up from brook

vavasor have spoken no word to one since hunt commenced have wished to speak to one desired to sell horse desired also to succeed in run for other reason than though think must have found difficult to define now have open grass land for about mile with very heavy fence so that hound gained upon little pollock weight began to tell huntsman burgo be leading with fortunate county gentleman whose good star have brought in upon at farmyard gate be injustice of such accident a break heart of man who have honestly gone through heat work of struggle hound have veered little round to left making after

there very triumphant in own success already talking of jones sovereign pollock be there also thankful for ten minute law trusting wind might be given to horse to finish run triumphantly pace on leaving claydon be better than ever may have come from fact that scent be keener a got out so close upon game think must have changed fox maxwell who saw go swore that be fresh clean burgo said that

glencora have married mr palliser have married without pausing to doubt alice have gone on doubting till at last have resolved that must not marry mr grey thought of much in day at cheltenham wondered

macleod have told with hesitation indeed for lady macleod be afraid of have told nevertheless more than once that noble relative have heard of treatment to mr grey be being subjected have expressed great sorrow if not dismay almost anger lady macleod indeed have gone a far a dared might have gone further without sacrifice of truth lady midlothian have said that must be disgraceful to family lady glencora aunt marchioness of auld reekie have demanded to be told what be girl wanted when letter came lady macleod be not present be disposed to think that one of have be written by concerted arrangement with if so have not dared to watch immediate effect of own projectile one be from lady midlothian of other lady macleod certainly knew nothing though also have sprung out of discussion have taken place a to alice sin in auld reekie midlothian set other letter be from lady glencora alice opened two one without reading other very slowly lady midlothian be first opened then came spot of anger on alice cheek a saw signature caught word two a allowed eye to glance down page then opened other be shorter when saw cousin signature glencora palliser read that letter first read twice before went back to disagreeable task of perusing lady midlothian lecture reader will have letter that from countess will have precedence castle reekie nb oct dear miss vavasor have not pleasure of knowing personally though have heard of very often from dear mutual friend relative lady macleod with whom understand that be at present on visit grandmother by mother side lady flora macleod mother countess of leith be half sister though circumstance since have prevented seeing so much of other a be desirable have always remembered connection have ever regarded a one in whose welfare be bound by tie of blood to take warm interest beince ' what doe mean by beince that ' said alice to herself have never set eye on at why doe talk of not having seen a much of a be desirable have learned with great gratification that be going to be married to most worthy gentleman mr john grey of nethercoats in cambridgeshire when first heard made business to institute inquiry be heartily glad to find that choice have done so much credit if reader have read alice character a have meant must be read will thoroughly be understood that be wormwood to be informed that mr grey be in respect gentleman that be man of most excellent habit one to whom young woman must commit future happiness with security that mean be very good for position that there be possible objection to marriage gave great satisfaction to in be joined by marchioness of auld reekie who be connected with almost a nearly a be who can assure feel considerable interest in welfare be staying with now in say agrees with may feel then how dreadfully be dismayed when be told by dear lady macleod that have told mr grey that intended to change mind dear miss vavasor can be true there be thing in young lady have right to change mind after have be once made up certainly when young lady have accepted gentleman be one of can not legally make become wife have right to claim before god man have considered that have probably furnished house in consequence of intended marriage perhaps in compliance with own especial wish think that lady macleod must have told countess something that have heard about garden have reflected that have of course told friend have reason to give be told none nothing must ever be done without reason much le such thing a in own interest may say respectability be involved hope will think of before persist in destroying own happiness perhaps that of very worthy man have heard year ago when be much younger that have become imprudently attached in direction with gentleman with none of quality to recommend speak so highly for mr grey must grieve very much a must also marchioness who in matter think exactly a do if be led to suppose that rejection of mr grey have be caused by renewal of project nothing dear miss vavasor must be more unfortunate might almost add stronger word have be advised that line from a representing poor mother family especially a have at present moment opportunity of expressing lady auld reekie sentiment a well a own might be of service implore dear miss vavasor to remember what owe to god man to carry out engagement made by be in respect comme il faut will give entire satisfaction to friend relative margaret m midlothian think that lady macleod have be wrong in supposing that must do good must have known alice better must also have known world better own reverence for own noble relative be so great that must not understand even yet that such feeling be wanting to niece be to impossible that expressed opinion of such one a countess of midlothian owning relationship solicitude condescending at same time to express friendship must not say understand that voice of such one so speaking must have weight think that have be quite right in keeping out of alice way at moment of arrival of letter alice read slowly then replacing in envelope leaned back quietly in chair with eye fixed upon teapot on table have however other letter on to occupy mind thus relieve from effect of too deep animosity against countess lady glencora letter be a follows matching priory thursday dear cousin have just come home from scotland where have be telling something of

resolve that must not accept invitation in first place even allusion to little trouble jarred upon feeling then thought that rejection of mr grey must be special reason why must go to matching priory be not very possible that have be invited that might meet lady midlothian there encounter strength of personal battery from countess lady glencora letter must of course answer to lady midlothian must

secrecy a paid for thing must have have kate undertook to stay month with aunt at norwich mr greenow undertook mr cheesacre must declare a kate lover before expiration of month be in vain that kate

regretted that have be induced to make promise yet have a often resolved that there be possible reason why must not go to matching priory feared commencement of closer connection with great relation have told so often that be quite separated from that slight accident of blood in way tied to to lesson have be so thoroughly taught to by injudicious attempt of lady macleod to teach opposite lesson that did not like idea of putting aside effect of teaching perhaps be little afraid of great folk whom might probably meet at cousin house lady glencora have liked have loved too with momentary love certain circumstance of life will sometimes produce love be strong while last can be laid down when need of be passed have liked loved lady glencora have in degree be afraid of during strange visiting in queen anne street be by mean sure that must like lady glencora in midst of grandeur surrounded by pomp of rank must have other friend acquaintance in house feared that might find herself desolate cold wounded in pride have be tricked into visit too rather have tricked into have be sure that there have be joint scheme between cousin lady midlothian must not resist temptation of repudiating in letter to lady glencora there have be no such scheme have wronged lady glencora have therefore be unable to resist second request felt unhappy fearing that must be out of element more than once half made up mind to excuse aunt have from first thought well of going believing that might probably be mean of reconciling to mr grey moreover be step altogether in right direction lady glencora must if lived become duchess a be decidedly alice cousin of course alice must go to house when invited must be acknowledged that lady macleod be not selfish in worship of rank have played out game in life there be probability that must live to be called cousin by duchess of omnium bade alice go to matching priory simply because loved niece therefore wished to live in best most eligible way within reach think owe a duty to family to go said lady macleod what further correspondence about affair have passed between lady macleod lady midlothian alice never knew steadily refused entreaty made that must answer countess letter at last threatened aunt that if request be further urged must answer telling lady midlothian that have be very impertinent be becoming very old woman alice poor lady said piteously suppose have better not interfere further have said have always meant to be for good then alice got up kissing aunt tried to explain to that resented interference from felt grateful for that said did that must not endure meddling from people whom did not know who thought entitled to meddle by rank because be cousin a well said lady macleod in softly sad apologetic voice alice left cheltenham about middle of november on road to matching priory be to sleep in london one night go down to matching in yorkshire with maid on following day father undertook to meet at great western station to take on following morning to great northern said nothing in letter about dining with when met muttered something about engagement taking home graciously promised that must breakfast with on following morning be very glad be going alice said when be in cab together why papa why because think be proper thing to do know have never said much to about people be not connected with know that hate name of vavasor not what name be deal older than of theirs family too therefore understand why think be specially right if be to say be specially wrong must be le surprised of course must go must go by mean rank wealth be advantage let anybody say what will to contrary why else doe everybody want to get sha get by going to matching priory will get part of value take a whole nobility of england be pleasant acquaintance to have have run after very much though married a may say among very thing rather stood in way than otherwise may be sure of men woman ought to grow like plant upwards everybody must endeavour to stand a well a can in world if have choice of acquaintance between sugar baker peer must prefer peer unless indeed sugar baker have something very strong on side to offer call that tuft hunting doe not necessitate toadying be simply growing up towards light a tree do alice listened to father worldly wisdom with smile did not attempt to answer be very seldom indeed that

so inconsiderable person a must not be down upon kate never mentioned till showed by question to that knew about journey to matching own understand why must be necessary to keep so much in dark alice felt that be blushing caution have be given to kate because kate still transgressed in letter by saying little word about brother alice did not even now believe kate to have be false to saw that have

of visit to pallisers know have be warned though have not confessed alice sat silent not knowing what to say in answer to charge brought against thinking perhaps that questioner must allow question to pas without answer vavasor be not so complaisant if there be reason alice think have right to ask for few second did not speak word sat considering also remained silent with eye fixed upon looked at saw nothing scar nothing scar brightness of eye be almost fierce knew that be in earnest therefore resolved that must be in earnest also think that have right said at last then let exercise think that

nothing to offend if there be cause why friendship must be dropped why must be on different footing to other in london than be in switzerland may acknowledge if be explained to can not put up with doubt when be told have right to demand solution then will be frank with george though being so will a may guess be very painful paused again looking at to see if yet must spare be scar eye a before there be mercy in face sister george have thought that parting with mr grey might lead to renewal of purpose of marriage between know eagerness will understand that may have be necessary must require silence from on head ought now to understand then be being punished for sin said suddenly scar on face be healed up again there be something of old pleasantness in eye have said nothing about sin

sometimes almost like old woman how talked what thing said what terrible foreboding uttered of stranger thing that meant to say why have at first meeting made allusion to mode of own betrothal then checking for speaking of so soon almost declare that meant to speak more of hereafter must never mention to one said alice to herself if lot in life have not satisfied there be so much more reason why

have be very young have be terribly weighted with wealth seemed to alice that cousin have told everything in hour half that have be together have given whole history of husband of have said how

water pipe over house everything else must be thought of yet ca move about place without meeting with draught at corner of passage duchess spoke with enormous emphasis on other word sometimes putting so great stress on special syllable a almost to bring voice to whistle have done with word pipe to great degree so alice never afterwards forgot hot water pipe of longroyston be telling lady glencora miss palliser never knew house so warm a be sorry to say here emphasis be very strong on word sorry so cold a longroyston tone in longroyston be uttered must almost have drawn tear from critical

code of perseverance taught that be virtue to overcome cold shoulder man woman who received first overture with grace must probably be one on whom must be better that must look down waste further time

stranger then did get up went away from member of parliament leaving rather astonished at audacity be constant man inner resolve be simply to effect that must try again wonder whether jeffrey palliser did think much of difference between present position that must have be have lady glencora be happy possessor of cradle up stair with boy in suppose must have done so be hardly possible that man must not be alive to importance of such chance own present position be one of most unfortunate can fall to lot of man father duke youngest brother have left about six hundred year have left also taste for

possessed of income above stated of course must live on a during winter month of year home be found for free of cost must keep hunter live a rich men live be poor embarrassed man without prospect until fine ducal prospect became opened to by want of cradle at matching priory prospect be doubt very distant lady glencora might yet have a many son a hecuba might die other more fortunate lady might become mother of cousin heir duke might marry have son moreover cousin be only one year older than great prize if came way might not come for forty year a yet nevertheless hand might now be acceptable in quarter where must certainly be rejected have lady glencora possessed that cradle up stair can not suppose that must have made calculation of nature be pity must hing life cousin plantagenet said to one morning just at time jeffrey have sought interview in cousin room fear have done so with slight request for ready money what be to do said jeffrey at rate might marry oh yes must marry there be man so poor what can do that question must be how might like subsequent starvation see that need starve though own fortune be small be something many girl have fortune of own jeffrey thought of lady glencora made allusion to in speech think be very good at kind of thing said when father mother came to ask of house home must break down say a praising indeed quite reverse

just so see be le lucky than ploughman there be vulgar error so vulgar be to say common erroneous a by men have be taught to say that mercenary tendency be bad desire for wealth be source of progress civilization come from what men call greed let mercenary tendency be combined with honesty can not take astray future chancellor of exchequer said with much of air tone of wisdom chancellor of

must never pay be too old fear for public service mean desk in treasury with hundred year yes think be too old have plan of own not much of one sometimes have thought must go to new zealand must have to be farmer there must do must get up opposition to government that sort of thing then must buy off give place doe very well here jeffrey if man can get into parliament have capital enough to wait think must do out there must like to go into parliament what here of course must only must be sure to get terribly into debt owe very much now not to speak of except what owe owe nothing to said plantagenet with little touch of magniloquence in tone speak of have brother between mean nothing see jeffrey may be that will have to look to a heir in short hereupon jeffrey muttered something a to small probability of such necessity a to great remoteness of result even if be so that be true said elder heir of pallisers still in short wish must do something do think about then day speak to again jeffrey a left cousin with cheque for l in waist coat pocket thought that interview have at one time taken important dimension have not be concluded altogether satisfactorily seat in parliament yes indeed if cousin must so far use political monetary ducal interest a to do for a to give something of status properly belonging to younger son of house then indeed life must have charm for a for farm in scotland desk at office in london own new zealand plan must be better than then a went along of course bethought that might be lot yet to die at least to be buried in purple a duke of omnium if so

frighten two delicious old duenna mr marsham mr bott last word be said a be in whisper to alice be so whispered that there be real attempt to keep from ear of mr jeffrey palliser glencora alice

alice who must hardly bring to speak so full be mind of have just be said to be surprised to find glencora must go on in usual light humour chatting a though there be weight within to depress spirit chapter xxviii alice leaf priory a came in at billiard room door mr palliser be there to meet must be very cold said to glencora who entered first indeed said glencora teeth be chattering whole appearance gave lie to word jeffrey said mr palliser turning to cousin be angry with at least must have known better than to have allowed to remain so long then mr palliser turned away walked wife off taking notice whatsoever of miss vavasor alice felt slight understood have told plainly enough though not in word that have trusted wife with that have betrayed trust might have brought glencora in within five six minute instead of allowing to remain out there in freezing night air for nearly three quarter of hour be accusation mr palliser made against made with utmost severity asked question of whether be cold spoke word to did even look at might get away to bedroom a pleased alice understood completely though knew that have not deserved such severity be not inclined to resent there be so much in mr palliser position be to be pitied that alice must not find in heart to be angry with be provoked with now said jeffrey palliser standing with for moment in billiard room a handed candle be afraid that will have caught cold yes think wrong that must remain out at night so long can easily understand miss vavasor that have not much sympathy for romance dare say be right said alice not exactly knowing what to say not being able to forget what have be said about jeffrey palliser when first left house romance usually mean nonsense believe be not glencora doctrine be younger than be foot be very cold mr palliser think will go up to room good night said jeffrey offering hand think so hard that must have incurred displeasure will not hurt said alice smiling doe not forget even will not hurt good night mr palliser a be last night may say good night alice will be away to morrow before be up still held hand have not be in for minute have thought nothing of did draw away even now suddenly said glencora be very wrong there doing injury without meaning to of there can be possible reason why must call otherwise than be customary can there never be reason mr palliser good night if be not to see to morrow morning good bye will certainly not see to morrow morning good bye have not be for folly of glencora acquaintance must have be very pleasant to have be very pleasant good night then left went up alone to own room whether other guest be still left in drawing room did not know have seen that mr palliser took wife up stair therefore considered right in presuming that party be broken up for night mr palliser plantagenet palliser according to rule of courtesy must have said word to a went a have said before alice be disposed to overlook want of civility on occasion so went up alone to room be very glad to find able to get close to good fire be in truth very cold cold to bone in spite of what lady glencora have said on behalf of moonlight two have be standing still during greater part of time that have be talking alice a sat down found that foot be numbed with damp have penetrated through boot certainly mr palliser have reason to be angry that wife must have remained out in night air so long though perhaps not with alice then began to think of have be told to try to think of what under such circumstance behoved to do must not doubt that lady glencora have intended to declare that if opportunity offered must leave husband put under protection of mr fitzgerald alice moreover have become painfully conscious that poor deluded unreasoning creature have taught to think that might excuse for sin to own conscience by fact that be childless that might thus give to man who have married opportunity of seeking wife who might give heir alice well knew how insufficient such excuse must be even to wretched woman who have framed for still must operate manifestly have already operated on mind teaching to hope good might come out of evil alice who be perfectly clearsighted a regarded cousin however much impaired vision might have be with reference to herself saw nothing absolute ruin ruin of worst most intolerable description in plan lady glencora seemed to have formed to be black in depth of hell knew that to glencora also be black loathe glencora have said thing be thinking of what be alice to do under circumstance mr palliser be aware have quarrelled with for in silent way have first shown that have trusted a wife friend then on evening have shown that have ceased to trust cared little for if told that wished to speak to must listen let opinion of be what might having listened must surely act in way must serve to save wife what mr palliser might think of alice cared little then there came to idea be in respect feminine that in such matter have right to betray friend when one woman tell story of love to woman confidant always feel that will be traitor if reveals secret have lady glencora made alice believe that meditated murder robbery alice must have have difficulty in telling tale thus preventing crime now hesitated feeling that must disgrace by betraying friend after be not more than probable that glencora have intention of carrying out threat very thought of must be terrible to herself a be thinking of sitting in dressing gown close over fire there came loud knock at door a have turned key be forced to answer in person opened door there be iphigenia palliser jeffrey cousin mr palliser cousin miss vavasor said know that be taking great liberty may come into room for few minute so much wish to speak to alice of

to one be headed by wife whereas miss pallisers have be naturally attached to of husband lady a have already seen almost idolized cousin though plantagenet palliser have till lately treated alice with greatest personal courtesy there have be intimacy of friendship between consequently none between special adherent be of lady prone to sudden friendship with one a alice vavasor sudden friendship with snuffy president of foreign learned society with personally unknown lady employed on female emigration be very much in way alice have not shown to be useful learned special intimacy with lady glencora have marked out a in sort separated from way know that be intruding said miss palliser a though be almost afraid of alice oh dear said alice if can do anything for will be very happy be going to morrow if did not speak to now must have other opportunity glencora seems to be very much attached to thought so good thing that must have friend hope have not changed mind said alice with faint smile thinking a spoke that must have be specially intended to include master of house oh by mean did not mean that cousin mr palliser mean liked so much when came doe not like quite so much now because went out in moonlight with wife be that well miss vavasor have not intended to mention at have not indeed have seen certainly since came in just for minute be vexed be not about that must speak to saw plainly enough that be angry with thought must have brought in earlier why must think that can manage wife be mistress out there a be in here mr palliser have be unreasonable not that signifies think have be unreasonable indeed miss vavasor have certainly be vexed sometimes have much to vex see glencora be very young mr bott also have declared that lady glencora be very young be probable therefore that special phrase have be used in discussion among mr palliser party a to glencora foible so thought alice a remembrance of word came upon be not younger than when mr palliser married alice said mean that if man marries young wife must put up with trouble be matter of course age in truth be very suitable cousin be not yet thirty when say that glencora be young mean that be younger in spirit perhaps in conduct than have expected to find be not to suppose that complains miss vavasor be much too proud for must hope so said alice thinking of mr bott hardly know how to explain to what wish to say how far may be justified in supposing that will believe to be acting solely on glencora behalf think have influence with know one else have friendship with be not of very long date miss palliser know still there be fact be not right in supposing in supposing what in supposing that have heard name of mr fitzgerald a connected with glencora before marriage with cousin alice paused moment before answered yes have then said think be agreed with other relation that marriage must have be very dreadful never spoke of matter in presence of relative of glencora must understand miss palliser that though be far away cousin even know nearest connection never saw lady midlothian till came here other day advised to abandon mr fitzgerald never know be much with just at time used to see certainly then there be pause miss palliser in truth scarcely knew how to go on there have be hardness about alice visitor have not expected unwillingness to speak even to listen made miss palliser almost wish that be out of room have however mentioned burgo fitzgerald name out of room now must not go without explaining why have done so at point alice came suddenly to assistance just then be often with said alice continuing reply there be much talk between about mr fitzgerald what be advice then can be of little matter in will be agreed miss palliser that glencora now must certainly not be called upon to be in company have told then yes have told that be to be at lady monk have told that mr palliser expects to meet at place to be going when leave duke that think hard that must be subjected to trial must be trial miss vavasor how can be otherwise come miss palliser if be friend be fair to be friend be above everything cousin friend have told that have complained of having to meet man declares that must be nothing to that fear be idle folly must be nothing to still fear may not be idle be there reason real reason why must not go miss vavasor conjure to tell even though in doing so must cast so deep reproach upon name anything will be better than utter disgrace sin conceive that cast reproach upon in saying that there be great reason why must not go to monkshade think there be absolute ground for interference must tell know openly what must have to fear think nay miss palliser know that there be ample reason why must save from being taken to monkshade if have power to do so can only do attempt to do by telling just what tell then tell must have thought of suppose before came to yes yes miss vavasor have thought of doubt have thought of have believed through that must assure that there be danger believed that must have said that be innocent be innocent said alice rising from chair a though might thus give emphasis to word hardly dared to speak above whisper be innocent who accuses of guilt ask question on behalf on hers on miss vavasor question feel bound to answer truly to answer with reference to welfare of will not have said that accuse have be attached to mr fitzgerald when cousin married knew that have be case told whole truth in worldly point of view marriage with mr fitzgerald must probably have be very imprudent must have be utterly ruinous perhaps so say nothing about a turned out gave up own wish married cousin know about own wish miss vavasor be what did must have married mr fitzgerald have not be hindered by advice of around can not be supposed that have forgotten in so short time there can be guilt in remembrance there be guilt in loving other than husband then miss palliser be marriage be guilty not love be done past must be cousin object to teach to forget mr fitzgerald will not do that by taking to house where gentleman be staying have said so much to know need declare to what have said have asked question have answered be thankful to for having asked what object can either of have to assist in position to save from dishonour have so hoped that be simply childish dread on part be not so be childish dread if have power to prevent going to lady monk implore to use indeed will ask to promise that will do so after what have said have alternative exactly there be alternative either for sake for hers there be none thereupon miss palliser got up wishing companion good night took departure throughout interview there have be cordiality of feeling between there be pretence of friendship even a be parting acknowledged that object be different that of alice be to save lady glencora from ruin that of miss palliser be to save cousin from disgrace with perhaps further honest desire to prevent sorrow sin one loved lady glencora other clearly did not love nevertheless alice felt that miss palliser in coming to have acted well that to herself coming have afforded immense relief step must now be taken to prevent that meeting have so deprecated must be taken without great violation of confidence on part have said nothing a to lady glencora must feel aggrieved on next morning be down in breakfast room soon after nine have not be in room many minute before mr palliser entered carriage be ordered for at quarter before ten said have come down to give breakfast there be smile on face a spoke alice must see that intended to

pallisers then came in together after mr bott closely followed by mr marsham of made inquiry after lady glencora a though be to be supposed that might probably be in perilous state after what have undergone on previous evening mr bott be particularly anxious frost be so uncommonly severe said that delicate person like lady glencora must have suffered in remaining out so long insinuation that alice be not delicate person that a regarded severity of frost be of moment be very open be duly appreciated mr bott be aware that great patron have in sort changed opinion about miss vavasor be of course disposed to change own fortnight since alice might have be a delicate a pleased in mr bott estimation hope consider lady glencora delicate said alice to mr palliser be not robust said husband by mean said mr marsham indeed said mr bott alice knew that be being accused of being robust herself bore in silence ploughboy milkmaid be robust accusation be heavy one alice however thought that must not have minded if must have allowed to reply at moment of going away must not do think be a strong a rest of said iphigenia palliser who felt that after last night owed something to miss vavasor a of said mr bott determined to persevere in accusation at moment lady glencora entered encountered eager inquiry of two duenna however quickly put aside made way up to alice last morning have come

loved striven to cherish with to what state have come poor burgo have eye be le brightly blue face le godlike in form may be that thing must have gone better with sweeter tempered man than never lived one who be of kinder nature at moment have barely money about to take down to aunt house at monkshade a have promised to be there before christmas day be bound to start on next morning before help from mr magruin be possible nevertheless out of very narrow fund have given crown to comfort poor creature who have spoken to in street chapter xxx containing love letter vavasor a sat alone in room after fitzgerald have left began to think of day in have before wished to assist friend in view with reference to lady glencora rather began to think of alice behaviour then of alice word alice have steadfastly refused to give aid no le likely assistant for purpose must have be selected have be very earnest in declaring that be glencora duty to stand by promise to burgo be desperate spendthrift kate vavasor have said to then let teach to be otherwise alice have answered that might have be good reason for refusing offer when first made can be excuse for untruth now that have told that love if woman have said again wo venture fortune for man love love be not worth having george vavasor remembered now a remembered asked whether woman have once loved must venture fortune for still though sister have pressed on subject with vehemence that must use have hardly hitherto made up mind that really desired to marry alice there have grown upon lately certain bohemian propensity love of absolute independence in thought a well a action be antagonistic to marriage be almost inclined to think marriage be old fashioned custom fitted indeed well enough for usual dull life of world at large a many men in heathen in christian age have taught to think of religion be not adapted to advanced intelligence if loved woman loved cousin alice if thoroughly respected woman respected that idea of tying down to household be in distasteful to be thing terrible to think of once said to congenial friend in day of life that man must give permission to priest to tie to human being like siamese twin so that power of separate solitary action must be taken from for ever beast of field treat other so badly neither drink drunk eat stupid do bind together in union must have to hate in way george vavasor trying to imitate wisdom of brute have taught theory of peculiar nature nevertheless a thought of alice vavasor on occasion began to feel that if siamese twin be necessary for of others be woman to whom must wish to be so bound if did at must do now under joint instigation of sister a thought perhaps not altogether without reason have broken engagement with mr grey that must renew again if left to herself believed probable then despite advanced intelligence have taught to regard form ceremony with eye of philosopher have still enough of human frailty about to feel keenly alive to pleasure of taking from john grey prize john grey have so nearly taken from if alice must have be taught to think a did a to absurdity of indissoluble tie must have be better nothing must have be more impossible than teaching of such lesson to cousin alice george vavasor be man of courage dared do most thing must not have dared to commence teaching of such lesson to now at moment what be outlook into life generally have very high ambition fair hope of gratifying if must only provide that thing must go well with for year so be still poor man having be once nearly rich man still so much of result of nearly acquired rich remained to that on strength of might probably find way into parliament have paid cost of last attempt might in great degree carry on present attempt on credit if succeeded there must be open to mode of life agreeable in honourable among men how be to bear cost of for next year next two year grandfather be still alive must probably live over period if married alice must do so with idea of cheating out of money must learn nay have already learned from own lip how perilous be enterprise knew to be woman who must boldly risk in money though consideration must induce to stir hair breadth towards danger in reputation towards teaching doctrine at have hinted must not have dared to make attempt felt that must have repugnance to telling that wanted to spend money in first year two of married life be still in arm chair thinking of with small untasted modicum of brandy water beside when heard distant lambeth clock strike three from over river then rose from seat taking candle in hand sat down at writing desk on other side of room need send when be written said to chance be wo then took paper wrote a follows dear alice time be when privilege be mine of beginning letter to with warmer show of love than above word contains when might did call dearest lost privilege through own folly since that have be accorded to have found with thorough honesty of purpose than know nothing greater that have behoved to withdraw privilege also need hardly say must not have written a now write have not found expedient to do a have done now once again ask to be wife in spite of passed in old day of selfish folly of be then guilty think know at time knew that ever loved claim to say for that love to be true from first to last claim from belief for statement indeed think that ever doubted love nevertheless when told that might no longer hope to make wife have word of remonstrance must utter acted a woman must act whom love have not made fool then came episode of mr grey bitter a have be feeling whilst that engagement lasted never made attempt to come between life have chosen in saying forget word spoke last summer at basle when a far a knew still intended that must be husband what said then be nothing to with much violence refrained from saying whether remember few word can not tell certainly must not have remembered must not even have noticed have heart be at nethercoats be nothing be now again free woman once again ask to be wife be older than be when loved before will be prone to think of marriage in somewhat different light then personal love for other be most in thought god forbid that must not be much in thought now perhaps be deceiving in saying that be not even now stronger in mine than other consideration have reached that time of life when be probable that in proposition of marriage must think more of adaptability to other than did before for myself know that there be much in character disposition to make unfit to marry woman of common stamp know mode of life be hope chance of success run great risk of failing may be that will encounter ruin where look for reputation career of honour chance be perhaps more in favour of ruin than of success may be chance will go on a long a mean of carrying on fight be at disposal if be wife to morrow must expect to use money if be needed in struggling to obtain seat in parliament hearing there will hardly stoop to tell that ask to be wife for sake of aid if be to become wife must expect cooperation with money possibly certainly with warmest spirit now once again alice dearest alice will be wife have be punished have kissed rod a never kissed other rod can not accuse love since time in might sit with arm round waist have sat with round other waist since lip be

repentance such repentance indeed claim merit a have be natural result of loss have suffered providence have hitherto be very good to in not having made that loss irremediable by marriage with mr grey

something else can tell though must tell to other person can tell because must do will do same have told that portion of money be at service may be needed for purpose before twelve month be over oh alice will not do that be too generous kate perhaps felt at moment that brother be man to whom offer must hardly be made with safety have done mercury with sixpence in pocket be already posting generosity at shap to tell truth kate be more than fair have honestly told that while old squire life will want money to assist in career of do much more than approve have be earnest wish to see in parliament will now be most earnest desire of heart one thing a to will feel intense anxiety how then can have face to bid wait twelve month for be specially needed in six month time must be like

safety of speak that be now going to become brother wife do suppose that see must run much risk prefer excitement of london to tranquillity may say of cambridgeshire exactly therefore have told george that will have money whenever want kate be very persistent in objection to scheme till george answer came answer to alice be accompanied by letter to sister after kate said nothing more about money question said more then must not therefore be supposed that be le determined than have be that part of alice fortune must be sacrificed to brother want at rate before alice must become brother wife brother letter for moment stopped mouth must be necessary that must speak to before again spoke to alice in what word alice have written assent will be necessary that reader must know in order that something may be understood of struggle made upon occasion will be given presently when come to speak of george vavasor position a received george reply be very short apparently very frank deprecated delay of twelve month still hoped to be able to induce to be more lenient to advised to write to mr grey at once a regarded squire gave carte blanche to act a pleased if squire required kind of apology expression of sorrow asking for pardon such like george must under circumstance a now existed comply with requisition most willingly must regard a simple form made necessary by coming marriage

feel great difficulty in answering letter must have own way must make answer to at present leave for next six month so that then such answer might hereafter be made a circumstance must seem to require will be little flattering to be le flattering to myself answer may make how can anything in affair be flattering to to have be like child who have quarrelled over game of play till now at close of little day of pleasure be fain to meet other in tear acknowledge that have looked for delight where delight be to be found kate who be here talk to of passionate love there be such passion left to a think to either must not now be possible that must come together on such term a must not stand up together a man wife with hope of happy marriage unless have agreed that such happiness might be have without passionate love will see from refuse offer without passion have for warm affection enables to take livelier interest in career than in other of matter be around of course if become wife that interest will be still closer dearer do feel that can take in that concern wife must have in husband affair if suit will become wife can not be quite at once have suffered much from past conflict of life there have be very much with must reproach know have behaved badly sometimes have to undergo doubly bitter self accusation of having behaved in manner world will call unfeminine must understand have not passed through unscathed must beg to allow time for cure perfect cure may never expect think that in twelve month from time may so far have recovered usual spirit ease of mind a to enable to devote to happiness dear george if will accept under such circumstance will be wife will endeavour to do duty by faithfully have said that even now a cousin take lively interest in career of course mean career a politician especially in hope of entering parliament understand accurately a think what have said about fortune perfectly appreciate truth frankness if have nothing of own in circumstance must not possibly take a wife know moreover that need of assistance from mean be immediate rather than prospective money may be absolutely necessary to within year during a tell most truly can not bring to become married woman money will be le cross grained than will take a frankly a mean when say that want for political purpose will be forthcoming at slightest wish dear george let have honour glory of marrying man who have gained seat in parliament of great britain of position man may attain that to be grandest will wait for further letter from before speak either to father to grandfather if can tell that accede to view will at once try to bring about reconciliation between squire think that will be almost easier than inducing father to look with favour upon marriage

aspirant a mr palliser must stand well therefore mr palliser came to monkshade although lady glencora be unable to accompany be so sorry said lady monk have be looking forward to having lady glencora with beyond everything mr palliser declared that lady glencora be overwhelmed with grief in must have be debarred from making special visit have however be so unwell at anxious husband declared a to make unsafe for to go again away from home hope be nothing serious said lady monk with look of grief so well arranged stranger must have thought that pallisers must have be very dear to heart then mr went on to explain that lady glencora have unfortunately be foolish during one of night of hard frost have gone out among ruin at matching to show by moonlight to friend friend have thoughtlessly foolishly in manner mr palliser declared to be very reprehensible allowed lady glencora to remain among ruin till have caught cold how very wrong said lady monk with considerable emphasis be very wrong said mr palliser speaking of poor alice almost maliciously however caught cold unfortunately have become worse at uncle so be obliged to take home lady monk perceived that mr palliser have in truth left wife behind because believed to be ill not because be afraid of burgo fitzgerald so accomplished woman a lady monk felt doubt that wife absence be caused by fear of lover not by cold caught in viewing ruin by moonlight be not to be deceived in such matter became aware that mr palliser have be deceived a be right in must go back for moment say word of thing a went on at matching after alice vavasor have left that place alice have told miss palliser that step ought to be taken might be cost to save lady glencora from peril of visit to monkshade to miss palliser have assented when left alice be determined to tell mr palliser whole story when time for doing so have come courage failed must not find word in to warn husband that wife must not be safe in company of old lover task with lady glencora bad a must be might be easier task at last undertook not without success glencora said when found fitting opportunity wo be angry hope if say word to that depends very much upon what word be said lady glencora here must be acknowledged that mr palliser wife have not done much to ingratiate with mr palliser cousin not perhaps so much a must have done seeing that found in husband house have taught to think that be hard stiff too proud of bearing name of palliser perhaps little attempt may have be made by one of to teach something need hardly be said that attempt on part of husband unmarried female relation must not be forgiven by young bride have undoubtedly be ungracious of miss palliser be well aware well word will be a little unpleasant a can make said miss palliser already appreciating fully difficulty of task why say anything be unpleasant however if be to be said let have over at once be going to monkshade believe with plantagenet well what of dear glencora think have better not go do not think so who have be talking to said lady glencora turning upon very sharply nobody have be talking to not in sense mean plantagenet have spoken to not word said miss palliser may be sure that must not utter word on subject to anyone unless be to yourself dear glencora must not go there mean in kindness love do indeed saying offered hand to glencora glencora took perhaps do said in low voice indeed do world be so hard cruel in what say care two straw for what world say might care be not fault want to go to monkshade lady monk be friend once care if never see again did not arrange visit be plantagenet who did will not take there if say wish have said so told that must go will hardly believe condescended even to tell why thought better to remain away told in answer that be silly folly must live down that did not become to be afraid of man of course be not afraid be afraid be just truth be afraid what can do more than have done be very terrible to miss palliser have not thought that lady glencora must say so much felt true regret in having be made to hear word so nearly amounted to confession for there be help now there be not many more word between already know result of conversation lady glencora became so ill from effect of imprudent lingering among ruin that be unable to go to monkshade mr palliser remained three day at monkshade cemented political alliance with sir cosmo much in same way a have before done with duke of st bungay there be little nothing said about politics certainly not word must be taken a definite party understanding between men sat at dinner together at same table drank glass of wine two out of same decanter dropped chance word now again about next session of parliament know that anything more have be expected either by mr palliser by sir cosmo seemed to be understood when mr palliser went away that sir cosmo be of opinion that young scion of ducal house ought to become future chancellor of exchequer in whig government ca see that there be so much in said one young member of parliament to sir cosmo rather think that there be same said baronet there be good deal in believe dare say be not very bright know that want brightness bright financier be most dangerous man in world have have enough of already give sound common sense with just enough of gab in man to enable to say what be got to say want more than nowadays from became evident that sir cosmo be satisfied with new political candidate for high place lady monk took occasion to introduce mr palliser to burgo fitzgerald with what object be difficult to say unless be anxious to make mischief between men burgo scowled at mr palliser did not notice scowl put out hand to late rival most affably burgo be forced to take a did so made little speech be sorry that have not pleasure of seeing lady glencora with said be unfortunately indisposed said mr palliser be sorry for said burgo very sorry indeed then turned back walked away few word have spoken manner in have carried have be such a to make around notice of knew that lady glencora name must not have be in burgo mouth felt fear not easily to be defined that something terrible must come of mr palliser did not seem to notice anything to fear anything nothing terrible did come of during visit of to monkshade chapter xxxiv mr vavasor speaks to daughter alice vavasor returned to london with father leaving kate at vavasor hall with grandfather journey be not pleasant one mr vavasor knew that be duty to do something to take step with view of preventing marriage daughter meditated did not know what that something must be did know might be doing of must be thoroughly disagreeable when started from vavasor have a yet hardly spoken to word upon subject can not congratulate have simply said hope time may come papa when will alice have answered have be squire have promised that must consent to reconciliation with grandson if alice father must express satisfied with proposed marriage john vavasor have certainly expressed nothing of kind think so badly of have said speaking to old man of george must rather know almost other calamity be to befall than must be united to then squire with usual obstinacy have taken up cudgel on behalf of grandson have tried to prove that match after must not be so bad in result a son seemed to expect must do very well for property said must settle estate on eldest son so that must not touch see why must reform a well a john vavasor have then declared that george be thoroughly bad that be adventurer that believed to be ruined man that must never reform squire upon have waxed angry in way george obtained aid assistance down at old house certainly have right to expect when alice wished grandfather good

will always be glad to see dear for sake will see if will humble to there be word spoken then about father consent alice when left vavasor felt that squire be rather friend than enemy in regard to thing contemplated that father be must be uncompromising enemy to uncompromising though probably not energetical be well aware therefore journey up to london be not comfortable alice have resolved with great pain to herself in matter owed father obedience there can not be obedience on one side said to herself without protection support on other now be quite true that john vavasor have done little in way of supporting protecting daughter early in life before have resided under same roof with in london have a be washed hand of solicitude regarding having other tie of family have fallen into habit of life made almost impossible for to live with a other father must live with child then when there first sprang up between manner of sharing same house without joining together of habit of life have excused to by saying that alice be unlike other girl that required protection fortune be own at own disposal character be such that showed inclination to throw burden of such disposal on father shoulder be steady too given to pursuit made necessary that must watch closely over be girl thought who must do a well without surveillance a with a well perhaps better so have come to pas that alice have be free mistress of own action have be left to make most must of own hour can not be supposed that have eaten lonely dinner in queen anne street night after night week after week month after month without telling that father be neglecting must not perceive that spent evening in society never evening in society without feeling that tie between be not strong bond usually bind father to child be well aware that have be ill used in being thus left desolate in home have uttered word of complaint have learned without being aware that be doing so to entertain firm resolve that father must not guide in path through life in affair of john grey have for time thought alike mr vavasor have believed that theory with reference to alice have be quite correct have be left to herself be going to dispose of in way than nothing must be more eligible evil day be now coming mr vavasor a travelled up to london with daughter seated opposite to in railway carriage felt that now at last must interfere in part of journey have carriage to mr vavasor thought that must begin what have to say put off till others joined then there be further opportunity for such conversation a must be necessary between reached home about eight in evening having dined on road will be tired to night said to a went off to club will speak to to morrow alice specially felt going on evening when two person have together tedium of such journey a from westmoreland up to london there must be feeling between to bind together while enjoying comfort of evening have stayed sat with at tea table alice must at rate have endeavoured to be soft with in discussion might have be raised went away from at once leaving to think alone over peril of life before want to speak to after breakfast to morrow said a went out alice answered that must be there a matter of course scorned to tell that be always there always alone at home have never uttered word of complaint must not begin now discussion after breakfast next day be commenced with formal almost ceremonial preparation father daughter breakfasted together with knowledge that discussion be coming did not give to of good appetite very little be said at table will come up stair said alice when perceived that father have finished tea perhaps will be best said then followed into drawing room in fire have just be lit alice said must speak to about engagement of yours wo sit down papa doe look so dreadful standing up over one in way have placed on rug with back to incipient fire now at request sat down opposite to be greatly grieved when heard of at vavasor be sorry that must be grieved papa be grieved must confess that never must understand why treated mr grey a have done oh papa be done past pray let that be among bygone doe know yet of engagement with cousin will know by time to morrow then beg of a great favour to postpone letter to to alice made answer have not troubled with many such request alice will tell that one will be granted think that owe to a imperative duty to let know truth may change mind again alice found that be hard to bear hard to answer there be certain amount of truth in grievous reproach conveyed in father word made bow neck to have right to say that be impossible replied in word be barely audible exactly so said father therefore will be better that must postpone such communication for how long do mean till will have agreed together that must be told papa will not consent to consider bound to let know truth without delay have done great injury must put end to a soon a possible have done injury certainly dear very great injury said mr vavasor going away from object about proposed letter believe will feel a such to last day of life if go on hope not believe that will not be so feel sure that will not be so of course what be thinking of now be welfare not when simply told that intended to alice winced for feared to hear from father that odious word grandfather have used to indeed word have be on father lip have refrained spared that intended to break engagement with mr grey continued said little nothing to must not ask to marry man even though have promised to marry when tell that be engaged to cousin george matter be very different think well of cousin indeed think anything well of be duty to tell that world speaks very ill of paused alice remained silent when be about to travel with continued ought perhaps to have told same did not wish to pain sister moreover have heard worse of since then much worse than have heard before a did not tell before think might spare now said alice dear can not allow to sacrifice without telling that be doing so if be not for money must never think of marrying of be well aware said alice have told so very plainly yet will marry certainly will seems to papa that there be great deal of false feeling about matter of money in marriage rather perhaps great deal of pretended feeling why must be angry with man for wishing to get for man be struggling at point of george career use of money be essential to must not marry without have better then give money without said father speaking in irony be just what mean to do papa said alice what said mr vavasor jumping up from seat mean to give money before marry certainly do if must want must rather say a much a may want of heaven earth exclaimed mr vavasor alice must be mad to part with money to friend said be kind of madness of need not at rate be ashamed tell alice have got of a yet not shilling papa pray look at like if have thought of marrying must not call mad because lent to cousin what money might need must only say that so much of fortune be thrown away if be not much must be end of must sooner see surrender to half of have without engagement to marry than know that have received shilling from under promise be prejudiced against sir be prejudice that made reject once before did condemn then through prejudice have not ascertained that be altogether unworthy of be younger then said alice speaking very softly very seriously be both much younger then looked at life with other eye than now use for expected much then now seem hardly to regard at a for be then attached to pleasure to believe have now learned to be indifferent psha ejaculated father can only speak a believe continued alice think may perhaps know more of manner of life than do papa be prepared to run risk now feared before even though be that think to be must still endeavour to do duty to to bring to other thing what be expect to get by marrying asked mr vavasor husband whose mode of thinking be congenial to own answered alice husband who proposes to career in life with can sympathize think may perhaps help cousin in career have chosen that alone be great reason why must attempt to do so with money said mr vavasor with sneer partly with money said alice disdaining to answer sneer though be only with money even must be something well alice a father can only implore to pause before commit to hand if demand money from be minded to give to let have in moderation anything will be better than marrying know can not hinder be a much own mistress a be own master rather great deal more a income depends on going to horrid place in chancery lane yet suppose must think something of father wish father opinion will not be pleasant for to stand at altar without being there near to alice made answer told that have not be pleasant to to have stood at so many place during last four year to have found so often alone without father being near to have be fault be not now in power to remedy ill effect of have day be fixed between asked papa nothing have be said about yes something have be said have told that can not be for year yet be because told that told also that must have money when wanted not of said mr vavasor suppose will need intends to stand again for chelsea be great expense of election make want money be not to suppose that have asked for when made understand did not wish to marry quite yet offered use of must be ultimately own have accepted answered just a have intended that when need came must take at word then alice will tell what be belief will drain of shilling of money when be gone there will be no more heard of marriage must take small house in cheap part of town live on income a best may will go insure life so that may not absolutely starve when die having said mr vavasor went away not immediately to insurance office a word seemed to imply to club where sat alone reading newspaper very gloomily till time came for afternoon rubber of whist club dinner bill for day be brought under eye alice have such consolation in solitude have fought battle with father tolerably well be now called upon to fight battle with be one much more difficult to win be cousin betrothed a now must regard worthless heartless mercenary rascal father painted there have certainly be time that not very long distant in alice have be almost constrained so to regard since change for better in opinion of have be grounded on evidence given by by sister kate have done nothing to inspire with confidence unless reckless daring in coming forward to contest seat in parliament must be regarded a doing of something have owned to be man almost penniless have spoken of a being utterly reckless a being one whose standing in world be must continue to be perch on edge of precipice from accident might knock headlong alice believed in heart that last profession trade to have applied be becoming a nothing to that received from certain income income that man must make to appear respectable to father guardian when seeking girl in marriage father declared that men spoke badly of alice knew father to be idle man man given to pleasure to be one who thought by far too much of good thing of world have never found to be either false malicious unwonted energy in matter be in evidence that believed to be right in what said to tell truth alice be frightened at what have done almost repented of already acceptance of cousin offer have not come of love have in truth come chiefly of ambition have not so much asked why must do thing a why must not do seeing that be required of by friend what after did matter be argument with can not be supposed that looked back on past event of life with self satisfaction there be self satisfaction in truth there be more self reproach than deserved a girl have loved cousin george passionately that love have failed did not tell that have be wrong when gave up thought to have be most unfortunate in one necessity after such experience a must not have be better for to have remained without further thought of marriage then came that terrible episode in life for never must forgive have accepted mr grey because liked honoured did love said to herself now on morning poor wretched heart wrung woman a sat there thinking of in solitude be to be pitied at rate if not to be forgiven now a thought of nethercoats with quiet life garden book peaceful affectionate ascendancy of who must have be lord master feeling be very different from have induced to resolve that must not stoop to put neck beneath yoke must not have be well for to have master who by wisdom strength must save from such wretched doubtings a have refused to bend then have found desolate alone in world if can do good why must not marry in feeling have be chief argument have induced to return such answer a have sent to cousin for doe matter a to life of mine belongs to why must regard otherwise than to make of service to one who be dear to have be ever dear to from earliest year believed in intellect even if must not believe in conduct kate friend longed for thing a for dream of love meant nothing a for argument of prudence that cold calculation about money people seemed to expect from must throw to wind what if be ruined there be always other chance might save from ruin help to honour fortune then when word be once past lip there returned to that true woman feeling made plead for long day made feel that long day must be too short made already dread coming of end of year have said that must become george vavasor wife wished that saying so might be end of when came to to embrace how must receive memory of john grey last kiss still lingered on lip have told that scorned delight of love if be so be not bound to keep far from if be so must not cousin kiss pollute may be a father say thought may be that want money only if so let have surely when year be over will know then plan formed in head did not make willingly with voluntary action of mind came upon a plan do come recommended to in despite of herself must have money a might call for of excepting small portion of income might suffice to keep from burdening father then if be contented must go free without reproach there must be end of question of marriage for a thought of matured in mind door opened servant announced cousin george chapter xxxv passion versus prudence have not occurred to alice that accepted lover must come to so soon have not told expressly of day on must return have not reflected that kate must certainly inform have be thinking so much of distant peril of engagement that peril so sure to come upon before many day hour must pas by have be forgotten when name struck ear george step be heard outside on landing place felt blood rush violently to heart jumped up from seat panic stricken in utter dismay how must receive then again with what form of affection must be accosted by be there in room with before have have moment allowed to for thought hardly ventured to look up at nevertheless became aware that there be something in appearance dress brighter more lover like perhaps newer than be usual with in be affliction to ought to have understood that engagement a not only did not require absolutely forbade such symptom of young love a even when marriage came if must come must come without customary sign of smartness without outward mark of exaltation must have be very good in to have remained away from for week month to come upon thus on first morning of return be cruelty not to be forgiven be feeling with alice regarded betrothed when came to see alice said coming up to with extended hand dearest alice gave hand muttered word be inaudible even to gave hand immediately endeavoured to resume held clenched within own felt that be prisoner be standing close to now must not escape from be trembling with fear lest worse might betide even than have promised to marry now be covered with dismay a felt rather than thought how very far be from loving man to whom have given promise alice said be man once again be only now that can tell have suffered during last few year still held hand have not a yet attempted closer embrace knew that be standing away from awkwardly almost showing repugnance to be altogether beyond power to assume attitude of ordinary ease alice continued feel that be strong man again armed to meet world at point will not let thank for what have done for must speak to though doing so must be ever so painful to must say word to must have in sound of kindness after be undoubted right to come to footing on assumed to stand be simply that have given to be not fault if at moment inspired with disgust rather than with love have done nothing for george said nothing at then got hand away from retreated back to sofa where seated leaving still standing in space before fire that may do much for be greatest hope if can help will do so most heartily then became thoroughly ashamed of word feeling that be at once offering to use of purse of course will help said be full of plan of must share with now at moment one great plan be that in have already consented to be partner alice be wife now tell that will make happy to call husband not for world must have said so at moment be ill judged in to press thus must already have seen with eye such triumph a now demanded must be on occasion have have triumph when in solitude of own room with quiet sarcasm have thrown on one side of letter in have accepted a though matter have be one almost indifferent to have right to expect double triumph then have frankly told that money must be useful to must have be contented with conviction not have required also to speak to soft winning word of love must be still distant george said have suffered so much have be fault that have suffered know that year of misery have be doing be however year of coming misery be most to be dreaded say that replied have ever thought have only to blame here altogether misunderstood believing to mean that fault for blamed have be committed in separating from on former occasion alice dear let bygone be bygone bygone will not be bygone may be well for people to say so be never true one might a well say so to one body a to one heart hair will grow grey heart will grow cold see that one follows upon other said george hair be growing very grey to show that be so lifted dark lock from side of forehead displayed incipient grizzling of hair from behind if grey hair make old man alice will marry old husband even will not be

a spoke in tone of voice be very sad struck forcibly struck with anger rather than with sadness doubtless money have be chief object when offered to renew engagement with doubtless must have made such offer have be penniless even have own need be le pressing nevertheless desired something more than money triumph of being preferred to john grey of having john grey sent altogether adrift in order that old love might be recovered must have be too costly luxury for to seek have not in seeking be able to combine prudence with luxury though prudence have be undoubted desired luxury also be on calculation of combined advantage that have made second offer to cousin a must by mean have consented to proceed with arrangement without benefit of cousin money so also did feel unwilling to dispense with expression of love for must be to triumphant hitherto in present interview there have certainly be expression of love alice said greeting to be hardly have hoped be not said indeed george be sorry that must be disappointed what can say must not have affect lightness of spirit feel if wish said very slowly if wish to retract letter to now have leave to do so what opportunity be of escape

a have walked away from queen anne street have thought of nothing that too visible shudder cousin alice have be unable to repress have be feeding on anger indulging telling at one moment that must let money go from whither list making inward threat in next that time must come in must punish for ill usage there be necessity of resolving what must say to mr scruby to mr scruby be still due trifle on cost of last election even if be paid mr scruby must make heavy advance towards expense of next election whoever might come out at end of such affair without satisfactory settlement of little bill a

take place till summer there be preliminary expense needed ready money metropolitan voter a mr scruby often declared required to be kept in good humour so mr scruby wanted present payment of five hundred pound well grounded assurance that must be put in full fund by beginning of next june even mr scruby might not be true a perfect steel if thought that candidate at last moment must not come forth properly prepared other candidate with money in pocket might find way into mr scruby office a george vavasor crossed regent street gulped down anger applied mind to business must prepare to give order kate little property must be sold out must resolve to use cousin money that cousin money must still be at disposal in spite of stormy mood in have retreated from presence felt sure asking for on part must be unpleasant that duty must entrust to kate a reached scruby door have decided that for such purpose a now in hand be preferable that must use wife fortune be thus that in own mind worded phrase made for excuse yes must use wife fortune explain to mr scruby that must be justified in doing so by fact that own heritage must be settled on at marriage suppose that altogether liked be not at rate a yet altogether heartless swindler must not take cousin money without meaning without thinking that meant to repay in full that took behaviour to very morning have doubt made affair more difficult to mind more unpleasant than must have be have smiled on even a be managed to assure that be doing wrong with self assurance entered mr scruby office clerk in outer office be very civil to

reach be astonishing how much man may get done for said without paying anything for year yes be true so may if know how to go about when doe pay mr vavasor doe through nose cent per cent worse for former shortcoming how many there be who never pay at said george yes mr vavasor be true too see what life lead be pleasant thing to be afraid of coming into agent office not what must like mr vavasor

common mr tombe be name mr grey have said when mr vavasor have asked a to peculiar nature of mr tombe business be not specially ecclesiastical lawyer have partner at ely be always employed by father by most of clergy there mr tombe have evinced no surprise dismay certainly mock delicacy when whole affair be under discussion george vavasor be to get present money if must be so arranged from john grey store rather than from belonging to alice mr tombe must probably arrange that with mr vavasor lawyer who must doubt be able to make difficulty a to raising ready money mr tombe must be able to raise ready money without difficulty then at last george vavasor be to be made to surrender bride taking having taken price of bargain john vavasor sat by in silence a arrangement be being made not knowing how to speak have money with to give assistance wish to understand from lady father grey said to lawyer that marriage must be regarded by with a much dismay a by certainly must be ruinous mr vavasor have answered see mr tombe mr grey went on only wish to try man if be not such a believe to be can prove by conduct if be worthy of can then take merely wish to open eye mr grey said mild eyed lawyer wish that must have what money want then will find what be really wish yes will know man said lawyer will have money mr grey so interview have be ended mr vavasor when entered drawing room addressed daughter in cheery voice what in dark yes papa why must have candle when be doing nothing did not expect suppose not came here because want to say few word to about business what business papa alice well understood tone of father voice be desirous of propitiating be at same time desirous of carrying point in thought probable that must oppose well love if understood rightly cousin george want money did not say that want now think will want before time for election come if so will want at once have not asked for yet have merely said must be in need must take at word think there be doubt that want indeed believe that be almost entirely without present mean of own can hardly think so have knowledge about can only say that have not asked yet must wish to oblige whenever may do so to what extent alice know have get about four hundred year know what be worth how far can all be turned into money must wish to keep hundred year let have rest what eight thousand pound said father who in spite of wish not to oppose must not express dismay imagine that will want so much if must wish that must have heaven earth said john vavasor of course must have to give up house must not suppress trouble refrain from bursting out in agony at prospect of such loss have asked for nothing yet papa exactly perhaps may not wish to know what to do when demand be made be not going to oppose now money be own have right to do with a please must gratify in one thing what be papa when doe apply let amount be raised through how through come to mean so may see lawyer have arrangement made then explained to that in dealing with large sum of money must not be right that must do so without knowledge even though property be own will promise will not oppose wish said then alice undertook when such case must arise money must be raised through mean day one following received letter from lady glencora who be still at matching priory be light spirited chatty amusing letter intended to be happy in tone intended to have flavour of happiness just failing through too apparent meaning of word here there will see that be at matching letter said whereas will remember be to have be at monkshade

possible own be thinking of at monkshade be in truth delighted that be not there absence be entirely laid upon shoulder that wicked evening amidst ruin poor ruin go there alone sometimes fancy that hear such voice from wall see such face through broken window old pallisers come frown at tell that be not good enough to belong to there be particular window to sir guy come make face at told iphy other day answered very gravely that might if chose make good enough for pallisers even for pallisers be that beautiful then lady glencora went on to say that husband intended to come up to london early in session that must accompany be added lady glencora if be still good enough for pallisers at time chapter xxxviii inn at shap when george vavasor left mr scruby office attentive reader will remember that did call upon mr scruby parliamentary lawyer there recognised necessity of putting in possession of small sum of money with a little delay a possible when left attorney office be well aware that work to be done be still before knew also that job to be undertaken be very disagreeable job did not like task of borrowing cousin alice money of know that swindler rogue do very dirty trick be apt to picture to ourselves certain amount of gusto delight on part of swindler in doing of in think be wrong poor broken semi genteel beggar who borrows half sovereign apiece from old acquaintance knowing that know that will never repay suffers separate little agony with petition that make doe not enjoy pleasant sailing in journey be making to be refused be painful to to get half sovereign with scorn be painful to get with apparent confidence in honour be almost more painful d say to on such rare occasion will pay fellow yet a say know that never will pay even that fellow be comfortless unsatisfying trade that of living upon other people money how be george vavasor to make first step towards getting hand into cousin purse have gone to asking for love have shuddered when asked have be commencement of life under new engagement knew very well that money must be forthcoming when demanded under present joint circumstance how be to make demand if wrote to must simply ask for money make allusion to love if went to in person must make visit mere visit of business a might call on banker resolved at last that kate must do work for indeed have felt all along that must be well that kate must act a ambassador between alice in money matter a have long done in other thing must talk to kate a must not talk to alice then between woman hard money necessity must be softened down by romantic phraseology must not know how to use with effect made up mind to see kate with view went down to westmoreland took to small wayside inn at shap among fell have be known to of old gave sister notice that must be there begged to come over to a early a might find possible on morning after arrival reached place late in evening by train from london there be station at shap by railway company doubt conceives that have conferred on somewhat rough remote locality advantage of refined civilization doubt whether shappites have be thankful for favour landlord at inn for one be not thankful shap have be place owing such life a have possessed to coaching posting have be stage on high road from lancaster to carlisle though lay high bleak among fell be cold windy thinly populated place filling traveller with thankfulness that have not be made shappites nevertheless have have glory in coaching posting have doubt that there be men woman who look back with fond regret to palmy day of shap vavasor reached little inn about nine in evening on night be pitchy dark in wind made necessary for to hold hat on to head what beastly country to live in said to resolving that must certainly sell vavasor hall in spite of family association if ever power to do so must be what trash be said hanging on to place a without mean of living like gentleman simply because one ancestor have done so then expressed doubt to whether world contained more ignorant opinionated useless old man than grandfather in short greater fool well mr george said landlord a soon a saw sight of guid for sair een be o'er lang since have be doon amang fell george did not want to converse with innkeeper to explain how be that did not visit vavasor innkeeper doubt knew about knew that grandfather have quarrelled with grandson knew reason why george if suspected such knowledge did not choose to refer to so simply grunted something in reply getting in before spark of fire hardly be burning in public room with sandy floor begged that little sitting room up stair might be got ready for there passed evening in solitude giving encouragement to landlord who nevertheless looked up three four time till at last george said that head ached that must wish to be alone be always one of cankery chiels a never have kindly word for man beast said landlord seems a though raw slash in face have gone right through into heart after george be left alone sat thinking whether must not be better to ask alice for two thousand pound at once so a to save from disagreeable necessity of second borrowing before marriage be very uneasy in mind have flattered through that cousin have loved have felt sure that such be case while be together in switzerland when have determined to give up john grey of course have told same thing when have at once answered first subsequent overture with assent have of course be certain that be so dark selfish even dishonest a be have nevertheless enjoyed something of lover true pleasure in believing that alice have still loved through mischance joy have in moment be turned into gall during interview in queen anne street have read truth at glance man must be very vain else very little used to such matter who at george vavasor age can not understand feeling with woman receives when alice contrived a have done to escape embrace be so well justified in asking knew whole truth be sore at heart very angry withal must have readily spurned from rejected who have once rejected must have done so have not need for money restrained be not man who must deceive in such matter knew that be so told that be rascal vavasor hall be by road about five mile from shap be not altogether easy task for kate to get over to village without informing grandfather that visit be to be made what be purport must indeed walk walk must not be so long a that have taken with alice to swindale fell walking to inn on high road be not same thing a walking to point on hill side over lake have be dirty draggled wet through on swindale fell must have simply be matter for mirth brother knew must not have liked to see enter lowther arm at shap in such condition therefore became necessary that must ask grandfather to lend jaunting car where do want to go asked sharply in such establishment a at vavasor family horse be generally used for double duty though draw lady of house one day be not too proud to draw manure on next will always be found that master of house give great preference to manure over lady squire at vavasor have come to do so to extent that regarded application for animal service a encroachment only to shap grandpapa to shap what on earth can take to shap there be shop at shap be not going to do shopping want to see one there whom can want to see at shap then occurred to kate on spur of moment that might a well tell grandfather fact brother have come down said be at inn there have not intended to tell a did not wish to mention name till have consented to receive here expects to come here now doe said squire oh sir think have expectation of kind have come down simply to see about business believe business what business suppose want to get money from think be with reference to marriage think want to use influence with alice that may not be delayed look here kate if ever lend money of be of principal mean will never speak to again under circumstance more than look here kate in spite of have past gone property will become for life when die unless change will if get money from will change will not be shilling richer at death than be now can have horse to go to shap what unlucky chance have be have put idea into old squire head on especial morning kate have resolved that must entreat brother to make use of little fortune feared that be now coming with reference to cousin money that something be to be done to enable to avail of cousin offer kate almost blushing in solitude of chamber at thought be determined that brother must be saved from such temptation knew that money be necessary to knew that must not stand second contest without assistance with confidence have never told much of pecuniary circumstance in world be almost sure that be poor man have said a much a to in letter desiring to come to at shap have inserted word two purposely intended to prepare mind for monetary consideration a be jogged along over rough road to shap made up mind that aunt greenow must be proper person to defray expense of coming election to give kate due must have given up shilling of own money without moment hesitation feeling that brother must be wrong to accept must perhaps have be unalterably opposed to taking alice money have alice simply be cousin felt that a vavasors be bound to stand by future head of family in attempt be to be made a felt for general vavasor interest must not endure to think that brother must take money of girl whom be engaged to marry aunt greenow money thought be fair game aunt greenow have made various liberal offer to herself kate have declined not caring to be under pecuniary obligation even to aunt greenow without necessity felt that for purpose a brother contest need not hesitate to ask for assistance thought also that such assistance must be forthcoming grandpapa know that be here george said kate when first greeting be over deuce doe why did tell must not get car to come in without letting know why wanted what nonsense a if must have made excuse be particularly anxious that must not guess that be here see that can make difference george see that can very great difference may prevent ever being able to get near again before dy what did say about coming did say much made offer a to going there must not have gone if have know now that ever will go to be there to do good so a to make alter will leave in position have right to expect must take more time than whole property be worth must endeavour to tie down in way must not stand perhaps ask to give up notion for going into parliament might ask must not make ground for quarrel if refused be so unreasonable ignorant that be better away from kate have not congratulated on matrimonial prospect indeed did george when wrote to did well have forgotten know that very strong congratulatory tone be necessary a thing go perhaps may be a well for of be about best can be said for george see be not romantic kate a be dozen child with small income generally present a being desirable to men who wish to push way in world know have always longed to make wife know anything of kind have always be under match making hallucination on point in case have be so far successful be entitled to triumph want triumph ought to know will tell do want kate want money then paused a did not answer immediately be obliged to go on speaking be not at sure have not be wrong in making attempt to get into parliament be not struggling to pick fruit be above reach say that george ah ca help feeling need hardly tell that be ready to risk anything of own if know must toss up to morrow for matter of to day between gallows seat in house can not go on with contest by risking what be merely own money for immediate use have none left neck though be ever so willing to risk be of service have can be yours to morrow said kate in hesitating voice too plainly pronounced misery a made offer must not refrain from making though grandfather threat be ringing in ear though knew that might be ruining brother by proposing loan have alternative when brother told of want of money must not abstain from tendering to use of what be own said will not take money must not scruple if knew how welcome be at rate will not take must not think right that have must only just suffice for present want must not choose to make beggar there must moreover be difficulty about readjusting payment there must be difficulty because one need be consulted two must not think right therefore let there be end of said george in tone of voice have in something of magniloquence what be wish then said kate who knew too well what did wish will explain to when alice be married of course there will be settlement made on a be grandchild of old squire will propose that vavasor property will be hers for life in event of outliving well said kate if be done there can be harm in forestalling of property under circumstance of such settlement must of course become mine when be married squire might leave property to whom plea know very well that wo at rate leave out of family in fact must only be too glad to consent to agreement a have proposed because must thereby rob of power in matter must not be done till be married look here kate make difficulty now a looked at cicature on face seemed to open yawn at if mean to say that wo help do say so will go back to london must do anything in power to help be not wrong yes anybody must say a much a be not much of offer if be to keep to yourself power of deciding what be wrong will write to alice better still go to explain want money how can go to london now can do very well if choose if be too much then write to will come much better from than from write to explain must pay in advance expense of contest can not look for success unless do so did not think that demand must come so quick on know be not man of capital therefore can not expect to carry on fight for unless know that money be sure scruby have be bitten two three time by metropolitan fellow be determined that will not be bitten again then paused for kate to speak george said slowly well wish must try other scheme that there be other scheme be so like woman to quarrel with only plan be practicable think ought to take alice money dear kate must allow to be best judge of what ought to do what

drinking wine after dinner old man must not openly quarrel with heir on point a even mr vavasor must not tell grandson that be going to dog because have become temperate nevertheless there be offence in when george sat perfectly silent looking at fire evidently determined to make attempt at conversation offence grew became strong what devil use of sitting there if neither drink talk said old man

father told that lawyer must manage that be nearly end of february when george vavasor made first payment to mr scruby on behalf of coming election when called at mr scruby office with object received intelligence surprised not little have heard news said scruby what news said george marquis be a nearly off hook a man can be mr scruby a communicated tidings showed clearly by face voice that be supposed to be of very great importance vavasor did not at first seem to be a much interested in fate of marquis a scruby have intended be very sorry for said george who be marquis there will be sure to come so much signify there will come be just be marquis of bunratty if drop young member will go into upper house what immediately before end of session george of course knew well enough that such must be case effect event must have upon now struck suddenly to be sure said writ must be out immediately must be glad enough of only that know that travers people have heard of before that be ready to be up with poster directly breath be out of marquis body must go to work immediately be will only be for part of session said george just so said mr scruby then there will be cost of election be

looking nastily at attorney ca help little accident mr vavasor there be worse accident than turn up almost daily in business may think almost lucky have gone over to travers be liberal know have be for want of offer can tell vavasor be inclined to doubt extent of luck in respect be almost disposed to repent of parliamentary ambition must now be called upon to spend certainly not le than three thousand pound of cousin money on chance of being able to sit in parliament for few month then after what fashion must be compelled to negotiate loan might to be sure allow remainder of session to run stand a have intended at general election knew that if now allowed liberal to win seat holder of seat must be almost sure of subsequent success must either fight now give up fight altogether be man who did not love to abandon contest in have be engaged well squire said scruby how be to be vavasor felt that detected in man voice diminution of respect with have hitherto be treated a paying

member can pull together wo have much of chance vavasor found compelled to say that must stand scruby undertook to give initiatory order at once not waiting even till marquis must be dead must have house open a soon a theirs said there be deal in so george vavasor gave order if worst come to worst said to can always cut throat a walked from attorney office to club bethought that might not unprobably be necessary termination of career everything be going wrong with grandfather who be eighty year of age must not die appeared to have symptom of dying whereas marquis who be not yet much over fifty be rushing headlong out of world simply because be one man whose continued life at present moment must be serviceable to george vavasor a thought of grandfather almost broke umbrella by vehemence with struck against pavement what right must ignorant old fool like have to live for ever keeping possession of property must not use ruining who be to come after if now at moment wretched place down in westmoreland must become might yet ride triumphantly over difficulty refrain from sullying hand with more of cousin money till must become wife even thousand pound have not passed through hand without giving much bitter suffering a be always case in such matter thing done be worse than doing of have taught to look at lightly whilst be yet unaccomplished must not think of lightly now kate have be right must have be better for to take money money must have be better than upon have laid sacrilegious hand if must have cut purse after old fashion stain of deed must hardly

have by mean given general support to ministry in last session took seat on same side of house indeed low down near to cross bench mr bott sat close behind men knew that mr bott be distinguished member of mr palliser party whatever that party might be lord cinquebars moved address must confess that did very lamely be once accused by mr maxwell brewer of making great noise in hunting field accusation must not be repeated a to performance on occasion a one must hear word that said address be seconded by mr loftus fitzhoward nephew of duke of st bungay who spoke a though be resolved to trump poor lord cinquebars in sentence pronounced a so often hear second clergyman from communion table trumping weary predecessor who have just finished litany not in clearest most audible voice word fell from mr fitzhoward with elaborate accuracy of separate pistol shot a became pleased with in progress warm with work accented word sharply made rhetorical pause even moved hand about in action quite disgusted own party who have be very well satisfied with lord cinquebars there be many rock young speaker in parliament must avoid rock requires such careful avoiding a rock of eloquence may be fault let at least avoid eloquence must not be inaccurate however be not much must not be long winded be good deal must not be ill tempered be more none of fault be so damnable a eloquence mr fitzhoward friend enemy knew that have have chance that have thrown away in queen speech there have be very lukewarm allusion to remission of direct taxation remission have already be carried so far must be carried further if such further carrying be found practicable so have said queen word be known must not have be approved of by energetic still existing chancellor of exchequer on subject mover of address said never word seconder only word two what have said have of course be laid down for though unfortunately manner of saying must not be so easily prescribed then there arose great enemy man fluent of diction apparently with deep malice at heart though at home a used to say at school one of most good natured fellow in world one ambitious of godship seat on other side of house bestowed greedy to grasp at chance disagreement in council of god might give be quite content said to vote for address a believed must be gentleman on side of house one must suspect of giving factious opposition to government have not borne forborne beyond precedent known in house then touched lightly almost with grace to opponent on many subject promising support barely hinting that be totally manifestly wrong in thing then tone of voice changed well known look of fury be assumed upon countenance then great jove on other side pulled hat over eye smiled blandly then member put away paper have be reading for moment men in gallery began to listen long short of be that existing government have come into power on cry of reduction of taxation now be going to shirk responsibility of own measure be going to shirk responsibility of own election cry although be known that own chancellor of exchequer be prepared to carry out to full be willing to carry out to full be not restrained by timidity falsehood treachery of colleague of whom of course most timid most false most treacherous be great god jove who sat blandly smiling on other side illustration great jove one must ever go near house of common who wish to enjoy be so manifestly evident that jove of satellite cared twopence for what irate gentleman be saying nay became so evident that in spite of assumed fury gentleman be not irate intended to communicate look of anger to newspaper report of speech knew from experience that must succeed in men walked about house in most telling moment enemy shaking hand with enemy in way showed entire absence of good honest hatred among gentleman went on finished speech demanding at last in direct term that treasury jove must state plainly to house who be to be who be not to be bearer of purse among god then treasury jove got up smiling thanked enemy for cordiality of support have always said done gentleman party justice for clemency have feared opposition from be glad to find that be correct in anticipation a to course must pursue on present occasion went on saying good deal about home matter foreign matter proving that everything be right just a easily a enemy have proved that everything be wrong on point be very full very courteous when came to subject of taxation simply repeated passage from queen speech expressing hope that right honourable friend chancellor of exchequer must be able to satisfy judgement of house wish of people specially personal question have be asked did not answer at house be still all agog a be crowded gallery energetic still existing chancellor of exchequer be then present divided only by one little thin secretary of state from jove must get up declare purpose be man who almost always did get up when opportunity offered when did not second little gun be fired off from opposition bench then there be pause must purse bearer of olympus rise upon wing speak mind must sit in silence upon cloud there be general call for purse bearer floated in silence be inexplicable purse bearer be not to be bullied into sudden reading of riddle then there came on general debate about money matter in purse bearer did say few word said nothing a to great question at issue at last up got mr palliser towards close of evening occupied full hour in explaining what tax government might remit with safety what might not mr bott meanwhile prompting with figure from behind with assiduity be almost too persistent according to mr palliser word used in queen speech be not at too cautious member went out gradually house became very thin during oration newspaper declared next morning that speech have be speech of night that perspicuity of mr palliser pointed out a coming man returned home to house in park lane quite triumphant after success found

there while burgo fitzgerald must be in vicinity must not analyse own wish often told a have told alice that must be better for that must go away in throwing even to dog if such must be result must do more of good than of harm declared to herself in most passionate word must use that loved man with heart protested that fault must not be hers theirs who have forced to marry man did not love assured that husband have affection for that marriage be in respect prejudicial to recurred over over again in thought to own childlessness to extreme desire for heir though do sacrifice must say will do more

to to be so intolerably cruel demand of that must be made to pas whole of first evening in town with old woman for whom be impossible that must entertain slightest regard that resolved upon rebellion have positively ordered mr marsham must have sent for lady have contented with enduring presence in disdainful silence mr palliser have not given order have made request request from very nature admits of obedience compliance with request must be voluntary must not send for mr marsham except upon compulsion have not also made request to have not refused be prerogative undoubtedly to command in matter of request have right to expect that voice must be a potent a own wrote line therefore to alice before went to bed begging cousin to come to early on following day so that might go out together then afterwards dine in company with mr bott know will be inducement to lady glencora said because generous heart will feel of what service may be to nobody else will be here unless indeed mr marsham must be asked unknown to myself then sat down to think to think especially about cruelty of husband have be told over over again in day before marriage that burgo must ill use if became husband marquis of auld reekie have gone so far a to suggest burgo might probably beat what hard treatment even what beating must be so unendurable a total want of sympathy a deadness in life present lot entailed upon a for matter of beating ridiculed idea in very soul sat smiling at absurdity of thing a thought of beauty of burgo eye of softness of touch of loving almost worshipping tone of voice must not even be better to be beaten by than to have politics explained to at one o'clock at night by husband a plantagenet palliser british constitution indeed have married burgo must have be in sunny italy must have told other tale than a sat together under pale moonlight have little water coloured drawing called raphael fornarina be infantine enough to tell that so called raphael be like burgo not burgo burgo be not hers at rate romance of picture might have enjoyed have allowed to dispose a have wished of own hand might have sat in marble balcony while vine clustered over head must have be at knee hardly speaking to making presence felt by halo of divinity must have called upon for hard reply with near must have enjoyed soft air must have sat happy without trouble lapped in delight of loving be thus that fornarina sat why must not such lot have be hers raphael must have loved let say what must about cruelty poor wretched overburthened child to whom commonest lesson of life have not yet be taught who have now fallen into hand of one who be so ill fitted to teach who must not pity who must say that fault be hers world have laden with wealth till have have limb free for ordinary us then have turned loose to run race have written to cousin husband asked next morning voice a spoke clearly showed that anger be either over suppressed yes have asked to come drive then to stay for dinner will send carriage for if can come man be to wait for answer very well said mr palliser mildly then after short pause added a be settled perhaps must have objection to ask mr marsham also wo probably be engaged think not said mr palliser then added being ashamed of tinge of falsehood of must otherwise have be guilty know be not engaged expects to come then said lady glencora have not asked if mean that glencora have done so must have said so told did not know what engagement be will write to if please said wife who felt that must hardly refuse longer do dear said husband so lady glencora did write to mr marsham who promised to come a did also alice vavasor lady glencora must at rate have alice to herself for hour before dinner at first took comfort in reflection after while bethought that must not know what to tell alice what not to tell did mean to show letter to cousin if did show then so argued with must bring to endure wretchedness of present lot must give up for ever dream about raphael fornarina if did not show at rate tell of then must come to pas that must leave husband under protection of man must become what did not dare to name even to herself declared that so must be knew that must go with burgo must ever come to with mean of going at instant command must bring to let alice know that letter have be conveyed to burgo must never

greeting between cousin be very affectionate lady glencora received a though have be playmate from early childhood alice though such impulsive love be not natural to a to other must not bring to be cold to one who be so warm to indeed have not promised love in meeting at matching priory in cousin have told of wretchedness will love have said though there be much in lady glencora that must not approve much even that must not bring to like still must not allow heart to contradict word sat so long over fire in drawing room at last agreed that driving must be abandoned what be use of said lady glencora there be nothing to see wind be a cold a charity be much more comfortable here be not alice quite acquiesced in having great desire to be driven through park in gloom of february afternoon if have dandy flirt up here there must be fun in mr palliser doe wish to drive in london suppose must be dangerous not in least think be that mind have idea that look fast so doe if be man be sure must like wife to drive horse about london why not just because 'd be tyrant like other husband what be harm of looking fast if one doe do anything improper poor dandy dear flirt be sure 'd like perhaps mr palliser doe care for can tell something else doe care for doe care whether dandy mistress like say that glencora why not say to teach to think be what mean believe must consent to anything that did

for love of thing client so thinking have believed for few hour scruby in jolly passionate eagerness must pour out own money like dust trusting implicitly to future day for return such client have soon encountered mr scruby other manner have perceived that be mistaken thing have come so suddenly upon george vavasor that there be not time for to carry on further operation through sister have written to kate let have written in what language must must have first rejoined by negative there must have be correspondence before have induced to comply thought of sending for by telegram even in

excitement of such interview must be triumphant in present contest must go to to share triumph with must fail must go to to console in failure within three day heard from saying that money must be at once placed to credit sent also candid good wish for success in enterprise beyond letter said nothing there be word of love word of welcome expression of desire to see vavasor a perceived in reading of note felt triumph in possession of money be ill using by coldness there be comfort in revenge serf right said to must have married at once when said must do so then must have be own when mr tombe

made further tender of own money must not reply to offer without telling that money have be forthcoming from that other quarter so left unanswered in meantime battle went on gloriously mr travers other liberal candidate spent money freely else other person did so on behalf when mr scruby mentioned last alternative to george vavasor george cursed own luck in have never found such backer call man member when be brought in like said mr scruby comforting ca do what like with vote ai independent never hear of fellow getting anything good pay for article mr vavasor then be own be what always

ignominiously into river mud be done under direction of mr grime vavasor be pelted with offal from sinking tide so that very name of river bank became odious to be man who did not like to have person touched when hustled became angry lord love mr vavasor said scruby be nothing have have candidate so mauled be in hamlet think that there be spot on be painted with rotten egg smell be something quite awful brought in through mr scruby at last did a much for george vavasor a have done for hero of hamlet at close of poll vavasor name stood at head by considerable majority scruby comforted by saying that travers certainly must stand expense of petition a seat be to be held only for few month have done very cheap mr vavasor said scruby considering that seat be metropolitan do say that have done cheap thousand twelve hundred will cover everything say thirteen perhaps at outside when will have fought battle once again will have paid footing fellow will let in almost for nothing after that further sum of thirteen hundred pound be wanted at once then whole thing be to be repeated over again in six month time be not consolatory nevertheless there be triumph in thing george vavasor be man

intend to become wife if after that wilfully make miserable will not that be unfair be not making miserable certainly not wilfully did that letter wrote to from westmoreland mean anything george strive to make think that meant too much if did have better say so at once alice though must have said so have dared made answer to sat silent turning face away from gaze longing that meeting might be over feeling that have lost own self respect look here alice said find very hard to understand when look back over have passed between to other episode in life summing up with conduct to at present find at loss to read character fear can not help in reading of when first loved for did love understood well enough there be young man who in early life doe not read with sufficient clearness that sweetest morsel of poetry when quarrelled with judging somewhat harshly of offence understood also for be custom of woman to be hard in judgement on such sin when heard that have accepted offer made to by gentleman in cambridgeshire thought understood still knowing how natural be that must seek cure for wound understood accused not in have driven to so fatal remedy here alice turned round towards sharply a though be going to interrupt said nothing though paused for to speak then went on understood well when heard that cure have be too much for by heaven yes there be misunderstanding meant insult to man when upset little toy just now have not word to say against for many woman must make model husband be not one of when discovered a did understood without difficulty yes by heaven if ever woman have be driven to mistake have be driven to one there here looked at again met eye looked at with something of own fierceness in face a though be preparing to fight with said nothing at moment then again went on alice understood also when again consented to be wife thought that still understood then may have be vain to think so surely be natural believed that old love have come back upon again warmed heart thought that have be cold during separation be pleased to think so be that unnatural put in place say if must not have thought so told that understood then told that in that have done have acted a true good loving woman thought of much saw that conduct a whole be intelligible becoming last word grated on alice ear showed anger by motion of foot upon floor cousin noted went on a though have not noted now present behaviour make rest riddle have said that must be wife declaring thereby that have forgiven offence a suppose reassuring of love yet receive with imaginable coldness what be to think of in what way must have behave to when last be here asked for kiss a said looked at with eye with mouth just open so a to show edge of white teeth with wound down face wide purple last word came with stigmatizing hiss from lip though did not essay to speak paused again a if be desirous that might realize full purport of request think that in energy of speaking touch of true passion have come upon that have forgotten rascaldom need of money that be punishing with whole power of vengeance for treatment have received from asked for kiss if be to be wife can have shame in granting such request within last two month have told that must marry what be to think of promise if deny customary sign of affection then paused again found that time have come in must say

worn for sake whereupon something have taken from waistcoat pocket be thrown violently into fender beneath fire grate then walked with quick step to door when hand be on handle turned alice said when be gone try to think honestly of conduct to then went remained still till heard front door close behind when be sure that be gone first movement be made in search of trinket fear that be not dignified on part think that be natural be not that have desire for jewel curiosity even to see must very much have preferred that must have brought nothing of kind to have feminine reluctance that anything of value must be destroyed without purpose so took shovel poked among ash found ring cousin have thrown there be valuable ring bearing ruby on between two small diamond such at least became aware have be bearing one of side stone have be knocked out by violence with ring have be flung searched even for scorching face eye in vain then made up mind that diamond must be lost for ever that must go out among cinder into huge dust heap of metropolis better that though be distasteful to feminine economy than other alternative of setting servant to search thereby telling something of what have be done when search be over placed ring on mantelpiece knew that must not do to leave there so folded up carefully in new sheet of note paper put in drawer of desk after sat down at table to think what must do head be in truth racked with pain on occasion must bring thought to conclusion chapter xlvii mr cheesacre disappointment when mr greenow be left alone in lodging after little entertainment have given to two lover sat down to think seriously over affair there be three path open before might take mr cheesacre might take captain bellfield might decide that must have nothing more to say to of in

once a told very plainly on occasion thought that might now venture on little love marriage for money have be altogether successful nursing of old greenow have not be very disagreeable to have taken longer than have anticipated have now got reward that have ever promised herself really did feel grateful to memory almost think that among plentiful tear few drop belonged to sincerity be essentially happy tempered woman blessed with good digestion who looked back upon past life with contentment forward to future life with confidence must not be greedy said to herself did not want more money therefore must have none of mr cheesacre so far resolved resolving also that if possible mahogany furnitured bedroom must be kept in family made over to niece kate vavasor must marry for love if so must captain bellfield be man strange to say poverty scampishness lie almost recommended to at rate be not of thing that be afraid have woman true belief in own power thought that must cure a far a needed cure a for story about inkerman little debt cared nothing about also have inkermans be quite aware that made a good use of a captain did of a for debt be man to do who have got money also have owed for glove corset in ante greenow day of adventure there be danger that there might be more behind of have never heard mr bellfield be not impossible what if instead of being real captain at must

there be nothing wo quiet at oileymead to night if brandy water do a said jeannette slipt into chair held up hand in token of intensity of fear why silly child be not going home together at did not captain go away first captain did go away first certainly thought perhaps be to get pistol fighting thing ready wo fight jeannette gentleman have given over fighting have ma'be that make much easier for lady doubt perhaps peaceable way will come down to such a in time 'd be comfort know to a be quiet given like hate to see men knocking other head about do so mr cheesacre captain wo fight ma'be of course wo little fool dear dear be so sure must have have paper full of perhaps one of stretched upon bloody bier wonder must have be always made up mind that captain must be wounded in of wital part unless be heart know ma'be why must quarrel at jeannette be most foolish thing well ma'be know about what else be to do there be thing a can cry half about there be cry half about about what jeannette why about ma'be jeannette wonder how can say such thing a if in position have ever said word to encourage of know be not true jeannette must say so whereupon mr greenow put handkerchief to eye

said nothing about love must instantly mend that fault have bidden not to be so communicative about wealth henceforth must be dumb on subject nevertheless must not think that knowledge of circumstance lady already possessed must be of service to ca really like poor beggarly wretch who have got shilling said to be very far from feeling that battle be already lost last word to have be assurance of friendship then why must have be at so much trouble to tell way in ought to address if be indifferent a to address be doubt becoming tired of courtship heartily wished that work be over be not minded to give up therefore prepared for attack took into norwich without seeking counsel from one must not trust to think that must really wish to refuse after encouragement have given on occasion put on pink shirt shiny boot being deterred from doing so by remembrance of captain bellfield ridicule nevertheless dressed with considerable care clothed nether person in knickerbockers with tight leathern bright coloured gaiter round leg being conscious of certain manly grace symmetrical proportion might a thought stand in good stead put on new shooting coat button on be elaborate wonderful waistcoat

about love have taken two glass of cherry brandy hoping that might enable to do so have put on coat with brilliant button new knickerbockers in order that might be master of occasion be resolved to call spade spade to speak boldly of passion how be to begin there be difficulty be now seated in chair there remained silent for minute two while smoothed eyebrow with handkerchief after last slight

have to make way up stair alone servant called mr marsh under name got passed on into front drawing room there sat down not having seen lady monk meditated over injury be past eleven before lady glencora arrived burgo fitzgerald have begun to think that evil star intended that must never see again have be wickedly baulked at monkshade by what influence have never yet ascertained now thought that same influence must be at work to keep again away from aunt house have settled in mind accurate plan of campaign have in thought fixed arrangement by might do thing meditated have attempted to make such plan a be case with men to whom thinking be unusual operation concluded at last that have better leave to course of event be however obviously necessary that must see lady glencora before course of event must be made to do anything for have written to making proposition in bold term felt that if be utterly decided against anger at suggestion at least refusal must have be made known to in way silence did not absolutely give consent seemed to show consent be not impossible from ten o'clock to past eleven stood about on staircase of aunt house waiting for name be desirous of hearing almost feared to hear men spoke to woman also hardly answered aunt once called into room with cautionary frown on brow bade go dance look so dreadfully preoccupied said to in whisper shook head at

glencora name announced have already seen mr palliser come in make way up stair quarter of hour before a to that be indifferent have known that husband be to be there when long expected name reached ear heart seemed to jump within what on spur of moment must do a have resolved that must be doing that something must be done let be what might hurried to dining room door be just in time to see be seen a lady glencora be passing up stair be just above a got out into hall so that must not absolutely greet with hand looked up at caught eye looked up moved hand to in token of salutation looked down at expression of face altered visibly a glance met barely bowed to with eye rather than with head flattered that there be at rate anger in countenance how beautiful be a gazed up at leaning against wall a stood watching a made slow way up stair felt that eye be on where stair turned must not restrain from one other glance a eye fell on again mouth opened fancied that must hear faint sigh that uttered be glorious mouth such a old sculptor gave to marble god burgo if be so that have not heart enough to love truly must look a though loved be not in deceit what men call acting expression came to naturally though expressed so much more than there be within a strong word come to men who have knowledge that be speaking strongly at moment burgo fitzgerald looked a though be possible that might die of love lady glencora be met at top of stair by lady monk who came out to almost into gallery with sweetest smile so that newly arrived guest of course entered into small room there sat duchess of st bungay on stool in corner there next to duchess at moment engaged in conversation stood mr bott there be lady there who stood very high in world whom lady monk be very glad to welcome young marchioness of hartletop be in slight mourning for father in law late marquis have died no t yet quite six month since very beautiful be one whose presence at house lady gentleman prized alike never said silly thing like duchess never be troublesome a to people conduct to be always gracious yet be never led away into intimacy be without peer best dressed woman in london yet gave air then be so exquisitely beautiful smile be loveliness there be indeed people who said that meant nothing then what must smile of young married woman mean have not be born in purple like lady glencora father being country clergyman who have never reached higher grade than of archdeacon knew way of high life what exigeant husband must demand of much better than poor glencora must have spoken of man a baboon with bristly beard never talked of long short of did not wander out o ' night in winter among ruin made fast friendship with lady whom lord did not like have once indeed be approached by lover since have be married mr palliser having be offender have turned affair to infinite credit profit have gained husband closest confidence by telling of have yet not brought on hostile collision have even dismissed lover without annoying then lady hartletop be miracle of woman lady glencora be miracle though born in purple be made of ordinary flesh blood a entered lady monk little room hardly knew how to recover sufficiently for purpose of ordinary conversation dear lady glencora do come in for moment to den be so sorry not to have at monkshade heard such terrible thing about health lady glencora said that be only cold bad cold oh yes heard something about moonlight ruin so like know love sort of thing above people doe do doe circumstance be so exacting think know lady hartletop there be duchess of st bungay mr palliser be here five minute since then lady monk be obliged to get to door again lady glencora found standing close to lady hartletop saw mr palliser just pas through said lady hartletop who be able to meet speak of man who have dared to approach with love without slightest nervousness yes said must be here said lady glencora there be great crowd said lady hartletop did think london be so full very great said lady glencora then have said to other society required lady glencora a know must talk with imprudent vehemence by hour together if liked companion other lady seldom committed by more word than have uttered now unless be to tirewoman how very well be looking said duchess heard have be so ill of midnight escapade among ruin be fated that lady glencora must never hear last how d 'ye do lady glencowrer sounded in ear there be great red paw stuck out for to take after what have passed between lady glencora husband to day about mr bott be determined that must not take mr bott hand how be mr bott said think will look for mr palliser in back room dear lady glencora whispered duchess in ecstasy of agony lady glencora turned bowed head to stout friend do let go away with there be that woman mr conway sparkes coming know how hate have nothing to do to take duchess under wing passed into large room together be think more than probable that mr conway sparkes have be brought in by lady monk a only way of removing duchess from stool just within dancing room lady glencora found husband standing in corner looking a though be making calculation be going away said coming up to only just came because said must will be late oh suppose not will dance perhaps once just to show be not old woman heat good bye then went in crush of doorway passed burgo fitzgerald whose eye be intently fixed upon wife looked at burgo thought of young man former hope flashed across mind remembrance too of caution have be whispered to for moment did suspicion come to that ought to stop watch by wife chapter l how lady glencora came back from lady monk party burgo fitzgerald remained for minute two leaning where last saw against dining room wall at bottom of staircase a did so thought be almost solemn passed across mind thing that be about to do to attempt be in good thing must be good for whom pretended to love what must be future if consented now to go with to divide from husband of own future thought not at all have never done so even when have first found attracted by reputation of wealth can not be said to have looked forward in prudential way to coming year desire to put in possession of so magnificent fortune have simply prompted a might have be prompted to play for high stake at gaming table now during moment did think little of must be happy simply because loved when woman must cease to acknowledge when men must regard a one degraded dishonoured when society must be closed against when must be driven to live loudly because softness grace of quiet life must be denied to burgo knew well what must be nature of woman life in such circumstance must glencora be happy with while living life simply because loved under such circumstance be likely that must continue to love did not know to be most inconstant of men least trustworthy leaning thus against wall at bottom of stair did ask question with something of true feeling about heart almost persuaded that have better take hat wander forth anywhere into street mattered little what might become of if must drink out of world might be end of thing must be not altogether undesirable then remembrance of aunt two hundred pound came upon money even now have about on person certain idea of honour told that be bound to do for money have be given to a to telling aunt that have changed mind therefore refunding money such thought a be possible to to give back two hundred pound entire two hundred pound be already within clutch be not within compass of burgo generosity remembering cash told that hesitation be no longer possible to so gathered up stretched hand over head uttered sigh be audible to around took up stair looked in at aunt room then saw be seen by well burgo said with sweetest smile have be dancing turned away from without answering muttering something between teeth about cold blooded jezebel if have heard must have made think most ungrateful of men did not hear smiled still a went away saying something to mr conway sparkes a to great change for better have taken place in nephew conduct there be knowing who may not reform said mr sparkes with emphasis seemed to lady monk to be almost uncourteous burgo made way first into front room then into larger room where dancing be in progress there saw lady glencora standing up in quadrille with marquis of hartletop lord hartletop be man not much more given to conversation than wife lady glencora seemed to go through work with very little gratification either in dancing in society of partner be simply standing up to dance because a have told mr palliser lady of age generally do stand up on such occasion burgo watched a crossed re crossed room at last be aware of presence made change in except became even somewhat le animated than have be before must not seem to see must allow to be driven into pretence of conversation with partner because be there will go up to at once ask to waltz burgo said to a soon a last figure of quadrille be in action why must not ask a well a other woman then music ceased after minute interval lord hartletop took away partner on arm into room burgo who have be standing near door followed at once crowd be great so that must not get near even keep in sight be aware of way in be going be five minute after when again saw then be seated on cane bench in gallery old woman be standing close to talking to be mr marsham cautioning against petty imprudence lady glencora be telling that lady that needed such advice in word almost a curt a have used lord hartletop have left feeling that a far a be concerned have done duty for night burgo knew nothing of mr marsham have never seen before be quite unaware that have special connection with mr palliser be impossible thought to find lady glencora in better position for purpose so made way up to through crowd muttering slight inaudible word offered hand will do very well thank mr marsham lady glencora said at moment pray trouble then gave hand to fitzgerald mr marsham though unknown to knew with quite sufficient accuracy who be history a far a concerned friend wife have learned whole story of love of burgo lady glencora though mr palliser have never mentioned that man name to be well aware that duty a duenna must make expedient that must keep doubly wary eye upon must come near sheepfold there be close to almost leaning over with hand of late lady love hand of mr palliser wife within own how lady glencora might have carried at moment have mr marsham not be there be bootless now to surmise may be well understood under mr marsham immediate eye resolution must be in burgo favour looked at softly kindly though uttered articulate word countenance seemed to show that meeting be not unpleasant to will waltz said burgo asking not at all a though be special favour asking exactly a might have done have be in habit of dancing with other other night for last three month think lady glencora will waltz to night said mr marsham very stiffly certainly did not know business a duenna else enormity of burgo proposition have struck so forcibly a to take away from presence of mind otherwise must have be aware that answer from must surely drive friend wife into open hostility why not mr marsham said lady glencora rising from seat why must waltz to night rather think will more especially a mr fitzgerald waltz very well thereupon put hand upon burgo arm mr marsham made still little effort little effort be probably involuntary put out hand laid on lady glencora left shoulder looking into face a did so with severity of caution of be mistress lady glencora shook duenna off angrily whether must put fate into hand of man who be now touching whether must not have not a yet decided of be very sure that nothing said done by mr marsham must have effect in restraining what must mr marsham do mr palliser be gone rumour of proposed visit to monkshade way in have be prevented have reached ear whisper have come to that fitzgerald still dared to love a married woman whom have loved before be married there be rumour about that still have hope mr marsham have never believed that mr palliser wife must really be false to vow be not in fear of such catastrophe a positive elopement that have taken upon duty of duenna lady glencora must doubt require to be pressed down into decent mould must become wife of mr palliser to assume a form pressing down moulding mr marsham thought that must accomplish have not hitherto occurred to that might be required to guard mr palliser from positive dishonour now now hardly knew what to think about must do to whom must go then saw mr bott looming large before on top of staircase illustration mr bott on watch in meantime lady glencora went off towards dancer leaning on burgo arm who be woman said burgo be first word spoke to though since have last seen have written to that letter even now carried about voice in ear sounded

be induced to guard from danger word husband have spoken to in morning anger against in that have subjected to eye of mr marsham own unsettled mind quite unsettled whether must be best for to go to stay came upon now at first word of tenderness burgo spoke to have often be said of woman that who doubt be lost so often that who say now say simply because others have said before never thinking whether there be truth in proverb who have said so thinking of word a be uttered have known little of woman woman doubt day who solve doubt at last on right side driven to do so by fear more by conscience most of by half prudential half unconscious knowledge of what be fitting useful best under cirumstances rarely desert men woman till have brought to burgo fitzgerald state of recklessness men when have fallen even to will still keep up outward show towards world woman in condition defy world declare to be child of perdition lady glencora be doubting sorely though doubting be not a yet lost doe put in mind of old day said burgo be driven to answer knew that much must be decided by way in might now speak must not talk of said very softly may not now tongue be unloosed so that began to speak quickly may not why not be happy day so happy be not happy when thought ah dear suppose be best not even to think of much best only be impossible wish knew inside of heart cora so must see what be that really wish in old day have always called cora now name came from lip upon ear a thing of custom causing surprise be standing back behind circle almost in corner burgo knew well how to

money soon found talking to mr scruby a though there be doubt a to forthcoming fund for next election mr scruby talked to very plainly a though fund must be forthcoming before long stitch in time save

one on that fellow have have time to make out if will put in fund for what must be out of pocket in june will be so soon a june be talking of june why then will lump two bill together when be over in discussion respecting money mr scruby injudiciously mentioned name of mr tombe precise caution have be given to have become aware that matter be being managed through agency be not recognized by client a agency be simply vehicle of money found way into mr scruby pocket must have held tongue mr tombe name escaped from vavasor immediately questioned scruby who did not often make such blunder readily excused shaking head declaring that name have fallen from lip instead of of man vavasor accepted excuse without further notice nothing more be said about mr tombe while be in mr scruby office have not heard name in vain have unfortunately heard before mr tombe be remarkable man in way wore powder to hair be very polite in bearing be somewhat asthmatic wheezed in talking be moreover most obedient of men though be said of that managed whole income of ely chapter just a pleased being in way man of note john grey have spoken of to alice name have filtered through alice cousin kate to george vavasor george seldom forgot thing name when heard mr tombe name mentioned in connection with own money matter remembered that mr tombe be john grey lawyer a soon a must escape out into street endeavoured to put thing together after while resolved that must go to mr tombe what if there must be understanding between john grey alice mr tombe must be arranging money matter for must not anything be better than even little tragedy down in westmoreland for ingenuity courage must be required must endure to borrow money from alice might even endure still though be very difficult after treatment of must not endure to be recipient of john grey money by heaven a got into cab have driven off to neighbourhood of doctor common gave credit for much fine manly feeling mr tombe chamber be found without difficulty a happened mr tombe be there lawyer rose from chair a vavasor entered bowed powdered head very meekly a asked visitor to sit down mr vavasor oh yes have heard name yes be in habit of acting for very old friend mr john grey have acted for mr john grey for mr john grey father partner believed might say for about century there must not be nicer gentleman than mr john grey pretty child a used to be at new sentence mr tombe caught poor asthmatic breath bowed meek old head rubbed hand together a though hardly dared to keep seat in vavasor presence without support of such motion wheezed apologetically seemed to ask pardon of visitor for not knowing intuitively what be nature of visitor business be sly old fox be mr tombe be considering time how much must be well that must tell mr vavasor how much must be well that must conceal fat have got into fire a told old wife when got home that evening told old wife everything know of client be worse for doing so while be wheezing coughing apologizing made up mind that if george vavasor be to ask certain question must be best that must answer truly if vavasor did ask question must probably do so upon certain knowledge if so why in case lying must be of use lying must not put fat back into frying pan even though such question might be asked without absolute knowledge must at rate show that questioner have mean of ascertaining truth must tell a little a must decided during last wheeze that must not lie in matter with chance of benefiting client prettiest child ever saw mr vavasor said mr tombe then coughed violently people who knew mr tombe declared that nursed cough dare say said george yes indeed ugh ugh ugh can tell mr tombe whether have anything to do with payment of certain sum to credit at messrs hock block messrs hock block banker in lom bard street said mr tombe taking little more time yes bank there said vavasor sharply most respectable house have money be paid there to credit by mr tombe may ask why put question to mr vavasor well think may be to say reason for asking can have nothing to do with yours for replying to if have have hand in such payment there be end of need not take up time by saying anything more on subject be not prepared to go length mr vavasor not altogether to go length ugh ugh ugh then will tell what have done in matter well upon word have taken little by surprise let see pinkle pinkle pinkle be clerk who sat in inner room mr tombe effort to call seemed to be most ineffectual pinkle understood sound came pinkle did pay money into hock block few week since to credit of mr george vavasor did sir said pinkle who probably knew that employer be old fox who perhaps have caught something of fox nature think did just look pinkle pinkle see date let know about be fine bright weather for time of year mr vavasor easterly wind ugh ugh ugh vavasor found sitting for apparently interminable number of minute in mr tombe dingy chamber be coughed at wheezed at till begun to be tired of position moreover when tired showed impatience perhaps will let write line when have looked into matter suggested mr tombe 'd rather know at once said vavasor suppose can take very long to find out whether have paid money to account by order of mr grey at rate must know before go away pinkle pinkle screamed old man through coughing again pinkle came well pinkle be anything of kind done be memory deceiving mr tombe be doubt lying shamefully for of course remembered about indeed george vavasor have learned already quite enough for own purpose be going to look said pinkle pinkle again went away be sorry to give clerk so much trouble said vavasor in angry voice think must be unnecessary surely know whether mr grey have commissioned to pay money for have so many thing to do mr vavasor so many client have indeed see be only one gentleman affair think there be something done do indeed what be mr john grey address asked vavasor very sharply number suffolk street pall mall east said mr tombe herein mr tombe somewhat committed client mr grey be in fact in town vavasor have not known imagined that such be case have mr tombe given usual address of nethercoats nothing further must have be demanded from on subject have foolishly presumed that question have be based on special information a to client visit to london have told plain truth in very simple way number suffolk street said vavasor writing down address perhaps will be better must go to a seem inclined to give information then took up hat hardly bowing to mr tombe left chamber mr tombe a did so rose from chair bent head meekly down upon table pinkle pinkle wheezed mr tombe never mind never mind pinkle did mind may say that have not minded for up to moment have taken no step towards performance of order have be given chapter lii what occurred in suffolk street pall mall mr tombe have gained nothing for cause by crafty silence george vavasor felt perfectly certain a walked out from little street run at back of doctor common that money have be using have come in shape through hand of john grey did not care much to calculate whether payment have be made from personal fund of rival whether rival have be employed to dispense alice fortune under view of case position be sufficiently bitter truth never for moment occurred to never dreamed that there might be conspiracy in matter of alice be a ignorant a have be never reflected that uncle john together with john lover whom so hated might be conspirator to seemed to be certain that alice mr grey be in league if be in league what must think of alice of engagement with there be men who rarely think well of woman who hardly think well of woman put mother sister into background a though belonged to sex race apart then declare to to friend that woman be false that woman can be trusted unless ugliness protect that woman may be attacked a fairly a may game in cover deer on mountain what man doe not know men who have so thought can not say that such have be vavasor creed not entirely such there have be period of life when have believed implicitly in cousin alice then there have be other moment in have ridiculed for quixotism in believing in woman a have grown older moment of quixotism have become more rare there must have be such quixotism left with now have not various circumstance have attempted to describe filled during last twelve month with renewed desire to marry cousin man try to believe in honesty of future wife therefore vavasor have tried have in way believed have flattered too that alice heart have in truth be more prone to than to other suitor grey a thought have be accepted by cold prudence thought also that have found prudence to be too cold have therefore returned where have truly loved vavasor though did not love much be willing enough to be object of love idea of however have be greatly shaken by alice treatment of personally still have not hitherto believed that be false to now what must believe of what be there within compass of one to believe a walked out into st paul churchyard called by name be most offensive to woman ear hated at moment with even more bitter hatred than felt towards john grey must have deceived with unparalleled hypocrisy lied to to sister kate a hardly woman have ever lied before must be that kate also be lying to if so kate also must be included in punishment why must have conspired to feed with money there have be no deceit at rate in reference to pound sterling scruby have already swallowed have be supplied have be motif of supplier have doubt that more must be supplied if must only keep quiet be still walking westward a thought of down ludgate hill on direct line towards suffolk street tried to persuade that must be well that must hide wrath till after provision must have be made for other election be enemy alice mr grey why must keep term with enemy be still trouble to to think that must have be in way beholden to john grey terrible thing have be done evil have occurred what must gain by staying hand now still however walked on quickly along fleet street along strand be already crossing under picture gallery towards pall mall east before have definitely decided what step must take on very day exactly at corner of suffolk street met john grey mr grey said stopping suddenly be moment going to call on at lodging at lodging be will return with if please said vavasor leading way up suffolk street there have be no other greeting than between mr grey though man very courteous in general demeanour must probably have passed vavasor in street with more than barest salutation situated a be towards other there must hardly be show of friendship between when vavasor have spoken to have dressed face in guise of civility men always use who intend to be offensive vavasor dressed a men dress theirs who do mean to be offensive mr grey have thoroughly appreciated dressing if will allow have key said grey then entered house vavasor followed host up stair mr grey a went up felt almost angry with in having admitted enemy into lodging be sure that good must come of remembered when be too late that might easily have saved from giving invitation while be still in street there be however together in sitting room grey have nothing to do to listen will take chair mr vavasor said said vavasor will stand up stood up holding hat behind back with left hand with right leg forward thumb of right hand in waistcoat pocket looked full into grey face grey looked full into a looked great cicatrice seemed to open to become purple with fresh blood stain have come here from mr tombe office in city said vavasor to ask of what nature have be interference have taken in money matter be question mr grey must not answer very quickly in first place be altogether unexpected in next place did not know what mr tombe have told what have not told then before replied must think how much of truth be bound to tell in answer to question so put to do say that have come from mr tombe asked think heard say so have come here direct from mr tombe chamber be lawyer believe be so have come from to ask what interference have lately taken in money matter when have answered that will have other question to ask mr vavasor have occurred to may not be disposed to answer question so asked have not occurred to to think that will prevaricate if there have be such interference will ask pardon go away if there have be such interference on part have right to demand that will explain to nature grey have now made up mind that must be better that must tell whole story better not only for for vavasors including angry man angry man evidently knew something must be better that must know truth there have be such interference mr vavasor if choose to call so money to extent of two thousand pound think have by direction be paid to credit by mr tombe well said vavasor taking right hand away from waistcoat tapping round table with finger impatiently hardly know how to explain circumstance under have be done dare say not nevertheless must explain grey be man tranquil in temperament very little prone to quarrelling with perhaps exaggerated idea of evil result of row man who must take infinite trouble to avoid such scene a now seemed to be imminent be man whose courage be quite a high a of opponent to bully be bullied be alike contrary to nature be clear enough now that vavasor intended to bully made up mind at once that if quarrel be forced upon must find ready to take own part difficulty in explaining come from consideration for said then beg that difficulty will cease that will have consideration for be so circumstanced towards other that consideration must be humbug nonsense at rate intend to have none for now let know why have meddled with matter think might perhaps better refer to uncle sir mr tombe be not uncle lawyer uncle never heard name unless heard of from be by agreement with uncle that commissioned mr tombe to raise for money be desirous of borrowing from cousin thought better that fortune must not be for moment disturbed what have to do with why must have done in first place believe story be altogether improbable why must come to of men to raise money on daughter behalf unless can behave with more discretion mr vavasor must leave room said mr grey then a vavasor simply sneered at spoke nothing went on be who suggested to uncle that arrangement must be made did not wish to see miss vavasor fortune squandered what be fortune to sir be aware that be engaged to a wife ask sir whether be aware that miss vavasor be to be wife must altogether decline to discus with miss vavasor present future position by heaven then will hear discus be engaged to have given dismissal if have understood anything of conduct be usual among gentleman if have have particle of pride in sir must have left never mentioned name again now find meddling with money matter so a to get hold upon fortune have hold upon fortune yes sir have advance two thousand pound without knowing that have security have rejected in order that may be revenged that may have further hold upon that may be in sort within power have contrived rascally pettifogging way of obtaining power over income money will be repaid at once with interest can be due if find interfering again will expose mr vavasor said grey very slowly in low tone of voice with something in eye must have told bystander that be much in earnest have used word in anger can not allow to pas must recall be word said that be pettifogging rascal now repeat a spoke put on hat so a to leave hand ready for action if action must be required grey be much larger man much stronger may be doubted whether knew extent of own strength such a be resolved that must now use there be help for said a also prepared for action first thing did be to open door a did so became conscious that mouth be full of blood from sharp blow upon face vavasor have struck with fist have cut lip against teeth then there came scramble grey be soon aware that have opponent in hand doubt whether have attempted to strike blow whether have so much a clenched fist vavasor have struck repeatedly blow have fallen on body head be unconscious of have one object now in mind that object be kicking assailant down stair then came scramble a have said grey have hold of smaller man by nape of neck so holding forced back through door on to landing there succeeded in pushing down first flight of step grey kicked at a went kick be impotent have however be so far successful that have thrust enemy out of room have satisfaction of seeing sprawling on landing place vavasor when raised prepared to make rush at room before must do so man from below hearing noise have come upon interrupted mr jones said grey speaking from above if gentleman doe not leave house must get to search for policeman vavasor though lodging house man have hold of collar of coat made attempt to turn upon new enemy when two dog be fighting bystander may attempt to separate with impunity brute be so anxious to tear other that have energy left for other purpose never occurs to to turn teeth upon newcomer in quarrel so be with george vavasor jones be sufficient to prevent further attack upon foe up stair therefore have alternative to relinquish fight what be about sir said jones who kept tailor establishment a tailor be something of fighting man of tradesman in london tailor be doubt most combative a might be expected from necessity lie upon of living down general bad character in respect world have wrongly given what be about sir said jones still holding vavasor by coat man have ill used have punished be know much about punishing said tailor seems to pitched down pretty clean out of room above think best thing can do now be to walk off be only thing that vavasor must do did walk off walked off went home to own lodging in cecil street that might smooth feather after late encounter before went down to westminster to take seat in house of common think that be comfortable when got there that felt very well able to fight battle night on behalf of river bank have not be hurt have be worsted grey have probably received more personal damage than have fallen to share grey have succeeded in expelling from room knew that have be found prostrate on landing place when tailor first saw might probably have got over annoyance of feeling have not be overwhelmed by consciousness that everything be going badly with be already beginning to hate seat in parliament what good have done for be likely to do for found to be associated there with mr bott few others of same class men whom despised even did not admit among without certain show of superiority on part who have not ascertained by own experience different light through same event may be seen according to success want of success pervades atmosphere at moment at present time everything be unsuccessful with george vavasor though told almost from hour to hour that must go on with thing have begun that must persevere in parliament till have obtained hearing there created for success must not believe in promise have made to have looked forward to entrance into chamber a hour of triumph have entered with mr bott there have be no triumph to in doing so have sworn to that when there must find men to hear hitherto indeed must not accuse of having missed opportunity election have be so recent that must hardly yet have made attempt have be there long enough to learn to fancy that there be glory in attempting art of speaking in parliament have appeared to to be so grand seemed already to be humdrum homely dull affair one seemed to listen much to what be said to such a member without acquired name men did not seem to listen at mr palliser have once in hearing spoken for two hour together house have treated speech with respect have declared that be useful solid conscientious what not more than house have be asleep more than time that be on leg vavasor have not a yet commenced career a orator night after night a sat there chance of commencing with brilliance seemed to be further from still further two thousand pound of own money two thousand more of alice money of mr grey have already spent to make way into assembly must spend at rate two thousand more if intended that career must be prolonged beyond three month sitting how be to get further sum after what have taken place to day must get be resolve a walked in by apple woman stall under shadow of great policeman between two august lamp must get a long a alice have pound over must obtain mastery by act violence within compass must get even though must come through hand of john grey mr tombe must get though in doing so might destroy cousin alice ruin sister kate have gone too far to stick at scruple have not often declared how great have be that murderer who have be able to divest of such scruple who have scoured bosom free from fear of hereafter a regarded present have dared to trust for everything to success must go to alice demand money from with threat with violence in eye knew so well how to assume believed that when so demanded money must be forthcoming so a to satisfy at rate present emergency wretched old man in westmoreland if must die there might yet be hope remaining of permanent success even though estate might be entailed so a to give more than life interest still money might be raised on life interest in must be worth ten twelve year purchase have idea that grandfather have not a yet made such will when left place in westmoreland what boon must be if death must be made to overtake old man before did so on very night walked about lobby of house thinking of went by from room to room roaming along passage sitting now for ten minute in gallery then again for short space in body of house till must get up wander again out into lobby impatient of neighbourhood of mr bott certainly just at time felt desire to bring before house subject of river embankment be mr grey much happier when be left alone than be assailant to give vavasor due memory of affray did not long trouble much success between combatant have be nearly equal have at rate spoken mind freely misery have come from other source reflection that have be concerned in row be in enough to make john grey wretched for time such misfortune have never hitherto befallen in dealing with men word have be sufficient generally word of courtesy have sufficed to have be personally engaged in fighting scramble with man a george vavasor be to terrible when ordering that money might be expended with possible object of saving alice from cousin have never felt moment regret have never thought that be doing more than circumstance fairly demanded of now be almost driven to utter reproach oh alice that thing must have come upon through thy fault when vavasor be led away down stair by tailor grey found that more actual fighting must be required of retired into bedroom that might wash mouth free from stain of combat have heard front door closed knew that miscreant be gone miscreant who have disturbed quiet then began to think what be accusation with vavasor have charged have be told that have advanced money on behalf of alice in order that might obtain power over alice fortune thus revenge upon alice for treatment of nothing must be more damnably false than accusation of that be well aware be not circumstance of nature to make appear that accusation be true security for money advanced by of course have none of course have desired none of course money have be given out of own pocket with sole object of saving alice if might be possible of who might hear of affair how many must know even guess truth while be in wretched state of mind washing mouth disturbing spirit mr jones landlord came up to mr jones have known for year entertained most profound respect for character rather sporting man than otherwise be mr jones father have be tradesman at cambridge in way jones have become known to mr grey though given to sport by meant modern prize fighting epsom course on derby day mr jones be man who dearly loved respectable customer respectable lodger mr grey with property at nethercoats august manner reputation at cambridge be most respectable lodger mr jones must hardly understand how one must presume to raise hand against man dear dear sir be terrible affair said a made way into room be very disagreeable certainly said grey be gentleman known to asked tailor yes know who be quarrel sir well yes must not have pushed down stair have not quarrelled with can have police after if wish sir wish at might manage to polish off in other way know be time before mr grey must get rid of tailor did so at last without having told part of story to warlike worthy very anxious individual chapter liii last will of old squire in meantime kate vavasor be living down in westmoreland with other society than of grandfather did not altogether have very pleasant life of george have be apt to represent old man to a being a strong a old tower though be ruin show sign of falling to eye squire have always seemed to be full of life power must be violent on occasion be hardly ever without violence in eye voice george opinion be formed by wish rather by revers of wish for year have be longing that grandfather must die have be accusing fate of gross injustice in did not snap thread with such thought in mind have grudged ounce squire vigour have be able to sustain have almost taught to believe that must be good deed to squeeze what remained of life out of violent old throat indeed ember of life be burning low have george known truth must hardly have inclined mind to thought of murder be indeed very weak with age tottering with unsteady step on brink of grave though must still come down early from room must if possible creep out about garden into farmyard must still sit down to dinner must drink allotted portion of port wine in doctor teeth doctor by mean desired to rob of last luxury even to stint quantity recommended certain change in mode time of taking against however old squire indignantly rebelled scolded kate almost off leg when attempted to enforce doctor order what mischief doe signify old man said to one evening what difference will make whether be dead alive unless be that george must turn out of house directly get be not thinking of one sir said kate with tear in eye wo be troubled to think of much longer said squire then gulped down remaining half of glass of wine kate be in truth very good to woman always be good under such circumstance kate vavasor be one who must certainly stick to such duty a now fell to lot be eminently true loyal to friend though must be a false on behalf a most false people can be on own be very good to old man tending want taking violence with good humour rather than with submission not opposing with direct contradiction when abused grandson saying little word to mitigate wrath if be possible at such time squire must tell that also must learn to know brother character day will live to be robbed by turned out a naked a be born said to one day then kate fired up declared that fully trusted brother love fault might have have be staunch to so said old man sneered at for saying so one morning soon after when brought up to bedroom mixture of thin porridge still endeavoured to swallow for breakfast bade sit down began to talk to about property know be fool said about matter of business more of fool than even woman generally be to kate acceded with little smile acknowledging that understanding be limited want to see gogram said do write to line telling to come here to day one of men send at once by peter gogram be attorney who lived at penrith who be never summoned to vavasor hall unless squire have something to say about will think 'd better put off till be little stronger said kate whereupon squire fired at such volley of oath that sprang off chair on be sitting darted across to little table at there be pen ink wrote note to mr gogram before have recovered from shaking battery have given wrote note ran away with to peter saw peter on pony on way to penrith before dared to return to grandfather bedside what must do with estate if left squire said to first moment be again back with be question must not answer instantly stood by bedside for while thinking holding grandfather hand looking down upon bed with rough watery old eye be gazing up into face a though be trying to read thought think must give to brother said then be d if will leave to said did not jump now though have sworn at still stood holding hand softly looking down upon bed if be grandfather said almost in whisper must not trust to alter family arrangement be ill be sure must advise one else against doing so if be to leave to alice 'd give to too said speaking thought out loud what be see in never must even guess be a ugly a baboon with scarred face have never done anything to show clever fellow kate give of bottle man sent kate handed medicine then stood again by bedside where did get money to pay for election squire asked a soon a have swallowed draught must give such one a credit yard further than must see know where got said kate lying have not have yours have must not take sir offered to yes sir have not have not penny of sir what made offer to after what said to because be own said kate stoutly be biggest idiot that ever heard of will know day go away now let know when gogram come went away for time employed about ordinary household work then sat down alone in dingy old dining room to think what have better be done in present circumstance carpet of room be worn out a be also cover of old chair horsehair sofa be never moved from accustomed place along wall be not comfortable squire residence old house at vavasor in last twenty year money have be spent on furniture embellishment for last ten year there have be no painting inside out twenty year ago squire have be embarrassed man have taken turn in life have lived sparingly must not be said that have become miser table be kept plentifully there have never be want in house in respect too have behaved liberally to kate to others have kept up timber fence on property house have become wretched in dull sombre dirty darkness garden round be a bad what ought now to do believed that grandfather last day be coming knew that others of family must be with besides for sake for for own must be proper that must not be alone there when died for whom must send brother be natural heir must be head of family duty to be clear more so a grandfather be at moment speaking of change in will be question to whether george presence at vavasor even if must come must not at moment do more harm than good to own interest must make prejudicial change in old man will more probable instead of le so george must not become soft mild spoken even by death bed side must be likely enough that squire must curse heir with dying breath might send for uncle john if did so without telling george must be treating george unfairly knew that be improbable that uncle brother must act together in anything aunt greenow thought must come to presence must not influence squire in way with reference to property so made up mind at last that must ask aunt to come to vavasor that must tell brother accurately that must tell leaving to come stay a might think alice must doubt learn fact from uncle john must hear from alice then must do a pleased a soon a mr gogram have be there must write letter must be sent over to shap early on following morning mr gogram came be closeted with squire doctor also came doctor saw

presume that think bound to support side to believe to have be wrong will make very unhappy will remember that be sister will not be angry with yours always affectionately alice vavasor kate a read letter through at first quickly then very slowly came by degree almost to forget death be in house mind heart brain be filled with thought feeling have exclusive reference to alice brother at last found walking room with quick impetuous step while blood be hot with indignation sympathy in matter be with alice never occurred to to disbelieve word of statement made to to suggest to herself that have be coloured by fear exaggeration on part of correspondent knew that alice be true moreover much a loved brother willing a have be must still be to risk that possessed also on behalf knew that must be risking not trusting loved brother such love having come to by nature having remained with from of old in intellect still believed have ceased to have belief in conduct feared everything that might do lived with consciousness that though be willing to connect own fortune with have much reason to expect that might encounter ruin in doing so sin have be in that have be anxious to subject alice to same danger that have intrigued sometimes very meanly to bring about object have at heart that have used craft to separate alice from mr grey perhaps may be alleged in excuse that have thought have hoped rather than thought that marriage contemplated must change much in brother be wrong bring into mode of life must not be dangerous might not alice together so work upon that must cease to stand ever on brink of half seen precipice to risk for brother be noble when used cunning in inducing cousin to share that risk be ignoble of have consciousness a walked up down old dining room at midnight holding cousin letter in hand cheek became tinged with shame a thought of scene alice have described toy thrown beneath grate loud curse whispered threat have be more terrible than curse demand for money made with something worse than cut throat violence strong man hand placed upon woman arm in anger in rage eye glaring gaping horror of still raw cicatrice a pressed face close to of victim not for moment did think of defending accused to herself vehemently of sin over above sin have filled alice with dismay have demanded money from girl whom intended to marry according to kate idea nothing must excuse palliate sin alice have accounted a nothing have expressed opinion that demand be reasonable even now after ill usage to have be subjected have declared that money must be forthcoming given to man who have treated so shamefully might be well that alice must so feel so act behoved kate to feel act very differently must tell brother even in house of death must come there that conduct be mean unmanly kate be coward declared to herself that must do even though must threaten with fury though must glare upon with horror of countenance one o'clock two o'clock still found in dark sombre parlour now then pacing floor of room fire have gone out though be now middle of april began to feel cold must not go to bed before have written line to alice to brother message by telegraph must of course be sent next morning a also must send message to aunt to alice must write though might be line cold a be found pen paper wrote letter night be very short dear alice to day

quarrel between there will be none at least on side can not say more till few day will have passed by be lying up stair corpse have telegraphed to george suppose will come down think aunt greenow will come also a have written to before seeing wanted comfort of having here uncle john will of course come not a think fitting know whether be in position to say that will be glad to see must be very glad will know can a yet tell nothing further lawyer be to see men about funeral nothing suppose will be done till george come own cousin friend kate vavasor then added line below own alice if will let will be sister be nearest to dearest alice when received be at first moment so much struck indeed surprised by tidings of grandfather death that be forced in spite of still existing violence of own feeling to think act chiefly with reference to event father have not then left room therefore went to handed kate letter papa said there be news from westmoreland bad news hardly expected yet father be dead said john vavasor whereupon alice gave kate letter that might read of course will go down said a came to part in kate have spoken of doe think will not follow father to grave because dislike brother what doe mean by saying that there will be quarrel between will explain at time said alice john vavasor asked further question then declared at first that must go to westmoreland on following day then altered purpose will go by mail train to night said will be very disagreeable ought to be there when will be opened there be very little more said in queen anne street on subject till evening till few moment before mr vavasor left house indeed have thought nothing more about quarrelling rather that promise that there must be quarrelling between girl still regarded nephew george a man who unfortunately be to be son in law now during tedious sad day in felt compelled to remain at home busied mind in thinking of george alice a living together at old hall at six father daughter dined soon after dinner mr vavasor went up to own room to prepare for journey after while alice followed did not do so till knew that if anything be to be told before journey further time must be lost papa said a soon a have shut door behind think ought to tell before go that everything be over between george have quarrelled with too said father with uncontrolled surprise must perhaps say that have quarrelled with dear papa pray question at present will tell when come back thought right that must know before went have be doing then can not explain to in hurry like papa may understand something of shame feel must not question now john grey there be nothing different in regard to will be shot if can understand george know have have two thousand pound of money of yours somebody else well ca talk about now a must be off thinking a do of george be glad of be then went alice be left alone to comfort a best might by own reflection george vavasor have received message on day previous to on alice letter have reached have not come to till late in day might have gone down by mail train of night there be one two person own attorney especially whom wished to see before reading of grandfather will remained in town therefore on following day went down by same train a took uncle walking along platform looking for seat peered into carriage met uncle eye two saw other did not speak george passed on to carriage on following morning before break of day met again in refreshment room at station at lancaster so father have gone george said uncle speaking to nephew must go to same house mr vavasor felt that must be better that must be on speaking term when reached yes said george have gone at last wonder what will find to have be latest act of injustice reader will remember that have received kate first letter in have told of squire altered will john vavasor turned away disgusted finer feeling be perhaps not very strong have thought hope in reference to matter be mean expected nothing did not begrudge nephew inheritance at moment be thinking of old squire a father who have ever be kind to might be natural that george must have such old affection at heart be unnatural that must express a have done at moment uncle turned away said nothing george followed with little proposition of own sha get conveyance at shap said have better go over in chaise from kendal to uncle assented so finished journey together george smoked time that be in carriage very few word be spoken a drove up to old house found that arrival have taken place before mr greenow having reached house in vehicle from shap station have come across from norwich to manchester where have joined train have brought uncle nephew from london chapter lv will coming of mr greenow at very moment be great comfort to kate without must hardly have known how to bear with uncle brother a be be restrained by something of courtesy stranger be bound to show to other george have never seen aunt since be child sort of introduction be necessary between so be george said mr greenow putting out hand smiling yes be george said member of parliament said mr greenow be quite honour to family felt so proud when heard said pleasantly meaning to be taken for truth then turned away to brother papa time be fully come said though to tell truth have idea that be so weak a kate describes to have be said john vavasor went to church with here on christmas day did indeed dear dear seems at last to have gone off just like poor greenow here put handkerchief up to face think did know greenow john met once said brother ah be to be known understood in way be aware there be little prejudice because of being in trade wo talk of now where must have be without tradesman tradesman have doubt be excellent man may say that john ah well ca keep everything in life for ever may perhaps be a well to explain now that mr greenow have told captain bellfield at last meeting before left norwich that under certain circumstance if behaved well there might possibly be ground of hope whereupon captain bellfield have immediately gone to best tailor in city have told man of coming marriage have given extensive order tailor have not a yet supplied good waiting for more credible evidence of captain good fortune be grass of field said mr greenow lightly brushing tear from eye must be cut down put into oven in turn brother uttered slight sympathetic groan shaking head in testimony of uncertainty of human affair then said that must go out look about place george in meantime have asked sister to show room two be already together up stair kate have made up mind that must say nothing about alice at present moment nothing if must be avoided till after funeral led way up stair almost trembling with fear for knew that other subject of will must also give rise to trouble sorrow perhaps also to determined quarrelling have brought that woman here be first question that george asked asked to come said kate why did ask to come here said george angrily kate immediately felt that be speaking a though be master of house also a though intended to be master of a regarded former idea have objection to thoroughly honestly wished that might be master though feared that might find mistaken in assumption be not disposed to deny appearance of right that might take upon in respect have already begun to tell that must not submit to masterdom have gradually so taught herself since have compelled to write first letter in alice have be asked to give money asked george before poor grandfather death when thought that must linger perhaps for week life here alone with without other woman in house beside servant be very melancholy why did not ask alice to come to alice must not have come said kate after short pause know why must have come wo have woman about place disgraced by marrying blacksmith why george be who advised to go stay with be very different thing now that be dead be got money be very well that must go to occasionally wo have here be natural that must come to father house at father death bed hate to be told that thing be natural always mean humbug suppose cared for old man more than did than cared for other old man who married people be such intense hypocrite there uncle john pulling long face because have come into house will pull a long a body lie up there yet for last twenty year there be nothing on earth have so much hated a going to see father when be going to bury on saturday day after to morrow why must do to morrow so that must get away before sunday only died on monday george said kate solemnly psha who have got will mr gogram be here yesterday told to tell uncle john that must have with when came back from funeral have uncle john to do with said george sharply will go over to penrith afternoon make gogram give up to think will do george what right have to keep what right have to at how do know that have really got old man last will where did grandfather keep paper in old secretary a used to call one stand in dining room be sealed up who sealed mr gogram did mr gogram together what deuce made meddle with merely assisted believe be quite right think be usual in such case balderdash be thinking of old trumpery of former day till know to contrary everything here belongs to a heir at law mean to allow of interference till know for certain that right have be taken from wo accept death bed will what man chooses to write when finger will hardly hold pen go for nothing ca suppose wish to interfere with right hope not oh george well say hope not know there be who must do think uncle john must not interfere with if must by if doe will find that doe to cost will lead life through court for next two three year that will wish that have remained in chancery lane have never left message be now brought up by nurse saying that mr greenow mr vavasor be going into room where old squire be lying must miss kate mr george go with mr vavasor shouted out george making old woman jump did not understand meaning in least yes sir old squire said will come george kate asked what must go there for why must pretend interest in dead body of man whom hated who hated whose very last act a far a know a yet be attempt to rob wo go see kate went be glad of opportunity of getting away from brother hour idea be becoming stronger in mind that must in way separate from there have come upon of late hard ferocity made unendurable then carried to such pitch hatred a called of conventional rule that allowed to be controlled by none of ordinary bond of society have felt heretofore with nervous consciousness that be doing wrong in endeavouring to bring about marriage between alice demeanour mode of talking have now so grown upon kate began to feel thankful that alice have be saved kate went up with uncle aunt saw face of grandfather for last time poor dear old man said mr greenow a easy tear ran down face do remember john how used to scold say must never come to good have said same thing to kate dare say have be very kind to said kate standing at foot of bed be not one of whose tear stand near eye be fine old gentleman said john vavasor belonging to day be now gone by by mean le of gentleman on account know that ever did unjust ungenerous act to one come kate may a well go down mr greenow lingered to say word two to nurse of manner in greenow body be treated when greenow be lying dead then followed brother niece george did not go into penrith did see mr gogram till worthy attorney came out to vavasor hall on morning of funeral said nothing more on subject did break seal on old upright desk stood in parlour two day before funeral be very wretched for party except perhaps for mr greenow who affected not to understand that nephew be in bad humour called poor george treated incivility to herself a though be effect of grief asked question about parliament of course did answer told little story about poor dear greenow not heeding expression of unmistakable disgust two day at last went by hour of funeral came there be doctor gogram uncle nephew to follow corpse nephew taking upon ostentatiously foremost place a though must thereby help to maintain pretension a heir clergyman met at little wicket gate of churchyard having by reasoning hope be satisfactory to overcome resolution at first formed that must not read burial service over unrepentant sinner did read having mentioned scruple to none one confidential clerical friend in same diocese be told that have got grandfather will george said to attorney a soon a saw have in pocket said mr gogram purpose to read a soon a return from church be usual to take will away from man house in way george asked quite usual said attorney in case be done at express desire of testator think be common practice said john vavasor george upon turned round at uncle a though about to attack restrained said nothing though showed teeth funeral be very plain not word be spoken by george vavasor during journey there back john vavasor asked few question of doctor a to last week of father life be incidentally mentioned by doctor by attorney that old squire intellect have remained unimpaired up to last moment that have be seen by of when returned to hall mr greenow met with invitation to lunch went to dining room drank glass of sherry george took two three glass doctor then withdrew drove back to penrith where lived will go into other room now said attorney three gentleman then rose up went across to drawing room george leading way attorney followed john vavasor closed door behind have observer be there to watch might have seen by face of two latter that expected unpleasant meeting mr gogram a have walked across hall have pulled document out of pocket held in hand a took chair john vavasor stood behind one of chair have be placed at table leaned upon looking across room up at ceiling george stood on rug before fire with hand in pocket of trouser coat tail over arm gentleman will sit down said mr gogram john vavasor immediately sat down prefer to stand here said george mr gogram then opened document before before paper be read said george think right to say few word know what contains believe to have be executed by grandfather only hour two before death on day before died early in day said attorney well day before died be same thing while be dying in fact never got out of bed afterwards be not in bed at time mr vavasor not that must have mattered if have be came down to dinner on day understand however why make observation if will listen to will understand make because deny grandfather fitness to make will in last moment of existence at such age saw few week ago be not fit to be trusted with management of property then think be time george to put forward such objection said uncle think be said george believe that paper purport to be instrument by must be villanously defrauded if be allowed to be held a good therefore protest against now will question at law if action be taken on can read now if please oh yes will read said mr gogram say that be a valid will a ever man signed say be not be difference between will be read amidst sundry interjection expression of anger from george be not necessary to repeat need trouble reader with will at length began by expressing testator great desire that property might descend in own family that house might be held inhabited by one bearing name of vavasor then declared that felt obliged to pas over natural heir believing that property must not be safe in hand therefore left in trust to son john vavasor whom appointed to be sole executor of will devised to george eldest son must george ever marry have son a soon a might reach age of twenty five in meantime property must remain in hand of john vavasor for use benefit with lien on of five hundred year to be paid annually to granddaughter kate in event of george having son property be to go to eldest son of kate failing that to eldest son of other granddaughter who might take name of vavasor personal property left to son john vavasor mr vavasor said attorney a finished reading will fear get very little by latter clause estate now owes nothing doubt whether squire have fifty pound in banker hand when died value of property about place be very small have be unwilling to spend anything during last ten year have paid off shilling that property owed be a supposed said george voice be very unpleasant so be fire of eye ghastly rage of scarred face old man have endeavoured in anger to rob of everything because must not obey in wickedness when be here with short while before died such will a can stand nowhere a to have nothing to say at present said attorney where be other will one made before if remember rightly executed two before where be be not business to know mr vavasor believe that saw destroy one have absolute knowledge a to other can say nothing what do mean to do said george turning to uncle do will carry out will have alternative sister be person chiefly interested under get five hundred year for life if marries if have son son will have whole property george stood for few moment thinking might not be possible that by mean of alice kate together by marrying former perhaps might still obtain possession of property wanted be command of property at once power of raising money upon instantly will have be so framed a to make impossible in way kate share in have not be left to unconditionally be to be received even by through hand of uncle john will shut out from hope be piece of d roguery said what

be written be here with grandfather one else one else presence of one else at time must be very unusual then regard document simply a waste paper after saying george vavasor left room slammed door after never be insulted in such way before said attorney almost with tear in eye be disappointed fear ruined man said john vavasor think need regard what say must not on account insult have only done duty did not even advise grandfather be mean on part unmanly if come in way again will tell so probably will not put in way again mr gogram then attorney went having suggested to mr vavasor that must instruct attorney in london to take step in reference to proving of will be a good will a ever be made said mr gogram if can set aside will give up making will altogether who be to tell kate be john vavasor first thought when be left alone at hall door after seeing lawyer start away how be to get back to london without further quarrelling with nephew what be to do at once with reference to immediate duty of proprietorship be entailed upon a executor be by mean improbable a thought that george might assume to position of master of house that might demand key for instance doubt be in kate hand at present that must take possession with violence what must do under such circumstance be clear that must not run away get back to club by night mail train have duty there at hall duty be of nature to make almost regret position in father will have placed eventually must gain considerable increase to mean immediate effect must be terribly troublesome a looked up at melancholy pine be slowly waving head in wind before door declared to that must sell inheritance executorship very cheaply if sale be possible in dining room found sister alone well john said well how be left where be kate asked have gone out with brother did take hat oh yes asked to walk went with at once then suppose will tell said john vavasor after that explained circumstance of will to mr greenow bravo

said murder yes why not treated a have be among do suppose that will stick at anything why must not murder alice too seeing how have betrayed poor alice a spoke word looked straight into eye a though defying a far a be concerned poor alice indeed d hypocrite there be pair of cursed whining false intriguing hypocrite there go down tell uncle that old woman there threatened to murder tell judge so when be brought into court to swear out of property false liar then pushed from with great violence so that fell heavily upon stony ground did not stop to help up even to look at a lay walked away across heath taking track on towards haweswater returning by path have brought thither went away northward across wild fell kate having risen up seated on small cairn of stone stood there watched a descended slope of hill till be out of sight did not run seemed to move rapidly never once turned round to look at went away down hill northward presently curving of ground hid from view when first seated thought have be altogether of have feared personal injury even when have asked whether must murder blood have be hot within vein heart have be full of defiance even yet feared nothing continued to think of misery disgrace that be gone for ever utterly irretrievably ruined thrown out a be beyond pale of men be now certain to be brother in whom have believed for whom have not only be willing to sacrifice for whose purpose have striven to sacrifice cousin what must do now a passed from out of sight down hill seemed to a though be rushing straight into hell from there must be escape illustration kate knew that arm have be hurt in fall for while must not move feel being resolved to take account of what might have happened to herself when have be gone ten minute rose to foot finding that movement pained greatly that right arm be powerless put up left hand became aware that bone of arm be broken below elbow first thought be given to telling of not telling when must meet below at house how must mention accident to must lie say that have fallen a came down hill alone of course must not believe still such excuse a might make matter easier for did not occur to that might not see again at day that a far a be concerned there might be need for lie started off to walk down home holding right arm steadily against body with left hand of course must give account of herself when got to house be of account to be given to that thought a to others cared little for here be arm be broken have better send for doctor must be sufficient for when got into wood path be very dark heaven be overcast with cloud few drop began to fall then rain fell faster faster before have gone quarter of mile down beacon hill cloud have opened shower have become storm of water suffering a be stood up for few moment under large tree taking excuse of rain for minute of delay that might make up mind a to what must say then occurred to that might possibly meet again before reached house a thought of began for first time to fear must come out upon from tree really kill have made way round when got out of sight that might fall upon suddenly do a have threatened a idea came upon made little attempt to run found that running be impracticable from pain movement caused then walked on through hard rain steadily holding arm against side still looking moment through tree on side from george might be expected to reach one came near on way homewards have be calm enough to think of nature of ground might have known that must not have returned upon so quickly must have come back up steep hill side have seen descend have gone away altogether across fell towards bampton be at moment vainly buttoning coat across breast in unconscious attempt to keep out wet fury be driving on be not aware whither be driven dinner at hall have be ordered at five old hour rather have be assumed to be hour for dinner without ordering be just five when kate reached front door opened with left hand turning at once into dining room found uncle aunt standing before fire dinner be ready said john vavasor where be george be wet kate said aunt greenow yes be very wet said kate must go up stair perhaps will come with aunt come with of course will aunt greenow have seen at once that something be amiss where george said john vavasor have come back with be to wait for kate seated in chair quite know where be said in meantime aunt have hastened up to side just in time to catch a be falling from chair arm said kate very gently arm then slipped down against aunt have fainted have done mischief said mr greenow looking up at brother be doing john vavasor stood confounded wishing back in queen anne street chapter lvii showing how wild beast got back from mountain about eleven o'clock on night night of day on kate vavasor arm have be broken there came gentle knock at kate bedroom door there be nothing surprising in a of household kate only be in bed aunt be sitting at time by bedside doctor who have be summoned from penrith who have set broken arm be still in house talking over accident with john vavasor in dining room before proceeded back on journey home will do very well said doctor be only simple fracture will see day after to morrow be not odd that accident must come from fall whilst walking asked mr vavasor doctor shrugged shoulder one never can say how anything may occur said know young woman who broke o femoris by just kicking cat at least said did indeed suppose did take trouble to inquire not much business be with injury not with way got somebody did make inquiry stuck to story nothing came of good night mr vavasor trouble with question till have have hour sleep at rate then doctor went john vavasor be left alone standing with back to dining room fire there have be so much trouble confusion in house since kate have fainted almost immediately upon reaching home mr vavasor have not yet have time to make up mind a to nature of accident have occurred mr greenow have at once ascertained that bone be broken doctor have be sent for luckily have be found at home have reached hall little before ten o'clock in meantime a soon a kate recovered sens volunteered account of what have occurred brother have quarrelled with about will said have left abruptly on mountain have fallen went on to say a turned from have at once found that have hurt have be too angry with to let know indeed have not known extent herself till have passed out of sight be story there be nothing in be false by letter though there be much that be false in spirit be certainly true that george have not known that be injured be true that have asked for help be true in one sense that have fallen be true that have not herself known how severe have be injury done to till have gone beyond reach of voice repressed mention of violence when be pressed a to nature of quarrel declined to speak further on matter uncle aunt believed be matter of course knew that did not believe george absence recent experience of mood violence by arm must have be broken made certain that kate have more to tell if chose to tell in present condition must not question mr greenow did ask a to probability of nephew return can only tell said kate that went away across fell in direction of bampton perhaps have gone on to penrith be very angry with a house be not own have probably resolved that will not stay night under roof who can say be not in sens when be angered john vavasor a stood alone after doctor departure endeavoured to ascertain truth by thinking of be sure said to that doctor suspect that there have be violence know from tone can see in eye how to prove must there be good in proving poor girl will not be better for to let pas a though believed story made up mind that must be better why must take upon terrible task of calling insane relation to account for act must not prove will without trouble must give trouble enough then began to long that be back at club to think that signing room in chancery lane be not so bad so went up to bed calling at kate door to ask after patient in meantime there have come messenger to mr greenow who have stationed with niece one of girl of house brought up scrap of paper to door saying that boy have brought over with cart from shap that be intended for miss vavasor be who knocked at sickroom door note be open be not addressed indeed word be written on scrap of paper be crumpled up rather than folded be a follows send clothes by bearer will not return to house mr greenow took in to kate then went away to see nephew thing duly put into portmanteau be sent away in cart mr vavasor a went up stair be told what have be done on night on following day did mr greenow ask further question on morning after when doctor have left with good account of broken limb curiosity must brook further delay indeed indignation a well a curiosity urged on in disposition be le easy perhaps le selfish than brother if be case that man have ill treated sister must have sacrificed much to bring to punishment kate said when doctor be gone expect that will tell whole truth a to what occurred between brother when have accident have told truth not whole truth truth mean to tell aunt have quarrelled with a think most unnecessarily suppose that be going to give exact account of quarrel be wrong probably so let there be end of be violent to when quarrelled with when be angry be always violent in language did strike dear aunt be angry with if say wo be cross examined must rather answer more question about know that questioning can do good mr greenow knew niece well enough to be aware that nothing more must be told be quite sure now that kate have not broken arm by simple fall be certain that injury have come from positive violence have not be so kate must not have contented with refusing to answer last question have be asked must also have repelled charge made against brother with indignation must have own way said mr greenow let just tell that brother george have better keep out of way be probable that will said kate especially if remain here to nurse kate conduct in answering question made to be not difficult found that there be much difficulty in planning own future behaviour towards own brother must abandon altogether from henceforth divide from a be have perfectly separate interest interest be indeed hostile must see ruined overwhelmed by want of money while have be made rich woman by grandfather will will be remembered that life have hitherto be devoted to that scheme plan have have success a object that have taught to consider to be duty to sacrifice everything to welfare be very sad to abandon only object of life be very hard to tear out from one heart fling away from only love one have cherished what be to say to alice about to alice whom have cheated of husband worthy of that might allure into arm of one so utterly unworthy luckily for kate accident be of such nature that writing to alice be now out of question blow what woman can bear blow from man afterwards return to with love wife may have to bear to return may return with sort of love be thing of custom man be father of child earns bread eat eats habit way of world require that must be careful in interest that must live with in what amity be possible to a for love that mean by love when speak of write of blow given by defender to defenceless crush woman may forgive deceit treachery desertion even preference given to rival may forgive forget think that woman can forget blow a for forgiveness be not blow that can not forgive meanness of spirit that made possible kate a thought of told that everything in life be over for have long feared brother nature have feared that be hard heartless still there have be hope with fear success if must be made to achieve must soften then might be right now be wrong knew that be so when have compelled to write to alice for money faith in have almost succumbed that have be very mean meanness have shocked now have asked to perjure that might have own way have threatened to murder have raised hand against because have refused to obey have accused of treachery to have accused of premeditated deceit in obtaining property for herself doe not believe said kate to herself said that because thought must vex know doe not think kate have watched brother longing for money life have thoroughly understood intensity of wish for agony of desire so far removed be from such longing on own account that must not believe that brother must in heart accuse of how often have offered to give on instant shilling that have in world at moment resolved in mind that never wished to see more even now have be practicable must have made over to without drawback interest in vavasor estate such making over be impossible john vavasor remained in westmoreland for week during time many discussion be of course held about property mr round came down from london met mr gogram at penrith a to validity of will mr round said that there be shadow of doubt so agent be appointed for receiving rent be agreed that old hall must be let in six month from date in meantime kate be to remain there till arm must become strong must make plan for future aunt greenow promised to remain at hall for present offered indeed indefinite service for future a though be quite forgetful of captain bellfield of mr cheesacre be not forgetful for still continued to speak of gentleman to kate a though be kate suitor did not now press upon niece acceptance of mr cheesacre hand a absolute duty kate be mistress of considerable fortune though such marriage might be comfortable be no longer necessary mr greenow called poor cheesacre pointing out how easily might be managed how indubitable be possession no longer spoke of kate chance in marriage market a desperate even though must decline cheesacre alliance young woman with six hundred year dear may do pretty nearly what plea said aunt greenow be better than having ten year grace given will last longer certainly said kate kate desire be that alice must come down to for while in westmoreland before six month be over desire mentioned to uncle promised to carry message up to alice must not be got to say more than upon subject then mr vavasor went away leaving aunt niece together at hall what on earth will do if wild beast show suddenly among woman asked mr greenow of brother brother must only say that hoped wild beast must keep distance wild beast did keep distance at rate a long a mr greenow remained at hall will now go back to wild beast tell how walked across mountain in rain to bampton little village at foot of haweswater will be remembered that after have struck sister turned away from walked with quick step down mountain side never turning back to look at have found to be without power of persuasion over a regarded evidence to be given if will be questioned more threatened steadier have be in asserting belief in grandfather capacity have looked into eye defied have felt to be worsted what be to do in truth there be nothing for to do have told that must murder in state of mind to fury have driven murder have suggested to a resource to might apply what must gain by murdering at rate by murdering then out on mountain side nothing hanging there must be gratification even to revenge if indeed have murdered that old man who be now unfortunately gone beyond reach of murder if must have poisoned old man cup before last will have be made there might have be something in such deed have merely thought of letting dare not wait upon must a now told with much self reproach nothing be to be got by killing sister so restrained in passion walked away from solitary down mountain rain soon came on found exposed on hill side thought little about buttoned coat a have said before strode on be storm of rain so that be forced to hold head to one side a hit from north with hand to hat head bent against wind went on till have reached valley at foot found that track by have be led thither have become road have never known mountain round hall a kate have known be not aware whither be going on one thing only have made up mind

of fact in favour a got near village overtook shepherd boy coming down from hill learned whereabouts from baampton said boy with accent be almost scotch when be asked name of place when vavasor

doe not know what love mean be quite aware that have behaved to with genuine true nobility a soon a be alone certain of solitude took out that letter from pocket tearing into very small fragment without reading threw piece on fire a did so mind seemed to be fixed at rate to one thing that must think more of burgo fitzgerald a future master think however that have arrived at so much certainty a at moment in have be parting with burgo fitzgerald in lady monk dining room have have courage enough will rather say sin enough to think of going with to tell that must do so to put in way of doing nay have have enough of to enable to tell husband that have resolved that must be good for to do so be bold enough wicked enough to do thing a have said of own idea of destroying did not dare to take plunge therefore knowing now that be so tore up letter that have carried so long burnt in fire have in truth told everything believing that in doing so be delivering own death warrant a regarded future position in house have done not hoping thereby for escape not with purpose a regarded herself simply because deceit have be grievous to have become unendurable a soon a word manner have in feeling of kindness confession have sooner be made than fault have be forgiven have told that did not love have told even that have thought of leaving have justified by own word treatment of however harsh might choose to practise result have be immediate result that have be more tender to than have ever remembered to be before knew that have conquered however cold heartless home might be to must be home now there must be further thought of leaving have gone out into tiltyard have tilted with have be victor mr palliser have not time for much thought before found closeted with duke a crossed hall went up stair thought two did pas quickly across mind have confessed to have forgiven did not feel quite sure that have be right did feel quite sure that thing have be done recognized for fact that a regarded past more be to be said there be to be reproach there must be tacit abandoning of mr marsham close attendance a to mr bott have begun to hate mr bott have felt cruelly ungrateful when gentleman endeavoured to whisper word into ear a passed through doorway into lady monk dining room have offered to go abroad to go abroad leave politics ambition coming honour have persisted in offer even after wife have suggested to that duke of st bungay be now in house with object of offering that very thing for have so longed a thought of heart became heavy within such chance so told come twice in man way when returning from twelvemonth residence abroad must be nobody in politics must have lost everything for have be working life be man of word a opened library door be resolute thought that must be resolute in adhering to promise duke said be afraid have kept waiting two political ally shook other by hand duke be in glow of delight there have be no waiting be only too glad to find friend at home have be prepared to wait even if mr palliser have be out suppose guess why be come said duke must rather be told than have to guess said mr palliser smiling for moment smile quickly passed off face a remembered pledge to wife have resigned at last what be said in lord last night made necessary that must do so that lord brock must declare able to support through thick thin of course can tell everything now must have gone must have done so know that like in cabinet admire character genius think most dangerous man in england a statesman have high principle very highest be so high a to be out of sight to ordinary eye be too exalted to be of use for everyday purpose be honest a sun be sure be just like sun honesty of kind men below ca quite understand appreciate have instinct in politics reach conclusion by philosophical deduction now in politics must deal sooner trust to instinct than to calculation think may probably know how england ought to be governed three century hence better than man living of proper way to govern now think know le brock half like half fear like support of eloquence like power of man fear restless activity thoroughly dislike philosophy at rate have left be here to ask to take place duke a concluded speech be quite contented almost jovial be thoroughly satisfied with new political arrangement be proposing regarded mr palliser a steady practical man of business luckily young therefore with deal of work in belonging to race from english minister ought in opinion to be taken a being in respect own pupil have be first to declare aloud that plantagenet palliser be coming chancellor of exchequer have be long known though such declaration have be made aloud that duke did not sit comfortably in same cabinet with gentleman who have now resigned everything have now gone a duke wished be prepared to celebrate little ovation with young friend before left house in park lane who go out with asked mr palliser putting off evil moment of own decision before duke must answer have reminded that under present circumstance have right to ask question own decision must not rest upon point doe not matter said be afraid must decline offer bring decline said duke who must not have be more surprised have friend talked of declining heaven fear must duke have now risen from chair be standing with hand upon table contentment joviality have vanished fine round face have become almost ludicrously long eye mouth be struggling to convey reproach reproach be almost drowned in vexation ever since parliament have met have be whispering mr palliser name into prime minister ear now must not must not believe nonsense palliser said must have got false notion into head there can be possible reason why must not join finespun will support at rate for time mr finespun be gentleman whose retirement from ministry duke of st bungay have now announced be nothing of kind said mr palliser who perhaps felt quite equal to duty proposed to even though mr finespun must not support be nothing of kind be fear of sort that hinders then for mercy sake what be dear palliser looked upon a being a sure in matter a myself have right to do so certainly intended to join month ago if opportunity offered certainly did be true duke must ask to listen to now must tell must not willingly tell to man a mr palliser said look of agony came over face there be men who can talk easily of most inmost matter be not such man went sorely against grain with to speak of sorrow of home even to such friend a duke be essentially necessary to that must justify upon word said duke ca understand that there must be reason strong enough to make throw party over have promised to take wife abroad be that said duke looking at with surprise at same time with something of returning joviality in face nobody think of going abroad at time of year of course can get away for time when parliament break up have promised to go at once then considering position have made promise behoves to break be sure lady glencora will see in light quite understand be afraid must trouble to listen to matter under other circumstance must be impertinent in to obtrude upon certain stiffness of demeanour measured propriety of voice much at variance with former manner came upon a said of course palliser want to interfere for moment if will allow duke wife have told that morning make feel that absence from england be requisite for present comfort be with when came have just promised that must go palliser think of if be small matter must not press man in position have public duty owes service to country have no right to go back if be possible that must so do when man have given word can not be right that must go back from that of course not man may be absolved from promise lady glencora wife must of course absolve be not that happiness demand be partly fault that be so can not explain to more fully why be that must give up great object for have striven with strength oh said duke if be sure that be imperative be imperative must give twenty four hour know mr palliser did not answer at once duke thought that saw sign of hesitation suppose must not be possible must speak to lady glencora must be of avail duke must only declare at first word that must remain in london must not be le duty on account to take abroad well ca say of course ca say such opportunity may not come twice in man life at age too be throwing away from finest political position that world can offer to ambition of man one at time of life have have chance within memory that man under thirty must be thought fit to be chancellor of exchequer must refuse because want to take wife abroad palliser if be dying must remain under such emergency a might go must remain mr palliser remained silent for moment two in chair then rose walked towards window a spoke there be thing worse than death said when back be turned voice be very low there be tear in eye a spoke word be indeed whispered duke heard felt that must not press more on subject of wife must be final said duke think must visit here have come so quickly on resolution to go abroad in truth be only made ten minute before name be brought to that believe ought to ask for portion of twenty four hour have offered small portion will be enough will see if come to evening say at eight if house be up in lord will go to in st james square will be sitting after eight think then will see there duke must ask to think of in matter a friend must think not a though be bound together only by party feeling will will have told what will never whisper to one else think know that be safe with be sure of duke can tell that sacrifice to will be almost more than can bear thing that have offered to day be only thing have ever coveted have thought of worked for have hoped despaired have for moment be vain enough to think that be within strength have be wretched for week together because have told that be utterly beyond a to that brock of have doubt finespun say that be man be much obliged to say simply that may understand how imperative be duty a think requires to refuse offer have refused a yet said duke will wait at house for whether be sitting not endeavour to join do best can will say nothing a to duty of speak if can be made compatible with public service pray pray let be done remember how much one a owes to country then duke went mr palliser be alone have not be alone before since revelation have be made to by wife word have spoken be still sounding in ear do love burgo fitzgerald do do do be not pleasant word for young husband to hear men there be doubt whose nature must make more miserable under infliction than have made plantagenet palliser be calm without strong passion not prone to give to word stronger significance than must bear be essentially unsuspicious never for moment have thought even while word be hissing in ear that wife have betrayed honour nevertheless there be that at heart a remembered word made feel that world be almost too heavy for for first quarter of hour after duke departure thought more of wife of burgo fitzgerald than did of lord brock mr finespun of be aware that have forgiven wife that have put arm round embraced after hearing confession that mutely with eye have promised that must do best for then something of idea of love came across heart acknowledged to that have married without loving without requiring love much of have be own fault indeed have not whole of come from own wrong doing acknowledged that be so now now loved felt that must not bear to part with even if there be question of public scandal of disgrace have be torn inwardly by assertion that loved man have got at heart string at last there be men who may love wife though never can have be in love before marriage when duke have be gone about hour when under ordinary circumstance must have be time to go down to house took hat walked into park made way across hyde park into kensington garden there remained for hour walking up down beneath elm quidnunc of town who chanced to see who have heard something of political movement of day thought doubt that be meditating future ministerial career have not be there long before have resolved that ministerial career be at present open to have be own fault said a returned to house with god help will mend if be possible be slow man did not go off instantly to duke have given to eight o'clock took full time must not go down to house of common because men must make inquiry of must find difficult to answer so dined at home alone have told wife that must see at nine before hour must not go to sat alone till be time for to get into brougham thought over seat in cabinet chancellorship of exchequer have so infinitely desired be already done with there be doubt about might have be better for not to have married now that be married that thing have brought untowardly to pas knew that wife safety be first duty will go through switzerland said to to baden then will get on to florence to rome have seen nothing of thing yet new life will make change in will have own friend with then went down to house of lord saw duke well palliser said duke when have listened to of course can not argue with more can only say that be very sorry more sorry than perhaps will believe indeed half break heart duke voice be very sad might almost have be thought that be going to shed tear in truth disliked mr finespun with strongest political feeling of be capable have attached to mr palliser almost a strongly be thousand pity how hard have not worked to bring about arrangement be now to be upset because woman have be foolish never above half liked said duke to thinking perhaps little of duchess complaint of must go to brock at once said aloud tell god know what must do now goodbye good bye be not angry there will be quarrel be very sorry in way two politician parted may a well follow political movement to end duke saw lord brock night then two minister sent for minister noble lord man of great experience in cabinet three discussed matter together on following day lord brock got up in house made strong speech in defence of colleague mr finespun to end of session at rate mr finespun kept position held seal of exchequer while quidnunc of nation shaking head spoke of wonderful power of mr finespun declared that lord brock did not dare to face opposition without in meantime mr palliser have returned to wife told of resolution with reference to tour abroad may a well make up mind to start at once said at rate there be nothing on side to hinder chapter lx alice vavasor name get into money market ten twelve day after george vavasor return to london from westmoreland appeared at mr scruby office with four small slip of paper in hand mr scruby a usual be pressing for money third election be coming on money be already being spent very freely among men of river bank so at least mr scruby declared mr grime of handsome man have shown sign of returning allegiance mr grime must not afford to be loyal without money have little family to protect mr scruby too have little family be not ashamed to use on occasion be family man mr vavasor therefore never run risk never go yard further than can see way back have said in answer to proposition that must take george note of hand for expense of next election payable in three month time be so very hard to realize said george immediately upon death when property left be real property very hard indeed said mr scruby who have heard with accuracy particular of old squire will vavasor understood lawyer cursed inwardly suggested to that day might murder mr scruby a well a john grey perhaps also few more of enemy two day after interview in own note of hand have be refused again called in great marlborough street upon occasion tendered to mr scruby for approval four slip of paper have be mentioned mr scruby regarded with attention looking first at one side horizontally then at other side perpendicularly before learn judgement pronounced by mr scruby a to four slip of paper must go back to earlier history a be still in infancy will not have to go back far one morning at about eleven o'clock parlour maid came up to alice a sat alone in drawing room in queen anne street told there be gentleman in hall waiting to be seen by know tone in servant announce gentleman when know that gentleman be not gentleman gentleman wanting to see what sort of gentleman well miss think be just of sort be decent to look at alice vavasor have desire to deny to person one be well aware that gentleman in hall must not be cousin george therefore did not refuse to see let come up said think jane ought to ask name jane did ask name came back immediately announcing mr levy occurred immediately after return of mr john vavasor from westmoreland have reached home late on preceding evening at moment of mr levy call be in dressing room alice got up to receive visitor at once understood tone of maid voice mr levy be certainly not gentleman of sort to have be most accustomed be little dark man with sharp eye set very near to other in head with beaked nose thick at bridge black moustache other beard alice did not at like look of mr levy stood up to receive made little bow asked to sit down be papa dressed yet alice asked servant well miss think be not to say dressed alice have thought might be a well that mr levy must know that there be gentleman in house with have called about little bit of business miss

not so of course excuse because woman so seldom know when how to do business demand of have doubt heard injustice grandfather have done will probably feel a indignant a do only mention now because nature of will make more than ever incumbent on that must be true to pledge to till there will be ground for better understanding between doubt will come think wiser not to call at queen anne street therefore send confidential clerk with four bill of five hundred pound drawn at fourteen day date across will get to write name mr levy will show way in must be done name must come under word accepted just above name of messrs drummonds where money must be lying ready at rate not later than monday fortnight indeed money must be there time on saturday know so well at drummonds that will not object to call on saturday afternoon ask if be all right have certainly be inconvenienced by not finding money a expected on return to town if bill be not properly provided for result will be very disastrous to feel however sure that will be done for own sake for mine affectionately yours george vavasor unparalleled impudence of letter have effect writer have intended made alice think immediately of own remissness if have be remiss rather than of enormity of claim upon decision with asked for money without pretence at excuse on part did for time induce to believe that have alternative to give to that have be wrong in delaying have told that must have ought to have be a good a word must not have forced upon necessity of demanding idea of signing four bill be terrible to felt sure that ought not to put name to order for so large amount then intrust to such man a mr levy father be in house might have asked thought that must do so of course occurred to then occurred to also that be to speak to father a to advancing of money to cousin to giving of money for now well understood that must be gift be to consult father in way about must hinder not only from signing bill for mr levy a far a must do so from keeping promise made to cousin be resolved that george must have money knew that must give to in spite of father father might probably be able to delay gift thus rob of chief value if be to sign bill money must be made to be forthcoming so much understood mr levy have taken out four bill from same case have placed on table before mr vavasor have explained believe miss what be have to do said yes sir cousin have explained there be nothing else to trouble with believe if will just write name across here need not detain by staying longer mr levy be very anxious to make visit a short a possible since have heard that mr john vavasor be in house alice hesitated two thousand pound be very serious sum of money have heard much of sharper thought that ought to be cautious what if man of whom have never before heard must steal bill after have signed looked again at cousin letter chiefly with object of gaining time be right miss said mr levy must not leave with sir said alice well not very well miss doubt mr vavasor have explained fact be must have afternoon have got heavy sum to put down on nail about here election if ai down to day on whom have to depend will be abroad sir money

four bill a held before be quick enough at doing when have once commenced work object then be that man must be gone from house before father must meet be four bit of paper george vavasor tendered to mr scruby notice on occasion have now in hand in doing so made use of after manner of grand capitalist who know that may assume certain air a allows odour of sweetness of wealth to drop from insisted on ready money with d suspicion said there be be not afraid of fourteen day dare say fourteen day be here there said mr scruby can let payment stand over a long a without doing harm will send one of men down to grime tell ca see till let see looked at one of bill till th be not exactly what george vavasor wanted be desirous that bill must be immediately turned into money so that necessity of forcing payment from alice must due provision for bill not be made might fall into other hand than can wait till th said scruby a handed bit of paper back to customer will want thousand say said george thousand to begin with certainly not le then have better keep two of well see use of that have better collect through own banker let have cheque on th th how cursed suspicious be scruby ai be not bit suspicious deal in such article be what doubt can there be about such bill a everybody know that cousin have considerable fortune altogether at own disposal truth be mr vavasor bill with lady name on lady who be way connected with business ai just paper people like nothing on earth can be surer take into city for discount see if banker tell same may be done of course upon name say nothing about can explain to nature of family arrangement ca do to stranger however mind of course not time be so short that doe not signify have collected through own banker then if suit to call send cheque for thousand pound when time be up then mr scruby turned to paper on right hand a though interview have be long enough vavasor looked at angrily opening wound at cursing inwardly mr scruby went on with paper by mean regarding wound unspoken curse thereupon vavasor got up went away without word of farewell a walked along great marlborough street through unalluring street surround soho district so on to strand own lodging still continued to think of wide scheme of revenge of scheme in mr scruby might be included there have appeared something latterly in mr scruby manner to something of mingled impatience familiarity made feel that have fallen in attorney estimation be not that lawyer thought to be le honourable le clever than have before thought that man be like rat knew falling house by instinct be in so george vavasor cursed mr scruby calculated method of murdering without detection reader be not to suppose that member for chelsea district have in truth resolved to gratify revenge by murder by murdering of person whom hated so vigorously did not think probable that must become murderer received secret satisfaction in allowing mind to dwell upon subject in making calculation reflected that must not do to take off scruby john grey at same time a must be known that be connected with of unless indeed be to take off third person at same time third person a to expediency of ending whose career made calculation quite a often a did in regard to of person whom cursed so often need hardly be explained to reader that third person be sitting member for chelsea district a be in want of instant ready money mr scruby proposition that must leave four bill at own banker to be collected when came to maturity did not suit doubted much also whether at end of fourteen day money must be forthcoming alice must be driven to tell father in order that money might be procured john vavasor must probably succeed in putting impediment in way of payment must take bill into city do best there that must with be too late for to day therefore went to lodging then down to house in house sat night with hat over eye making little calculation of have spoken have heard news have said mr bott to whispering in ear news have heard news finespun have resigned palliser be at moment with duke of st bungay in lord library may be at bottom of lord fishpond for what care said vavasor be nonsense know said bott still know palliser be chancellor of exchequer at moment what lucky fellow be to have chance come to directly get in a soon a take seat down there of course will go up behind will have election in month time said george be safe enough said bott never hurt man at election to be closely connected with government george vavasor be in city by time next morning found that city did not look with favourable eye on four bill city took up first horizontally then with twist of hand perpendicularly looked at with distrustful eye city repeated name alice vavasor a though be not esteemed good name on change city suggested that a time be so short holder of bill must be wise to hold till must collect amount be very clear that city suspected something wrong in transaction city by one of mouth asserted plainly that lady bill never meant business george vavasor cursed city made calculation about murdering might not river of strychnine be turned on round exchange about luncheon time three of bill left at last with own banker for collection retained fourth in breast pocket intending on morrow to descend with into lower depth of money market have not a yet visited again on next day went to work succeeded to extent among lower depth found capitalist who be willing to advance two hundred pound keeping that fourth bill in possession a security capitalist be to have forty pound for transaction george cursed a took cheque george vavasor knew quite enough of commercial world to enable to understand that man must be in very bad condition when consent to pay forty pound for use of two hundred for fourteen day cursed city cursed house of common cursed cousin alice sister kate cursed memory of grandfather cursed mr levy have hardly left house in queen anne street before alice have told father what have done money must be forthcoming said alice to father made immediate reply turning in chair away from with sudden start sat looking at fire

then sat in drawing room awaiting two gentleman be already past hour of dinner before father came up stair knew that be in house in heart accused of keeping out of way in order that john grey might be alone with whether be right in suspicion john grey did not take advantage of opportunity offered to father came up first have seated silently in arm chair before visitor be announced a mr grey entered

quarrel with on very subject on very point have left have never argued matter with have never asked to argue with have not condescended so far a have done so thought that must have brought to think a thought must have striven at rate to do so must not become unambitious tranquil fond of retirement philosophic without argument on matter without being allowed even poor grace of owning to be convinced if man take dog with from country up to town dog must live town life without knowing reason why must live town life die town death woman must not be treated like dog have deigned to discus with alice have so often said will read book be to go there to fetch slipper make tea for came upon again a walked down stair by side with there came consciousness that have be driven by usage into terrible engagement have made with cousin that doubt be now over there be longer to question of marrying george vavasor fact that have be mad enough to think talk of such marriage have of be enough to ruin thing of sort be so often over with after speech a to from father alice told that there must be no more thing of sort for misery have be brought about by scornful superiority to ordinary pursuit of world looking down upon humanity seems to said very quietly while hand be yet upon arm that pity be hardly needed must think that person can be happier than whom call public men ah said be old quarrel said a though quarrel have simply be argument between dozen argument a argument do come up between friend not a though have served to separate for life two person who have loved other dearly be old story of town mouse country mouse a old a hill mouse may be civil for while compliment other when come to speak mind freely like own life best said nothing more at moment three sat down to small dinner table be astonishing to alice that must be able to talk in way to hint at such thing to allude to former hope present condition without quiver in voice a far a must perceive without feeling in heart alice said father ca compliment cook upon soup encourage papa by eating often enough then only told at two o'clock to day if cook ca make soup between two seven ca make in week hope mr grey will excuse said alice be good said wo say that be because must be pretending to have opinion must not have found out anything against of where do dine usually now be in london mr vavasor

public life for be quite unfitted 'd a soon be called on to choose prime minister for country a must cook for club of course must said mr vavasor there may be a many a dozen cook about london to be looked up there be never more than two possible prime minister about a one of must be going out when other be coming in see that there can be difficulty moreover now day people do politics for expect to have dinner cooked for little dinner went on quietly very easily mr vavasor found fault with nearly everything a on occasion meat drink with manner of eating drinking did not constitute difficulty alice be indifferent to father censure thing needed be that mr grey must be able to sit together at same table without apparent consciousness of former tie alice felt that be succeeding indifferently well while be putting in little mock defence for cook a for john grey succeeded so well that success almost made alice angry with required effort with at to be successful in matter if can forget have passed so much better said alice to herself when got up into drawing room then sat down on sofa cried oh what have not lost have woman ever be so mad so reckless so heartless a have be have done knowing that loved cried bitterly then went away to wash eye that might be ready to give coffee when must come up stair doe not look well said grey a soon a have left room well how can look well after what have gone through sometimes think that of people ever knew have be most foolish of course be not for to say anything against own child of people not to nothing that must say against must make difference to sometimes fancy that know better than do think that will still come round again can not say that think so no one can venture to say whether not such wound a hers may be cured there be heart body so organized that in severe wound be incurable whereas in others injury seems to be fatal can say that if be not cured will not be from want of perseverance on part upon word grey know how

niece have inherited property be to make change oh mr greenow who must have thought to find mercenary like inherited property be going to fling man over because of mr greenow endeavoured to explain to that niece must hardly be said to have flung over at last pretended to become angry when attempted to assert position why mr cheesacre be quite sure never gave word of encouragement in life always

with air of offended dignity falling back almost into humility during performance of adieu before be gone have invited to bring captain to oileymead when be married have begged to tell miss vavasor how happy must be to receive mr cheesacre said widow a walked back along road forget dear charlie fairstairs be standing at front door of house when mr greenow re appeared alice kate captain bellfield shap boy shap horse gig where be kate asked in low voice everyone there felt how important be question have gone said widow bellfield be so relieved that must not restrain joy took off little straw hat threw up into air kate satisfaction be almost a intense be so glad said what on earth must have done with never be so disappointed in life said alice have heard so much of mr cheesacre have never seen kate suggested that must get into gig drive after ai be took off suggested boy whose face became very dismal a terrible idea struck with juvenile craft put hand on carpet bag finding that did not contain stone be comforted drive after young gentleman will find on road to shap said mr greenow mind give love said captain in glee say hope will get turnip in well little episode went far to break day did more than anything else must have done to put captain bellfield at ease created little joint stock fund of merriment between whole party be very much needed absence of such joint stock fund be always felt when small party be thrown together without such assistance bond be necessary on occasion other bond be so easy so pleasant now when captain found alone for quarter of hour with alice have plenty of subject for small talk yes indeed old cheesacre in spite of absurdity be not bad sort of fellow at bottom awfully fond of money know miss vavasor always boasting about be not pleasant said alice no most unpleasant thing in world there be nothing hate so much miss vavasor a kind of talking idea be when man have lot of money let make best use can of say nothing about nobody ever heard talking about money knew that alice knew that be pauper nevertheless have satisfaction of speaking of a though be not pauper in way afternoon went very pleasantly for hour before dinner captain bellfield be have into drawing room be talked to by widow on matter of business have of course known that be necessary scolded soundly about sheriff officer why have not told a long a there be anything kept back wo have said wo become wife till be quite sure there be not penny owing be not shown in list then think did tell nearly when be counted be not so very much three four hundred pound must make new man what be such sum a to wealthy widow indeed for woman wanting husband of sort captain bellfield be safer venture than must be man of higher standing among creditor be true bellfield might have be forger thief returned convict then debt must not be large let have done best must not have obtained credit for thousand pound whereas one must tell liability of gentleman of high standing burgo fitzgerald be gentleman of high standing creditor must have swallowed up shilling mr greenow possessed with captain bellfield be comparatively safe upon whole think that be lucky in choice perhaps might more truly say that have chosen with prudence be forger thief in ordinary sense of word be returned convict be simply idle scamp who have hung about world for forty year doing nothing without principle shameless accustomed to eat dirty pudding to be kicked morally kicked by such men a cheesacre be moderate in greediness possessed of certain appreciation of comfort of daily dinner might possibly suffice to keep from straying very wide a long a intended wife must be able to keep purse string altogether in own hand therefore say that mr greenow have be lucky in choice not altogether without prudence think of taking house said of living here what in westmoreland said captain with something of dismay in tone what on earth must do with life in gloomy place yes in westmoreland why not in westmoreland a well a anywhere else if like westmoreland be not too late yet know in answer to poor captain be obliged to declare that have objection to westmoreland have be talking to niece about continued mr greenow find such arrangement can be made very conveniently property be left between uncle father of other niece of want to live here wo be rather dull dear must go to yarmouth know in autumn then captain visage became somewhat bright again perhaps if be not extravagant must manage month so in london during winter just to see play do little shopping then captain face became very bright will be delightful said a for being dull said widow when people grow old must be dull dancing ca go on for ever in answer to widow captain assured widow that be not at old now on occasion that ceremony came off successfully have be interrupted on shap road by noise of mr cheesacre wheel there go cap said what goose be what will jeannette say bother jeannette said captain in bliss can do cap many more wo be wanted then think ceremony be repeated upon whole captain visit be satisfactory at rate to captain everything be settled be to go away on saturday morning remain in lodging at penrith till wedding agreed to have celebrated at vavasor church kate promised to be solitary bridesmaid there be talk of sending for charlie fairstairs idea be abandoned will have afterwards said widow to kate when be gone will want more will get cheesacre here make marry there be good in paying for two journey captain be to be allowed to come over from penrith twice week previous to marriage perhaps might more fairly say that be commanded to do so wonder how felt when mr greenow gave first five pound note told that must make do for fortnight whether be joy whether there be about heart touch of manly regret captain bellfield of vavasor hall westmoreland sound badly said to a travelled away on first journey to penrith chapter lxvi lady monk plan on night of lady monk party burgo fitzgerald disappeared when guest be gone room be empty aunt inquired for in vain old butler factotum of house who be employed by sir cosmo to put out lamp to see that be not robbed beyond certain point on occasion of wife triumph be interrogated by mistress said that thought mr burgo have left house lady monk knocked at nephew door when went up stair ascending additional flight of stair with weary old limb in order that might do so even opened door saw careless debris of toilet about room be gone perhaps after have arranged said to herself a went down to own room burgo a know have not arranged may be remembered that when mr palliser came back to wife in supper room at lady monk bringing with scarf lady glencora have left up stair burgo be no longer with have become well aware that have chance left at rate for night poor fool acting upon aunt implied advice rather than own hope have secured post chaise stationed in bruton street five minute walk from aunt house have purchased feminine wrapping cloak c thing that thought might be necessary for companion have too ordered room at new hotel near dover station london bridge station from whence be to start on following morning train to catch tidal boat for boulogne there be dressing bag there for have paid twenty five guinea out of aunt money not having be able to induce tradesman to grant to on credit

glencora taken to carriage from back hiding place in hall then slipped out unmindful of shining boot dress coat jewelled stud took gibus hat own that of other unfortunate slowly made way down to place in bruton street there be carriage pair of horse in readiness driver when have placed by door of vehicle be not long in emerging from neighbouring public house ready honour said man sha want to night

parints be too many for said driver of imagined enormity hirer of chaise have in truth contemplated burgo from thence took way back into grosvenor square from thence down park street through narrow passage mew there be in part into park lane have now passed position of mr palliser house having come out on park lane at spot nearer to piccadilly retraced step walking along by rail of park till found opposite to house then stood there leaning back upon railing looking up at lady glencora window what did expect to see be in truth moved by love of kind can take joy in watching slightest shadow be made by one loved object may be made by by violent conjecture of mind may be supposed to have be so made such love a be think always innocent burgo fitzgerald did not love like almost doubt whether can be said to have loved at there be in breast mixed feverish desire took trouble to analyse wanted money wanted thing of palliser have robbed wanted revenge though desire for be not burning desire among other thing wanted woman beauty of woman whom coveted wanted to kiss again a have once kissed to feel that be soft lovely loving for a for seeing shadow unless movement indicated purpose in favour think that cared much about why then be there because in unreasoning folly did not know what step to take what step not to take there be men whose energy hardly ever carry beyond looking for thing want might see from window come to say that thought that must be so fancy that never thought at about about anything if lie under tree open mouth plum may fall into be probably undefined idea of such chance a brought against railing in front of mr palliser house that feeling made up partly of despair partly of lingering romance that be better there out in night air under gas lamp than must be elsewhere there stood looked cursed ill luck curse have none of bitterness of george vavasor be always uttering through there remained about burgo one honest feeling one conviction be true feeling that served right that have better perhaps go to devil at once give nobody more trouble if loved one sincerely did hate one whenever made self inquiry into own circumstance always told that be own fault when cursed fate only did so because cursing be so easy george vavasor must have ground victim up to powder if knew how burgo fitzgerald desired to hurt one there stood till be cold then a plum did not drop into mouth moved on went up into oxford street walked along whole distance to corner of bond street passing by grosvenor square to intended to return at corner of bond street girl took

lady glencora have promised that must see again have said a much a quite distinctly what use must there be in if money must then be gone knew that keeping of money in pocket be to quite impossibility

breakfasted on pate de foie gras curacoa regarded dainty very much a other men regard bread cheese beer though be dressing at summons of aunt have by mean made up mind that must go to why must go to what good must do must not give more money must only scold for misconduct might perhaps turn out of house if did not obey attempt to do so must be much more likely to do when have made angry by contradicting in case must leave house even though further use be positively forbidden because remaining there be convenient a must gain nothing by seeing old girl a have called resolved to escape to club without attending to summons aunt who be better general than out manoeuvred crept down back stair a must not quite condescend to escape through area be forced to emerge upon hall here aunt pounced upon coming out of breakfast parlour did not lucy tell wanted to see lady monk asked with severity in voice burgo replied with perfect ease that be going out just to have hair washed brushed

consolation a among mortal there must in truth hardly be one with whom such consolation must go shorter way be man who required to have such comfort backed by pate curacoa to very large extent now might be doubted whether amount of pate curacoa at command must last much longer must not go in tell aunt at once of failure a must gain nothing by doing so indeed thought that must not tell aunt at so turned back from grosvenor square went down to club in st james street feeling that billiards brandy water might for present be best restorative a went back blamed very greatly in matter of bank

lady glencora felt certain that endeavoured to do mischief said alice of course did said lady glencora have habit of rubbing head against paper in room leaving mark behind be quite unpardonable mr palliser be effectually talked down felt constrained to abandon political ally perhaps did easier a loss mr bott have just suffered must materially interfere with political utility suppose will remain now among own people said mr palliser let hope will said lady glencora that own people will appreciate advantage of presence then there be nothing more said about mr bott be evening while be still sitting among letter newspaper there came shout along water noise of many voice from bridge suddenly there shot down before in swift running head of many swimmer in river with swimmer came boat carrying clothes went by almost like glance of light upon water so rapid be course of current there be shout of voice quick passage of boat uprising dozen time of men hand above surface then be gone down river out of sight like morsel of wood thrown into cataract be borne away instantly oh how wish must do said lady glencora seems to be very dangerous said mr palliser know how can stop why must want to stop said lady glencora think how cool water must be how beautiful to be carried along so quickly to go on on on suppose must try a encouragement be given to proposition lady glencora did not repeat stood leaning on rail of balcony looking enviously down upon water alice be of course thinking of other evening when perhaps same swimmer have come down under bridge before balcony where george vavasor be sitting in presence be think on evening that made up mind to separate from mr grey on day after mr palliser party went on to lucerne making journey a have said by slow stage taking schaffhausen zurich in way at lucerne established for time occupying nearly dozen room in great hotel overlook lake here there came to visitor of whose arrival will speak in next chapter chapter lxx at lucerne be inclined to think that mr palliser did not much enjoy part of tour abroad when first reached lucerne there be one there with whom must associate pleasantly have occupation capable of making time run easily did not care for scenery close at elbow be finest to be have in europe be nothing to have be simply journeying through lucerne at proper time of year for journey when business of session be over little change of air needed must have enjoyed thing in moderate way looking about passing on knowing that be good for to be there at moment have none of passion for mountain lake none of positive joy in heather must have compensated many man for loss of mr palliser be losing mind be ever at home in house of common in august assembly men call cabinet of meeting of read from week to week simple record be mentioned name of hero to whom fortune have be so much kinder than have be to envied took short solitary walk about town over bridge along river making to speech must have made to full house have not wife brought ruin upon hope a pictured to glorious success probably never must have be have remained in london so did prophesy to absolute irremediable downfall from political power a result of absence having in truth sufficient cause for such despair a yet be barely thirty have be able to judge own case a keenly a must have judged case of must have known that short absence might probably raise value in estimation of others rather than lower personal annoyance be too great to allow of making such calculation aright so became fretful unhappy though spoke word of rebuke to wife though never hinted that have robbed of glory made conscious by manner that have brought to miserable condition lady glencora have love for mountain lake be love of kind requires to be stimulated by society be keenest among cold chicken picnic pie flying of champagne cork when first entered switzerland be very enthusiastic declared intention of climbing up mountain going through pass endeavoured to induce husband to promise that must be taken up mont blanc think must have carried on must have be taken up mont blanc have mr palliser aspiration be congenial be not congenial lady glencora soon lost enthusiasm by time that be settled at lucerne have voted mountain to be bore have almost learned to hate lake declared always made wet through when got into small boat sea sick when put foot in large one at lucerne made acquaintance mr palliser being man not apt to new friendship did not even dine at public table though lady glencora have expressed wish to do so mr palliser did not like of course lady glencora gave way there be moreover marital passage be not pleasant to third person did not scold other lady glencora must make little speech of husband disapproved must purposely irritate by continuing tone of badinage then mr palliser must become fretful must look a though care of world be too many for can not therefore say that alice have much to make first period of sojourn at lucerne period of enjoyment when have be there about fortnight stranger arrived whose coming at rate lent grace of excitement to life custom be to breakfast at nine a near nine a lady glencora must be induced to appear then mr palliser must read till three at hour must walk forth by after having handed two lady into carriage must be driven about for two hour how do hate carriage lady glencora said one day do so wish must come to grief be broken to piece wonder whether swiss people think that be going to be driven about here for ever there be moment however seemed to indicate lady glencora have something to tell cousin if told must alter monotony of life alice however must not press for secret if have anything to tell why tell alice once said be so hard said lady glencora so tell very often alice replied be not complimentary hard soft wo make petition for confidence then lady glencora said something savage subject be dropped for while must go back to stranger mr palliser have put lady into carriage be standing between front door of hotel lake on certain day doubting whether must walk up hill to left turn into town on right when be accosted by english gentleman who raising hat said that believed that spoke to mr palliser be mr palliser said friend very courteously returning salute smiling a spoke though smiled though be courteous though raised hat there be something in look voice must not have encouraged ordinary stranger to persevere mr palliser be not man with whom be easy to open acquaintance name be john grey said stranger then smile be dropped look of extreme courtesy disappeared tone of mr palliser voice be altered put out hand knew enough of mr john grey history to be aware that mr john grey be man with whom might permit to become acquainted after interchange of very few word two men started off for walk together perhaps wish to meet carriage said mr palliser if so have better go through town up river went through town up river when mr palliser on return be seen by alice lady glencora be alone dined together nothing be said together sauntered out in evening together came in drank tea still nothing be said at last alice cousin took candle from mr palliser hand left sitting room for night alice said lady glencora a soon a be in passage together have be dying for time to come must not speak before must have made blunder so must let go into room at once who do think be here at lucerne in house at very moment alice knew at once who be knew immediately that mr grey have followed though word have be written to spoken to on subject since day on have told that must meet abroad though be quite sure did not mention name who be glencora asked very calmly whom in world must best like to see said glencora cousin kate certainly said alice then be not cousin kate believe else be fool alice be accustomed to lady glencora mode of talking therefore did not think much of perhaps be fool said only know be not be not at so sure a to being hypocrite person mean be gentleman of course why show little excitement at rate when plantagenet told just before dinner almost jumped out of shoe be going to tell after dinner in politest way in world doubt just a servant be carrying away apple thought best to save from declare believe might have left to do must have have effect upon who be have come do suppose of course know now said alice very calmly that mr john grey have come yes mr john grey have come be here in house at minute more probably waiting outside by lake till will see light in bedroom then lady glencora paused for moment waiting that alice might say something alice said nothing well said lady glencora rising up from chair well well said alice have nothing to say be same to a though mr smith have come no not exactly same be quite alive to importance of mr grey arrival will probably lie awake night thinking about if will do good to know feel have much to say about wish have let mr palliser tell in ordinary way before servant do indeed must not have made much difference not least believe wonder whether ever did care for anybody in life for for other one for anybody for nobody believe except cousin kate still water say run deep sometimes think water run too deep for to fathom suppose may go now if have got nothing more to say what do want to say of course know why have come here told must come have never said word about told must come thought better not to say word about might change mind anything might happen told not to come must have be much better that must have remained away why why why must be better because being here will do good to one good seems to impossible that must do good in world look here alice if altogether make up with before to morrow evening will believe to be utterly heartless have be must have be in arm before will go now leave to lie awake a say will then left room returned in moment to ask question what be plantagenet to say to about seeing to morrow of course have asked permission to come call may come if plea think have quarrelled with must refuse to see may ask to dine with oh yes make up picnic rest of in fact be to be regarded a only ordinary person well good night understand be may be doubted whether alice understood a soon a friend be gone put out candle seated at open window of room looking out upon moonlight a played upon lake must be there thinking of looking up perhaps a glencora have hinted to see if must distinguish light among hundred must be flickering across long front of house if be so at rate must not see so drew curtain sat there watching lake be pity that must have come yet loved dearly for coming be pity that must have come a coming must lead to good result of assured over over again yet hardly knew why be so sure of glencora have called hard conviction on matter have not come from hardness now that be alone heart be full of love of soft romance of love towards man yet felt that ought not to marry even though might still be willing to take that be still willing to take that desired to have for wife in spite of injury have done there must be doubt why else have followed to switzerland remembered now at moment how have told at cheltenham that must never consider to be lost to unless must in truth become wife of man why then must not be a wished illustration alice asked question did not answer still felt that might not be so have right to such happiness after evil that have done have be driven by frenzy to do must not pardon having done must not bring to accept position must have be reward of good conduct must not analyse cause made feel that must still refuse love be proffered to must not clearly read own thought cause be a have said such be true reading of thought have simply refused hand after have once accepted have refused then again changed mind must have brought to ask to forgive have done so much more than so much worse have affianced to man since have belonged to since have be a future wife what must not think of what not suspect then remembered interview have have with cousin since have written to accepting offer when have be with in queen anne street have shrunk from outward sign of love did not feel there have be no caress between have not allowed to touch with lip be impossible that nature of mad engagement between cousin george must ever be made known to mr grey sat there wiping tear from eye a looked for figure among figure by lake side a sat there promised happiness from coming oh reader can forgive in have sinned against softness of feminine nature think that may be forgiven in have never brought to think lightly of own fault if be there by lake side did not see think may say that john grey be not man to console in love by looking up at lady candle be one who be capable of doing a much a most men in pursuit of love a proved to be case when followed alice to cheltenham again to london now again to lucerne doubt whether glimmer from bedroom window have be unmistakably own glimmer not that of ugly old french woman who might chance to sleep next to must have done much good have come to lucerne with purpose purpose if might be possible meant to carry out think be already in bed being tired with long travel before lady glencora have left alice room at breakfast next morning nothing be said for while about new arrival at last mr palliser ventured to speak glencora have told think that mr grey be here mr grey be old friend of yours believe alice keeping countenance a well a be able said mr grey have be

back from be very glad to see a old friend said hope well hope what hope have have better cause for travelling than desire to see dearest no have have better cause indeed none other have come on purpose to see have mr palliser taken off to asia africa think must have felt compelled to follow know why follow hardly said not finding at moment other word that must say because love see what plain spoken john bull be how come to point at once want to be wife say that perseverance be best way when man have want a that ought not to want said whispering word a though be unable to speak out loud do see why must not want be not fit to be wife be best judge of alice have to make up mind whether be fit to be husband must be disgraced if be to take after have passed after what have done what must other men say of when knew story other men hope must be just enough to say that when have made up mind be tolerably constant in keeping to think must say much worse of than that must say that have be jilted have forgiven jilt a far a forgiveness go must tell truth indeed alice very much care what men do say of care mr grey though may forgive can not forgive indeed know now a have known along be not fit to be wife be not good enough have done make feel have right to marry anyone word said jerking out different sentence almost in convulsion when have come to end of tear be streaming down cheek

to treat simply a friend in spite of everything hope that may always be friend dear friend said hope may answered very dearest then left in afternoon again encountered palliser having thought over matter since interview with alice resolved to tell whole story to new acquaintance not in order that might ask for counsel from for in matter wanted man advice that might get assistance so two men walked off together up bank of clear flowing reuss mr palliser felt comfort of having companion have always liked said mr palliser though to tell truth have twice be very angry with have never be angry with said lover anger be in instance unjust may imagine how great be confidence in when have thought be best companion wife must have for long journey taken under circumstance be that be need not trouble with so great have be desolation of mr palliser life since banishment from london that almost felt tempted to tell story of trouble to absolute stranger bethought of blood of pallisers refrained there be comfort royalty may never enjoy luxury in such men a plantagenet palliser may not permit to indulge about character have doubt in world said grey in that have done think have seen motif though have not approved of have always known to be pure unselfish have done nothing did not forgive a soon a be done have married that man must have forgiven even that though must have known that future life be destroyed much of mine also think can make happy if will marry must first be taught to forgive living a be with with wife may perhaps just now be more under influence wife than can possibly be under mine whereupon mr palliser promised that must do what must think love said mr grey mr palliser said that be sure did though what ground have for such assurance be quite unable to surmise be probably desirous of saying most civil thing occurred to little dinner party that evening be pleasant enough nothing more be said about love lady glencora talked nonsense to mr grey mr palliser contradicted nonsense wife talked be done in such way that evening passed away pleasantly be tacitly admitted among mr grey be to be allowed to come among a friend lady glencora managed to

vavasor be already halfway up stair before girl have reached first landing place have entered mr grey room closed door behind grey be sitting near open window in dressing gown be reading breakfast thing be on table have not a yet breakfasted a soon a saw george vavasor rose from chair quickly put down book mr vavasor said hardly expected to see in lodging again dare say not said vavasor nevertheless here be kept right hand in pocket held pistol held left hand under waistcoat may ask why have come said grey intend to tell at rate whether ask not have come to declare in own hearing a be in habit of doing occasionally behind back that be blackguard to spit in face defy a said suited action to word without serious result have come here to see if be man enough to resent insult can offer doubt whether be nothing that can say to mr vavasor will have effect upon except that can of course annoy mean to annoy too before have done with will fight fight duel with with pistol certainly not then be coward a supposed must be fool if be to do thing a look here mr grey managed to worm into intimacy with cousin miss vavasor to become engaged to when found out what be how paltry mean vile changed mind bade leave be here at request be here a representative self appointed think then sir think wrong be at moment affianced husband find in spite of have said to be enough must have thought to keep man of spirit out of presence still persecute by going to house forcing upon presence now give two alternative will either give written promise never to go near again will fight will do one

nothing of kind will suit at want to have anything to do with then be coward perhaps be saying so will not make one be coward liar blackguard have given option of behaving like gentleman have refused now look here have come here with arm intend to leave room without using unless will promise to give meeting have proposed took pistol out of pocket do mean that be going to murder grey asked there be two window in room have be sitting near to be furthest removed from fireplace consequently furthest removed from bell visitor be now standing immediately between door have to think what step might best take to act upon decision instantly be by mean timid man be one moreover very little prone to believe in extravagant action did not think even now that disappointed ruined man have come there with intention of killing knew that pistol in hand of angry man be dangerous that behoved to do best to rid of nuisance now encumbered do mean that be going to murder have said mean that will not leave room alive unless promise to meet fight out upon hearing grey turned towards bell if move step will fire at said vavasor grey paused moment looked full in face will said vavasor again must be murder said grey think that will frighten by ugly word said vavasor be beyond grey have stopped for moment to fix eye on other man face be only for moment then went on to bell have seen that pistol be pointed at have once thought of rushing across room at adversary calculating that shot fired at a did so might miss that must then have fair chance of disarming madman chief object be to avoid personal conflict to escape indignity of scramble for pistol especially to escape necessity of consequent appearance at police office where must have to justify answer question of lawyer hired to cross question made therefore towards bell trusting that vavasor must not fire at having little thought also a to danger of moment might be that everything be over for now that fatal hour have come that eternity be close upon something of spirit of prayer flashed across mind a moved then heard click of pistol hammer a fell be aware that eye be dazzled though be unconscious of seeing flame felt something in air knew that pistol have be fired did not know whether shot have struck have missed hand be out for bell handle have pulled before be sure that be unhurt d ation exclaimed murderer did not pull trigger again though weapon have of late be so often in hand forgot in agitation of moment that missing once be of small matter if chose to go on with purpose be there not five other barrel for making ready by discharge of other have paused forgetting in excitement use of weapon before have bethought that man be still in power heard sound of bell d ation exclaimed then turned round left room hurried down stair made way out into street having again passed girl on way grey when perceived that enemy be gone turned round to look for bullet mark soon found little hole in window shutter probing with point of pencil came upon morsel of lead might now just a readily have be within own brain there left for time then made not inaccurate calculation a to narrowness of own escape have be standing directly between vavasor shutter found from height of hole that shot must have passed close beneath ear remembered to have heard click of hammer must not remember sound of report when girl entered room perceived at once from manner that be unaware that firearm have be used have gentleman left house grey asked girl said that have left house admit again said be if can avoid believe be not in right sens then asked for mr jones landlord in few minute pugilistic tailor be with during few minute have be called upon to resolve what must do now must put police at once upon track of murderer who be a remembered too well first cousin of woman whom still desired to make wife that cross examination must have to undergo at police office again probably in assize court in relation with vavasor family must be made public be very vivid to imagination that be called upon by duty to do something felt almost assured man who have be allowed to make such attempt once with impunity might probably make again resolved that need not now say anything about pistol to pugilistic tailor unless tailor said something to mr jones said that man whom have to put out of room once before have be here again have there be tussle sir nothing of kind must take step to prevent getting in again if can help jones promised aid offered to go at once to police to however mr grey demurred saying that must seek assistance from magistrate jones promised to be very vigilant a to watching door then john grey sat down to breakfast of course thought much of what have occurred be impossible that must not think much of so narrow escape have probably be a near death a man may well be without receiving injury more thought of more strongly be convinced that must not allow thing to pas by without notice precaution a to future at eleven o'clock went to scotland yard saw officer great in power over policeman told circumstance confidentially powerful officer recommended equally confidential reference to magistrate towards evening very confidential policeman in plain clothes paid visit to vavasor lodging in cecil street vavasor lodged there no longer mr bunsby who be also very confidential at wit end because must not learn special business of stranger who called stated that mr george vavasor left house in cab at ten o'clock that morning having taken with such luggage a have packed having gone be afraid for good a mr bunsby expressed have gone for good at moment in policeman be making inquiry in cecil street be leaning over side of american steamer have just got up steam weighed anchor in mersey be on board at six o'clock be not till next day that cabman be traced who have carried to euston square station of course be soon known that have gone to america be not thought worth while to take further step towards arresting mr grey be decidedly opposed to such attempt declaring opinion that own evidence must be insufficient to obtain conviction big men in scotland yard be loth to let matter drop mouth watered after job have very numerous very confidential interview with john grey be decided that nothing must be done pity said one enterprising superintendent in answer to condolings of brother superintendent pity name for be greatest shame a ever knew since joined force man a be member of parliament only last session a belongs to end of swell club gent a well known in london a gent about town 'd have have back in three month a sure a name walker superintendent felt that profession country be alike disgraced now george vavasor vanishes from page will be heard of more roebury knew no longer pall mall chelsea district disappearance be nine day wonder world at large knew nothing of circumstance of attempt in suffolk street mr grey told story to one till told to mr palliser at lucerne mr scruby complained bitterly of way in vavasor have robbed doubt whether scruby in truth lost much by transaction to kate down in westmoreland tidings came of brother sojourn in london with aunt have nearly come to end before knew that be gone even then rumour reached through captain bellfield learned what few fact knew from mr bunsby in cecil street be always mysterious said mr greenow now have vanished hate mystery a for think will be much better that must not come back again perhaps kate be of same opinion if so kept to herself chapter lxxiii in come tidings of great moment to pallisers be not till have be for day two together at lucerne that mr grey told mr palliser story of george vavasor visit to in suffolk street having begun history of connection with alice found obliged to go with to end a described way in man have vanished from sight of who have known that have in truth gone so a no longer to be cause of dread must not without dissimulation keep back story of last scene tried to murder said mr palliser must be caught mr palliser hesitated not liking to say boldly that first cousin of lady who be now living with ought to be hung be better a be said grey actually walked into room in day time fired pistol at a be sitting at breakfast did that in london then walked off went abroad a though have nothing to fear be just said grey mr palliser began to think that something ought to be done to make life more secure in metropolis of world have not known mr grey be accustomed to see other man in parliament must not have thought so much about be almost too much for when reflected that one man whom now called friend have be nearly murdered in daylight in heart of own part of london by man whom have reckoned among parliamentary supporter have got money too said palliser putting circumstance of case together in answer to mr grey said that hoped loss might eventually be own that be bound to regard money have be taken a part of miss vavasor fortune be simply greatest miscreant of whom ever heard in life said mr palliser wonder be that miss vavasor must ever have brought to to like then mr grey apologized for alice explaining that love for cousin have come from early year that man be clever capable of assuming pleasant way that have not be wholly bad till ruin have come upon attempted public life made miserable by failing a most men do who make attempt said grey be statement mr palliser must not allow to pas without notice whereupon two men got away from george vavasor own individual interest went on seriously discussing merit demerit of public life end of be said grey at last that public men in england must be rich like not poor like miserable wretch who have now lost everything that fate have given continued to live at lucerne in way for fortnight mr grey though be not unfrequently alone with alice did not plead suit in direct word continued to live with on term of close easy friendship have told that cousin have

already ancient people be never impatient said grey laughing if be must go to tell roundly that must marry then must shake if be to scold till did not know whether stood on head heel must come to reason suppose try that lady glencora ca be that always scold a will her when be wife mr palliser be very much alike be of so very virtuous that woman must have chance of picking hole in coat lady glencora be wrong alice must no doubt have submitted patiently to lover rebuke must have confessed own sin towards with amount of self accusation that might have required must not on account have be more willing to obey in one point a to now required present obedience understood that must be taught to forgive for evil have done to forgive at rate in part before must be induced to return to old

world be about to be moved from lowest depth to summit of highest mountain lady glencora have whispered into husband ear that thought probable be sure did know then burst out into tear on bosom a sat by on bedside be beside when left did with primary intention of telegraphing to london for dozen leading physician went out by lake side walked there alone for ten minute in state of almost unconscious exaltation did not quite remember where be what be doing one thing in world have lacked one joy have wanted so much be so common among men be coming to also in few minute be to a though

whose nose be now so terribly out of joint indeed thought be of good thing be coming to of new world of interest be being opened for must be better to than being chancellor of exchequer must rather have in store for to be father of next duke of omnium than make dozen consecutive annual speech in parliament a to way mean expenditure of british nation must be possible that foreign tour have produced for good fortune if so how luckily have thing turned out must remember even that ball at lady monk with gratitude perhaps residence abroad must be best for lady glencora at particular period of life if so abroad must certainly live before resolving however on anything permanently on head thought that might judiciously consult six first rate london physician whom in first moment of excitement have be desirous of summoning to lucerne in meantime alice have gone up to bedroom of lady who be now to be subject of so much anxious thought when entered room friend be up in dressing

requiring very early energy on mr palliser part when remember own programme for following day lady glencora received husband that night with infinite anxiety be by mean satisfied with what have be done described to a accurately a must nature of interview with burgo described to also other interview with head commissioner will will said lady glencora when heard from husband man surmise that perhaps might destroy will will if doe how can expect that will bear palliser tried to soothe by telling of promised visit to landlord lady glencora accepting a something strove to instigate husband to lavish expenditure on burgo behalf there can be reason why must not take said glencora none least have not be promised to have not right to subject be one mr palliser found very hard to discus must not tell wife that fitzgerald ought to accept bounty assured that money must be forthcoming almost to extent if must be made available on following morning went down to hotel saw real landlord found to be reasonable tranquil very good natured man who be possessed by not irrational desire that customer bill must be paid who seemed to be much le eager on subject than be english landlord in general chief anxiety seemed to arise from great difficulty of doing anything with gentleman who be now lying in bed up stair have have breakfast mr palliser asked breakfast oh yes landlord laughed have be very particular in order have given have desired cutlet to be dressed in particular way with great deal of cayenne pepper have be so dressed have ordered bottle of sauterne landlord have thought head waiter acting for have thought that bottle of ordinary wine of country must do a well bottle of ordinary wine of country have just that moment be sent up stair then mr palliser sat down in landlord little room have burgo fitzgerald bill brought to think might venture to pay said palliser be a monsieur pleased said landlord with something like sparkle in eye what be mr palliser to do did not know whether in accordance with rule of world in lived ought to pay ought to leave certainly landlord must not tell then thought of wife must not go back to wife without having done something so a first measure paid bill landlord eye glittered receipted in most becoming manner must now send up bottle of sauterne to mr palliser demurred to whom must receipted bill be given mr palliser thought that landlord have better keep for while perhaps there be little difficulty suggested landlord mr palliser acknowledged that there be little difficulty knew that must do something more must not simply pay bill go away must not satisfy wife knew that must do something more how be to do so at last let landlord into confidence did not tell whole of burgo past history did not tell little episode in burgo life referred to lady glencora did make landlord understand that be willing to administer money to mr fitzgerald if only must only be administered judiciously ca keep out of gambling salon know sir be not if have franc in pocket a to that landlord be very confident be at last arranged that landlord be to tell burgo that bill did not signify at present that use of hotel be to be at burgo command for next three month at end of time be to have notice to quit money be to be advanced to landlord even in respect have discretion when get home will see what can be done with relation there said mr palliser then went home told wife will have clothes said lady glencora mr palliser said that judicious landlord must manage that also in way lady glencora be appeased appeased till something final must be done for young man on mr palliser return home poor burgo must now be made to end career a far a page be concerned soon found that something have be done for at hotel doubt must have made guess near truth discreet landlord told nothing must tell nothing that bill did not signify a yet burgo thinking about resolved to write about in indignant strain to mr palliser letter did not get written when in england mr palliser saw sir cosmo monk with many apology told what have done regret said sir cosmo in anger regret not for money sake regret amount expended be however repaid to mr palliser arrangement be made for remitting weekly sum of fifteen pound to burgo through member of diplomatic corp a long a must remain at certain small german town be indicated in there be public gambling table lady glencora expressed satisfied for present must doubt whether poor burgo lived long in comfort on allowance made to here must say farewell to burgo fitzgerald chapter lxxvii traveller return home mr palliser did not remain long in baden after payment of burgo bill perhaps will not throw undeserved discredit on courage if say that be afraid to do so what must have said what must have be able to say if young man have come to demanding explanation so hurried away to strasbourg same day much to wife satisfaction journey home from thence be not marked by incident gradually mr palliser became little more lenient to wife slightly le oppressive in caution if still inquired about spring of carriage did so in silence ceased to enjoin necessity of day rest after day journey by time that reached dover have become so used to wife condition that made little fluttering a walked out of boat by narrow gangway be so contrived a to make arrival there serious inconvenience to lady nuisance even to man be somewhat staggered when big man in middle of night insisted on opening little basket wife carried be uncomfortable when obliged to stop on plank while gave up ticket thought have be already surrendered be becoming used to position bore like man during journey home mr palliser have by mean kept seat opposite to lady glencora with constancy have soon found that be easier to talk to mr grey than to wife consequently two lady have be much together a have also two gentleman what lady discussed may be imagined one be about to become wife other mother be to be fate after have made up mind that such lot be to be hers may however be presumed that for one word alice spoke lady glencora spoke ten two men throughout day of close intimacy be intent upon politics mr palliser who may be regarded a fox who have lost tail tail being in instance comfort of domestic privacy be eager in recommending new friend to cut off tail also argument must be very well said if men be to be contented to live for only argument must be very well said other if be used to man who felt that must do good to others by going into public life be wholly inefficacious if recommends public life simply chiefly because man may gratify own ambition by public service of course there be personal gratification of course there be good done said mr palliser be must be said mr grey exactly two thing must go together chief gratification come from feeling that be of use if feel that must not be of use need not follow argument further know nature what between two such men must be said on side know that of must put matter altogether in true light men never can do so in word let light within be ever so clear think that man yet ever have such gift of word a to make perfect exponent of wisdom within effect be partly that weaker man of two desired weaker in gift of nature though art have in respect made stronger mr grey be shaken in quiescent philosophy startled alice startled a much a delighted by word two said a walked with in court of louvre be hollow here said speaking of french politics very hollow said alice who have love for french mode of carrying on public affair of mode of governing seems to to be surest of coming to downfall men be told that be wise enough to talk not wise enough to have power of action be a though men be cautioned that be walking through gunpowder that fire must be allowed be at same time enjoined to carry lucifer match in pocket believe in gunpowder think there must be fire plenty of if did want fire must have match be so odd to hear talk politics said alice laughing after dropped subject for while a though be ashamed of in very few minute returned to manfully mr palliser want to go into parliament upon hearing alice said nothing be afraid to speak after have passed felt that must not become to show much outward joy on hearing proposition so spoken by yet must say nothing without sign of exultation in voice so walked on without speaking be conscious that finger trembled on arm what do say about asked what do say oh john what right can have to say anything one else can have so much right putting aside of course who must be responsible for own action asked whether must afford seems to think that smaller income suffices for such work now than did few year since believe that must afford if must get seat be not very expensive at first outset must help there on point of course can have opinion no not on point believe may take for granted living in london for four five month in year might be managed a to mode of life then alice be unable to hold tongue longer spoke out thought with more vehemence than discretion doubt combated with amount of opposition seldom allowed out spoken enthusiasm to pas by without amount of hostility be not so perverse a to be driven from new view by fact that alice approved a drew near home be able to think that only flaw in character be in process of being cured when reached london separated be mr palliser purpose to take wife down to matching with a little delay a possible london be at time nearly empty doings of season be over be now first week of august a parliament have not be sitting for nearly two month town looked a usually look in september lady glencora be to stay one day in park lane have be understood between alice that be not to see other how odd be parting in way when people

girl on sand at yarmouth summer for last ten year about street of norwich winter have learned to regard a thing poor despicable because be common in eye be thus that cheesacres judge of people in spite of difficulty mr greenow have taken up poor charlie case kate vavasor expressed strong opinion that aunt must win what have done to man alice asked coaxed simply that have made so much master that doe know how to say to sometimes have thought that might possibly run away have abandoned that fear now have little confidence with from day to day be so alluring to that can not tear off in

be quite wonderful have always observed that when man can create kind of affection in bosom of man invariably be sort of man man in fact who make good husband alice knew story of charlie fairstairs hope knew of quarrel between bellfield cheesacre knew almost a much of bellfield past life a mr greenow did mr greenow be doubt aware that such be case nevertheless have pleasure in telling own story told a though believed word that spoke on following day two gentleman came over according to custom alice observed that miss fairstairs hardly spoke to mr cheesacre indeed manner of avoiding that gentleman be so very marked that be impossible not to observe drank tea out of door when mr cheesacre on one occasion sauntered across towards end of bench on charlie be sitting charlie got up walked away in strolling about place afterwards in going up through wood be at great pain to attach to other person so that there must be such attaching between owner of oileymead at one time mr cheesacre did get close up to spoke word very indifferent word knew that be being cut wanted to avoid appearance of scene know sir said charlie again moving away with excellent dignity at once attached to alice who be close by know have just come home from switzerland said charlie beautiful switzerland heart pant for switzerland do tell something about switzerland mr cheesacre have heard that alice be dear friend of lady who must probably day become duchess therefore naturally held in awe slunk away on occasion mr greenow clung lovingly to future husband effect be that mr cheesacre found to be very much alone unhappy have generally enjoyed day at vavasor hall having found fancied to be dominant spirit there that mr greenow be always in truth dominant spirit need hardly say knew how to make companion happy well also how to make wretched on whole of day poor cheesacre be very wretched think will go there more said to bellfield a drove gig back to penrith evening not go there more cheesy said

against view of case captain bellfield argued stoutly cheesacre have be offended throughout next day be cross touchy must play billiards on one occasion hinted that hoped must get that money soon did admirably dear said mr greenow night to charlie widow be now on term almost more confidential with miss fairstairs than with own niece kate vavasor loved little bit of intrigue though kate must

alone devoted a be always case on blank day to millinery household care mr greenow a have before be stated have taken lease of place trouble extended beyond mere bridal wardrobe large trunk of household linen have arrived linen be marked with name of greenow greenow greenow good deal have to be done before ancient wealth of housewifery must probably be converted to bellfield purpose must cut out piece jeannette work in again ever so carefully said widow after painful consideration will always show said jeannette shaking head other must show worse said widow if finedraw not one person in ten will notice 'd always put on with name to foot know be not quite true that cheesacre have bespoke dinner out in field although doubt thought have done so little treat if treat be have be arranged by mr greenow who be ever ready to create festivity there be not much scope for picnic here besides own party of course included captain mr cheesacre guest must be caught except clergyman low church clergyman who be so anxious about income with whom old squire have quarrelled mr greenow have quickly obtained advantage of alliance who be soon to perform on marriage ceremony have promised to grace little festival affair simply amounted to that be to eat dinner uncomfortably in field instead of comfortably in dining room mr greenow knew that charlie charm must be much strengthened by dinner out of door nothing said to kate nothing make man come forward so well a putting altogether out of usual tack man who must think of thing in drawing room must be sure to make offer if spent evening with young lady down stair in kitchen at two o'clock gig from penrith arrived at hall for next hour cheesacre captain be engaged in preparing table carrying out viand captain charlie fairstairs be going to lay cloth let do said cheesacre taking out of captain hand oh certainly said captain giving up prize captain bellfield must do much better said charlie with little toss of head

seeing that clergyman be there be just in time must have be very angry with have thought awkward have forgotten mr cheesacre sat on right hand clergyman on left hardly spoke word to bellfield sweetest smile be given to cheesacre be specially anxious to keep parson in good humour therefore illuminated once in five minute with passing ray full splendour of light be poured out upon cheesacre a never have before be poured how did flatter with what capacious gullet did swallow flattery oileymead be only paradise have ever seen ah when think of sometimes never mind moment came to when thought that even yet might win race send bellfield away howling into outer darkness moment came to widow saw moment well know have done for best said therefore will never regret at rate be done now not done yet said plaintively yes done done done besides man in position in county must always marry wife younger than good deal younger cheesacre did not understand argument liked allusion to position in county perceived that be too late for change in present arrangement be happy that feeling of animosity to alice have vanished from breast poor alice at rate be innocent with so much of own to fill mind have be little able to take share in greenow festivity may safely say that if mr cheesacre supremacy be on occasion attacked be not attacked by supremacy on occasion be paramount during dinner after dinner be allowed to give order to bellfield in manner must have gratified much must have glass of champagne with friend said mr greenow mr cheesacre drank other glass of champagne be not second third that have taken after dinner started off for ramble through field mr greenow mr cheesacre be together think that charlie fairstairs did not go with at think went into house washed face brushed hair settled

yours virgin heart may be yours if choose to accept oh bother if choose to take solicitude on behalf in way of course have done be good enough to say just now that wished to see husband in hospitable hall after have passed do think must be visitor at house unless there be mistress there upon word think might no mr cheesacre certainly not for sake must decline if be married be always wanting to marry mr greenow do do be only way in there can be friendship between not for world must lose advantage for husband let alone what may feel for why did take mr greenow if ca understand be not for to say anything more mr cheesacre if value warm affection of virgin heart why mr greenow yesterday must say word to not say word to be that know about be so ignorant that can not see when girl heart be

so very close that must feel sure that saw hook there be fish so silly that will take bait although know hook be there cheesacre understood many thing must not see must see that mr greenow be trying to catch a husband for charlie fairstairs knew also that have always despised charlie that worldly advantage must accrue to by marriage with girl there be did quite know how to avoid did look rather nice in clear starched muslin frock felt that must like to kiss need marry because kissed champagne have created desire also gave audacity gave one glance around to see that be not observed then did kiss charlie fairstairs under tree oh mr cheesacre said charlie oh mr cheesacre echoed laughing voice poor cheesacre looking round saw that mr greenow who ought to have be inside house looking after boiling water be moving about for unknown reason within sight of spot have chosen for dalliance mr cheesacre said charlie sobbing how dare do where world must see be only mr greenow said cheesacre what will think of lord bless wo think anything about do think great deal about know what to do whereupon charlie got up from seat under tree began to move away slowly cheesacre thought about for moment two must follow must not knew that have better not follow knew that be bait with very visible hook knew that be big fish for whom two woman be angling after perhaps must do much harm to be caught so got up followed suppose meant to take way towards wood towards little path leading to old summer house up in tree be too much beside to know where be going doubt be path did take before long cheesacre be in summerhouse together sam somebody really will be coming well then there now wo do again 't be thus spoke when last kiss be given on occasion unless there may have be one two later in
