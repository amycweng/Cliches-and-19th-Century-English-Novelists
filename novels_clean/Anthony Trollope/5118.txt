horse be standing then consultation be held a to what must do next there be who thought that hound must be taken home for day be a though special friend of u r u have died that morning that spirit of sportsman be too dejected for sport others with prudent foresight suggested that hound might run back from distant covert to dillsborough that there must be hunting till wood have be thoroughly searched stranger especially who have hired horse must not hear of after considerable delay be arranged that hound must be trotted off a quickly a possible to impington gorse be on other side of impington park fully five mile distant so started leaving dead fox in hand of bean gamekeeper be sort of thing occurs day asked senator a got back into carriage must fancy not answered morton somebody

what be man name morton have heard name have forgotten will find man out have conversation with mr morton respect that man mr morton be one against two hundred insists upon right men standing round wiping eye stifled with grief because fox have be poisoned a though great patriot have died among in service of country formed one of most remarkable phenomenon sir that ever beheld in country when get among own people in mickewa tell that wo believe sir in meantime cavalcade be hurrying away to impington gorse john morton feeling that have not have opportunity a yet of showing american friend best side of hunting went with five mile be five long mile a pace be not above seven mile hour nearly hour be occupied there be therefore plenty of opportunity for senator to inquire whether gentleman around be a yet enjoying sport there be air of triumph about a to misfortune of day joined to battery of continued raillery made almost impossible for morton to keep temper asked whether be not at rate better than trotting pair of horse backwards forward over same mile of road for day a be custom in state senator though did not quite approve of trotting match argued that there be infinitely more of skill ingenuity in american pastime everybody be so gloomy said senator lighting third cigar have be watching that young man in pink boot for last half hour have spoken word to one perhaps be stranger said morton be way treat be past two when hound be put into gorse certainly one be in very good humour trot of five mile be disagreeable two o'clock in november be late for finding first fox then poisoning be vice may grow into habit there be general feeling that goarly ought to be extinguished idea that might be difficult to extinguish whip nevertheless cantered on to corner of covert tony put in hound with cheery voice senator remarked that gorse be very little place for a be on side of opposite hill must see lord rufford who be standing by carriage explained to that be favourite resort of fox difficult to draw a being very close perhaps have poisoned too said senator be evident from voice have such be case must not have be among mourner blackguard be not yet thick enough in country for said lord rufford meaning to be sarcastic then whimper be heard from hound at first very low then growing into fuller sound there be said young hampton for heaven sake get fellow away from side glomax be uttered with so much vehemence that senator looked up in surprise then captain galloped round side of covert making use of strong language stopped ardour of certain gentleman who be in hurry to get away on what considered good term lord rufford hampton larry twentyman others sat stock still on horse watching gorse ned botsey urged little forward down hill be creeping on when captain glomax asked whether must be so obliging kind a to remain where be for minute ned took observation in good part stopped horse doe do that cursing swearing for l asked senator fox traversed gorse back from side to side from corner to corner again again there be two side certainly at might break though came out more than once must not be got to go away will kill now before break said elder botsey

hand gate through be expedient to pas in minute score of men be jostling for way among whom be two botseys friend runciman larry twentyman with kate master on pony close behind young hampton jumped very nasty fence by side of wicket lord rufford followed score of elderly men with young men among too turned back into lane behind having watched long enough to see that be to take lane to left not lane to right after there be time enough for when men have got through hand gate hound be hardly free of covert tony riding up side of hill opposite be still blowing horn be off at last bulk of field got away on good term with hound now be hunting said mr morton to senator seemed to be very angry with other at narrow gate be in hurry suppose two of jumped over hedge why did jump how long will be now before catch very probably may not catch at not catch after then man be certainly right to poison that other fox in wood how long will go on hour perhaps call that hunting be worth while of men to expend energy for result upon whole mr morton must say that be one of most incomprehensible thing have ever seen in course of rather long varied life shooting can understand for have bird fishing can understand a have fish here get fox to begin with be broken hearted then come across after riding about day chance be ca catch suppose said mr morton angrily habit of one country be incomprehensible to people of when see american loafing about in bar room of hotel be lost in amazement there be not man see who must give reason for being there have object in view though perhaps may be no better than to rob neighbour here there seems to be possible motive chapter xi from impington gorse fox ran straight from covert through well known haunt to impington park a hound be astray there for two three minute there be general idea that too have got up into tree must have amused senator very much have senator be there have country pace be adapted to wheel senator paragon be now returning along

goarly have risen in importance since day on saturday bean with couple of men employed by lord rufford have searched wood found four five red herring poisoned with strychnine there have be no doubt about magnitude of offence on monday detective policeman dressed of course in rustic disguise not le known to one in place be wandering about between dillsborough dillsborough wood making futile inquiry a to purchase of strychnine also a to purchase of red herring one knew such leading people a runciman dr nupper be not slow to declare that dillsborough be only place in england in one might be sure that article have not be purchased on tuesday began to be understood that goarly have applied to bearside other attorney in reference to claim against lord rufford pheasant have contemptuously refused s d acre offered put demand at s a to poisoned fox herring strychnine goarly declared that did care if there be twenty detective in place stated to be opinion that larry twentyman have put down poison be very well goarly said for larry to be fond of gentleman to ride to hound make pretence larry liked turkey a well a anybody else larry have put down poison in matter goarly overreached one in dillsborough must be brought to believe that even harry stubbings be ready to swear that must suspect a soon nothing be clearer than goarly be going to make stand against hunt especially against lord rufford have gone to bearside bearside have taken up matter in serious way then became known very quickly that bearside have already received money be surmised that goarly have one at back lord rufford have lately ejected from house of on other side of county discontented litigious retired grocer from rufford who have made money have set up in pretty little residence with few acre of land man have made objectionable have be dispossessed man name be scrobby hence have come sorrow be story have already made known in dillsborough on tuesday evening up to time not tittle of evidence have come to light a to purchase of red herring strychnine be known be fact have not tony tuppett stopped hound before reached wood there must have be terrible mortality be that nasty beastly drunken club said mr master to husband of course be at time known to lady that husband have thrown away goarly business that have be transferred to bearside be also surmised by a be by town in general that goarly business must come to considerable dimension just sort of case a must have be sure to bring popularity if carried through a nickem senior clerk must have carried a soon a scrobby name be heard by mr master there be end to money in lady imagination to very case might not have amounted club have nothing to do with dear what time did come home on saturday night sunday morning mean do mean to tell did settle there there be nastiness beastliness drunkenness about told before went must take did how on earth be to go on if chuck child bread out of mouth in way wo believe do ask what sort of man goarly be attorney knew that larry be in great favour with wife a being favoured suitor for mary hand have thought that argument must be very strong want mr twentyman to teach what be proper for family yet to teach business mr twentyman have own way of living brought home kate other day with hardly rag of sister habit left go out hunting more very well dear indeed for matter of see how of be to do anything what will lord rufford do for want lord rufford to do anything for attorney be beginning to have spirit stirred within want anybody to do anything yet will hing just because set of drinking fellow in tap room call club be tap room be worse because nobody can see what be doing know how be have pluck to hold to own when runciman told not there be spice of truth in made more bitter runciman know on side bread be buttered can make money out of swearing tearing fellow can send in bill get paid too be very well for larry twentyman to be hobbing nobbing with like of botseys for father of family like to be put off business by what mr runciman say be shame will manage business a think fit said attorney when be in poor house what will do then said mr master with handkerchief out at spur of moment whenever roused husband to state of bellicose ire by taunt must always reduce again by tear being well aware of must bear taunt a long a must knowing that tear must be still worse be so soft hearted that when affected to be miserable must not maintain sternness of demeanour leave in misery when everything have gone away from be to do little bit of money have disappeared ever so long then sat down in chair have great cry be useless for to remind that hitherto have never wanted anything for herself child be resolved that everything be going to dog because goarly case have be refused what will sporting men do for repeated very name of gentleman so do wish goarly have killed fox in county nasty vermin what good be like of nickem senior clerk be at first made almost a unhappy a mr master by weak decision to employer have come have in first flush of anger resolved to leave office be sure that case be one must just have suited must have got up evidence a to fertility of land enormous promise of crop ultimate absolute barrenness to marvel must have proved cloud of pheasant then goarly humble position futile industry general poverty might have be contrasted beautifully with lord rufford wealth idleness devotion to sport anything above s d acre obtained against lord must have be triumph thought that if thing have be well managed might probably have got s then in case lord rufford must hardly have taxed cost be really suicide for attorney to throw away business so excellent a now have gone to bearside whom nickem remembered a junior to when be young hobbledehoy at norrington dirty blear eyed pimply faced boy who be suspected of purloining halfpenny out of coat pocket thing be very trying to nat nickem suddenly before wednesday be over idea have occurred to be almost content knew goarly have heard of scrobby scrobby history in regard to tenement at rufford a must not get goarly case why must not make something of case against goarly detective be merely eking out time having idle week among public house if must set up a amateur detective thought that might perhaps get to bottom of be not bad thing to be concerned on same side with lord when lord be in earnest lord rufford be very angry about poison in covert must probably be ready to pay very handsomely for having criminal found punished criminal of course be goarly nickem did not doubt that for moment must not have doubted side might have taken nickem did not suppose that one for moment really doubted goarly guilt to eye such certainty amounted to nothing if evidence of crime be not forthcoming probably felt within own bosom that last judgment of must depend in way on terrestrial evidence be quite sure that be by such that man conscience must be affected if goarly have so done deed a to be beyond possibility of detection nickem must not have brought to regard goarly a sinner a be have considerable respect for goarly might not be possible to drop down upon scrobby bearside with case against lord must be nowhere if goarly must be got to own that have be suborned by scrobby to put down poison if in default of close communication must be proved between goarly scrobby scrobby injury spirit of revenge being patent then too bearside must not have much of case jury must look at question of damage with very different eye if scrobby spirit of revenge must be proved at trial also poisoning also machination between scrobby goarly nickem be little red haired man about forty who wrote good flourishing hand must endure immense amount of work drink large amount of alcohol without being drunk nose face be over blotch looked to be dissipated disreputable a often boasted one must say that black be white of eye by meant to insinuate that have not be

of goarly did not particularly wish to be present at rufford hall with trefoil lady hitherto have received very little satisfaction from visit to bragton so little that have be more than once on verge of asking arabella whether wished to be relieved from engagement have never quite given opportunity have always be gracious to in cold disagreeable glassy manner in manner that irked spirit still did not justify in expressing anger lady augustus be almost uncivil to from time to time said little thing be hard to bear be not going to marry lady augustus must revenge against by resolving in own breast that must have a little a possible to do with after marriage be condition of mind towards in condition did not want to take to lord rufford house visit to must be over on monday must thought be better for that must then go on way to gore a have proposed did not like to answer letter by refusal without saying word to guest on subject must not object to ignore senator be afraid that if nothing be to be said to arabella must hear of hereafter must complain of such treatment therefore directed that man might be kept waiting while consulted lady of choice be with difficulty that found alone with then only by sending maid in quest of did get at last into own sitting room then having placed in chair near fire gave lord rufford letter to read what can be said looking up into face with great inexpressive eye have required solemnity still looked up at did not even open letter did not like to answer without showing to suppose must care to go go where be from lord rufford for monday from

before made answer have very quickly resolved that invitation must be accepted must suit very well to know lady penwether might possibly suit still better to become intimate with lord rufford be delighted at idea of riding lord rufford horse a eye dwelt on paper too began to think that invitation have be chiefly given on account at rate must go have understood perfectly well from first tone of lover voice that did not wish to subject to allurement of rufford hall be clever enough must read did not mean to throw away chance for sake of pleasing must not at once displease by declaring purpose strongly therefore a slowly continued reading resolved that must throw burden upon mother have not better show to mamma said can if please be going to gore on monday must not go earlier might put off for couple of day if pleased must bore mind about be not very great man for dance 'd sooner write report must about product of country great deal sooner said paragon see have of got product to

because be here must say so suppose lord rufford must care to know mr morton lady penwether go everywhere doe everywhere must suit to 't ' to get on to lady penwether book mamma of course be not that if lord rufford must say word be so much easier to manage down in country than up in london have l year if have penny how many girl have tried same thing with mind have always said that john morton bragton must not do mamma have be first to say must do only said that if there be nothing else oh mamma how can say such thing nothing else a if be last man said distinctly that bragton be l year that must do very well may change mind if like be good trying to back out of own doings then have changed mind yes without thinking what have to go through be not going to throw at lord rufford head so a to lose chance here will go see how land lie of course will go mamma if think be for advantage dear advantage be part of work to be done may a well do at rate will tell to accept will have odious american with ca be helped old woman lord rufford doe say anything about suppose be such muff what can leave grandmother behind for couple of day then went back to morton told that mother be particularly anxious to make acquaintance of lady penwether that have decided upon going to rufford hall will be very nice opportunity said for to become acquainted with lord rufford then be almost angry can make plenty of such opportunity for when want said of course if lady augustus like will go let stand on right bottom may stand on bottom please do mean to ride man horse certainly do never refuse good offer why must ride man horse did never hear before of young lady borrowing gentleman horse lady belonging to will ever do so unless gentleman be very close friend indeed lady in case doe not belong to mr morton therefore if have other objection will ride lord rufford horse perhaps will not think too much trouble to signify lady acceptance of mount in letter then swam out of room knowing that left in anger after that have to find mr gotobed going be now decided on a far a be concerned must make very little difference whether american went not except that letter must have be easier to in accepting invitation for three person than for four senator be of course willing be senator object to see england lord rufford house must be additional bit of england senator must be delighted to have opportunity of saying what thought about goarly at lord rufford table after before weary letter must be written be compelled to see grandmother explain to that have be omitted of course ma'be did not know that be at bragton a be not in carriage at beeet be nonsense john did lord rufford suppose that be entertaining lady here without one to be mistress of house of course knew that be here must have gone may be sure of be not in habit of going to house of people know indeed think be impertinence in to ask in way be surprised that must go on invitation trefoil knew if lady penwether knew why must not lady penwether ask independently of believe ever spoke to lady penwether in life lord rufford miss trefoil may very likely be london acquaintance may admire therefore choose to have at ball know nothing about that a far a be concerned be quite welcome to keep be not very pleasant to john morton knew already that grandmother lady augustus hated other said spiteful thing not only behind other back openly to other face now have be told by girl who be engaged to be wife that did not belong to by grandmother who stood to in place of mother that wished that girl belonged to one else be not quite sure that did not wish even be to be so must there be reason for to be gratified at escape still did not relish idea of taking girl to other man house wrote letter however dispatched even writing of be difficult disagreeable when various detail of hospitality have be offered by comparative stranger man hardly like to accept in case have to do must be delighted said to stay at rufford hall from monday to wednesday lady augustus miss trefoil must also be delighted so also must mr gotobed be delighted miss trefoil must be further delighted to accept lord rufford offer of horse for tuesday a for if rode at horse must come for to meet then wrote note to mr harry stubbings bespeaking mount for occasion on evening party at bragton be not very pleasant one doubt be intimate with lady penwether lady augustus said mr morton now lady penwether be very fashionable woman whom to know be considered honour what make ask ma'be said lady augustus only a be taking daughter to brother house a be bachelor dear mr morton really may leave to take care of myself of daughter too have lived so much out of world for last thirty year that be quite amusing there be person world that be great deal better for lady to be out of said mr morton then lady augustus put up hand turned round affected to laugh of thing mr gotobed who be studying english society made note in own mind what sort of position doe that man goarly occupy here senator asked immediately after dinner position at said morton man created hold position a take land be own have believe about fifty acre yet seems to be in lowest depth of poverty ignorance of course mismanages property probably drink dare say mr morton be proud of right talked of father grandfather yet doubt whether must find man so squalid so ignorant in state suppose be injured by having lord so near contrary if must be amenable mean if must be creature of lord why be that other man so uncivil to man who be lord gamekeeper because went there a friend of goarly be idea of english fair play asked senator with jeer truth be mr gotobed said morton endeavouring to explain see part only not whole that man goarly be rascal so everybody say why ca believe everybody so everybody say on lord side before be done will find out what people say on other side can see that be ignorant squalid very probably be lord fault may be that be rascal that lord be to blame for too if lord pheasant have eaten up goarly corn lord ought to pay for corn whether goarly be rascal not then john morton made up mind that must never ask american senator to house chapter xviii attorney family be disturbed on wednesday evening mary master said nothing to of family a to invitation from lady ushant very much wished to accept latterly for last month two distaste to kind of life for stepmother be preparing have increased upon greatly there have be day in have doubted whether might not be expedient that must accept mr twentyman offer believed ill of thought to be fine manly young fellow with good heart high principle never asked whether be be not gentleman have never even inquired of whether be be not especially lady with effort to like man because thought that by doing so must relieve please father yet be distasteful to now since walk home with from bragton bridge be more distasteful than ever did not tell that short visit say for month to cheltenham must prevent further attention felt that there must be temporary escape think that dwelt much on suggestion that reginald morton must be companion on journey idea of such companionship even for short time be pleasant to if did surely then must forgive for having left at bridge have much to think of before must resolve how must tell tidings must show letter first to stepmother to father in ordinary course of thing in house former course must be expected be mr master who managed everything affecting family be who gave permission denied permission for indulgence be generally fair to three girl taking special pride to herself for doing duty by stepdaughter on very account be more likely to be angry if mary passed by on occasion a went to father must stepmother have once refused permission then matter must have be decided against must be quite useless to appeal from stepmother to father must such appeal come within scope of own principle morton especially lady ushant have be father friend in old day thought that perhaps might prevail in case if must speak to father first knew well what must be great rather real objection mother must not wish that must be removed so long from larry twentyman there might be difficulty about clothes father knew must be kind to at last made up mind that must ask father be always at office desk for hour in morning before clerk have come on following day minute two after have taken seat knocked at door be busy reading letter from lord rufford man of business asking certain question about goarly almost employing to get up case on lord rufford behalf there be certain triumph to in be not by mean that tidings have reached lord rufford of refusal to undertake goarly case runciman who be often allowed by lordship

remembered that something be due to eldest child in way of garment relaxation never like to be expense papa be very good about dear see why must go be very kind of lady ushant will talk to mamma then mary went away to get breakfast fearing that before long there must be black look in house mr master at once went up to wife having given minute two to calculate that must let mary have twenty pound

got friend said going back to mary proposed visit of course have got friend if will only take up with a ought to do why doe go on shilly willying with young man instead of closing upon at once if did

turn up nose at directly want anything for herself know what be fit for mary ai fit that must go trapesing away to cheltenham doing nothing in old woman parlour losing chance for life who be to suppose that larry twentyman will go on dangling after in way month after month young man want wife of course will get one ca make marry man if like like ought to be made to like young man well off a

ready to acknowledge to that present wife be good helpful companion to careful mother to child there be moment in must remember with soft regret different phase of life just at present be somewhat angry resolving in own mind that in case must have own way then will tell may said mr master with look of dogged determination hope will hing of kind dear have told that will have few pound to get what want wo have disappointed after mr master bounced out of room made very disagreeable indeed over tea thing whole household be much disturbed that day mr master said nothing to mary about lady ushant morning said great deal about other thing poor mary be asked whether be not ashamed to treat young man a be treating mr twentyman then again be demanded of whether thought right that house must be knocked about for at dinner mr master must hardly speak to husband addressed exclusively to dolly kate mr master be not man who must usually stand kind of thing very long be accustomed to give up

at dinner called husband mr master when helped to stew afternoon averred that head be splitting managed to say many very bitter thing about gentleman in general expressed vehement hope that poor man goarly must get at least hundred pound must be owned however at time have heard nothing of lord rufford commission to husband in evening larry came in be at once told terrible news larry said kate

attorney have learned a much a mr bearside chose to tell of fact of case took place on saturday morning interview be on whole satisfactory to senator then having theory of own in head being fond of ventilating own theory explained thoroughly to man story wished to hear before man be called upon to tell story mr bearside of course told accordingly goarly be very poor man very ignorant be perhaps not altogether so good member of society a might have be doubt have strong case against lord lord so said mr bearside have fallen into way of paying certain recompense in certain case for crop damaged by game having in way laid down rule for did not choose to have rule disturbed just feudalism said indignant senator better yet worse than sir said attorney who did not in least know what feudalism be strong hand backed by strong rank strong purse determined to have own way continued senator most determined man be lordship said attorney then senator expressed hope that mr bearside must be able to see poor man through mr bearside explained to senator that poor man be very poor man indeed who have be so unfortunate with land that be hardly able to provide bread for child went so far a to insinuate that be taking up matter solely on score of charity adding that a must not of course afford to be money out of pocket for expense of witness c did not quite see how be to proceed then senator made certain promise be said going back to london in course of next week did not mind making responsible to extent of fifty dollar if thing be carried on bona fide to conclusion mr bearside declared that must of course be bona fide asked senator for address must mr gotobed object to putting name to little docket certifying to amount promised mr gotobed gave address thought that in such matter a word might be trusted if be not trusted then offer might fall to ground mr bearside be profuse in apology declared that gentleman word be a good a bond mr gotobed made secret of doings perhaps have feeling that must not justify in so strange proceeding without absolute candour saw mr mainwaring in street a left bearside office told about just want sir to see what will come of will lose fifty dollar mr gotobed only cause little vexation to high spirited young nobleman very likely sir loss of dollar lord rufford slight vexation will in least disturb rest be not rich man sir must like to watch way in question will be tried brought to conclusion in aristocratic country quite know what law may be mr mainwaring just same a own mr gotobed take have game law sir a be saying understand law justice be same everywhere if great lord game have eaten up poor man wheat great lord ought to pay for owner of game pay for damage do three time over said parson who be very strongly on side of question do think that such men a goarly must be better off if gentry be never to come into country at perhaps mr mainwaring may think that there must be goarlys if there be ruffords that however be great question can not be argued on case can hope here be that one poor man may have act of justice done though in seeking for have to struggle against so wealthy magnate a lord rufford what hope be that may be found out replied mr mainwaring with equal enthusiasm then will be in rufford gaol before long be justice look for who do think put down poison in dillsborough wood how be that poor woman lost goose asked senator be paid for great many more than lost mr gotobed doe touch upon injustice of proceeding who assessed loss sir who valued goose be to keep pet tiger in garden give couple of dollar when destroys pet dog think justified because dog a rule be not worth more than two dollar have right to own goose on own ground lord rufford sir a take said runciman who have be allowed to come up hear end of conversation have right to own fox in own covert yes if must keep there friend a be nature of fox to wander away to be thief have such right of course sir begging pardon said runciman be speaking of england runciman have heard of senator gotobed a indeed have dillsborough by time be speaking of justice world over said senator slapping hand upon thigh only want to see may be england be country in poor man must not attempt to hold few acre of land on night dillsborough club met a usual a matter of course goarly american senator be subject chiefly discussed everybody in room knew thought that knew that goarly be cheating fraudulent knave that lord rufford be at rate in case acting properly understood old goose be aware nearly to bushel of amount of wheat man have sold off two field runciman knew that interest on mortgage have be paid must only have be paid out of produce larry twentyman knew that if goarly took s d acre must be better off than if wood have not be there yet among did quite see how be to confute senator logic must not answer satisfactorily even among felt that if goarly must be detected in offence must confute senator among be sufficient to

during time not word have be said of john morton master of bragton man to whose party new comer belonged lady augustus arabella clearly understood that john morton be only peg on invitation to have be hung feeling that be so grew upon with word be spoken also conviction that must be treated like peg at rufford sight of hanging of room so different to old fashioned dingy curtain at bragton brilliancy of mirror decoration of place very blaze from big grate forced upon girl feeling conviction that be proper sphere here be being made much of a new comer here if possible must remain everything smiled on with gilded dimple be smile valued a softness of cushion sank into heart mellow nothingness from well trained voice greeted ear air of wealth idleness floated about cheek imagination rose within assured that must secure something better than bragton caution with have armed faded away be kind of thing for have be striving a girl of spirit be not worth while to make effort even though there might be danger aut caesar aut nihil knew nothing about caesar before tardy wheel brought senator mr morton have stopped at door have declared to herself that must be lady rufford fresh party be of course brought into drawing room tea be offered arabella hardly spoke to lady augustus did not speak to at be shown up to bedroom with very little preliminary conversation be

horseback be that suited for pacing horse of california mexico then assured sir john purefoy eighty mile day be great journey for pacing horse with man of fourteen stone saddle accoutrement weighing four more major countenance when senator declared that englishman must ride be sight worth seeing that evening even in drawing room conversation be chiefly about horse hunting terrible enemy goarly scrobby lady penwether miss penge who did hunt be distantly civil to lady augustus of whom of course woman so much in world a lady penwether knew something lady penwether have shrugged shoulder when consulted a to special guest have expressed hope that rufford be going to make goose of be fond of brother a lady purefoy miss penge be special friend of hers a have also be allowed to invite couple of godolphin girl to whom wished to be civil did a be asked girl said to miss penge that evening be handsome penniless flirt mother declared to be regular old soldier a to lady augustus be right have perhaps failed to read arabella character correctly arabella trefoil be certainly not flirt in horsey conversation arabella joined low clear slow voice must be heard now then a though be really animated with subject at bragton have never once spoken a though matter have interested during time morton fell into conversation first with lady purefoy then with two miss godolphins afterwards for few minute with lady penwether who knew that be county gentleman respectable member of diplomatic profession during whole evening ear be intent on note of arabella voice also during whole evening eye

arabella be very angry though hardly knew why with whom girl when be engaged be not supposed to talk to one recognised lover in mixed party of lady gentleman be especially absolved from such duty when chance to meet in house of comparative stranger in such house among such people be natural that talk must be about hunting a girl have accepted loan of horse be natural that must join in such conversation have never sat for moment apart with lord rufford be impossible to say that have flirted with man yet morton felt that be neglected felt also that be only there because pleasure seeking young lord have liked to have in house handsome girl whom morton intended to marry felt thoroughly ashamed of being there a be in train of miss trefoil be almost disposed to get up declare that girl

be discouraged whole thing must be failure request be made by lady penwether because miss penge have said that thought impossible for to dance poor miss penge who be generally regarded a brilliant

opportunity enough doubt be handsome doubt loved after fashion of loving to lose now must not break heart whereas to lose after be married to must knew well bring to very ground must ask question two

seat in house of lord mr gotobed of course will see if wish will take note of if will do mr green will be fixed up straight 'd great deal sooner see than lordship be very flattering mr gotobed be sure know why because lord drummond always seems to to have more on hand than know how to get through never seem to have anything to do be not quite so flattering must be killing only that feel that opinion be founded on error men conscia rectus mr gotobed exactly understand english pretty well better a far a can see than of meet around here go beyond mr green merely meant to observe mr gotobed that a within own breast be conscious of zeal diligence in majesty service shaft of satire pas by without hurting will offer cigar candle burned at end be soon consumed be quite clear that a quickly a senator got through one end of cigar by usual process of burning so quickly did eat other end took that mounser green offered without displeasure at allusion be sorry to say have spittoon said mounser green whole fire place be at service senator must hardly have heard a made difference in practice morton at moment be sent for by secretary of state senator expressed intention of waiting for in mr green room how doe great goarly case get on mr gotobed asked clerk well know that be getting on very much be not growing tired of senator not by mean be getting complicated mr green mean to see end of if be beat why can take beating a well a man begin to think will be beat did say so mr green be very hard to understand in out of case like in foreign country then must try senator there differ be object to learn can at rate must pay for lesson a be like to do what will bill be four hundred dollar never mind mr green if will take opinion of good deal older man than one who have perhaps worked harder will understand that there be knowledge got so thoroughly a for man pay soon after morton came out from great man room went away in company with senator chapter ii senator letter soon after senator gotobed went down alone to dillsborough put up at bush inn although have by mean reputation of being rich man did not seem to care much what money spent in furthering object have taken in hand never knew how near have be to meeting direst inhospitality at mr runciman house that worthy innkeeper knowing well senator sympathy with goarly scrobby bearside being heart soul devoted to rufford interest have almost refused senator accommodation wanted be only when mr runciman represented to that must charge ten shilling day for use of sitting room also that lord rufford have condescended to entertain gentleman runciman gave way mr gotobed must no doubt have delighted in such inhospitality must have gone to second rate inn be very second rate indeed have acquired further insight into british manner british prejudice a be made at home in best upstairs sitting room at bush be quite unaware of indignity offered to when mr runciman refused to send up best sherry let hope that refusal be remembered by young woman in bar when made out senator bill stayed at dillsborough for three four day during saw goarly once bearside on two three occasion moreover handed to busy attorney three bank note for l bearside be clever enough to make believe that goarly must certainly obtain serious damage from lord with bearside be fairly satisfied thinking however that man be much more illiterate ignorant than general run of lawyer in united state with goarly be by mean satisfied goarly endeavoured to keep out of way must not be induced to come to at bush three time walked out to house near dillsborough wood on of occasion mr goarly pestered for money told at great length history of forlorn goose scrobby of whom have heard must not see at found that bearside be very unwilling to say anything about scrobby scrobby red herring strychnine dead fox be according to bearside to be kept quite distinct from pheasant wheat bearside declared over over again that there be evidence to connect client with demise of fox when asked whether did not think that client have compassed death of animal assured senator that in such matter never ventured to think let go by evidence mr gotobed said be paying money for sake of getting at fact evidence be fact sir said attorney way let settle about pheasant first condition of senator mind may perhaps be best made known by letter wrote from dillsborough to especial well trusted friend josiah scroome member of house of representative from own state of mickewa since have be in england have written constantly to friend giving result of british experience bush inn dillsborough ufford county england december dear sir since last have enjoyed very well be trust beginning to understand something of mode of thinking of very peculiar people that there must be so wide difference between american english from whom be divided so to say other day be one of most peculiar physiological phenomenon that history of world will have afforded a far a can hear german even frenchman think much more a englishman think than doe american doe come mainly from greater prevalence with of democratic institution think that one can perceive in hour conversation difference between swiss german fancy may say flatter that american be a easily distinguished from englishman a sheep from goat tall man from one who be short yet there be pleasure in

self consciousness of better class of citizen there be story of old hero who with companion fell among beautiful woman luscious wine that hero have be warned in time must have be turned into filthy animal by yielding to allurement around temptation here be perhaps same be not hero though too have be warned by lesson have learned under happy constitution feel might easily become one of animal in

not very happy a to goarly business have paid money have half promised more have found out that be in boat with thoroughly disreputable person a have said to landlord man may have right on side in action at law though be knave rascal if lord be unjust to poor man poor man must have justice done even though be not quite pattern poor man now be led to believe by what landlord have said to that be being kept in dark that there be fact generally known that did not know have learned something of english manner english institution by interference there might be question whether be not paying too dearly for whistle there be growing upon feeling before have done must have to blush for colleague a omnibus went away dr nupper joined mr runciman under archway be blessed if can understand man said runciman what be be after notoriety said doctor with air of man who have completely solved difficult question will have to pay for that pretty smart said runciman never heard of such foolish thing in

goarly be what understand notoriety said doctor evidently know nickem have got round goarly said landlord chapter iii at cheltenham month at cheltenham be passed very quietly must have be very happy month with mary master that there grew upon from day to day increasing fear of what must have to undergo when returned to dillsborough at moment when be hesitating with larry twentyman when begged to wait six month then at last promised to give answer at end of two have worked up to think that might possibly be duty to accept lover for sake of family at rate have at moment thought that question of duty ought to be further considered therefore have vacillated when two month delay be accorded to within period privilege of long absence from dillsborough put trouble aside for while with common feeling that chapter of accident might do something for before have reached cheltenham chapter of accident have done much when reginald morton told that must not have congratulated on such prospect have explained to why in truth have be angry at bridge how have be anxious to be alone with that might learn whether be really engaged to man then have known that answer to larry twentyman at end of two month must be positive refusal a became aware of new trouble arose harassed very soul when have asked for six month have not at moment be aware have not then felt that girl who asks for time be supposed to have already surrendered since have made that unhappy request conviction have grown upon have read in word stepmother said to in father manner very wink hint little joke fell from younger sister told that be so must see around satisfaction have come from settlement of difficult question satisfaction be perhaps more apparent with father than even with others then knew what have done remembered to have heard that girl who express doubt be supposed to have gone beyond doubting while be still at dillsborough there be feeling that evil must arise from if must at last make up mind to be mr twentyman when settled conviction came upon after hearing reginald morton word then be much troubled stayed only couple of day at cheltenham during time said very little to certainly spoke word must give right to think that be attached to have be interested about a be aunt lady ushant because have be known mother have be known by old morton there be nothing of love in that have never supposed that there must be yet there be vague feeling in bosom that a have be strong in expressing objection to mr twentyman there might have be something more to stir than memory of old day at bragton to thinking there be sweetness about have never seen equalled in young woman be said by lady ushant to nephew after mary have gone to bed on night before left one must suppose answered that wanted to ask to be wife never want anything of kind reg never make in such matter mar if can help there be man at dillsborough want to marry can easily believe that there must be two three who be man do remember old twentyman of chowton be near neighbour of course remember can remember well when bought land be son surely can hardly be worthy of reg yet say be very worthy have asked about be not bad fellow keep money have idea of living decently doe drink gamble be not gentleman anything like one must think never open book of course must be degradation what doe mary say fancy have refused then added after pause indeed know have how must know have told in answer to only nodded head at old lady there must have be close friendship reg between two when told that hope have not made give up one suitor by leading to love who doe not mean to ask certainly have not done that said reg men may often do much without knowing that do anything such probably have be case with reginald morton during journey from dillsborough to cheltenham what must father wish want to take man how can do better must have marry man who be not gentleman whose wife will never be visited by other lady in marrying whom must go altogether down into lower world be matter on lady ushant nephew have conversed often thought knew to be thoroughly wedded to privilege believed to be attached to birth with same feeling be almost stronger because be so well aware of blot upon caused by lowness of own father marriage man held must raise woman to own rank whereas woman must accept level of husband bread meat chair table be very serious thing reg must then recommend to take man pas altogether out of own sphere what can do for be old woman who will be dead probably before first five year of married life have passed over a for recommending know enough to recommend anything doe like man be sure must feel degraded by marrying trust will never live to feel degraded believe that must do anything that thought must degrade think that have better leave to herself in matter further on in same evening rather late in night for have then sat talking together for hour over fire made direct statement to when die reg have l to leave behind have divided between will not tell because might do more harm than good may know must make difference to said very likely not wish to know trouble be that will have to pay so much out of for legacy duty might leave to must give honester more religious better woman than old lady ushant there be not in cheltenham never crossed conscience that must be wrong to cheat revenue may be doubted whether woman have ever be brought to such honesty a on next morning morton went away without saying word in private to mary master be left to quiet life with old lady to ordinary visitor nothing must have be le exciting for lady ushant very seldom went out never entertained company be tall thin old lady with bright eye grey hair face be still pretty in spite of sunken eye sunken cheek wrinkled brow there be ever present with air of melancholy told whole tale of sadness of long life chief excitement be in two visit to church on sunday in letter wrote week to nephew at dillsborough now have young friend with that too be excitement to more so since have heard tidings of larry twentyman courtship made up mind that must not speak on subject to young friend unless young friend must speak to in first three week nothing be said four five day before mary departure there came up conversation about dillsborough bragton there have be many conversation about dillsborough bragton in of name of lawrence twentyman have be scrupulously avoided have longed to name yet have determined not to do so at length be avoided no longer lady ushant have spoken of chowton farm widow then mary have spoken of place inhabitant mr twentyman come great deal to house now said have reason dear go with papa once week to club sometimes lends sister kate pony kate be very fond of riding there be nothing else have got to be intimate think mamma like be good young man then very good said mary with emphasis chowton belongs to oh yes belongs to young men make such duck drake of property when get say that be not like at people say that understands farming very well that mind everything what excellent young man there be other reason for coming to house mary then sluice gate be opened whole story be told sitting there late into night mary told a well a knew how of except in regard to spark of love might have fallen upon in respect of reginald morton of reginald morton in story of course did not speak rest declared did not love man be quite sure of though thought so well of there be be quite sure feeling in heart akin to love have promised to take time because have thought that might perhaps be able to bring to marry without loving to marry because father wished because going from home must be relief to stepmother sister because must be well for that must be settled out of way since have made up mind thought that have quite made up mind that must be impossible there be nobody else mary said lady ushant putting hand on to mary lap mary protested that there be nobody else without consciousness that be telling falsehood be quite sure that can not do do think that ought lady ushant must be very sorry to say that dear young woman in such matter must be governed by feeling only seems to be deserving young man mary looked askance at friend remembering at moment reginald morton assurance that aunt must have disapproved of such engagement never must persuade girl to marry man did not love think must be wicked always thought so there be nothing about degradation in be quite clear to mary have be able to tell lady ushant that be head over ear in love with young man that therefore be going to marry old friend must have found reason to lament such arrangement old friend must have congratulated lady ushant evidently thought larry twentyman to be good enough a soon a heard what mary found compelled to say in young man favour mary be almost disappointed reconciled to very quickly telling that there be yet time for to decide in favour of lover if must bring to do so did try night next day thinking that if must so make up mind must declare purpose to lady ushant before left cheltenham must not do in struggle with herself at last learned something of truth lady ushant saw nothing what be right proper in marriage with lawrence twentyman reginald morton have declared to be improper therefore be out of reach must not do must not bring after what have said to look in face tell that be going to become wife of larry twentyman then asked fatal question be in love with reginald morton think that answered in affirmative became more more sure that must never marry larry twentyman lady ushant declared to have be more than satisfied with visit expressed hope that might be repeated in next year must ask to come make home here while have home to offer only that must be so much more buried here than at dillsborough have duty there perhaps ought not to leave come again when papa will spare on journey back certainly be not very happy there be yet three week wanting to time at must be bound to give answer to larry twentyman why must keep man waiting for three week when answer be ready stepmother knew

same business to have for many year be business business have be so very hard that have never allowed lighter thing to interfere with have have justice on side when rebuked mother for accusing of flirtation must such man a lord rufford with hand so free venture to tell that such token of affection with girl must mean nothing if might contrive to meet again of course must be repeated then must be forced to say that did mean something when therefore severe letter came from morton severe pressing telling that be bound to answer at once that be still silent must in regard to own honour take that a indication of intention to break off match felt that must answer answer must however still be ambiguous must not if possible throw away that stool quite a yet though mind be intent on ascending

till friend have told that be free to do so did not pretend to have interest in affair a to father lawyer be making busy have never even condescended to tell what be wanted on behalf for matter of have morton ever told what be that refused to do of course must not throw into arm till thing be settled by expression have meant metaphorical throwing of herself not such flesh blood embracing a have permitted to lord in little room at rufford then suggested that must appeal again to father need hardly be said that father knew very little about that lawyer have long since written to lady augustus to say that better term a to settlement must not be have from mr john morton morton when wrote second letter have received offer of mission to patagonia have asked for few day to think of after much consideration have determined that must say nothing to arabella of offer treatment of gave no right to be consulted must at once write back declaring readiness to become wife then must consult must

trefoil received answer at once accepted offer accepted though by mean assured that engagement be irrevocably annulled now if came to must take chance must be told that at rate be going to patagonia that unless must make up mind to do so too must remain arabella trefoil for must not even tell her of appointment have done in lay must prepare for journey a single man minister going out to patagonia must of course have little leave of absence allowed arranged with friend mounser green that must not start till april when lord rufford second letter reached miss trefoil down at greenacre manor where have learned by common report that mr morton be to be new minister at patagonia when believed a then did that lord be escaping that seeing feeling danger have determined not to jump into lion mouth by meeting at mistletoe that chance there be over then remembered age many season hard work of toilet tedious long bitter quarrel with mother ever renewed trouble of smile hopelessness of future must smile in vain to last countless misery of endless visiting remembered too l year that morton have offered to settle on assurance of home of own though home must be at bragton for hour two have almost given up hope of rufford have meditated letter to other lover might at rate secure have collected courage sufficiently to make last appeal to lord have be successful three week now might settle for three week might still be possible so to manage affair that might fall back upon patagonia a last resource about time morton returned to bragton waiting however till be assured that senator have completed visit to dillsborough have be little ashamed of senator in regard to great goarly conflict be not desirous of relieving solitude by presence of american on occasion went quite alone ordered carriage from bush increased establishment of servant certainly be not happy in mind mission to patagonia be well paid being worth with house etcetera nearly l year be great quick promotion for one so young a for one lord connected with cabinet minister patagonia be great place at to begin career a plenipotentiary on own bottom be long way off have drawback must not look to be there for le than four year there be hardly reason why man in position must expatriate to place for so long time felt that must not have gone for engagement to arabella trefoil that neither must have gone have engagement be solid permanent be going in order that might be rid of trouble man feeling in such circumstance can not be satisfactory to however have said that must go knew enough of to be certain that having said so must not alter mind be very melancholy mr hopkins declared to old mr twentyman that young squire be hipped along of lady love a thought hand have be so full of visitor when at bragton before have be carried off so suddenly to rufford then have hurried up to london in such misery that have hardly have time to attend to own business mr master have made claim upon since have be in england for l s d in reference to certain long gone affair in attorney declared have be badly treated by who have administered morton estate john morton have promised to look into matter to see mr master have partially looked into now felt ashamed that have not fully kept promise old attorney have not have much hope of getting money be doubtful to whether must make good claim against squire at law be settled purpose to make such attempt although be quite sure that money be due indeed if mr morton must not do anything further in matter neither must be almost too mild man to be successful lawyer have dislike to asking for money mr morton have promised to see mr morton have probably forgotten gentleman seem apt to forget such promise mr master be somewhat surprised therefore when be told one morning in office that mr morton from bragton wished to see thought that must be reginald morton having not heard that squire have returned to country john morton be shown into office old attorney immediately arose from arm chair sundown be there be at once sent out of room sundown on such occasion be accustomed to retire to settlement seldom visited by public be called back office nickem be away intent on unravelling goarly mystery attorney must ask visitor to take confidential seat mr morton however have very little to say be full of apology at once handed out cheque for sum demanded money be so much to attorney that be flurried by own success perhaps said morton ought in fairness to add interest not at by mean lawyer never expect that really mr morton be very much obliged be so long ago thought that perhaps might think doubt that be right yes mr morton be all right be quite right coming in way be quite compliment be so proud to see owner of bragton once more in house respect family a always did a for money be only sorry that have be delayed so long good morning mr master attorney affair be in such condition that unexpected cheque for l s d sufficed to exhilarate be a though money have come down to from very sky a happened mary returned from cheltenham on same evening attorney felt that if have brought back with intention to be mr twentyman must still be happy contented man there have be trouble on john morton mind have received cousin card have not returned visit while grandmother have be at bragton now walked on to hoppet hall knocked at door yes mr morton be at home then be shown into presence of cousin whom have not seen since be boy ought to have come sooner said squire who be hardly at ease heard have house full of people at

too old to get in at bottom seems long way off for man who be owner of bragton be long way what will do with old place there be one to live there if be married might perhaps take be of course said in joke a old mr morton must have thought bragton to be disgraced for ever even by proposition might let who must take such place for five year suppose old mr hopkins will remain that will become more more desolate year must let old house tumble down be then minister plenipotentiary to patagonia took departure walked back to bragton thinking of publicity of engagement dillsborough have heard that be to be married to miss trefoil cousin of have be so sure of fact that have not hesitated to ask question about in first moment of first interview under such circumstance must be better for to go to

from material necessity of life that little hardship must bring round to more rational condition with very heavy heart consented to do part be to consist mainly of silence word might be considered expedient be to come from wife three four day went on in way be day of absolute misery to mary soon perceived partly understood father silence knew at rate for present be debarred from confidence mother did not say much what did say be founded on theory that ushanting softness in general be very bad for young woman even dolly kate be hard to having dim idea that mary be to be coerced towards

be to lose lose oh aunt now that know do hope that will be friend must kill if be to throw over why must throw over if proposed to only last month might do if thought that be interfered with of course

latitude man have only to say that have changed mind nothing ever come of have never be used to such men dear at rate ask duke to speak to to day will think about perhaps will let see to morrow after come in to duchess gravely assented hope wo be angry because found walking with because did not go to church be everything to be sure dear aunt will understand to duchess made reply entered house together what became of lord rufford of saw arabella when regained room thought that upon whole fortune have favoured by throwing aunt in way have doubt be driven to tell series of barefaced impudent lie lie of such nature that almost made own hair stand on end a thought of must matter nothing if succeeded if failed in matter did not care much what aunt thought of aunt might now do good turn lie must have told such have be emergency of position a thought of be glad that aunt have met when lord rufford be summoned to take out to dinner on very sunday matter a to aunt managed everything be immediately aware that lie have done good service be more than expected lord rufford said when be seated knew that have overdone when sent away in cavalier way replied arabella now want to show that did mean anything chapter xii day at peltry duchess did tell duke whole story about lord rufford arabella night a to may be said that also be false according to conscience there be two way of telling such secret a matter of course told husband everything idle placid dinner loving man be in truth consulted about detail of house family secret be told to with injunction that be to say nothing about

marry girl must go to father be possible that might come to if doe not mean can do promised however that must think of be still dark night morning be still dark a night when arabella got out of bed opened window coming of frost now might ruin absence of might give everything in life that wanted lord rufford have promised tedious communication through servant a to state of weather be far too energetic far too much in earnest to wait for opened window putting out hand felt drizzle of rain air though damp from seemed to chill through be not frosty air stood there minute so a to be sure then retreated to bed fortune be again favouring then how must be if must turn to hard rain in case lady chiltern other lady certainly must not go how in such case must get conveyed to meet must at rate go down in hat habit trust that somebody must provide for there might be much must be disagreeable difficult hardly anything must be worse than necessity of telling such lie a have fabricated on previous afternoon have be much in doubt whether aunt have have not believed that belief be not thorough belief be almost certain then there be great fact that after story have be told have be sent out to dinner leaning on lord rufford arm unless aunt have believed something must not have taken place then so much of be true surely must be impossible that must not propose after have occurred aunt be evidently alive to advantage of marriage to advantage must accrue not to arabella individually to trefoil generally almost thought that aunt must not put spoke in wheel for day wished now that have told aunt that intended to hunt so that there need not be surprise slept again again looked out of window rained little still there be hour in rain might cease again slept at eight maid brought word that there must be hunting did rain little very little of course must dress in riding attire at nine o'clock walked into breakfast parlour properly equipped for day sport there be four five men there in red coat top boot among whom lord rufford be conspicuous be just seating at breakfast table aunt be already in place lady chiltern have come into room with herself at door have spoken good natured

doing most ordinary thing in world went round room kissed aunt brow have not done on other morning then on other morning have be late be going to ride said duchess believe so aunt who be giving horse lord rufford be lending one think even good nature will extend to giving away so perfect animal know well for rode when be at rufford said so that room must hear need not be afraid duchess said lord rufford be quite safe name be jack said arabella laughing a took place with little air of triumph lord rufford offered to let have time be here did know whether must take in so attended there be not one who heard who did not feel that spoke a though lord rufford be own lord rufford felt almost thought might a well turn round bid sister miss penge let go must marry day why must not girl do a well a one else duchess did not approve of young lady hunting certainly must not have have niece at mistletoe have expected performance must not find fault now there be feeling in bosom that if there be engagement must be cruel to cause obstruction certainly must not allow lover in house for husband niece without having official authenticated knowledge of respectability of lover whole thing have come upon so suddenly that be at loss what to do what to say certainly did not seem to that arabella be in least afraid of being found out in untruth if girl be about to become lady rufford then must be for lord rufford to decide whether must hunt soon after duke came in also alluded to niece costume be informed that be to ride one of lord rufford horse did hear mentioned before said duke will carry miss trefoil quite safely said lord rufford who be at moment standing over game pie on sideboard then subject be allowed to drop at half past nine there be rain lady be so nearly punctual that carriage absolutely started at ten of men rode on one got seat on carriage lord rufford drove friend in dog cart tandem tandem be off before carriage lord rufford assured that must get master to allow quarter of hour arabella contrived to say one word to if start without will never speak to again nodded smiled perhaps thought that if so might be a well that must start without waiting for at last moment duchess have taken into head that too must go to meet doubt be actuated by feeling in regard to niece be not till arabella be absolutely getting on to jack at side of carriage under auspex of jack owner that idea occurred to grace that there must be great difficulty a to return home arabella how do mean to get back asked will be right aunt said arabella will see to said lord rufford gracious impatient master of hound have absolutely waited full twenty minute for duchess party be not minded to wait minute longer for conversation moment that carriage be there huntsman have started so that there be excuse for hurry lord rufford a be speaking got on to own horse before duchess must expostulate be away there be feeling of triumph in arabella bosom a told that have at rate secured day hunting in spite of such heart breaking difficulty sport be fairly good have twenty minute in morning kill then drew big wood during ate lunch drank sherry in big wood found fox must not do anything with after that came on third in stubble field ran well for hour when went to ground be then three o'clock a day be now at shortest master declined to draw again be then about sixteen mile from mistletoe about ten from stamford where lord rufford horse be standing distance from stamford to mistletoe be eight lord rufford proposed that must ride to stamford then go home in hired carriage there seemed indeed to be other way of getting home without taking three tired horse fourteen mile out of way arabella made objection to arrangement lord rufford did in truth make slight effort slightest possible to induce third person to join party there be still something pulling at coat tail so that there might yet be chance of saving from precipice failed tired horseman before whom suggestion be casually thrown out must have be delighted to accept instead of riding way to mistletoe did not look upon a made in earnest two knew be company three none hunting field be by mean place suited for real love making very much of preliminary conversation may be done there in pleasant way intimacy may be formed when lover have already walked with arm round other in wood riding together may be very pleasant can hardly be ecstatic lord rufford might indeed have asked to be lady r while be breaking up first fox a loitered about in big wood did not expect that there be moment during day sport in have right to tell that be misbehaving because did not so ask in postchaise must be different at inn at horse be given up arabella condescended to take glass of cherry brandy have gone through long day be then half past four be not used to be many hour on horseback fatigue seemed to to be very much greater than have be when got back to rufford immediately after fatal accident ten mile along road have be done in little more than hour have almost overcome have determined not to cry for mercy a hard trot went on have passed off a accustomed horsewoman having done so well across country must not break down coming home a got into carriage be very tired must almost have cried with fatigue yet told that now now must work be done must perhaps tell that be tired might even assist cause by languor though must die for must not waste precious moment by absolute rest may light cigar said a got in know may wherever may be with do think must interfere with gratification be best girl in world said a took out case threw back in corner do call that long day asked when have lit cigar not very long because be so tired came home pretty sharp thought best not to shock grace by too great stretch into night a be will have time to go to bed for hour two before dress be what do when be in time will be right a trivet then oh be right now only tired be very nice pretty well ought to have killed that last fox why on earth made nothing of fellow in gooseberry grove must understand old tony must never have left that fox alive above ground must like to go to sleep o dear afraid of glove said drawing nearer to might pull a liked by coat tail a be in postchaise with must make agreeable shook head laughed a looked at through gloom then of course kissed lord rufford what doe mean know what mean hardly mean that think jolliest girl out never liked anybody so well a do perhaps never liked anybody said well yes have be not going to boast of what fortune have done for in way wonder whether care for do want to know must like to know have never said that did because have never asked be not asking now bella there be different way of asking there be only one way will get answer from will not have have allowed too much to already oh be so tired then sank back almost into arm recovered very quickly lord rufford said if be man of honour let there be end of be sure wish to make wretched must do anything to make happy then tell that love honestly sincerely with heart will be happy know do do do said then flung on to shoulder for while seemed to faint for few minute lay there a be lying calculated whether must be better to try at moment to drive to clearer declaration to make use of what have already said without giving opportunity of protesting that have not meant to make offer of marriage have declared that loved honestly with whole heart must not that justify in setting uncle at might not be that duke must carry great weight with that duke might induce to utter fatal word though be to demand now might fail a thought of affected to swoon almost believed that be swooning be conscious hardly more than conscious that be kissing yet brain be at work felt that must be startled repelled perhaps disgusted be absolutely to demand more from now oh rufford oh dearest said a woke up with face close to so that must look into eye see brightness even through gloom then extricated from embrace with shudder laugh must hardly believe how tired be said putting out ungloved hand took drew to there sat in arm for short remainder of journey be now in park a light of house came in sight gave counsel go up to room at once dearest lay down will think must go in among must fall will see duchess tell that be right very tired if go up to have better see oh yes have rather not will be sure to come bella jack must be yours now be joking never more serious in life of course must remain with just at present be horse then a carriage be stopping took hand kissed got to room a quickly a possible then before have even taken off hat sat down to think of sending maid away meanwhile to fetch cup of tea must have meant for offer there have at rate be enough to justify in so taking present have made to of horse must mean nothing else under other circumstance must be possible that must either take horse use certainly be offer a such must instruct uncle to use then allowed imagination to revel in thought of rufford hall of rufford house in town final end to weary labour must thus have brought to so glorious termination chapter xiii lord rufford want to see horse lord rufford have be quite right about duchess arabella have only taken off hat be drinking tea when duchess came up to lord rufford say that be too tired to come in said duchess be tired aunt very tired there be nothing matter with have to ride ever so far coming home be that knocked up be very bad coming home with in postchaise arabella why be bad aunt thought very nice dear must have be done ought to have known that certainly must have have here have thought that there must be anything of kind be going to be right said arabella laughing according to grace view of thing be not must not be made right must not have be right be girl to become lady rufford to morrow scandal loud reproach due to evil doings may be silenced by subsequent conduct merited punishment may not come visibly nothing happening after must make right that young lady must come home from hunting in postchaise alone with young unmarried man when duchess first heard thought what must have be feeling if such thing have be suggested in reference to one of own daughter lord rufford have come to in drawing room have told story in quiet pleasant manner merely saying that miss trefoil be too much fatigued to show at present moment have thought from manner that niece story have be true there be cordiality apparent earnestness a to girl comfort seemed to be compatible with story still must hardly understand that lord rufford must wish to have known that travelled about country in such fashion with girl intended to marry if be true then must look after niece even if be not true in case must never have girl at mistletoe again yet must not ignore presence in house be now th of january lord rufford be to go on following day arabella on th invitation have not be given so a to stretch beyond if must be at once decided declared by lord rufford to duke that match be to be match then invitation must be renewed arabella must be advised to put off other friend lord rufford must be invited to come back early in next month spend week two in proper fashion with future bride have be settled between duke duchess so much must be done for sake of family duke have not seen way to asking lord rufford question duchess must now find out truth if must so that if story be false might get rid of girl altogether shake off from mistletoe roof tree arabella manner be certainly free from appearance of hesitation fear know about being right said duchess can not be right that must have come home with alone in hired carriage be hired carriage wickeder than private one if carriage have be sent from here for must have be different even then must not have come with must be sure must have asked what man be engaged to marry may sit in carriage with duchess must not explain thought that have better drop topic what doe mean to do now arabella what doe who mean aunt lord rufford mean to marry mean to go from here to mr surbiton to morrow quite understand question what do mean to do mean to marry mean to join mamma in london on wednesday believe be to go to connop green next day mr connop green be sort of cousin of mamma be odious people who be to see lord rufford however dear if be very tired will leave now aunt stay moment if will be so very kind be tired if be twice a tired must find strength to talk about if uncle must speak to lord rufford at once must take a very kindest thing must do must not send to uncle for after one uncle one father be not same must only refer to papa if duke must speak to did renew offer to day have done nothing else renew ever since have be in carriage with be plain truth made offer at rufford renewed in wood yesterday repeated over over again a came home to day may have be very wrong so be miss trefoil must have thought that kissing proposing be same thing other young lady have perhaps before now made mistake young lady have have much experience must have known better lord rufford have better perhaps speak to uncle will tell so aunt duchess thought about for moment certainly must not tell lord rufford to speak to duke without getting duke leave to tell so then if be done lord rufford be to assure duke that young lady have made mistake how derogatory must all that be to exalted quiescence of house of mayfair thoroughly wished that niece be out of house for though did believe story belief be not thorough will speak to uncle said now have better go to sleep dear aunt pray excuse at dinner have be so excited so flurried so fatigued that fear must make fool of if attempted to come down must get into swoon must be dreadful maid will bring bit of something glass of sherry will find in drawing room when come out then duchess went arabella be left alone to take view of circumstance of campaign though there be still infinite danger yet must hardly wish that anything must be altered must lord rufford disown knew to be quite possible there must be general collapse world must crash over head have known when took business in hand that a success must open elysium to so must failure involve in absolute ruin be determined that must mar nothing now by cowardice having so resolved having fortified with perhaps two glass of sherry went down to drawing room little before nine laid out upon sofa till lady must come in lord rufford have gone to bed a be wont on such occasion with order that must be called to dress for dinner at half past seven a laid down made up mind that instead of sleeping must give up to thinking about arabella trefoil matter be going beyond joke must require thinking liked well enough be certainly not in love with doubt whether men ever be in love with girl who throw into arm man love till have be chastened fastened by feeling of duty marriage brings with be instigated mainly by difficulty of pursuit be hardly possible that anything so sweet a must ever be mine yet because be man because be so heavenly sweet will try be what men say to lord rufford have have opportunity of saying that to in regard to miss trefoil thing have be sweet not heavenly sweet have never for moment doubted possibility now at rate must make up mind instead of doing so went to sleep when got up be ten minute late be forced a dressed to think of duke dinner instead of arabella trefoil duchess before dinner submitted trouble at great length to duke duke must give substantial comfort of course have be wrong supposed that ought not to have be found walking together in dark on sunday afternoon hunting must not have be arranged without sanction return home in hired carriage have doubt be highly improper what must do if marriage came off must be all well if not niece must not be invited to mistletoe again a to speaking to lord rufford did not quite see how be to set about own girl have be married in so very different fashion must imagine nothing so disagreeable a to have to ask gentleman intention parental duty might make necessary when daughter have not known how to keep own position intact here there be parental duty if lord rufford must speak to then indeed there must be difficulty at last told wife that if must find opportunity of suggesting to young lord that might perhaps say word to young lady uncle without impropriety if must do in light easy way so a to run peril of scene might do so when two duchess other lady came out into drawing room arabella be found upon sofa of course became centre of little interest for few minute more so a aunt went up to made inquiry have have dinner be le fatigued fact of improper return home in postchaise have become generally known there be there who must have turned very cold shoulder to arabella have not aunt noticed perhaps there be who have envied jack lord rufford admiration even postchaise a long a aunt countenanced be not likely that one at mistletoe must be unkind to duchess of omnium did indeed remark to lady chiltern that remembered something of same kind happening to same girl soon after own marriage a duchess have now be married great many year be unkind be known that when duchess of omnium did dislike one never scrupled to show lord rufford be about silliest man of day said afterwards to same lady there be one thing think even be silly enough to do be nearly ten o'clock when gentleman came into room then be that duchess arabella aunt must find opportunity of giving lord rufford hint of duke have spoken be to leave mistletoe on morrow might not improbably do so early of woman be steadiest most tranquil least abrupt in movement must not pounce upon man nail down say what have to say let be a unwilling a might to hear at last however seeing lord rufford standing alone have then just left sofa on arabella be still lying without apparent effort made way up to side have rather long day said not particularly duchess have to come home so far about average distance did think hard day maurice then called to aid certain lord maurice st john hard riding hard talking old friend of trefoil family who gave duchess very clear account of performance during lord rufford fell into interesting conversation with mr mulready wife of neighbouring bishop after that duchess made attempt lord rufford said must be so glad if must come back to first week in february price will be here mackenzie be pledged to stay with sister till fifth on sixth surbiton lot come to battersby be not sixth that surbiton come to rufford rather think be said battersby wish be possible like mistletoe so much be so central very well for hunting be not lord rufford that horrid captain battersby did not go out of way wonder whether lady chiltern must do favour said lord rufford stepping across room in search of lady might be foolish when duchess of omnium declared to be silliest man of day think used wrong epithet duchess be very patient intended to try again on evening got opportunity captain battersby be lord rufford particular friend on occasion have come over with from mr surbiton house bat said a be sitting close to other in smoking room night mean to make early start to morrow what to get to surbiton have got something to do on way want to look at horse at stamford will be off with do will go in own cart will make man get hold of groom manage somehow can leave thing can bring only say to morrow be obliged to go understand heard something know kind of thing make apology to duchess in point of fact must be in stamford at ten will manage said captain battersby who made very shrewd guess at cause drew friend to uncomfortable proceeding after lord rufford went to room gave good deal of trouble night to of servant in reference to step must be necessary to take out of harm way before duchess must be up on morrow arabella when heard of man departure on following morning luckily did from own maid be for time overwhelmed by of course man be running away from there must be doubt of have watched narrowly on previous evening have seen that aunt have tried in vain to speak to did not on account give up game at rate have not found out at mistletoe be something of course must have be infinitely better for must have be absolutely caught nailed down before left house be perhaps more than have right to expect must still pursue still write to at last if necessary force father to do so must trust now chiefly to own correspondence told aunt last thing last night that be going said why did not mention thought must have told saw speaking to have received telegram about horse be most flighty man in world about such thing be to write to before leave to morrow then duchess did not believe word of engagement felt at rate certain that if there be engagement lord rufford did not mean to keep chapter xiv senator be badly treated while great effort be being made by arabella trefoil at mistletoe john morton be vacillating in unhappy mood between london bragton may be remembered that offer be made to a to purchase of chowton farm at time mistletoe party be broken up miss trefoil be staying with mother at connop green by morning post on next day received note from senator in mr gotobed stated that business required presence at dillsborough suggested that must again become guest at bragton for few day morton be so sick of own company so tired of thinking of own affair that be almost glad to welcome senator at rate have mean of escaping senator came two men be alone at house senator be full of own wrong a well a of englishman in general mr bearside have written to very cautiously pressing for immediate remittance of l explaining that great case must not be carried on without sum of money might have be very well a being open to idea that senator have option of paying money of allowing great case to be abandoned that attorney in last paragraph of letter intimated that senator must be of course aware that be liable for whole cost of action be what might have asked legal friend in london opinion legal friend have seemed to think that perhaps be liable what order have given to bearside have given without witness at rate have already paid certain sum legal friend when heard mr gotobed be able to tell about goarly have advised senator to settle with bearside taking due receipt having person with when did so legal friend have thought that small sum of money must suffice went so far a to suggest said senator with indignant energy that if contested liability to man charge matter must go against because have interfered in such case on unpopular side must think that in great country must find justice administered on other term than morton attempted to explain to that legal friend have not be administering justice only giving advice have so morton told undoubtedly taken up case of one blackguard in urging have paid money to have done so a foreigner loudly proclaiming a reason for such action that man supported must be unfairly treated unless gave assistance of course must not expect sympathy want sympathy said senator only want justice then two gentleman have become little angry with other morton be last man in world to have be aggressive on matter with senator be necessary to be prostrate to fight with mr gotobed such fighting never produced ill blood be condition of life must be supposed that liked on next morning did not scruple to ask host advice a to what have better do agreed to walk across to goarly house to ascertain from man what thought might have to say about own case on way passed up road leading to chowton farm at gate leading into garden found larry twentyman standing morton shook hand with young farmer introduced senator larry be still woe begone though endeavoured to shake off sorrow to appear to be gay never see much of man said when told that be going across to call upon neighbour know want to doe seem to have much friendship among said senator quite a much a deserves mr gotobed replied larry senator name have lately become familiar a household word in dillsborough be to tell truth odious to such men a larry twentyman be thundering rascal only place fit for in county be rufford gaol be like to be there soon think be what provokes said senator think be rascal mister do because take upon to think so 'd send to rufford gaol there be one gentleman somewhere about here told ought to be hung because must not agree with got up walked away from at table carrying provision with man in next field to insulted because said be going to see goarly clergyman in dillsborough hotelkeeper be just a hard upon see mister that what want to find out be whether goarly lord have right of in particular case know have right without more finding out said larry shortest way to house be by ride through wood mr morton take out on land on other side think will find there one of men told that have made scarce then added a two be going on must like to have just word with mr morton have be thinking of what said know be kind will take month over wo talk of selling chowton till end of february if feel about then a do now ca stay be right mr twentyman work hard like man through month go out hunting allow moment for moping will said larry a retreated to house then gave direction that horse might be ready for morrow went in through wood senator pointed out spot at bean gamekeeper have be so insolent to must not understand said why must be treated so roughly a men must be aware that have nothing to gain if be to go into mickewa said morton interfere there with peculiarity of people a have done here be belief that 'd have have eye out of head long before that only show that know mickewa said senator people be most law abiding population on face of earth passed through wood couple of field brought to goarly house a approached by back only live thing saw be old goose have be so cruelly deprived of companion progeny goose be waddling round dirty pool there be to be seen sundry ugly sign of poor man habitation be not till have knocked at window a well a door mr goarly showed remembered senator at once curtseyed to when morton introduced curtseyed again to squire of bragton when goarly be asked for shook head declared that knew nothing about have be gone said for last week have left no word a to whither be going have told why have given up action against lord rufford asked senator indeed then sir ca tell word about have be told that have taken lord rufford money ai ' taken money a have seed sir wish have for money sore wanted here if gen'leman have mind to be kind hearted then intimated own readiness to take contribution to good cause senator might be willing to make at moment senator buttoned up breech pocket with stern resolution though still believed lord rufford to be altogether wrong be beginning to think that goarlys be not worthy benevolence a came to door with accompanied few yard across field again told tragic tale of goose senator have not word to say to on same day morton drove mr gotobed into dillsborough consented to go with to mr bearside office found attorney at home before anything be said a to payment heard account of action if goarly have consented to take money from lord rufford knew nothing about a far a be aware action be going on ever so many witness must be brought from distance who have seen crop standing who must have bias against owner a must be case with neighbour such a lawrence twentyman of course be not easy to oppose man a lord rufford little money must be spent indeed such said be interest in case that have already gone further than ought to have done out of own pocket of course must be successful be if matter be carried on with spirit then money must come back again just at present little money must be spent mean to spend said senator hope wo stick to mr gotobed will sir understand from letter that look to for fund certainly do mr gotobed because told to do so told nothing of kind mr bearside paid l on account mr gotobed paid l certainly told that more must be coming a be wanted do think must have gone on for such man a goarly fellow without shilling unless have one like to back be likely now mr morton appeal to suppose that friend have made liable for bill because paid l with view of assisting goarly said morton said that meant to go on mr morton said that plain can swear now mr gotobed just say out like honest man whether did give to understand that meant to go on never employed made responsible for bill authorized distinctly most distinctly will stick to when gentleman come to lawyer office pay money tell lawyer a how mean to see case out explaining reason a did when said against landlord squire nobility of here country why then lawyer have right to think that gentleman be mark thought be employed by mr scrobby said morton who have heard much of story by time then mr morton must make bold to say that have heard wrong know nothing of mr scrobby want there ai nothing about poisoning of fox in case of ours scrobby goarly may have done scrobby goarly may be a innocent a two babe unborn for aught know care excuse mr morton have to be on p q see be case for trespass damage against lord rufford in ask for s acre of course there be expense there own time ai to be kept here talking to two gentleman for nothing suppose well gentleman come to pay l to go on must have gone on without something gentleman saw that plain enough told 'd see through rest of said nothing of kind sir very well then must put to jury may make bold to ask whether be going out of country at once will be here for next two month at least happy to hear sir have doubt will all be settled before time amiable otherwise a be money out of pocket did hope must have paid something on account to day then mr gotobed made offer informing mr bearside that have brought friend mr morton with in order that there might be witness must see that sir with eye said attorney unabashed be willing to pay mr bearside further sum of l immediately to be quit of affair not because thought that such sum be due because wished to free from further trouble in matter mr bearside hinted in very cavalier way that l might be thought of further payment of l must cover money be out of pocket proposition mr gotobed indignantly refused then left office with friend wherever there be lawyer there will be rogue said senator a soon a found in street be noble profession that of law finest perhaps that work of world affords give scope temptation for roguery think however that must find anything in america so bad a why did go to without asking question of whom be to ask question when took up goarly case have already put into man hand be sorry must be troubled mr gotobed upon word can not say what serf right be because be offended with endeavoured to protect poor man against rich man in country be cause of offence after leaving attorney office called on mr mainwaring rector found that knew professed to know great deal more about goarly than have learned from bearside according to story nickem who be clerk to mr master have goarly in safe keeping somewhere rector indeed be acquainted with detail scrobby have purchased red herring strychnine have employed goarly to walk over by night to rufford fetch poison at time have be duly packed in herring goarly have done have at scrobby instigation laid bait down in dillsborough wood nickem be now at work trying to learn where scrobby have purchased poison a be feared that goarly evidence alone must not suffice to convict man if strychnine must be traced herring then there must be almost certainty of punishing scrobby what about goarly asked senator must escape of course said rector must get little money after such experience must probably become good friend to fox hunting quite respectable man rector did not guarantee seemed to think that there must at rate be promise of improved conduct place ought to be too hot to hold exclaimed senator indignantly rector seemed to think possible that might find uncomfortable at first in case must sell land at good price to lord rufford one concerned must have be benefited by transaction except scrobby for whom one must feel pity two gentleman then promised to come dine with rector on following day feared said that must not make up party a there be declared nobody in dillsborough never knew such place said rector except old nupper who be there master be very decent fellow have got out of kind of thing ca ask man without asking wife a for clergyman be sick of dining with own cloth discussing trouble of sermon there never be such place a dillsborough then whispered word to squire be squire unwilling to meet cousin reginald morton thing be said people never knew what be true what be false then john morton declared that must be very happy to meet cousin chapter xv mr mainwaring little dinner company at rector house consisted of senator two morton mr surtees curate old doctor nupper mr mainwaring be not well enough to appear rector therefore be able to indulge in what called bachelor party a rule disliked clergyman at last have be driven to invite curate because thought six better number than five for joviality began by asking question a to trefoil be not very fortunate of course have heard that morton be to marry arabella trefoil though made direct allusion to fact a reginald have done spoke in bland eulogistic tone clearly showed purpose went with to lord rufford be told yes did now have left neighbourhood very clever young lady miss trefoil so be mother very clever woman senator to whom sort of appeal be made nodded assent lord augustus believe be brother of duke of mayfair yes be said morton be afraid be going to have frost again then reginald morton be sure that marriage must never take place trefoil be very distinguished family continued rector remember present duke father when be in cabinet knew man almost intimately when be at christchurch together think duke ever took prominent part in politics know that ever did said morton dear dear how tipsy be once driving back to oxford with in gig have reputation of being one of best landlord in country now wonder what be that give man reputation of being good landlord be fox asked senator rector acknowledged with smile fox helped doe mean that let land below value if so certainly doe more harm than good though may like popularity be rich enough to buy mean that doe not exact more than due said rector indiscreetly when hear man so highly praised for common honesty be of course led to suppose dishonesty in particular trade be common rule body of english landlord must be exorbitant tyrant when one among be so highly eulogised for taking more than own luckily at moment dinner be announced exceptional character of duke of mayfair be allowed to drop mr mainwaring dinner be very good wine be excellent fact of mr mainwaring be much better aware than of guest there be difficulty in giving of dinner of mr mainwaring other host have become painfully aware what service do do to one in

with out of next farm yard soup have be care since yesterday fish got down with so great trouble from bond street on very day saddle of mutton in selecting have affronted butcher in neighbourhood be plainly thrown away yet hospitable hero who must fain treat friend a must be treated can hardly arrange dinner according to palate of different guest will like when stranger sit at board to put nothing better on table than cheaper wine with needful economy induces to solace when alone who write have seen honoured guest deluge with pump ah so hardly earned most scarce most peculiar vintage there be pang in such usage will not understand cut mr mainwaring to very soul there be not one among there who appreciated fact that claret on dinner table be almost best that year have produced be impossible not to say word on subject at moment though rector be not man who usually lauded own viand think will find claret what like mr gotobed said be ' mouton judge say that be good very good indeed said senator in state have got into way yet of using dinner claret be a good a play to see rector wince under ignominious word great statesman added much to national comfort when took duty off lighter kind of french wine rector must not stand hated light wine hated cheap thing in general hated gladstone in particular nothing said that statesman speak of ever did must make such wine a cheaper be sorry sir that perceive difference in matter of wine said senator think have happened to come across anything so good in country a old madeira then sir have be fortunate in climate english atmosphere be not one in wine seems to reach full perfection rector heaved deep sigh a looked up to ceiling with hand in trowsers pocket knew thought that knew that one must ever get glass of good wine in united state knew thought that knew that best wine in world be brought to england knew thought knew that in other country be wine so well understood so diligently sought for so truly enjoyed a in england imagined that be le understood le sought for le enjoyed in state than in other country did not a yet know senator well enough to fight with at own table must only groan moan look up at ceiling doctor nupper endeavoured to take away sting by smacking lip reginald morton who did not in truth care straw what drank be moved to pity declared claret to be very fine have nothing to say against said senator who be not in least abashed when cloth be drawn for rector clung so lovingly to old habit that delighted to see mahogany beneath wine glass more serious subject of dispute arose suddenly though perhaps hardly more disagreeable thing in england said senator find most difficult to understand be matter of what call church patronage if will pas hour with mr surtees to morrow morning will explain to said rector who did not like subject connected with profession must be mooted after dinner must be delighted said mr surtees nothing must give more pleasure said senator what mean be question be of course one of paramount importance doubt be said deluded rector be very necessary to get good doctor well yes rather considering that men wish to live observation of course came from doctor nupper care be taken in employing lawyer though after experience of yesterday not always must say so much care a be needful man who want such aid look about get best doctor can for money best lawyer here in england must take clergyman provided for must be very much better for if did said rector clergyman at rate be supposed to be appointed that clergyman must pay not at said rector clergy be paid by wise provision of former age will let that pas for present said senator there be however may be paid how doe get there now be fact that mr mainwaring living have be bought for with

learn stipend be absurdly various one man getting l year for working like horse in big town l for living idle life in luxurious country house bishop of course give bigger plum to best men how be then that big plum find way so often to son son in law nephew of bishop because bishop have looked after education principle said rector taught how to choose wife said senator with imperturbable gravity be not son of bishop sir exclaimed rector wish have be sir if must have done good general ca make son colonel at age of twenty five admiral son first lieutenant judge queen counsellor can head of office promote to be chief secretary be only bishop can do suppose because cure of soul be so much le important than charge of ship discipline of twenty thirty clerk bishop do said rector fiercely then statistic have be put into hand belie how be with bishop appoint there seems to to be such complication of absurdity a to defy explanation think must explain said mr surtees mildly if can do so satisfactorily will be very glad to hear continued senator who seemed in truth to be glad to hear one lad of one learns lesson so well that have to be rewarded at college part of reward consists in having parish entrusted to when be forty year old to can maintain right whether be in way trained for such work be that true collegiate education be best training can have said rector came across

salary of l year mr surtees sat aghast with mouth open knew not how to say word doctor nupper rubbed red nose reginald morton attempted suggestion about wine fell wretchedly flat john morton ventured to tell friend that did not understand subject will be most happy to be instructed said senator understand said rector almost rising in chair to rebuke insolence of guest understands nothing about yet venture to fall foul with unmeasured term on establishment have be brought to present condition by fostering care of perhaps most pious set of divine ever lived have produced result with of other church can compare have represented anything untruly asked senator great deal sir only put right man will recall word more readily be not case living in church of england can be bought sold matter be one sir said rector can not be discussed in manner there be two clergyman present to whom such language be distasteful a be also hope to others who be member of church of england perhaps will allow to

lady ushant age then have doubt within own mind whether mary might not be debarred from accepting young man by unfortunate preference for reginald morton have seen together have suspected something of truth before have glimmered before eye of one in dillsborough have reginald be so inclined lady ushant must have be very glad to see marry mary master for sake must have preferred match to one with owner of chowton farm did not think that reginald be way minded fancied that poor mary might be throwing away prosperity in life be to wait for reginald love larry twentyman be at rate sure perhaps

marry men what did reginald morton think about be to remember that a far a be concerned dearly loved mary master must be delighted to have at cheltenham so remembering be to see attorney mary herself if necessary mr master then to report opinion to cheltenham then fearing that nephew might be away for day two that might not be able to perform commission instantly thinking mary might be unhappy if

must give so much pleasure be quite sincere matter be in other respect very important of course have kept letter to in writing to reginald have mentioned name affectionate friend margaret ushant chapter xvii particularly proud of arabella trefoil left uncle mansion on day after lover departure certainly not in triumph with somewhat recovered spirit when first heard that lord rufford be gone that have fled away a be in middle of night without saying word to without syllable to make good slight assurance of love have be given to in post carriage felt that be deserted betrayed when found altogether neglected on following day that slightly valuable impression have made on aunt be apparently gone did for hour think in earnest of paragon patagonia after while called to mind that knew of great effort successfully made in opposition to almost overwhelming difficulty have heard of forlorn hope perhaps in young day have read something of caesar still clinging to commentary a struggled in wave be forlorn hope must be a brave a soldier of lord rufford embrace be commentary let wind blow wave roll a might must still cling to after lunch spoke to aunt with great courage a duchess thought with great effrontery uncle must speak to lord rufford before went how must speak to man who ran away from house in way running away a call aunt did not take place till two day after have told about thought must have done a much a for brother daughter believe in at said duchess sternly believe in what aunt mean to say that believe that lord rufford have asked to be wife then paused duchess absolutely lacked courage to express conviction again suppose signifies much continued arabella of course must have be something to that lord rufford must have known that duke be anxious for welfare be quite prepared to have assured uncle of intention then why did speak because duke be not father really aunt when hear talk of running away do feel to be unkind a if did all know that man like go come a plea be just before dinner that got message be to run round wish everybody good bye like schoolgirl going to bed duchess be almost certain that message have come from various little thing have observed from tidings have reached very much doubted whether arabella have known anything of intended going too have maid of own who on occasion must bring information have nothing further to say on subject if arabella must ever become lady rufford must of course among other visitor be occasionally received at mistletoe must never be favourite thing must to certain degree have rectified if a duchess expected such marriage took place then ill conducted niece must never be admitted within house again later on in afternoon hour after became dusk arabella contrived to meet aunt in hall with letter in hand asked where letter box be knew where to deposit letter a well a did duchess herself desired opportunity of proclaiming what have done be writing to lord rufford perhaps a be in house ought to tell have done letter box be in billiard room close to door said duchess passing on then added a went post for to day have gone already lordship will have to wait day for letter dare say wo break heart said arabella a turned away to billiard room have be planned moreover have so written letter that if magnificent aunt must condescend to tamper with be in must seem to corroborate own story duchess must have considered disgraced if ever have done thing niece of duchess did not quite understand that must be so letter be a follows mistletoe th jany dearest r going off like be after very horrid aunt think that be running away from think that be running away from be true in real earnest for moment think that duchess have anything to do with that did go because horrid man wrote

eye try to think that somebody else be there good bye dear dear dear r will be dying for letter from yours ever with heart will write serious epistle when get to green be not such letter a thought that aunt must approve be fancied such a duchess must believe that must write to lover if be allowed to go on way must make lord rufford feel that be neither alarmed displeased by suddenness of departure be not expected to do much good might produce short joking half affectionate reply must not draw from serious word be so necessary for success of scheme therefore have told that intended to prepare serious missile must pleasant little message of love miscarry serious missile must still be sent miscarriage must occasion harm then further plan be necessary might be that lord rufford must take notice of serious missile thought very probable might be that must send back serious reply in must calmly explain to that have unfortunately mistaken sentiment believed must be stretch of manhood beyond reach in case must be prepared with course must follow in first must begin by forcing father to write to letter must dictate in second must set whole family at a far a family be within reach with cousin lord mistletoe who be only two year older than have always held pleasant relation have be child together a have grown up young lord have liked pretty cousin latterly have seen other rarely therefore feeling still remained must tell lord mistletoe whole story be story a must please to tell implore aid father must be driven to demand from lord rufford execution of alleged promise must write such letter to duke a uncle must be unable not to notice must move heaven earth a to wrong thought that if friend must stick to lord rufford must be weak a water in hand must be done immediately

serious study a intent student who have zealously buried for week among commentary note feel qualified to question porson to be bentley bentley so did senator believe while still be groping among rudiment that have political intricacy at finger end when heard argument used for difference of suffrage in town county found that even who be proposing change be not ready absolutely to assimilate two still held that rural ascendancy feudalism a called must maintain by barring fraction of house of common from vote of majority pronounced whole thing to be sham intention be said to delude people be coming said gentleman who be accustomed to argue with in day spoke in sad vein be in distressing to senator why must be in such hurry senator suggested that if country delayed much longer

dillsborough there be nobody there to whom must apply thus be driven to employ london attorney london attorney told that have better pay bearside senator remembering at time that must also have to pay london attorney for advice gave second lawyer authority to conclude matter at last bearside accepted l when london attorney refused to take anything for trouble senator felt such conduct almost a additional grievance in existing frame of mind must sooner have expended few more dollar than be driven to think well of anything connected with english law be immediately after have handed over money

absolutely have conference conference have have result duke have not consented to interfere have agreed to compromise proposed by son lord augustus must be authorised to ask lord rufford to meet in library of piccadilly mansion so that there must be savour of dukedom in what might be done said there lord rufford must by surroundings be made to feel that in rejecting arabella be rejecting duke mayfair belonging in accepting must be entitled to regard a accepting by allowing thus much duke must not compromise duchess lord mistletoe lord mistletoe with prudence will certainly in future year

easiest mode of escape how must be possible that two must get out at dillsborough station be taken to bragton without rufford knowing of course there must be hymn sung in praise of arabella love

must so willingly have seen instantly only that doctor must not allow be so glad so very glad that have come lady ushant said to in whisper seemed to say a though have heard nothing of frightful story have be told to not much more than hour ago arabella did not utter word in reply put out hand secretly a be grasped that of old lady to whom have told tale of later intrigue dinner did not keep long be very grievous to lady ushant might have made effort to be at least complaisant hostess to lady augustus have not heard story have not be told that woman knowing daughter to be engaged to john morton have wanted to marry lord rufford story having come from lip of girl have moved pity in old woman breast in regard to for lady augustus must feel nothing horror in evening lady augustus sat

lady augustus daughter got into mr runciman carriage without farewell be driven back from park to dillsborough station to poor lady ushant whole thing have be very terrible sat silent unoccupied whole of evening wondering at horror of such history girl have absolutely dared to tell dying man own disgrace have travelled down from london to bragton with purpose of doing so when next crept into sick room almost expected that nephew must speak to on subject only asked whether sound of wheel heard beneath window have come from carriage have taken away then did not say further word of lady augustus daughter what do mean to do now said lady augustus a train approached london terminus nothing have given up lord rufford indeed have not journey to bragton will hardly help much with want to help at what have done that lord rufford can complain of have not abandoned lord rufford for sake of mr morton lord rufford ought only to be too proud if knew of course must make use of such escapade a let

fear that daughter in despair must abandon altogether one pursuit of life now seemed that there be still courage left for battle night nothing more be said arabella applied mind to present condition of circumstance must must not go to house in piccadilly on following morning at last determined that must not do so believing must father fail might make better opportunity for herself afterwards at uncle house must hardly have known where how to wait for proper moment of appearance so be not going to piccadilly said mother on following morning appears not said arabella chapter ii now what have got to say may be question whether lord augustus trefoil lord rufford looked forward to interview be to take place at duke mansion with greater dismay unfortunate father whose only principle in life have be that of avoiding trouble must have rather that daughter must have be jilted score of time than that must have be called upon to interfere once there be in demand upon breach of silent well understood compact wife daughter have be allowed to do just what pleased to be free of authority upon understanding that be never to give trouble might have married lord rufford mr morton other man might have succeeded in catching must not have troubled either before after marriage be not fair that must be called upon to interfere in failure what be to say to young lord being fat old plethoric must not be expected to use stick thrash young lord pistol be gone remembrance of fact perhaps afforded consolation nobody now need be afraid of anybody young lord must not be afraid of arabella declared that there have be engagement young lord must of course declare that there have be none upon whole be inclined to believe most probable that daughter be lying did not think likely that lord rufford must have be fool a for taking lord rufford by back of neck shaking into matrimony knew that must be altogether out of power then hour be so wretchedly early be that little fool mistletoe who have named ten o'clock fellow who took parliamentary paper to bed with have blue book brought to morning at half past seven with cup of tea by ten o'clock lord augustus must not have have time to take

impossible be great bore have to go up to london alone in february when weather be quite open hunting be nearly coming to end for what be likely that man a lord augustus must succeed in talking into marrying girl nevertheless went prepared to be very civil full of sorrow at misunderstanding strong in determination not to yield inch arrived at mansion precisely at ten o'clock be at once shown into back room on ground floor saw one very demure old servant who seemed to look upon a one who be sinning against trefoil family in general who shut door upon leaving a be in prison be so accustomed to

be sir george penwether be quite wrong said young man with well informed sententious gravity must hing to help be arabella father one can plead cause lord augustus dropped eyebrow over eye a be said who knew well have seen same thing done when partner must not answer call at whist have led up to discard be aware that motion be tantamount to very strong expression of disgust did not however argue matter further allowed to be led away slowly by same solemn servant lord rufford have taken up hat preparatory to departure when lord augustus be announced just five minute after half hour when elder

probability reginald morton be not legitimate heir of great grandfather sir reginald for assertion john morton knew there be not shadow of ground one old woman have ever suspected that canadian girl whom reginald father have brought with to bragton have be other than honest wife suspicion have only come from vague assertion made by in blind anger till at last have learned to believe then when in addition to asserted purpose of asking arabella trefoil to come to at bragton cup of wrath be overflowing withdrew from house altogether might be that be dying did in truth believe that be dying there be thing more serious to than life death must allow to trample upon feeling because be on death bed when perhaps in very truth might not be on death bed at at rate be near death must do duty so packed

given by mr hopkins general opinion be that squire day be numbered then old woman jealousy be aroused perhaps heart be softened be still hard black winter be living alone in lodging in london noble cousin man nearly a old a whose child be desirous to enrich took little notice of must have be happy have lived with life have be usually solitary with little break to loneliness occasioned by visit to england of whom have called child that child must die before must die in youth did not shock much husband have done so own son sundry of noble brother sister be hardened against death life to have never be joyous though trapping of life be so great in eye broke heart that child must die in arm of old woman who have always be to a enemy lady ushant in day now long gone by still remembered a though be yesterday have counselled reception of canadian female lady ushant when canadian female husband be dead have be mother to boy whom mr morton must so fain have repudiated altogether lady ushant have always be on other side now lady ushant be paramount at bragton doubtless there be tenderness though mr morton be unwilling to own even to herself that be moved by such feeling if have done duty in counselling to reject reginald morton arabella trefoil a to admitted doubt in own mind if duty have required to absent when counsel be spurned then must be weak unmindful of duty must allow softness of heart to lure back again be so reasoned still softness be there when heard that miss trefoil have gone that visit have not in mr hopkins opinion led to much wrote to say that must return made request clothed suggestion in word of tenderness simply told grandson that must come back a trefoil have left did come when news be first told to lady ushant by sick man that lady proposed that must at once go back to cheltenham when be asked whether animosity to mr morton be so great that must not consent to remain under same roof at once declared that have animosity whatsoever idea of animosity running over nearly century be horrible to therefore though did in heart of heart dread other old woman consented to stay what will reginald do asked john morton have thought about too expressed wish reginald must come regularly a have come during last week two be just week from day on trefoil have gone that mr morton be driven up to door in mr runciman fly be at four in afternoon have old woman looked out of fly window might have seen reginald making way by little path to bridge led back to dillsborough be at hour that went daily have not now thought worth while to remain to welcome mr morton might also have seen have looked out that with be walking young woman must not have known mary master have seen have known young woman must have declared in pride that be fit associate saw nothing of sitting there behind veil thinking whether might still do anything if so what might do to avert present evil destination of bragton estate there be honourable nephew of own rather great nephew who might easily take name who must so willingly take name if be impracticable there be distant morton very distant whom have never seen certainly did not love who be clearly morton who must certainly be preferable to enemy of forty year standing might there not be bargain made must not her dying grandson be alive to evident duty of enriching property leaving behind wealthy heir must enrich property make heir wealthy by money how be that of course be first question when mr hopkins met in hall mr hopkins only shook head said that perhaps have taken food day little better than on last then there be whisper to mr hopkins whispered back answer yes lady ushant be in house be at moment in sick man room mr reginald be not staying there have never stayed there came day have only just left be to come still asked mr morton with wrath in eye mr hopkins did not know be disposed to think that mr reginald must come day then mr morton went up to own room while prepared for visit to sick room lady ushant retired have cup of tea refusing other refreshment then walking erect a though have be forty instead of seventy five entered grandson chamber took old place at bedside nothing be then said about arabella indeed at future time be name mentioned between be anything then said about future fate of estate did not dare to bring up subject at once though on journey down from london have determined that must do so be awed by appearance by increased appanage of sick bed spoke indeed of property expressed anxiety that chowton farm must be bought if came into market thought that old acre must be redeemed if opportunity arose if money must be found chowton farm exclaimed old woman who remembered well agony have attended alienation of portion of morton land may be that will be sold lawrence twentyman sell chowton farm thought be well off little a have be at bragton knew about chowton farm except owner be so wounded by vain love a to be like hurt deer grandson did not tell story explained to lawrence twentyman though not poor have other plan of life thought of leaving neighbourhood of course have money a believed that land be one proper possession for english gentleman of ancient family doubtless must have be willing to buy have approved of hand into must fall seemed to that be duty to do a much for estate with fortune have be concerned yes said must be bought if other thing suited will talk of to morrow john then spoke of mission to patagonia of regret that must be abandoned even be ever to be well again strength must return to too late for purpose have already made known to foreign office inability to undertake service must perceive that have not in truth abandoned hope of living for spoke much of ambition a to public service more thought of said more certain became that must suit better to go on with profession than to live life of country squire in england yet must see change have taken place since be last there be aware that be fading away from day to day be not till be summoned to dine together that saw lady ushant very many year have passed since last be together yet seemed to other to be much changed lady ushant be still soft retiring almost timid whereas mr morton showed inclination to domineer even in way in helped to salt while servant be with very little be said on side there be word two from mr morton to show that considered mistress there word from other lady proclaiming that have pretension of kind after dinner in little drawing room be more communicative something of course be said a to health of invalid lady ushant be not woman to give pronounced opinion on subject used doubtful hesitating word must in one minute almost contradict what have said in former mr morton be clever enough to perceive lady ushant be almost without hope then made little speech with fixed purpose must be great trouble to lady ushant to be so long away from home not at said lady ushant in perfect innocence have nothing to bind anywhere will think duty to remain here now till end suppose so have always be almost same to a own quite so quite same be own yet thought lady ushant left in illness too have heard something from mr hopkins of temper in mr morton have last left bragton be not bound to in way not in way certainly in way may say be very kind of to come when business made imperative on to go to town think can call upon for further sacrifice be sacrifice mr morton lady ushant be a meek a worm worm will turn though innocent be quick enough to perceive at first meeting other old woman be endeavouring to turn out of house mean that can hardly be necessary to call upon to give up time what have old woman to do with time mr morton hitherto mr morton have smiled smile indeed have be grim have be intended to betoken outward civility now there came frown upon brow be more grim by mean civil truth be that at time one who be almost stranger be stranger said lady ushant have not seen since be infant name be morton a be dear father be owner of house husband mr morton be grandfather brother will allow one to tell that be stranger at bragton have lived here many more year than stranger to meant now that be ill will stay with till desire to go away asked to stay be quite enough then got up left room with more dignity a also have spoken with more earnestness than mr morton have given credit for possessing after that two lady did not meet again till next day chapter iv two old lady on next morning mr morton did not come down to breakfast sat alone upstairs nursing wrath during night have made up mind to one two thing must never enter grandson chamber when lady ushant be there must not speak to reginald morton must come into presence while be at bragton must leave room must do best to make house in common parlance too hot to hold that other woman must make use of word john have spoken concerning chowton farm a peg on might hang discourse in reference to will if in doing must receive that dutiful assistance thought that owed then must stand by bed side be tender to nurse to last a mother must nurse child if a feared be headstrong in disobeying then must remember that duty to family if done with firm purpose must have lasting result while life might probably be affair of few week even day at about eleven lady ushant be with patient when message be brought by mr hopkins mr morton wished to see grandson desired to know whether must suit that must come now why not said sick man who be sitting up in bed then lady ushant collected knitting be about to depart must go because be coming morton asked lady ushant shocked at necessity of explaining to ill feeling that existed said that perhaps must be best why must be best lady ushant shook head smiled put hand upon counterpane retired a passed door of rival room must see black silk dress moving behind partly open door a entered own heard mr morton step upon corridor place be already almost too hot for anything must be better than scene like in house of dying man need aunt have gone away asked after first greeting did not say so seemed to think that be not to stay can help what think john of course feel that be be what interloper if must say have sent for have begged to stay of course can stay if wish dear john there must be much to be said between can not interest at least ought not to hear did not contradict in word feeling to be too weak for contest within own mind declared that be not so thing interested now be a likely to interest great aunt a grandmother to be a fit for ear of one a for of other hour have passed after during tended giving food medicine have slept before ventured to allude to subject be nearest to heart john said at last have be thinking about chowton farm well certainly must be bought if man resolve on selling of course mean that how much must be then mentioned sum twentyman have named saying that have inquired have be told that price be reasonable be large sum of money john there might be mortgage for part of like mortgage property must not be yours at if be mortgaged a soon a bought must pay per cent for money only get per cent from land old lady understood about must pay off in two year said sick man there need be paying off mortgage if did almost believe have got enough to do knew very well that have much more than enough think more of property than of anything in world dear chowton farm must be yours know what must do with chowton farm will probably be in grave before slow lawyer must have executed deed in mine thought to before present owner have quite made up mind to part with land what must little place like do for in father in law time be part of bragton property sold to pay debt of younger son forgetting a thought what owed to estate have in truth be sold on behalf of husband of old woman who be now complaining if can be recovered be duty to get back again property like must never be lessened be in way that country be given over to shopkeeper speculator be made to be like france italy quite think that chowton farm must be bought though might die before be done must find money knew what feeling must be yes john must not know well then paused moment looking into face must wish to know what must become of eventually if be yours must do what pleased with must be yours then must go with rest of property to whom must go have to die dear who can say whom may please almighty to take first in house ma'be one can give shrewd guess know own condition if die without child of own acre posse will go to proper heir thinking a do ought to agree with in who be proper heir cousin reginald let contest a certainly a lie here will have bragton when be gone will not listen to john not about how must die in peace be to rob be own to do a like with be own not to do a like with with feeling with idea how can urge to injustice do want for even want for one belonging to there be cousin peter if be heir must have though know nothing of believe to be poor creature very unfit to have custody of family property be father son will believe nothing of said sick man raising in bed be slander be based on evidence whatsoever one even thought of john be that way to speak to be way to speak of assertion so injurious then fell back again on pillow sat by bedside for full half hour speechless thinking of at end of time have resolved that must not yet give up must regain health strength must pray fervently night day that god must be so good to then everything must be well then must marry have child bragton must descend in right line be to be ordained otherwise must be god will that must die then a grew weaker must become more plastic in hand might still prevail at present be stubborn with old stubbornness must not see with eye must bide time be careful to have lawyer ready turned over in mind a sat there watching in sleep knew of one mr master whom distrusted a being connected with other side of family whose father have made that will by property in dillsborough have be dissevered from bragton mr master must probably obey instruction if be given to definitely thought of then went down to lunch did not dare to refuse altogether to meet other woman lest such resolve on part might teach in house to think that lady ushant be mistress took place at head of table interchanged few word with grandson guest of course have reference to health lady ushant be very ill able to carry on battle of sort be willing to show submission in everything unless be desired to leave house while be still sitting at table reginald morton walked

than have expected that poor mary almost felt that heart be lightened chapter vi again at mistletoe reader will have be aware that arabella trefoil be not favourite at mistletoe be so much disliked by duchess that there have almost be word about between grace duke since departure duchess always submitted be rule of life to submit with so good grace that husband never fearing rebellion must never be driven to assume tyrant on occasion duke have objected to term thoroughly bad girl have be applied by wife to niece have said that thoroughly bad girl be strong language when duchess defended phrase have expressed opinion that arabella be only bad girl not thoroughly bad girl duchess have said that be same thing then said duke why use redundant expletive against own relative duchess when be accused of strong language have not minded much feeling be hurt when redundant expletive be attributed to effect of have be that duke in mild way have taken up arabella part that duchess following husband at last have be brought round to own arabella though bad have be badly treated have disbelieved then believed have again disbelieved arabella own statement a to offer of marriage girl have certainly be in earnest when have begged aunt to ask uncle to speak to lord rufford surely when did must have thought that offer have be made to such offer if made have doubt be produced by very hard pressure still offer of marriage be offer girl if can obtain have right to use such offer a so much property then came lord mistletoe report after meeting with arabella up in london have be unable to give cousin satisfaction be clearly of opinion that have be ill used did not venture to suggest step did think that lord rufford be bound a gentleman to marry young lady after lord augustus saw mother up in town said that be d shame in truth have believed nothing must have be delighted to allow matter to drop a be not permitted thought easier to take daughter part than to encounter family enmity by entering list against so came to pas down at mistletoe there grew opinion that lord rufford ought to marry arabella trefoil what must be done duke be alive to feeling a girl be certainly niece a be not to be regarded a thoroughly bad girl assistance be due to from family lord mistletoe volunteered to write to lord rufford lord augustus thought that brother must have personal interview with young brother peer bring strawberry leaf to bear duke suggested that duchess must see lady penwether scheme to grace objected strongly knowing something of lady penwether being sure that strawberry leaf must have effect on baronet wife at last be decided that family meeting must be held lord augustus be absolutely summoned to meet lord mistletoe at paternal mansion be now year since lord augustus have be at mistletoe a have never be separated be formally separated from wife have be always invited there together year after year have accepted invitation have be declined on behalf because did not

conference made worse for lord augustus a be one of little party have private gathering for whist on sunday afternoon went to conference travelling down by same train with nephew not in same compartment a solaced with tobacco time lord mistletoe devoted to parliamentary erudition four met in grace boudoir duke began by declaring that be very sad lord augustus shook head put hand in trouser pocket be a much a to say that feeling a british parent be almost too strong for mother think that something ought to be done said duke turning to son something ought to be done said lord mistletoe wo let fellow go out with fellow now said lord augustus heaven forbid said duchess raising hand be thinking mistletoe that mother might have met lady penwether what must do with lady penwether duke what must do with man wo care for what sister say to suppose 'd undertake to speak to lord rufford on subject lady penwether be honourable accomplished woman dare say though give abominable air of course if like dear sha be pressed thought perhaps 'd see said lord augustus turning to brother 'd carry more weight than anybody of course will if be necessary must be disagreeable very disagreeable appeal must be made to feeling think must better come through female influence a far a know world man be always more prone to be led in such matter by woman than by man if mean said duchess think must see of course augustus wish to say anything hard of arabella fact that have met here to take part will prove that think did quite approve of be done here lord augustus stroked beard looked out of window think dear need go into just now said duke not at said duchess intend to say word only if be to meet lord rufford might refer to thing in point of fact have rather not might see suggested lord mistletoe doubt might be done with advantage said duke only that a be senior in age what might say to must lack that weight observation might be made on such matter must carry with did care straw for said lord augustus then continued lord mistletoe so completely agree with what father say a to advantage of female influence with man of lord rufford temperament female influence be everything if aunt be to try lord augustus blew breath out of mouth raised eyebrow knowing what did of wife thinking that knew what did did not conceive possible that worse messenger must be chosen have known to be very bad one did honestly believe to be even le fitted for task than said nothing simply wishing that have not left whist for purpose a perhaps lady augustus have better see said duke duchess who did not love hypocrisy must not actually assent to said nothing suppose sister in law must not object augustus g almighty only know said younger brother duchess grievously offended by impropriety of language drew up haughtily perhaps must not mind suggesting to sir said lord mistletoe must do by letter said duke when have assented a of course will then perhaps must mind writing line to to make appointment if be to do so must not refuse to proposition duke returned immediate answer looked at round round carefully at last however acceded to also so matter be arranged influential member of ducal family met together at ducal mansion on arabella behalf settled difficulty by deputing work of bearding lion of tying bell on cat to absent lady whom despised disliked that afternoon duke with assistance of son who be great writer of letter prepared epistle to sister in law to lord rufford be to be sent a soon a lady augusta have agreed to arrangement in former letter good deal be said a to mother solicitude for daughter have be felt letter said that one must speak for daughter so well a mother that other word must so surely reach heart of man who be not evil who be tempted by surroundings of world to do evil in particular case letter began dear sister in law ended affectionate brother in law mayfair be in fact first letter that duke have ever written to brother wife other letter be more difficult be accomplished at last confined to request that lord rufford must meet lady augustus trefoil at place at time of be for present left blank on monday lord

other member of family may be very well know be d nonsense be sorry that must think so uncle what do suppose mother can do thoroughly vulgar woman never must live with a far a can see wherever go everybody hate dear uncle rufford will only laugh at if mayfair must have gone be just possible that might have done something father be so unwilling to mix up in thing of course be everybody know

well aware that young lady mother have inverted circumstance a expressed to have put cart before horse have assured young lady that loved have also be assured of love assurance have come first felt that made difference in world so much difference that one cognisant in such matter must hold that assurance obtained after such fashion meant anything at how be to explain to lady mother will admit

be really nothing else to be said if there be anything must do to atone to for trouble if only must know brightness of hope have shattered purity of girl affection for be then that idea low minded idea occurred to lord rufford while be going on have of course made various inquiry about branch of trefoil family have learned that arabella be altogether portionless be told too that lady augustus be much harassed by impecuniosity might be possible to offer recompense if must do anything else lady augustus really be not marrying man then lady augustus wept bitterly while be weeping low minded idea occurred to also be clear to that there must be marriage have never expected that there must be marriage if man who be rolling in wealth must offer sum of money to daughter something so considerable a to divest transaction of meanness must be attached to small bribe something might be really useful throughout life must not be duty on behalf of dear child to accept offer beginning of

never be offer of marriage made in first place lord rufford word went further with than arabella then story have be consistent probable whereas hers have be inconsistent improbable at rate rope horse must not bring lord rufford to hymeneal altar that being so be not natural that must then have considered what result must be next best to marriage be very poor having saved only few hundred year from wreck of own fortune independently of daughter have nothing in spite of poverty arabella be very extravagant running up bill for finery without remorse wherever credit must be found excusing by saying that on occasion such expenditure be justified by matrimonial prospect opened out to now of late arabella have be talking of living separately from mother lady augustus who be thoroughly tired of

room mr morton be closeted with attorney have thought much of step before have dared to take even now doubted whether must avail anything a entered book room in mr master be seated almost repented man be there be compelled to go on with scheme mr master said be think long time since have be employed by family very long time madam have now sent for under circumstance of great difficulty answered a said nothing be forced to go on grandson made will other day up in london when thought that be going out to patagonia mr master bowed be done when be in sound health be now not satisfied with then there be bow not word be spoken of course know that be very ill have be very much grieved to hear be sure must be for sake of old day when dr fanning be last here thought that grandson be something better held out stronger hope than before still be very ill mind have never wavered for moment mr master again mr master bowed now think that change must be made indeed that there must be new will doe wish to see mr morton not to day think be not quite prepared to day wanted to ask whether must come at moment notice quite at moment notice thought better so that must know why sent for if did send so that might be prepared must be done here suppose must be possible mr morton must do then there be long pause altering will be very serious thing mr morton when be done on what perhaps may be death bed be very serious thing indeed mr morton believe employ london solicitor know firm more respectable gentleman exist telegram must bring down one of firm from london by next train frown very heavy frown came across old woman brow must have repressed have be possible must not command frown be there if have be practicable mr master said must not have sent for be only suggesting madame what might be best course exactly of course be much obliged if be driven to call upon for assistance will find madame said attorney very slowly be of course part of business to make will when called upon to do so perform business to best of ability in altering will during illness great care be necessary codicil might be added new will must be necessary new will thought attorney must only be necessary for altering disposition of whole estate knew enough of family circumstance to be aware that property must go to reginald morton whether with without will also enough to be aware that old lady be reginald bitter enemy did not think that must bring to take instruction from dying man from squire of bragton on death bed for instrument must alienate property from proper heir too have strong feeling perhaps prejudice about bragton must wish that task be in other hand mr morton why so be hard to measure capacity of invalid mind be a clear a yours might be so yet might not be able to satisfy that be so must have to ask long tedious question must be offensive must find giving advice must not be called for for instance be grandson to wish to leave estate away from heir be not discussing wish mr master beg pardon mr morton for making suggestion a said before must prefer that must employ one else refuse then if mr morton be to send for must go to instantly fear might be slow in taking instruction be possible that might refuse to act on then got up from chair bowing to with stately displeasure left room have done without authority from grandson simply encouraged in object by saying in weakness that must think of proposition so intent be on business that be resolved to have everything ready if only must once be brought to say that peter morton must be heir having abandoned hope for noble cousin must tell conscience that be instigated simply by idea of justice peter morton be at rate legitimate son of well born father well born mother what have one belonging to to gain by forty year since brat have be born at bragton in opposition to wish by whose mean have be expelled from place now seemed to to be simple justice that must on account be robbed of must otherwise be naturally own a mr master must not serve turn must write to london lawyer thing must be more difficult nevertheless if sick man must once be got to say that peter must be heir thought that must keep to word lady ushant mr master went back to dillsborough in runciman fly need hardly be said that attorney said nothing of business have taken to bragton happened on wednesday wednesday rd of march on friday morning at o'clock during darkness of night john morton be lying dead on bed old woman be at bedside have done duty by a far a knew how in tending have be assiduous with diligence of much younger year

between teeth so said that dr nupper who be in room woman who be with must hear dr nupper took news into dillsborough a folk sat down to breakfast heard that squire of bragton be dead man have be too little known have be too short time in neighbourhood to give occasion for tear there be certainly more of interest than of grief in matter mr master said to that time have be too short for change in will therefore felt tolerably certain that reginald must be heir for day opinion be not general in dillsborough mr mainwaring have heard that reginald have be sent away from bragton with flea in ear be pretty certain that when will be read must be found that property be to go to mr morton friend dr be of same opinion there be many in dillsborough with whom reginald be not popular who thought that

conversation be ended can not refuse so slight request a seeing trouble to have put never saw man so forgetful of word can not speak have excuse to offer not word to say in explanation of conduct so black that think here in england ever heard case to equal if sister have be treated so must have be impossible believe cautious nature must have trusted man a trusted lip doubtless be never unfrozen till settlement have be signed with be matter of bargain not of love can well believe will not talk about sister seems to lord rufford that object to talk about anything certainly have be very uncommunicative with reference to be lying when told that loved did lie when told duchess that have promised love did lie when told mother that in day man doe not always mention marriage when asks girl to be wife said loved believed rest be thing of course meant know meant when held in arm in carriage know meant to suppose that must always be so then fear of sister came upon of sister husband ran away wonder whether think man yet felt that have not hit yet be wretched enough must see that be wretched wretchedness must pas away a soon a be gone how must stab so that wound must remain with what virus must poison arrow so that agony might be prolonged such coward too began to suspect when started that night from mistletoe though did not think then that must be mean cowardly from day to have not dared to speak word of truth word have be falsehood by heaven word falsehood lady lady whom have so deeply injured whose cruel injury even have not face to deny be forced by cowardice to come to here because have not dared to come out to meet be that true what good can do none to god know be such thing must not have now know though be twice lord rufford have chosen to speak mind to to tell what think did suppose that when said must meet face to face be to be deterred by such girl excuse a made chose to tell to face that be false coward gentleman though have hidden under very earth must have found then turned round saw sir george penwether standing close to lord rufford have seen approaching for time have made one two futile attempt to meet be back have be turned to house have not

miss trefoil whether will not come into lunch believe be lord rufford house said arabella if miss trefoil frame of mind will allow to sit at table with will be proud to see said lord rufford miss trefoil frame of mind will not allow to eat to drink with dastard said turning away in direction of park gate perhaps sir george will be kind enough to direct man who brought here to pick up at lodge so walked away mile across park of caring to follow seemed to a stood at lodge gate having obstinately refused to enter house to be eternity before fly came to when did come felt a though strength must barely enable to climb into when be there wept with bitter throbbing woe way to rufford be over now at rate now there be not possible chance on gleam of hope might be made to settle how handsome be how beautiful place how perfect must have be triumph must have achieved one more word one other pressure of hand in post chaise might have done have really promised marriage did not even now think that must have gone back from word if heavy stupid duke must have spoken to that night at mistletoe must have be well now now there be nothing for weeping gnashing of teeth be gone poor morton be gone

at rufford quarter session be afraid invitation be given in spirit of triumph over senator rather than with genuine hospitality be thought well that american must be made to see in public degradation of abject creature with whom have sympathised perhaps there be who thought that in way must get senator neck under heel if there be such be likely to be mistaken a senator be not man prone to submit to such treatment be seated at table with lady penwether miss penge when lord rufford brother in law came into room after parting with miss trefoil in manner described in last chapter lady penwether have watched unwelcome visitor a took way across park have whispered something to miss penge miss penge understood matter thoroughly must not herself have made slightest allusion to other young lady

in drawing room before went across hall even took up pair of field glass to scrutinise lady when be present asked whether be not miss trefoil whom have seen down by new fence lady penwether without seeming to look about did look about for few second to see whether question might be allowed to die away unanswered perceived from senator face that intended to have answer yes said be miss trefoil be very glad that be not coming in to disturb great blessing said miss penge where be staying asked senator think drove over from rufford said elder lady poor young lady be engaged to marry friend mr

cold melancholy upon too be fancy so with most of english lady miss trefoil always gave idea of being good type of english aristocracy lady penwether miss penge drew up very stiffly admired think lord very much indeed said lord rufford filling mouth with pigeon pie a spoke not lifting eye from plate will be back to dinner oh dear said lady penwether there be something in tone at last startled senator into perceiving that miss trefoil be not popular at rufford hall only came for morning call said lord rufford poor young woman have lost husband be afraid now have lost friend also be told that be not well off from what see hear fancy here in england young lady without dowry can not easily replace lover suppose too miss trefoil be not quite in first youth if have done caroline said lady

view mr gotobed be utilitarian rather than picturesque oh if say that be done for picturesque be thing lord rufford be wealthy lord can afford to be picturesque green sward must have thought handsomer a well a le expensive than ploughed field be matter of taste only why call pretty toy model farm might mislead british rustic have by time passed through couple of field formed part of model farm have

matter o that if happened on herring have not said cause be good mr runce will wish good evening sir george said farmer reining pony round good evening to sir mr runce trotted rather ambled off unable to endure word honest man dare say said senator certainly not bad specimen of british farmer not bad specimen of briton generally still perhaps little unreasonable after sir george said a little a must till have brought senator back to hall think be over now said lady penwether to miss penge when gentleman have left alone in afternoon be sure hope so for sake what woman to come here by in way think ever cared for in least ca say have troubled much about replied miss penge for sake of family generally property must be very very sorry to think that be going to make lady rufford dare say have amused with there be very little of a far a can learn very little encouragement indeed what saw here be worst of be hardly with at at mistletoe hope will make more cautious that be said miss penge miss penge be now great heiress having have lawsuit respecting certain share in welsh coal mine settled since last saw a world know came from one of oldest commoner family in west of england be moreover handsome young woman only twenty seven year of age lady think that be very woman to be mistress of rufford know miss penge be averse to idea lord rufford have be too lately wounded to rise at bait quite immediately sister know that brother be impressionable that little patience will go long way have however agreed at hall that arabella name will not again be mentioned chapter xv scrobby trial rufford be good deal moved a to trial of mr scrobby mr scrobby be man who not long since have held head up in rufford have reputation of well to do tradesman enemy have perhaps doubted probity have gone on prospered two three year before event be now chronicled have retired on competence have then taken house with few acre of land lying between rufford rufford property of lord rufford have commenced genteel life many in neighbourhood have be astonished that man must have be accepted a tenant in such house be generally understood that lord rufford have be very angry with agent mr scrobby did not prosper greatly in new career became guardian of poor quarrelled with board tried to become municipal counsellor in borough failed then quarrelled with landlord insisted on making change in ground be not authorised by term of holding must not pay rent be at last ejected having caused considerable amount of trouble then occupied portion of leisure with spreading calumny a to lordship be generally understood to have made up mind to be disagreeable a lord rufford be sportsman rather than anything else scrobby studied how might best give annoyance in direction time before goarly affair have succeeded in creating considerable disturbance when man will do pertinaciously when selected enemy be wealthy of high standing will generally succeed in getting party round in rufford there be not few who thought that lord rufford pheasant fox be nuisance though probably person have never suffered in way be grand thing to fight lord so scrobby have party when action against lordship be first threatened by goarly when be understood that scrobby have backed with money there be feeling that scrobby be doing rather fine thing have not indeed used money openly a senator have afterwards done be not scrobby way if goarly have be ill used help be legitimate party a party be proud of man when came to pas that poison have be laid down wholesale a hunting men said in dillsborough wood in close vicinity of goarly house then party hesitated such strategy a be disgusting be there reason to think that scrobby have be concerned in matter scrobby still have income ate roast meat boiled day for dinner be likely that man must deal in herring strychnine nickem have be at work for last three month backed up by fund have latterly be provided by lord agent have in truth run matter down nickem have found out about in pride have resigned stool in mr master office scrobby party in rufford must not bring to believe that nickem be correct that goarly hand have actually placed herring man either at rufford dillsborough have doubted such be now nickem story of what avail must be evidence of such man a goarly against man a scrobby must be utterly worthless unless corroborated scrobby party be not yet aware how clever nickem have be thus rufford be interested in case lord rufford sir george penwether lordship agent mr gotobed have be summoned a witness expenditure of money by senator having by time become notorious on morning of trial went into town in lordship drag senator a guest be on box seat with lordship a passed old runce trotting into rufford on nag mr gotobed began to tell story of yesterday meeting complaining of absurdity of old farmer anger penwether told about said lord suppose tenant be little crazy by mean thought be right in what said if understood penwether must have be right turned from in disgust simply because tried to explain to that rogue have a much right to be defended by law a honest man runce look upon men a vermin ought to be hunted down be not vermin be men till have be found guilty be innocent men if man have murdered child must be innocent in eye till be convicted hope so must be very anxious to bring home crime against must be found guilty even then must not be made subject to other punishment than that law award mr runce be angry with because think that goarly must be crushed under heel of neighbour take care lord did come round that corner rather sharp then lord rufford emphatically declared that such men a scrobby goarly must be crushed senator with inward sigh declared that between landlord tenant between peer farmer between legislator rustic there be in capacity for logical inference difference whatever british heart might be right british head be ah hopelessly wooden must be duty to say so in lecture perhaps good might be done to so gracious so stolid people if only must be got to listen scrobby have got down barrister from london therefore case be allowed to drag out through whole day lord rufford a magistrate went on to bench though explained that only took seat there a spectator sir george mr gotobed be also allowed to sit in high place though senator complained even of goarly scrobby be not allowed to be there lord rufford in opinion must also have be debarred from such privilege long time be occupied before even jury must be sworn barrister earning money by brow beating provincial bench putting various obstacle in way of trial a be used to practice at assize of course be able to domineer juror must not do that chairman be wrong in law officer of court knew nothing about at first there be quite triumph for scrobbyites even nickem be frightened at last real case be allowed to begin goarly be soon in witness box goarly did not seem to enjoy day be with difficulty got to tell own story even on own side story when be told be simple enough have met mr scrobby accidentally in rufford two have together discussed affair of young lord came to agreement that young lord be tyrant ought to be put down scrobby showed how be to be done scrobby instigated action about pheasant undertook to pay expense if goarly must act in other little matter when found that senator money be forthcoming have be anything a good a word goarly swore that in hard cash have never seen more than four shilling of scrobby money a to poison goarly declared that knew nothing about certainly have received parcel of herring from scrobby own hand in obedience to scrobby direction have laid down in dillsborough wood very morning on hound have come there owned that supposed that there might be something in herring something must probably be deleterious to hound a well a fox to child must herring happen to fall into child hand assured court that have knowledge of poison none then be made by other side to give complete somewhat prolonged account of own life up to present time information being of course required by learned barrister on other side in listening to senator did become thoroughly ashamed of briton whom have assisted with generosity must have be nothing have not nickem secured old woman who have sold herring also chemist from whom strychnine have be purchased a much a three year previously latter feat be nickem great triumph feeling of glory of induced to throw up employment in mr master office thus brought family to absolute ruin within few month in spite of liberal answer be made by lord rufford to many of numerous appeal away in poison have be purchased a much a three year ago yet nickem have have luck to find out when scrobbyites heard that scrobby have gone way to norrington to buy strychnine to kill rat be scrobbyites no longer hope will hang 'un do hope will hang 'un said mr runce quite out loud from crowded seat just behind attorney bench barrister of course struggled hard to earn money though must not save client might annoy other side insisted therefore on bringing whole affair of pheasant before court examined senator at great length asked senator whether have not found compelled to sympathise with wrong have witnessed senator declared that have witnessed no wrong why then have interfered because have thought that there might be wrong because wished to see what power poor man in country must have against rich one be induced still to think that goarly have be ill treated about pheasant must not take upon to say that have witnessed wrong done be quite sure that system on such thing be managed in england be at variance with even justice prevailed in own country yes by own country did mean mickewa must tell learned gentleman in spite of sneer in spite of evident ignorance of geography nowhere on earth surface be justice more purely administered than in great western state of mickewa be felt by everybody that senator have best of mr scrobby be sent into durance for twelve month with hard labour goarly be conveyed away in custody of police lest must be torn to piece by rough lover of hunting who be congregated outside when sentence have reached mr runce ear have be twice explained to first by one neighbour then by face assumed very look have worn when carried away victual from senator side at rufford hall when have turned pony round on own land on previous evening man have killed fox might have killed dozen hound be to be locked up only for twelve month indignantly asked neighbour what have come of van diemen land be use of botany bay on way back to rufford hall lord rufford must have be triumphant have not senator checked be bad state of thing altogether said of course promiscuous use of strychnine be objectionable rather said lordship be odd that utterly uneducated man one whom country have left to grow up in ignorance of brute must have recourse to measure however objectionable when law will absolutely give redress against trespass made by couple of hundred horseman lord rufford gave up feeling senator to be man with whom must not argue chapter xvi at last when once mr morton have taken departure for london on day after grandson death nothing further be heard of at bragton locked up everything took key away a though still hoping against hope that will might turn out to be other than expected when lawyer came down to read document brought key back with further tidings reached dillsborough respecting old woman still drew income a have done for century never even came to look at

lady ushant yielded returned once again to old home house in have be born gave up lodging at cheltenham word that said about possible marriage set mind at work induced to put sundry question to of course will marry said men who have property to leave behind usually do marry a be not wiser than others probably may do so will not admit that be matter of course may escape yet do hope will marry hope may be before die so may see disapprove of ten to one certainly will not if tell that love then will tell so to prevent disagreeable result be quite sure there must be somebody that like reginald said after pause be know have shown very strong preference be not disposed to praise for many thing really do think have be a undemonstrative a most men of age still did hope what did hope wo mention name think be right have observed that more harm than good come of such talking have determined always to avoid then there be pause remember how old be reginald when be to be done give at rate pleasure of knowing of course knew to whom alluded of course laughed at feeble caution must not say word to encourage to mention name of mary master thought that be sure be girl free must now ask to be wife if loved one be if have ever known woman with whom thought must be pleasant to share joy labour of life be mary master if must imagine that one constant companion must be joy to must be that person have be distinctly informed that be in love with one not for world must ask for have be given to not for world must hazard chance of refusal thought that must understand delight that must

here a well a in dillsborough object to lover if be of proper sort be sure mary must have anything else reginald told might do a pleased made further inquiry a to mary lover few day afterwards mary went with box to bragton mr master repeating objection repeating with little energy just at time stroke of good fortune befell master family generally greatly reduced power over husband reginald morton have spent hour in attorney office have declared purpose of restoring mr master to old family position in regard to bragton estate when heard felt at once that dominion be gone have based everything on growing inferiority of husband position now be about to have glory back again have inveighed against gentleman from day of marriage here be again to be immersed up to eye in affair of gentleman then have be so wrong about goarly lord rufford have be so much better client ready money have be so much more plentiful of late owing to poor john morton ready handed honesty have very little to say about when mary packed box be taken in mr runciman fly to bragton since old day old day of since day to reginald have referred when asked to pas over bridge with have never yet walked about bragton ground have often be to house visiting lady ushant have simply gone thither returned indeed when house have be empty walk from dillsborough to bridge back have be sufficient exercise for herself sister now must go whither listed bring memory to old spot with tenacity a to household matter characterised lady of country year since lady ushant employed morning of young friend in making inventory of everything be found in house afternoon be own wandered about with freedom have never known before at time reginald morton be up in london have be away nearly week have gone intending to be absent for undefined time so lady ushant mr hopkins be free from interruption be a yet only middle of march lion have not altogether disappeared still mary must get out did not care much for wind roamed about among leafless shrubbery thinking probably not of many thing meaning always to think of past unable to keep mind from future future must so soon be present how long must be before coming of stately dame be in quest of now have perhaps postponed demand upon till fortune have made rich of course have right to be sorry that have inherited property have be almost of right yet have be otherwise might not have have chance oh if have said word to only word more than have spoken already word might have sounded like encouragement to others beside then have be obliged to draw back because of duty owed to property how much worse must have be did own to herself that squire of bragton must not look for wife in house of dillsborough attorney a thought of tear ran down cheek trickled down on to wooden rail of little bridge there be one to give excuse now must come walk round with said voice close to ear oh mr morton how have startled be there anything matter mary said looking up into face only have startled so have that brought tear into eye well suppose so said trying to smile be so very quiet thought be in london so be morning now be here something else have made unhappy nothing wish must be friend mary wish must know secret have secret said boldly be there nothing what must there be mr morton tell why be cry be not cry just tear be not cry sometimes one doe get melancholy one ca cry when there be one to look so one doe alone 'd have be laughing if knew that be coming come round by kennel can get over wall ca oh yes will go down old orchard get out by corner of park fence then walked followed hardly keeping close by side thinking a went how foolish have be not to have avoided peril fresh trouble of such walk when be helping over wall held hand for moment be aware of unusual pressure be pressure of love of pretence of love young men perhaps old men sometimes permit to affect in ordinary way mary must have thought a little of a girl might feel dislike to man affair must be too light for resentment with man be different certainly be not justified in making slightest expression of factitious affection at rate must have felt bound to abstain from touch of peculiar tenderness must not say word must not even look at with angry eye twitched hand away from a sprang to ground then there be passage across orchard not more than hundred yard after stile at stile insisted on using own hand for custody of dress must not even touch outstretched arm be very independent said have to be so can not make out mary wonder whether there be still anything rankling in bosom against oh dear what must rankle with what indeed unless resent regard be not so rich in friend a to do mr morton suppose there can be many people who have same sort of feeling for have there be not many who have known so long certainly have friend know said more than one hope special friend who be mary know what mean mr morton then thought that be still alluding to lawrence twentyman tell mary what be to tell father say that there be one papa yes father then remembered how have be driven into half confession to father must not say there be nobody certainly must not say who one be must not be silent for by silence must be confessing passion for other man passion certainly have existence know why papa must talk about said certainly know why must repeat what said there be one clenched fist hit out at air with parasol knit brow a looked up at with glance of fire in eye have never seen there before believe mary said if ever girl have sincere friend have one in must not tease by impertinence in such matter will be a faithful to a sun do love one yes said turning round at with ferocity shouting out answer a pressed on who be mary what right have to ask what right can one have even aunt must not press a be doing aunt must not have same interest who be mary will not tell paused few moment walked on step two before spoke again must be said what ejaculated must be repeated one glance of eye stole round into face then face be turned quickly to ground parasol have be raised drooped listless from hand unconsciously hastened step became aware that tear be streaming from eye for moment two seemed to that be still hopeless if have more to say than certainly have not word have made tender of love have not told that in very truth be chosen one after be not sure that understood meaning of word must be tear be coming so quick that must see nothing of thing around did not dare even to put hand up to eye if wanted love if be possible that really wished for why did not ask for felt footstep close to hers be tempted to walk on quicker even than before then there came finger of hand round waist stealing gradually on till felt pressure of body on shoulder put hand up weakly to push back intruding finger only to leave tight in grasp then then be first moment in realized truth after did love surely must not hold there unless meant to know that loved mary said to speak be impossible turned round looked at with imploring eye mary say that will be wife chapter xvii own own husband yes have come at last a one may imagine to be certainty of paradise to doubting fearful despairing soul when have passed through gate of death found in new world reality of assured bliss so be assurance to conveyed by simple request mary say that will be wife did not seem to that answer be necessary will be required that spirit will assent to entrance into elysium be there room for doubt must never go back from word now must not have spoken word have not be quite quite certain have loved time when be so hard to must have be so have loved bright one even when thought that be to be given to clay bound rustic lover perhaps be sweetest of though in draining sweet draught have to accuse herself of hardness blindness injustice must be real be true that have foot firmly placed in paradise be there close to with arm still round finger grasped within word wife be still in ear surely sweetest word in language what protestation of love must have be so eloquent a question will be wife true man thought ever ought to ask question in other form eye be still full of tear a went knew not where be going have forgotten surroundings being only aware that be with that other eye be on then there be stile on reaching withdrew arm stood facing with back leaning against why do weep said mary why do not answer question if there be anybody else must tell now there be nobody else said almost angrily there never be there never must be yet there be somebody pouted lip at glancing up into face for second then again hung head down mary grudge delight do if there can be delight to in so poor thing have then must kiss dear gently came to oh so gently with head still hanging creeping towards shoulder thinking perhaps that motion must have be still obeying then leaning against seemed a though must stoop with lip to hand did not endure seizing quickly in arm drew up till not unwilling face be close to there kept till be almost frightened by violence now mary what do say to question have to be answered know will not do will have in word will not be shorn of delight that must be delight to be very essence of heaven tell what to say answered how may say best reginald morton began reginald repeated after went farther in naming because love better than other being in world do ah say because love oh so much better than world besides therefore own own husband therefore own own then paused say word own own husband will be true wife will be own true loving wife then kissed again that said be little marriage ceremony under god sky other can be more binding a soon a in plentitude of maiden power will fix day for other one when can get over then will begin little journey together reginald well dear have said anything have thought have said have said for say what want will repeat quite a well a did ca do say will be true husband for rest of journey by mean to be understood that take into partnership on equal term be to be allowed to manage business just a please yes that will said quite in earnest only a be practical be vague doubt that everything will fall into hand before five year be over that will have to be told whether can afford to buy new book when be to ask gentry to dinner now be laughing at because will know so little about anything come dear let get over stile go on for field will never get round park then jumped over after just touching hand be not laughing at at in least doubt that in very little time will know everything about everything be so much afraid need be know well enough for suppose have taken one a young woman who be here with poor cousin oh heaven perhaps ought to have done so thank lord that hath delivered ought ought to have chosen lady of high standing said mary thinking with ineffable joy of stately dame who be not to come to bragton do know what be thinking only other day about that have gone up to london to look for proper sort of person how did mean to receive must have received at must have gone away ca do now ca what be thanking lord for so heartily for be be sweetest thing have said yet own darling dearest if only can so live that may be able to thank lord for in year to come will not trouble reader with be said at stile doubt very much of what have be told be repeated again again so that walk round park be abnormally long at last however reached house a entered hall mary whispered to who be to tell aunt said come along replied striding upstairs to aunt bedroom where knew must be at time opened door without notice having waited till mary have joined led forcibly into middle of room here be said wife elect oh reginald have managed there need be more said about except to settle day mary have be looking about house learning duty already will be able to have bedstead chair by heart be advantage lady seldom posse then mary rushed forward be received into old woman arm when reginald left did very soon after announcement be made lady ushant have great deal to say have be thinking of dear oh for year ever since came to hoppet hall be sure best way be never to say anything if have interfered there be knowing how might have be then dear lady ushant be so glad did said mary being tolerably sure at same time within own bosom that loving old friend must have done harm in direction must say word though be always thinking of then be so odd one can know what mean sometimes be what made think when mr twentyman be so very pressing must must have be possible poor young man always told be impossible wonder whether cared about reginald time in answer to mary only hid face in old woman lap dear suppose did all along be sure be better not to say anything now what will papa mamma say will hardly believe at first hope will be glad glad why what do suppose must want to do dear papa dear mamma too because have really be good to wonder when must be then question be discussed at great length lady ushant have great deal of very good advice to bestow did like long engagement be very essential for reginald welfare that must settle at bragton a soon a possible mary plea for long day be not very urgent that evening at bragton be rather long rather dull be almost first that have ever passed in company with reginald there now seemed to be necessity of doing something peculiar whereas there be nothing peculiar to be done be custom to betake to book after dinner must hardly do so with ease in company with girl who have just promised to be wife lady ushant too wished to show extreme joy made flattering vain attempt to be ecstatic mary to tell truth be longing for solitude feeling that must not yet realise happiness not even when be in bed must reduce mind to order must have be impossible even have remained comparatively humble lord of hoppet hall that squire of bragton must be promised husband be marvel so great that from short slumber waked with fear of treacherous dream minute sleep might rob of joy declare to in moment of waking that be hallucination be not that be dearer to that condition be happier because of position wealth that chance of inheritance have lifted so infinitely above thought of little room at home generally shared with one of sister of too scanty wardrobe of daily task about house of stepmother late severity of father care surely must not hinder from being good to surely must let young girl come to from time to time what added happiness must be if must allow to pas on to spark of prosperity be bestowing on then thought travelled on to poor larry must not be more contented now now when must be certain that further frantic effort must avail anything poor larry must reginald permit to regard a friend must submit to friendly treatment must look forward see happy with wife best loved of neighbour for who be there in world better than larry did not know how two men who have be lover must allow to be brought together oh what peril have be there be other day have striven so hard to give lie to love to become larry wife shuddered beneath bedclothes a thought of danger have run one word must have changed paradise into perpetual wail of tear waste of desolation when woke in morning from long sleep effort be wanting to tell that be true oh if have slipped from then if have waked after such dream to find loving in despair with sore bosom angry heart met downstairs early in study having first request to make to might go in at once after breakfast tell suppose

engaged to marry richest gentleman in neighbourhood in expression of joy must be driven to confess how wrong have always be how often have asked what must come of ushanting be that have come of ushanting girl have be made fit to be companion of one a reginald morton have now fallen into position be suited to of course will see nothing of now said in whimpering voice be not gracious speech be

nearly going in last affair sir george in matter did not quite agree with wife be in opinion right to avoid miss trefoil did not see why brother in law must be precipitated into matrimony with miss penge according to idea in such matter man must be left alone therefore a be customary with when opposed wife held tongue have be called in three four time when have be just on edge of cliff know that be reason why must be pushed over there be not word to be said against caroline have fine fortune of own of best blood in kingdom if brother doe not care for be nonsense george a for liking be same to rufford be good natured easily pleased can like woman caroline be very good looking great deal handsomer than horrid creature ever be with manner fit for position have reason to wish to force wife on of course will marry unless be guided will certainly marry badly be miss penge in love with asked sir george in tone of voice be intended to be provoking wife looked at asking plainly by countenance whether be such fool a be likely that untitled young lady of eight twenty must be wanting in capacity of being in love with young lord handsome possessed of forty thousand year without encumbrance sir george though did not approve be not eager enough in disapproval to lay serious embargo on wife proceeding first step taken be in direction of hero personal comfort be flattered petted a sister knew how to flatter pet miss penge in quiet way assisted lady penwether in operation for day two have not much to say for word did say be oracle horse be spoken of a demigod projected fishing operation for june july became matter of most intense interest evil thing be said of arabella trefoil in evil thing said hint be given that lord rufford have behaved badly have be in danger lady penwether not quite knowing state of mind thought that there might still be lurking affection for young lady did ever see anybody look so vulgar hideous a did when marched across park asked lady penwether thank goodness did not see said miss penge never saw look so handsome a when came up to said lord rufford thing to do awful said miss penge be pluckiest girl ever came across in life said lord rufford knew very well what be at be already almost inclined to think that might a well be allowed to have way miss penge be ladylike quiet good be like cool salad in man mouth after spiced meat money must enable to buy purefoy property must probably be soon in market felt that might a well give little trouble before allowed to be hooked certainly be not by arrangement of own that found walking alone with miss penge that sunday afternoon in park did seem to be by hers thought of other sunday at mistletoe when have be compelled to wander with arabella when met duchess when a often told little more good nature little more courage on grace part must have completed work entirely certainly have duke come to that night after journey from stamford must have capitulated a walked along allowed to be talked to by miss penge did tell that must be better angel of two must not hunt with a arabella must have done then man doe not want wife to gallop across country after might perhaps object to cigar soda water after eleven o'clock then what assurance have that arabella must not have objected still more loudly have sworn that must never be opposed to little pleasure knew what such oath be worth marriage altogether be bore having name large fortune be incumbent on to transmit to immediate descendant perhaps be worse bore to grow old without having specially bound other human being to interest how well recollect spot said miss penge be there that major caneback took fence be not where fell oh no did not see that must have haunted for ever have done so be there that thought must kill be terrible time lord rufford terrible to poor caneback certainly yes to of do remember fearful ball be so unhappy because suffered so much be bad that woman who persecuted knew that felt felt that poor man death yes felt other nuisance too remember that told that must cling on to leg eleanor said so when be explained to what clinging on to leg meant remember saying that wished to be understood a being one to help love sister so well that anything must break heart must make unhappy did not care for own welfare in matter what ought say lord rufford in answer to of course did care knew that be impossible that must really set affection on person a miss trefoil told eleanor that must come to nothing be sure of why must have come to nothing a call because be gentleman because be not lady know that woman can quite understand how be that men amuse yourselves with such person did amuse never thought did very much there be something suppose in riding something in audacity something perhaps in vivacity through did not think that be enjoying may be sure of lord rufford that when woman be not specially liked by other woman ought not to be specially liked by man have never heard that miss trefoil have female friend from day to day there be little meeting conversation of kind till lord rufford found accustomed to miss penge solicitude for welfare in passed between lady affected status be altogether removed from of making receiving love there have come to be peculiar friendship because of eleanor week of kind of thing have not gone by before miss penge found able to talk of absolutely to describe peculiar feeling must almost say how pleasant be such friendship divested of burden of amatory possibility through lord rufford knew that must have to marry miss penge be not long before yielded in pure weariness who have not felt a stood by stream into knew that be fate to plunge folly of delaying shock in present condition have ease sister threatened with return of arabella miss penge required from sensational conversation brother in law be laughing at in sleeve very hunting friend treated a though time be come in that did young lady took interest bored excessively to put end to only saw one certain way therefore asked to be lady rufford before got on drag to go out hunting on last saturday in march rufford said looking up into face with lustrous eye speaking with sweet low silvery voice be sure of oh yes quite sure of never so sure in life then dearest dearest rufford will not scruple to say that also be sure so thing be settled very much to comfort must hardly have done better have sought through england for bride will be true to never give cause for moment jealousy will like title house property will never spend shilling more than ought to do will look very sharply after will not altogether debar from accustomed pleasure will grace table nurse child never for moment give cause to be ashamed of will think that love after lapse of ten fifteen year will probably really be fond of from moment that be lady rufford will love a love everything be own in spite of antecedent one doubted faith in engagement one wished to hurry very much when proposition have be made accepted when hero of have gone off on drag miss penge communicated tidings to friend think have behaved very wisely said lady penwether well feeling a do of course think have hope think same of have many doubt about do believe that can make good wife lady penwether thought that friend be hardly sufficiently thankful strove to tell so in own gentle friendly way miss penge held head up be very stout must not acknowledge cause for gratitude lady penwether when saw how be to be gave way little close friendship with future sister in law must be very necessary to comfort miss penge since law suit be settled have never be given to yielding dear rufford said sister affectionately congratulate with heart do indeed be quite sure that must not have done better know must be gem of inestimable price most warmly attached to if property be to be bought of course money will be great thing money be always comfortable of course be then there be nothing to be desired if have named girl must have wished to love must have be caroline penge need hardly have said a have in fact be naming girl for last three four month news be soon spread about country fashionable world everybody be pleased except trefoil family chapter xxi arabella success when arabella trefoil got back to portugal street after visit to rufford be ill effort have made unaccustomed labour necessity of holding aloft before man who have rejected be together more than strength must bear be taken up to bed in fainting condition be not till next morning that be able even to open letter contained news of john morton legacy when have read letter realized content took to weeping in fashion very unlike usual habit be still in bed there remained for two three day during have time to think of past life to think also little of future old mr green came to once twice day be necessarily left to nursing of own maid evening mounser green called sent up tender enquiry in there be very little to comfort there lay with letter in hand thinking that only man who have endeavoured to be of service to be whom have treated with unexampled perfidy other men have petted have amused with then thrown over have lied to laughed at till have be taught to think that man be heartless cruel slippery animal made indeed to be caught occasionally in catching of infinite skill be wanted in infinite skill might be thrown away man have be true to to last in spite of treachery knew that be heartless that belonged to heartless world knew also that there be world of woman who be not heartless such woman have looked down upon a from great height in return have be able to ridicule have chosen part have chosen hers have thought that might climb to glory of wealth rank while must have to marry hard working clergyman briefless barrister have often be called upon to vindicate to herself part have chosen have always done so by magnifying in own mind sin of men with whom have to deal at moment thought that lord rufford have treated villainously whereas conduct to have be only that necessity of case required to lord rufford have simply behaved after manner of class heartless of course only in way custom of trade justified have tried to circumvent other a weaker have gone to wall john morton have believed in loved oh how wished that have deserted class clung to even though must now have be widow legacy be burden to even have conscience enough to be sorry for day two that have named in will what must do with for future quarrel with mother have be very serious swearing under circumstance must again consent to live with other daughter of course knew that mother must receive again must ask to be received in such case must go back with shortened pinion blunted beak sojourn with mr green be to last for one month at end of time must seek for home if put john morton legacy out to interest must now be mistress of small income understood money well enough to know to what obduracy of poverty must thus be subjected a looked matter closer in face horror became more startling more manifest who must have in house where must find society where possibility of lover must be life what prospect must give up for ever game for have lived own that have be conquered in fight beaten even to death then thought over long list of past lover trying to see whether there might be one of least desirable at whom might again cast javelin there be not one tender message from mounser green came to day by day mounser green a nephew of hostess have be very kind to hitherto have never appeared to in light of possible lover be clerk in foreign office waiting for aunt money man whom have met in society whom knew to be well thought of by above in wealth rank have never regarded a prey a man whom girl must want to marry be one of of other sex who must most probably look out for prey who if married at must marry heiress in time have be on good term with many such one have counted among intimate friend have made use of be useful to have never dreamed of marrying one of be there in society for altogether different purpose have not hesitated to talk to mounser green about lord rufford though have pretended to make secret of place to be going when have taken to railway have not at all objected to understanding purpose up to moment there have certainly be thought on part of transferring what be wont to call affection to mounser green a suitor a lay in bed thinking of future life tidings be brought to by mr green mounser have accepted mission to patagonia must be that destiny intended to go out to patagonia a wife if not of one minister then of there must be career way of living if not exactly that must have chosen of patagonia a place of residence have already formed idea in of moment in have foreseen that lord rufford must be lost to have told that must be better to reign in hell than serve in heaven among patagonian woman must probably be first among english lady did not seem at present have prospect of high place must be long before lord rufford must be forgotten have not space enough before for forgettings must require time for accomplishment mounser green have declared with energy that lord rufford have behaved very badly there be men who feel to be mission to come in for relief of lady who have be badly treated if mounser green wished to be one of on behalf to take out with to very far away employment might not be best possible solution of present difficulty on evening of third day after return be able to come down stair line of thought have be suggested for induced to undertake trouble with white pink robe dressing gown in have appeared well dear be smart old lady said 'odious in woollen 'twould saint provoke be last word poor narcissa spoke ' said arabella who have long since provided herself with quotation for such occasion hope be not exactly dying mr green see why must not object to be 'frightful a well a young lady who be suppose be done for mounser benefit partly for partly for mounser good deal for what very odd name why did call mounser used to think be because be in foreign office kind of chaff a being frenchman mother maiden name be mounser be french at see why must not be a good christian name a willoughby howard quite a good much more distinctive there ca be mounser green in world very few other young men like at time of life find very hard going away what will do in place a alone without wife why make take wife there be time now will have to start in may plenty of time trousseau be now got up by steam girl be kept ready to marry at shortest notice if be must certainly advise to take out healthy young woman capable of bearing inclemency of patagonian climate a for that climate be delicious said mr green who certainly be not led by guest manner to suspect nature of guest more recent intention mounser green on afternoon came to portugal street before went out to dinner choosing hour at aunt be wont to adorn so be to be hero of patagonia said arabella a put out hand to congratulate on appointment know about heroism seems that be to go there said mounser with much melancholy in voice must have thought be last man to leave london willingly well yes must have said so do flatter will be missed what have before here may lead to something indeed will be missed mr green be very kind of to say so patagonia be such long way off then began to consider whether have ever heard of engagement with last minister elect to country that must know about lord rufford be matter of course what chance must there be for if also knew that other affair be intimately acquainted with mr morton in washington be surprised that must have accepted poor morton be friend of mine used to call paragon because never made mistake have heard that lady augusta be good deal with in washington be indeed know good news a yet suppose paragon a call have left five thousand pound of course must be necessary that must know day if new plan of hers be to be carried out if plan must fail knowing must do harm how very nice for poor morton be well that somebody must behave well when others treat one so badly mr green yes have left five thousand pound then showed lawyer letter perhaps a be so separated at present from own people by affair with lord rufford must not mind seeing man for of course promised to see lawyer to do everything be necessary truth be mr green mr morton be very warmly attached to be foolish girl must not return thought of long be then obliged to tell must not entertain just sort of feeling for can not think now how bitter be regret must have allowed to trust man so false treacherous a lord rufford must have perhaps added pang to deathbed of one so good a mr morton so told little story not caring very much whether be believed not finding to be absolutely essential that story must be told during next day two mounser green thought great deal about that story be not exactly true knew very well be not to be expected that girl before marriage must be exactly true about old love that have be engaged to lord rufford have be cruelly jilted by did believe that have at one time be engaged to paragon be almost sure fact that paragon have left money be strong argument that have not behaved badly to there be much that be quite certain five thousand pound be quite certain money though must not be called large fortune for young lady must pay debt send out free man to patagonia family honour be certainly true be undoubted niece of duke of mayfair connection might in career be of service to lord mistletoe be prig must probably be member of government mounser green liked duke loved duchess in heart of heart if must only be assured that niece must not be repudiated thought that speculation might answer in spite of ambiguity in lady antecedent have heard about arabella good fortune young glossop asked next morning at office forget boy said mounser green that young lady of whom speak be friend of mine oh lord so did beg pardon old fellow there be one else in room at moment glossop in asking question have in truth forgotten what have heard of new intimacy learn to be ill natured glossop remember that there be form so bad a of calling young lady by christian name do know that poor morton have left miss trefoil sum of money be at rate evidence that thought well of to last of course be did mean to offend must do for world a be going away that afternoon when green back be turned glossop gave a opinion that something particular must turn up between mounser miss trefoil opinion brought down much ridicule upon from hoffmann archibald currie before week be over in early day of april be forced to retract opinion to do honour to young glossop sagacity mounser green be engaged to miss trefoil for day two foreign office must talk of nothing else very handsome girl said lord drummond to one of subordinate met at mistletoe a to affair with lord rufford treated abominably when mounser showed at office did boldly immediately after engagement be made known received with open arm congratulated sincerely on happy fortune be quite contented with what have done thought that be taking out for very wife for patagonia chapter xxii wedding sooner did new two lover mounser green arabella trefoil understand other than set wit to work to make best of natural advantage latter communicated fact in very dry manner to father mother nothing be to be got from be only just necessary that must know what intended to do with dear mamma be to be married time early in may to mr mounser green of foreign office think know daresay have heard of go to patagonia immediately after wedding will go with affectionate daughter arabella trefoil be said letter to father be word for word same how to make use of friend who be more happily circumstanced be matter for frequent counsel between mr green in day think that concealed very much from to tell little detail of adventure with lord rufford must have be useful pleasant a to chief fact reticence must have be foolish to statement that lord rufford have absolutely proposed to clung fast really did believe that have be engaged to john morton did not deny threw blame of matter on mother explained to that have broken off engagement down at bragton because must not bring to regard man with sufficient personal favour mounser be satisfied be very strong in urging to seek yet once again favour of magnificent uncle magnificent aunt what good can do said arabella who be almost afraid to make appeal must be everything for to be married from mistletoe said people must know

created considerable amount of attention goarly affair with subsequent trial of scrobby have be much talked about senator doings in reference to have be made matter of comment in newspaper have praised for courage benevolence steadfast purpose others have ridiculed inability to understand manner different from of own country have seen good deal of society in london in country have never hesitated to express opinion with audacity have called insolence when have trodden with whole weight hard down on individual corn of course have given offence a on memorable occasion of dinner at parson house in dillsborough on whole have produced for general respect among educated men be not diminished by fact that seemed to count quite a little on a on ill will abuse of others for day previous to delivery of lecture hoarding in london be crowded with sesquipedalian notice of entertainment so senator gotobed great oration on irrationality of englishman be looked to with considerable interest when intelligent japanese travel in great britain intelligent briton in japan be struck with wonder at national difference be on other hand rather startled to find how like strange brother be to in many thing crime be persecuted wickedness be condoned goodness treated with indifference in country men care more for what eat than anything else combine closely defined idea of meum with lax perception a to tuum barring little difference of complexion feature englishman must make good japanese japanese first class englishman when american come to briton go to state speaking same language using same cookery governed by same law wearing same costume difference present be so striking that can live six month in country of other without holding up of hand torrent of exclamation in nineteen case out of twenty surprise ejaculation take place of censure intelligence of american displayed through nose worry englishman unconscious self assurance of englishman not always unaccompanied by sneer irritates american meet a might lad from harrow from mr brumby successful mechanical cramming establishment harrow boy can not answer question be sure that be proper thing be ready to face world on assurance mr brumby paragon be shocked at other inaptitude for examination be at same time tortured by envy of know not what in spirit american englishman go on writing book about other sometimes with bitterness enough generally with good final result in meantime there have sprung up jealousy make inclined to hate other at first sight hate be difficult expensive between individual soon give place to love can not bear american a rule though have be very lucky with few friend who in england have not heard that form of speech over over again what englishman have travelled in state without hearing abuse of english institution uttered amidst pause of free handed hospitality have left nothing to desire mr senator gotobed have expressed mind openly wheresoever went being man of immense energy be not content with such private utterance must not liberate soul without doing something in public to convince cousin that in general practice of life be not guided by reason have object of making money to give due must own that have object of making fame be impelled by intense desire to express often amount to passion with sometimes to fury with american hardly considered much what reception word might receive be only when be told by others that lecture might give offence possibly must turn to violence that made inquiry a to attendance of police though must tear to piece must say what have to say must not be fault if absurdity of people whom really loved be not exposed to light so that might be acknowledged abandoned have found time to travel to birmingham to manchester to liverpool to glasgow to other place really thought that have mastered great subject have worked very hard be probably premature in thinking that knew england thoroughly have however undoubtedly dipped into great many matter must probably have told many englishman much that did know about own affair have poked nose everywhere have scrupled to ask question have seen misery of casual ward despair of expiring strike amenity of city slum stolid apathy of rural labourer home have measured animal food consumed by working class knew exact amount of alcohol swallowed by average briton have seen also luxury of baronial hall pearl drinking extravagance of commercial palace unending labour of pleasure seeker a with lord rufford dullness of ordinary country life a experienced by at bragton now be going to tell english people at large what thought about great room at st james hall have be secured for occasion lord drummond minister of state in foreign affair have be induced to take chair in day government be very anxious to be civil to foreigner there be nothing that robust secretary of state will not do for on platform there be many member of house of parliament almost everybody connected with foreign office ticket have be taken for week since front bench be filled with wife daughter of on platform back behind into distant space in seeing be difficult hearing impossible crowd be gathered at s d head of be going to great british charity from half past seven to eight piccadilly regent street be crammed when senator came with chairman must hardly make way in at door great treat be expected there be among officer of police who thought that portion of audience must not bear quietly hard thing must be said that there be uncanny gathering of rough about street who be not prepared to be on best behaviour when must be told that old england be being abused lord drummond opened proceeding by telling audience in voice clearly audible to reporter first half dozen bench that have come there to hear what well informed distinguished foreigner thought of country must not be sure expect to be flattered than flattery nothing be more useless ignoble gentleman coming from new country in tradition be of avail on custom of former century have have opportunity to engraft have seen many thing here in eye must not justify by reason lord drummond be little too prolix for chairman at last concluded by expressing conviction that countryman must listen to distinguished senator with courtesy be due to foreigner due also to great brotherly nation from have come then senator rose clapping of hand kicking of heel be most satisfactory there be at rate prejudice at onset english lady gentleman said be in unenviable position of having to say hard thing to for about hour half together if drive from seat before lecture be done be more pity because must talk to for three hour about country not say unpleasant word lordship have told that flattery be not purpose be praise must not be flattery why must collect three four thousand people here to tell of virtue consciousness of be inheritance of of be brave generous be lovely to look at with sweetly polished manner know that quite well enough without telling strike that know how little prone be to admit light of reason into public private life how generally allow yourselves to be guided by tradition prejudice custom must be obsolete if will consent to listen to what one foreigner think though be man of account may perchance gather from word something of opinion of bystander in general so be able perhaps little to rectify gait costume tone of voice a be apt to do when come from private home out among eye of public be received very well senator spoke with clear sonorous voice doubt with twang so audibly a to satisfy room in general will not said dwell much on form of government be to praise republic might seem to belittle throne lady who sits on offence must not be endured for moment by english ear will take monarchy a be simply remarking that recondite form be very hard to be understood by foreigner that seem to to be for most part equally dark to native have hardly a yet met two englishman who be agreed a to political power of sovereign most of of whom have enquired have assured that matter be one a to have not found worth while to make inquiry here voice from end of hall made protestation nature of protest did not reach platform continued senator now rising into energy tho ' will not meddle with form of government may hope be allowed to allude to political agent by be conducted be proud of parliament be said voice wonder of house ask question that may be answered because be advisable at present moment that there must be only one speaker that labour be unfortunately for at present in hand be sure will agree with that must not be divided mean probably that be proud of house of common that be so because speaks with voice of people voice of people in order that may be heard without unjust preponderance on side on requires much manipulation that manipulation have in latter year be effected by reform bill of during last half century there have in fact be four five latter in favour of ballot having be perhaps greatest there have be bill for purity of election very necessary bill for creating constituency bill for abolishing bill for dividing bill for extending suffrage bill if be not mistaken for curtailing have be result how many men be there in room who know respective nature of vote be there single woman who know political worth of husband vote passing other day from bank of great metropolis to suburb called brentford journeying a did whole way through continuous row of house found at first in very ancient borough returning four member double usual number not because of population because have always be so here be informed that resident have little nothing to do with be told though did not quite believe what heard that there be resident voter however at rate influential voter never pas night there combine city franchise with franchise elsewhere then went through two enormous borough one so old a to have great political history of own other so new a to have none did strike a odd that there must be new borough with new voter new franchise not yet ten year old in midst of city of london when came to brentford everything be changed be not in town at though be surrounded on side by house everything around be grim dirty enough be supposed to have reached politically rustic beauty of country around who have vote voted for county of middlesex on other side of invisible border have just past poor wretch with day who lived in grimy lodging half built hut who at rate possessed political privilege now have suddenly emerged among aristocrat quite state of thing prevailed be that reasonable manipulation of vote of people doe that arrangement give to man equal share in country yet fancy that thing be so little thought of few among be aware that in way largest class of british labour be excluded from franchise in country boast of equal representation chief object of first reform bill be that of realising very fact of representation up to time member of house of common be in truth deputy of lord of other rich men lord mr b perhaps lady c sent whom pleased to parliament to represent that town occasionally that county that absurdity be supposed to be past on evil have be cured one must dwell how be now have list in memory for must not care to make out so black catalogue in legible letter of forty member who have be returned to present house of common by single voice of influential person what will not forty voice do even in parliament if can count forty how many more must there be of have not heard then there be voice calling upon senator to name men other voice denying fact will name one said senator how must tell what noble friend might put on stool of repentance by doing so looked round on gentleman on platform behind defy member of parliament here present to get up say that be not so then paused moment if be so be that rational be that in accordance with theory of representation a to have be so ardent profess to be so dear to be country not over ridden by aristocracy when lord lambswool not only posse own hereditary seat in house of lord also have seat for eldest son in house of common then voice from back called out what deuce be to chapter xxiv senator lecture no ii if see man hungry in street said senator instigated by question asked at end of last chapter give bit of bread do for own sake for up to time britisher around on platform in bench near to have received what said with good grace allusion to lord lambswool have not be pleasant to have not be worse than have expected now be displeased did not like being told that be taking bit of bread from in own political destitution did not like that individual must presume that have bread to offer to a nation yet have argued out in own mind must have seen that senator metaphor be appropriate purpose in being there be to give advice theirs in coming to listen to be unfortunate when ventured to come before here made business continued senator then paused glanced round hall with defiant look now about house of lord went on have not much to say about house of lord because if understand rightly feeling of country be already condemned such thing who told that know nothing about other word of curt denial came from distant corner slight murmur of disapprobation be heard even from seat on platform then lord drummond got up begged that there might be silence mr gotobed have come there to tell view a have come there expressly to listen to must not without impropriety interrupt that such will be feeling of country before long continued senator think one can doubt who have learned how to look to sign of time in such matter be possible that theory of hereditary legislature can be defended with reason for legislature want best wisest of people get in america said voice be beginning to be recognised try at rate said senator now be possible that accident of birth must give excellence wisdom what be result not tenth of hereditary legislator assemble in beautiful hall that have built for of tenth greater half consists of counsellor of state who have be placed there in order that business of country may not be brought to standstill hereditary chamber be fiction supplemented by element of election election resting generally in very bosom of house of common on subject although have promised to be short said much more be received for most part in silence when ended by telling that must have right to call free people till legislator in country be elected by vote of people murmur be heard through hall told said waxing more more energetic a felt opposition be bound to overcome that what have to say to must not be pleasant if can not endure to hear let break up go away in case must tell friend at home that tender ear of british audience can not bear rough word from american lip yet if think of have borne rough word from have borne with good humour again paused a none rose from seat went on proceeding from hereditary legislature come to hereditary property be natural that man must wish to give to child after death property have enjoyed during life let ask man here who have not be born eldest son whether be natural that must wish to give to one son must man think of doing so by light of own reason out of own head a say must man be so unjust to who be equal in love be not constrained by law by custom more iron handed even than law senator have here made mistake very common with american great many voice be on at once what law there be law know nothing about go back learn what cried senator coming forward to extreme verge of platform putting down foot a though there be strength enough in leg to crush will one have hardihood to tell that property in country be not affected by primogeniture go back learn law know law perhaps better than most of do mean to assert that lord lambswool can leave land to whom plea tell that have more than life interest in that son will only have same then eager briton on platform got up whispered to senator for few minute during murmuring be continued friend reminds said senator that matter be one of custom rather than law be obliged to custom be damnable cruel be backed by law be equally so if have land can not only give to eldest son can assure right of primogeniture to son though be not yet born one think will deny that there must be special law to enable to commit injustice so unnatural a hence come that still suffer under aristocracy almost a dominant in essence a irrational a created feudalism gentleman collected on platform looked at other smiled perhaps failing to catch exact meaning of senator word lord here have power a lord can not fathom of daily make unconscious most deleterious use be brought up to think natural that must be tyrant proclivity of order be generous a rule give more than take be a injurious in one process a in other ordinary briton in dealing with lord expects payment in shape for repetition of absurd title payment be made titled aristocrat pay dearer for horse dearer for coat dearer for servant than other people in return exacts much other person can get knowing own magnanimity expects that word will not be questioned if may be allowed will tell little story a to one of most generous gentleman have have happiness of meeting in country will explain meaning then without mentioning name told story of lord rufford goarly scrobby in such way a partly to redeem with audience acknowledged how absolutely have be befooled how have be done out of money by misplaced sympathy made mr goarly goose immortal in imitating indignation of runce farmer bean gamekeeper showed that be master of considerable humour brought round at last to own purpose ended episode of lecture by view of absurdity illegality of british hunting can talk about to said will know whether be speaking truth when get home among own people repeat lecture there a will do with little addition a to good thing have found here from ear may be spared will omit story a know will be impossible to make countryman believe that hundred harum scarum tomboy may ride at pleasure over man land destroying crop trampling down fence going if vermin lead there with reckless violence into sweet domestic garden of country residence that one can either stop punish american will believe much about wonderful way of british cousin american will be got to believe till see find said that irrationality a have ventured to call run through profession will take church a being highest at rate in object then recapitulated argument against mode of dispensing church patronage with reader be already familiar if have attended to senator earlier word a given in chronicle in other line of business there be even here in attempt made to get man best suited for work have to do if one want domestic servant set about work of getting proper person in very determined manner indeed for care a call cure of soul have to put up with man who have bought right to minister to want with whose father want mean of living for younger son elder being destined to swallow family property with who have become sick of drinking wine in oxford college with again who have pleaded cause successfully with bishop daughter be not often that british public be angered by abuse of church part of lecture be allowed to pas without strong mark of disapprobation have be at trouble continued to learn very complex rule by army be now regulated by be regulated very short time since unhappily for have found in state of transition nothing be so difficult to stranger comprehension a transition state of affair can see plainly that improvement be made be received by whom most concern with horror amount almost to madness so lovely to ancient british well born feudal instinct be state of unreason that very absence of principle endears to institution one can attempt to support by argument have thing not existed a right to purchase military promotion must satirist have be listened to who have suggested a possible outcome of british irrationality think what carry with man who have proved fit to serve country by serving in twenty foughten field who have bled for country perhaps preserved country will rot in obscurity because have money to buy promotion whereas young dandy who have done more than glitter along pavement with sword spur will have command of men because have so many thousand dollar in pocket buncombe shouted inimical voice be buncombe asked intrepid senator will one who know what be talking about say that be describing state of thing did not exist yesterday will acknowledge that have be rectified tho ' see symptom of relapse fault have be mended be fault no longer what speak of now be disruption of concord in army caused by reform have forced upon loyalty have gone love of profession must be breath of soldier nostril fine body of fighting hero be broken hearted not because injury have be done to to of because system have become peculiarly british by reason of special absurdity therefore peculiarly dear buncombe again said voice word be now repeated by dozen voice let one show that be buncombe if say what be untrue do with what please if be ignorant set right laugh at if what say be true then interruption be surely sign of imbecility say that change be forced upon by feeling of people that very expediency have demoralized army because army be irrational how be with navy what be to believe when hear so many conflicting statement among yourselves during last appeal however noise at back of hall have become so violent that senator be hardly able to make voice heard by immediately around did not quail for moment going on with gesture setting down foot a though be still confident in purpose of overcoming opposition have not much above half done yet there be lawyer before civil service railway commerce of country labouring class lord drummond others near be becoming terrified thinking that something worse might occur unless end be put to proceeding then superintendent of police came in whispered to lordship crowd be collecting in piccadilly st james street perhaps senator have better be withdrawn officer did not think that must safely answer for consequence if be carried on for quarter of hour longer then lord drummond having meditated for moment touched senator arm suggested withdrawal into side room for minute mr gotobed said little feeling have be excited have better put end to for present put end to be afraid must police be becoming alarmed oh of course know best in country man be allowed to express unless utters blasphemy calumny be in hand of course must do a please then sat down in corner wiped brow lord drummond returned to hall there endeavoured to explain that lecture be over for night row be so great that did not matter much what said people soon understood that american senator be not to appear before again be not much after nine o'clock when senator reached hotel lord drummond having accompanied thither in cab good night mr gotobed said lordship can not tell how much respect purpose courage know how far be wise for man to tell other man much le nation of fault english tell of ours pretty often said senator when found alone thought of giving special credit for what have done acknowledging to that have often chosen word badly expressed imperfectly declaring to through that want of reason among britisher be so great that one ought to treat a wholly responsible being chapter xxv last day of mary master triumph of mary master be something more than nine day wonder to people of dillsborough have known larry twentyman intention aspiration have generally condemned young lady obduracy thinking not being slow to say that must live to repent perversity runciman who have thoroughly warm hearted friendship for attorney larry have sometimes be very severe on mary want touch of hardship must say to

have said in bosom of own family when be found that mr surtees curate be not to be fortunate man matter be more inexplicable than ever have then be declared that owner of hoppet hall have proposed to tongue must have be silenced refusal even of larry twentyman must have be justified what be to be said what be to be thought when be known that be to be mistress of bragton for day two prosperity of attorney be hardly to be endured by neighbour when be first known that stewardship of property be to go back into hand rise in world be for time slightly prejudicial to popularity greater stroke of luck latter promotion must place so much higher in dillsborough than even father grandfather have ever be be great trial of friendship mr master felt very keenly possibility for reproach against husband step daughter be of course at end even did not pretend to say that mary ought to refuse squire a far a mary be concerned must have further recourse to evil of ushanting peril of social intercourse with lady gentleman be manifest that mary be to be lady with big house many servant doubt carriage horse still mr master be not quite silenced have daughter of own must solace by declaring
