various way in lame dog may be helped over stile if only lame dog be popular among dog for ex solicitor general seat must have be found delay must have be granted at least there must have be consultation with suggestion that something must be tried in case man four year junior in age whom despised who a be informed have obtained place in parliament by gross bribery be put into office without word of apology to then be unhappy acknowledged to that spirit be crushed acknowledged to at same time that be one doomed by nature to such crushing of spirit if came out of hole of solitude

nearest to create discord between father daughter sir thomas be always in southampton building on sunday did sir thomas go to church miss underwood did go to church very regularly thought much of propriety necessity of such sunday exercise must remember that in younger day father always have be there with must remember indeed that with something of sternness must require from punctuality exactness in duty now again perhaps four time in year must go to roll chapel so much must learn believed that beyond sunday be kept holy by attendance at divine service may be said at once that believed aright sir thomas chamber in southampton building though be dull dingy of aspect from outside be reached by staircase may be designated a lugubrious so much did dark dismantled condition tend to melancholy be in large commodious bedroom be small have two spacious sitting room one of be fitted up a library other a dining room over beyond there be clerk room for sir thomas though have given up greater part of business have not given up clerk here old man clerk passed entire time from half past eight in morning till ten at night waiting upon employer in various capacity with sedulous personal attention to have probably not intended to devote when first took upon duty of clerk to practising chancery barrister joseph stemm sir thomas be not unlike in character have grown old together with too equal step to admit of separation of new alliance stemm have one friend in world sir thomas be that friend have already said that sir thomas have friend perhaps felt more of true intimacy friendship produce with stemm than with other human being sir thomas be tall thin man who stooped considerably though not from effect of year with face must perhaps have be almost mean have not be rescued from evil condition by assurance of intelligence strength be always conveyed by certain class of ugliness have nose something like great lord brougham thin long projecting at point have quick grey eye good forehead component part of countenance be irregular roughly put together chin be long a be also upper lip so that may be taken a fact that be ugly man be hale however strong be

ordinary manner of men a be that unlike ordinary figure of king have always book in hand not club book novel from mudie magazine ancient hard bound volume from own library have brought in pocket to undivided attention must be given eating of dinner always consisted of joint of day of nothing else did not take more than five minute must sip port wine slowly must have cup of tea must also drink very slowly must then pocket book pay bill must go be rarely case that spoke to one in club must bow to man here there if addressed must answer of conversation at club knew nothing hardly ever went into room that in dinner be served to in conversing about men must express wonder how such one have ever risen to high office how indeed must have thriven at profession in such matter be of too apt to form confident opinion on apparent cause be near surface a guide to character be fallacious perhaps in london there be better lawyer in branch of law than sir thomas underwood have worked with great diligence though be shy to degree quite unintelligible to men in general in ordinary intercourse of life have feeling of diffidence when upon leg in court in house of common with lord chancellor wife daughter must not exchange five word with comfort to with lordship in drawing room in court lord chancellor be more to than lawyer whom believed to be not so good lawyer a man have ever succeeded in

marvel among young woman for prudence conduct proper feeling clarissa whom have certainly ever loved better of two be a far a knew faultless little more passionate little warmer somewhat more fond of pleasure than sister on account only more to be loved nothing that must do must make safer than must be by own virtue still be not pleased to think that ralph newton be often at villa when man such a sir thomas have be entrusted with charge of young man with great expectation hardly wish daughter to fall in love with ward whether ward be prudent imprudent in manner of life sir thomas be hot tired

pound must uncle provide for humble home for present assist in future endeavour to obtain employment a governess must thought teach music french must endeavour to fit for work of tuition in other

said patience a handed letter to clarissa yes must come here said sir thomas mean to stay for always yes to stay for always can not say that arrangement be one to look forward with satisfaction man doe not undertake new duty without fear especially not such duty a to can see end may probably be quite unable to perform papa be sure will be nice said clarissa why be sure dear will not argue that

that new sister must be one whom must not love remember that ever heard word about said clarissa have be told that be pretty do remember that said patience how old be younger than suppose now clarissa

sore subject have never a yet be mentioned frankly even between two sister in truth though patience thought that there be fancy did not think that there be much more than fancy a far a must see there be not even fancy on young man part word have be spoken must be accepted a expression of avowed love so at least patience believed must have be very unhappy have be otherwise for ralph newton be not in opinion man to whose love sister must be trusted with confidence yet beyond father sister there be one whom patience loved a did ralph newton there have however be little episode in life of clarissa underwood have tended to make sister uneasy reader may a well hear at once there be second newton younger brother though younger not only in order in possession of living gregory newton rev

enough for whole life knew that be idle extravagant fond of pleasure unsteady a in vocabulary must be disposed to describe character believed to be in heart of heart liked unsteadiness in men if be not carried too far ralph brother parson a to whom be informed that possessed virtue incident to humanity who be quite a good looking a brother have utterly failed to touch heart black coat white cravat be antipathetic to ralph a lay on green sward hot with linen trouser coloured flannel shirt with small straw hat stuck on edge of head with nothing round throat jacket over shoulder with pipe in mouth empty glass beside be to in external beau ideal of young man then though be unsteady extravagant idle sin be not so deep a to exclude from father sister favour be there on villa lawn not a interloper by implied permission though made for argument on matter not having much time just now for arguing felt that be undoubted privilege to be made love to by ralph newton if pleased so to amuse have never be told not to be made love to by of course must not engage without father permission of course must tell patience if ralph must say anything very special to have right to be made love to if liked in case must like when ralph looked at asked whether might not do better than marry west indian cousin have not word with to answer smoked on for second in silence still looking at while stood over blushing then spoke again think might do great deal better still have not word for ah suppose must be off said jumping up on leg flinging jacket over arm patience will be in soon expect minute if be to say something uncivil about patience suppose must like certainly must like only just to wish be at jericho nonsense ralph yes must be nonsense chance be know that must be at jericho with dear dear clary know love then put right arm round waist pipe kissed certainly have expected no such assault have not only not thought of have not known to be among possibility might occur to have never be so treated before one other lover have have a know by have be treated with deference due by inferior to superior being must have be very nice if ralph must have told that loved be not nice have be done must not dare to tell to patience must not have endured that patience must have seen be bound to resent how stood silent for moment then burst into tear be not angry with clary said be angry very angry go away will never speak to again know how dearly love love at have insulted will never forgive go away at moment step of patience coming up from gate be heard upon gravel clarissa first thought when heard be to hide tear though man have injured insulted very last resource must be to complain to others of injury insult must be hidden in own breast remembered always forgotten must not be a thought at moment forgiven above must not be repeated a to show of anger against sinner be impossible to because be so necessary that sin must be hidden what ralph have be here long asked patience looking with somewhat suspicious eye at clarissa back be turned to about hour waiting for smoking drinking soda water have boat here must be off now will have tide with said clarissa with effort there be tide in affair of men said ralph with forced laugh affair will at once take advantage of tide will come again very soon to see new cousin good bye girl then inserted into boat took off without bestowing even anything of special glance upon clarissa be there anything matter patience asked only why did stay evening with stupid old woman when promised that must be back in ten minute said nothing about ten minute clary after have be hour gone miss spooner be in trouble about tenant who wo pay rent have to tell about stupid old woman have ralph be quarrelling clary why must quarrel there seems to have be something wrong be so stupid being found alone here make one feel that one be so desolate do wish papa must live with like other girl father a wo must be much better not to let people come at patience be sure that something have happened that something must have reference to guise of lover assumed not assumed by ralph newton accused sister of hypocrisy be aware that clarissa word be wild not expressing girl thought spoken almost at random something must be said therefore complaint have be made clary dear like ralph asked be oh yes like of course head ache will go to bed wait few minute clary something have disturbed have not everything disturbs if there be anything special wo tell there have be something very special clarissa certainly must not tell what have said to think must be simply cross to have not be cross at what be then well if wo tell think that be afraid of never yet have be afraid of other then there be pause clary have said that love there be pause clarissa thought over for moment be not quite certain whether such sweet assurance have have not be given to then remembered word know how dearly love ought to be sweet to now have not so offended that there must never be forgiveness if forgiveness how then must love be sweet to patience waited then repeated question tell clary what have said to know do love clary hate hate clary did not use to hate did not hate yesterday must not hate without cause darling tell what mean if trust other will world be to there be one else to whom can tell trouble nevertheless clarissa must not tell trouble why do say that hate know why oh dear patty why do go on so yes did say that loved there did that make unhappy need not make unhappy though must refuse when brother asked to marry did not make unhappy yes did very be same be quite different be afraid clary ralph newton must not make good husband be extravagant in debt papa must not like then papa must not let come here just a plea whenever like be papa fault be to say must be if there be anything in be there nothing in clary what answer did make when told that loved came made answer do so wish that have come before wanted to tell sister everything one thing be unable to do so because one thing affected other thing so vitally a be patience finding that must press question further be altogether in dark ralph have made declaration of love to sister did know in what manner clarissa have received must not guess have hitherto feared that clary be too fond of young man clary must now only say that hated matter must soon be set at rest ralph newton must now doubt go to father if sir thomas must permit new fangled hatred of clary must patience thought soon be overcome if however a be more probable sir thomas must violently disapprove then there must be no more visit from ralph newton to villa a there have be declaration of love of course father must be informed of at once patience having so resolved allowed sister to go to bed without further questioning in clarissa own bosom great offence have be forgiven rather condoned before morning lover have be very cruel to very wicked most unkind especially unkind in that have turned to absolute pain moment of life might have be of moment fullest of joy especially cruel in that have so treated that must not look forward to future joy without alloy must forgive yes must not endure that must think that must forgive be willing to blot out offence a thing by in island of life of one must ever think again be to lose lover for ever because did not forgive if must only come to agreement that offence must be acknowledged to be heinous unpardonable committed in temporary madness henceforward must be buried in oblivion such agreement however be impossible there must be speech about matter be be not to lose lover for ever because have done wicked thing during night made up mind that must not afford to pay price for sake of avenging virtue for future must be on guard wicked heartless man who have robbed of so much yet how charming have be to a looked into eye told that must do very much better than fall in love with west indian cousin then thought of offence again ah if only time might come in must be engaged together a man wife with consent of everybody then there must be no more offence chapter iv mary bonner while clarissa underwood be being kissed on lawn at popham villa sir thomas be sitting very disconsolate in private room at dolphin in southampton have required no great consideration to induce to resolve that home must be given by to niece though be man so weak that must allow to shun from day to day daily duty to do so constantly a to make up out of various omission small in vast aggregate of misconduct still be one who must certainly do what conscience prompted to be right in great matter a to right wrong appeared to to be clearly defined though loved daughter dearly must leave from day to day almost without protection because day fault in so doing be of small new niece of certainly did not love at have never seen be almost morbidly fearful of new responsibility expected nothing trouble in thus annexing new unknown member to family yet have decided upon doing because duty to be done be great enough to be clearly marked demanding immediate resolve capable of postponement a thought of sitting alone on eve of girl coming be very uneasy what be to do with if found to be one difficult to manage willed vexatious worse again ill conditioned a to conduct hurtful to own child must even become imperative upon to be rid of how must riddance be effected then what must think of habit of life brought to other reflection might not be possible utterly to break up establishment of in southampton building so that must be forced by necessity of thing to live at home at home must share with girl knew well enough to be sure that while chamber remained in possession a long a bedroom bed be at command must not extricate from dilemma day after day temptation be too great for hated villa there be nothing there that must do have book at villa so averred there be something in air of fulham prevented from reading book when brought there no must break altogether fresh ground set up new establishment one thing be clear must not now do before mary bonner arrival therefore there be nothing to create special urgency have hoped that girl must marry so that might be left to live alone in chamber waited upon by old stemm without sin on part be beginning to discover girl always get married out of way in first bloom now be taking to girl must knew give over hope of escape in direction be very uneasy when quite late at night rather early in morning took to bed slumber be not refreshing truth be that air suited for sleeping except air of southampton building packet from st thomas be to be in harbour at eight o'clock next morning telegram from cape clear lizard eddystone lighthouse where not having made that a certain a sun rising at eight o'clock be down on quay there be travelling city of royal atlantic steam mail packet company at moment being warped into harbour ship a walked along jetty be so near to that must plainly see face of passenger on deck men woman girl child dressed up to meet friend on shore crowding side of vessel in eagerness to be among first to get on shore anxiously scanned face of lady that might guess be to be lady be to be to almost same a daughter saw not one a to whom must say that have hope there be in crowd three four a to whom acknowledged that have fear at last remembered that girl must necessarily be in deep mourning saw two young woman in black there be nothing to prepossess about of one of be insignificant very plain other be fat untidy of looked like lady what if fate must have sent to a daughter a companion for girl that fat untidy ill bred looking young woman a happened ill bred looking young woman whom feared be cook who have married ship steward have gone out among island with husband have found that speculation did not answer be now returning in hope of earning bread in old vocation of woman sir thomas underwood be in great dread at last be on board whispered question to purser miss bonner oh yes miss bonner be on board be sir thomas underwood miss bonner uncle purser evidently knew about there be something in tone seemed to assure sir thomas that fat untidy woman niece must not be one same person purser have just raised cap to sir thomas have turned towards cabin stair to go in search of lady be stopped immediately by miss bonner purser did task very well said slightest word to introduce uncle niece together then vanished sir thomas blushed shuffled with foot put out hand be shy astonished frightened did not know what to say girl came up to took hand in hers holding for moment then kissed did not think must come said of course have come girl be at home will receive to night said nothing further then again raised hand kissed be hardly too much to say that sir thomas underwood be in tremble a gazed upon niece have be on deck a walked along quay have noted must not have dared to think that girl a be coming to house declared to at once that be most lovely young woman have ever seen be tall somewhat large with fair hair of now very little must be seen with dark eye perfect eyebrow face for colour line of beauty might have be taken a model for female saint martyr there be perfection of symmetry about assertion of intelligence combined with loveliness almost frightened uncle for there be something there also beyond intelligence loveliness have heard of eye to threaten command sir thomas did not at moment tell that mary bonner have eye did involuntarily unconsciously acknowledge to that over young lady a whom now saw before must be very difficult for to exercise parental control have heard that be nineteen certainly seemed to that be older than own daughter a to clary there must be question between two girl a to of must exercise authority over other not by force of age by dint of character will fitness mary bonner who now shone before a goddess almost young woman to whom ordinary man must speak without kind of trepidation goddess do inflict on ordinary men have proposed to herself to go out a governess indeed at very moment such probably be own idea a yet have received no reply to letter have written other than be now conveyed by uncle presence few question be asked a to voyage have not be at ill have almost feared said to reach england thinking must be so desolate will not let be desolate said sir thomas brightening up little under graciousness of goddess demeanour girl be looking forward to coming with greatest delight then asked question a to cousin sir thomas thought that there be majesty even in voice be low soft musical yet even in a in eye there be something indicated power of command have servant with to assist in looking after luggage old stemm be only man in employment

to have nothing to do to look after doctor be at elbow to last box trunk seemed to extricate from general mass with readiness be certainly not experienced by ordinary passenger there be certain favour in life be very charming very unjust to others may perhaps lump under name of priority of service money will hardly buy when money doe buy there be injustice when priority of service be have like coach four by man who can afford to pay for industry be source of wealth receives fitting reward rank will often procure most unjustly a who have rank feel sometimes with great soreness position other than of rank official position commercial position will secure in certain case railway train be stopped at wrong place for railway director post office manager get letter taken after time too be grievance priority of service be perhaps more readily accorded to feminine beauty especially to unprotected feminine beauty than to other form of claim whether be ever felt a grievance lady who be not beautiful may perhaps be able to say there flit across memory at present moment reminiscence of angry glance at too speedy attendance given by custom house officer to pretty woman priority of service be think if not deserved at least so natural a to take out of catalogue of evil of complaint must be made one might complain with a much avail men will fall in love with pretty girl instead of with who be ugly on present occasion sir thomas be well contented be out of ship through custom house at railway station back at inn before struggling mass of passenger have found out whether longed for box have have not come with in ship then miss bonner took not arrogantly a though be due just a grass take rain flower sunshine good thing came to from heaven doubt be thankful came to so customarily a doe man dinner to bed that must not manifest surprise at what be done for illustration even captain came to take special farewell of sir thomas hardly spoke to except about journey luggage till be

establishment manipulation of leather be something marvellous in latter year have added to original art art have at first be perfect rather than comprehensive exquisite skill in cord buckskin such like material when trade be becoming prosperous have thought of degenerating into tailor adding largely to premise of compensating pride by prospect of great increase to fortune angel of glory have whispered to to let well alone be still able to boast that measurement have be confined to leg of sportsman instead of extending business have simply extended price have boldly clapped on extra half guinea to pair that supplied experiment be altogether successful when be heard by riding men of city mr neefit price be undoubtedly higher than of other breech maker in london that have refused to supply breech for groom of marquis because marquis be not hunting man riding men of city flocked to in such number that became quite common thing for to give order in june july so that might not be disappointed when november came round mr neefit be prosperous man have trouble now be great trouble to that sporting men must be so very slow in paying for breech in took pride mr neefit fortune have not be rapid in early life have begun with small capital small establishment even now place of business be very limited in size have be clever enough to make profit even out of smallness have contrived that must be understood that little back room in men be measured be so diminutive because did not suit special business to welcome crowd be pride said to wait upon hunting men with garment

knew a did how morsel of leather must behave under needle must come within two hairbreadths of in accuracy across kneepan a for measuring mr neefit did that almost always to be measured by mr neefit be a essential to perfection a to be cut out for by german there be rumour indeed that from certain class of customer mr neefit great foreigner kept personally aloof be believed that mr neefit must not condescend to measure retail tradesman latterly indeed there have arisen doubt whether must lay august hand on stockbroker leg though little wallop one of young glory of capel court swears that be handled by year confound 'be impudence say wallop 'd like to see sending foreman to a for cutting d'you think know bawwah 'and name of foreign artist be not exactly known be pronounced a have written spelt in fashion by sporting gentleman when writing to other reader may be told in confidence up to very late date mr neefit lived in room over shop be certainly not thing for prosperous tradesman to do indeed if tradesman be known not to have private residence will hardly become prosperous neefit have be cautious man till two year before commencement of story have actually lived in conduit street working hard however to keep residence deep secret from customer at large now be proud possessor of villa residence at hendon two mile out in country beyond swiss cottage customer knew that be never to be found before be after pm a have said mr neefit have trouble one of great trouble be young friend ralph newton ralph newton be hunting man with stud of horse never le than four sometimes running

in flesh to many tradesman in day be not that never paid did pay something a ordered more than paid sum total against be always increasing figure then be most engaging civil spoken young man whose order be almost impossible to decline be known moreover that prospect be so good nevertheless be not pleasant for breech maker to see second hundred pound accumulating on book for leather breech for one gentleman what doe do with old neefit must say to did dare to ask such question of mr newton be for tradesman to complain that gentleman consumes too many of article thing however went so far that mr neefit found to be incumbent on to make special inquiry about prospect thing have gone very far indeed for ralph newton appeared one summer evening at villa at hendon absolutely asked breech maker to lend hundred pound before left have taken tea with mr mr miss neefit on lawn have received almost promise that loan must be forthcoming if must call in conduit street on following morning have be early in may ralph newton have called though there have be difficulty have received money before three day have passed mr neefit be stout little man with bald head somewhat protrusive eye whose manner to customer contained combination of dictatorial assurance subservience have found to be efficacious in peculiar business on general subject must rub hand bow head agree most humbly with word be uttered in same day must be radical conservative devoted to church scoffer at parson animated on behalf of staghound loud censurer of aught in way of hunting other than orthodox fox on trivial outside subject considered to be duty a tradesman simply to ingratiate in matter of breech gave way to man let custom be what might knew business be not going to be told by man whether garment made did did not fit be duty of gentleman to come allow to see on while still in half embryo condition if gentleman did duty be sure that must do must take back anything be not approved without murmur after that must decline further transaction be moreover quite understood that to complain of material be so to insult that must condescend to make civil reply elderly gentleman from essex once told that button be given to breaking if have breech washed by old woman in country said mr neefit very slowly looking into elderly gentleman face then run through mangle button will break elderly gentleman never dared even to enter shop again mr neefit be perhaps somewhat over imperious in matter relating to own business in excuse for must be stated that be in truth honest tradesman be honest at least so far that did make breech a well a knew how have made up mind that best way to make fortune be to send out good article did best whether be honest in adding on additional half guinea to price because found that men with whom dealt be fool enough to be attracted by high price will be left to advanced moralist to decide in universal agreement with diverse opinion there must fear have be something of dishonesty made best of breech put shoddy cheap stitching into be upon whole honest tradesman from to be mr neefit hour have come to be understood by who knew establishment well that from half past twelve to half past one master be always absent young man who sat at high desk seemed to spend time in contemplating bad debt in ledger must tell gentleman who called up to one mr neefit be in city

to leaf in book found without difficulty mr neefit took to examination of certain completed article adorned shop a though be anxious to banish from mind so painful subject be to 'ave mr neefit asked foreman master be still silent still fingered material very soul loved must 'ave matter of twenty pair by unless sell said suspicious foreman sell said mr neefit ai one of sort can put in hand waddle very well mr neefit only thought 'd mention looked queer like coming just when be out see anything queer in ai one of sort do go on mr waddle knew nothing of hundred pound did know that ralph newton have twice drank tea at hendon on occasion mr neefit have declared that if ever saw gentleman mr newton be gentleman miss neefit though word have be very few have evidently approved of mr newton

be gentleman seemed to be no more within reach than be for gentleman to be angel did not desire must not have enjoyed have that sort of sense make man know so thoroughly own limit that have regret at not passing yet in eye gentleman be so grand thing being so infinitely superior to that loving daughter above anything else did think that must die happy if must see married into station so exalted there be humility in a regarded affection for child be admirable reader will think that might at rate have done better than to pitch upon one a ralph newton then reader hardly know ralph newton a yet can not at realise difficulty poor mr neefit experienced in coming across gentleman in such fashion a to be able to commence operation be hardly open to tradesman to ask young man home to house when measuring from hip to knee neefit have heard of many case in gentleman of money have married daughter of commercial men knew that thing be to be done money spent in other direction seemed to be nearly useless to might be used beneficially in way how be to set about polly neefit be a pretty girl a will wish to see knew that be pretty if did take care good looking young gasfitter next door to down at hendon must have polly before knew where be worse still a thought there be that mad son of old friend moggs bootmaker ontario moggs a have be christened by canadian godfather with whom polly have condescended already to hold something of flirtation must not advertise for genteel lover what must do then ralph newton made way down to hendon villa asking for money what must have induced mr newton

of mr ralph newton mr neefit must not analyse there be kind of sunshine about young man must have made very unwilling to press hard for payment to stop supply of breech have taken liking to ralph found thinking about young man in journey between hendon conduit street be not sort of gentleman must suit daughter neefit wanted one to tell that ralph be gentleman what meant by gentleman that

handsome estate in hampshire place called newton priory with parish of newton peele lodge gamekeeper park knew from of old that ralph uncle must have nothing to do with nephew debt learned now a certainty that uncle must not disinherit nephew debt did not seem to be very high ralph have come into property from father upon whole though of course there must be sacrifice of money at first neefit thought that saw way mr newton too have be very civil to girl not simply making to foolish flattering little speech treating so thought neefit exactly a high bred gentleman must treat lady of thought be high ambition neefit thought that there might possibly be way to success mr neefit have be good helpmate to husband having worked hard for when hard work on part be needed be not altogether so

bond street wife say ai got glass fit to drink out of need tell mr newton that mr what be ai ashamed on yet what doe let have honour of drinking glass of wine with mr newton see just a be wish be better must be welcomer health mr newton there be many men men too not of bad sort who in such circumstance can not make pleasant grant circumstance with desire to make best of men can not be otherwise than stiff disagreeable uneasy then again there be men who in almost position can carry a though be to manner born ralph newton be one of latter be not accustomed to dine with tradesman who supplied with good have probably never before encountered such host a mr neefit went through dinner with perfect ease satisfaction before pie jelly have be consumed have won heart of even mr neefit law mr newton said what can know about custard then ralph newton offered to come make custard against in own kitchen providing might have polly to help 'd want back kitchen to yourselves be thinking said mr neefit in high good humour mr neefit certainly be not delicate man a soon a dinner be over two lady have eaten strawberry cream suggested that port wine must be taken out into garden in farther corner of mr neefit ground at distance of about twenty yard from house be little recess called arbour admonitory of earwig without much pretension to comfort might hold three person on occasion mr neefit be minded that two only must enjoy retreat polly carried out decanter glass did not presume to stay there for moment followed mother into gorgeous drawing room where mr neefit at once went to sleep while daughter consoled with novel mr neefit a have said be not delicate man girl will have twenty thousand pound down on nail day marries man a approves of fill glass mr newton will there be mistake about there will be more money too when be dead old woman might be owned that speech from father of marriageable daughter to young man who have hardly a yet shown to be enamoured be not delicate may be question whether be not sensible have made up mind therefore went at once at object unless did business in way what chance be there that must be done at mr newton must not come down to alexandrina cottage other day meet girl elsewhere a might do young lady of fashion moreover father knew well enough that be girl once to tell that have set heart upon gasfitter upon ontario moggs must not have power to contradict desired that must become gentleman wife thinking that be readiest way to accomplish wish saw reason why must not follow when have spoken chucked off glass of wine looked into young friend face for answer will be lucky fellow get said ralph beginning unconsciously to feel that might perhaps have be a well for have remained in lodging on sunday will be lucky fellow mr newton be a good a gold well bred 'un too though say a must there be not dirty drop in be that clever can do abeost anything a for look will say nothing about have got eye in head there ai mistake there mr newton paint madame rachel made beautiful for ever be human nature what see there mr newton be quite sure of have heart of angel by time mr neefit be alternately wiping tear from eye

honest know what call do know there ai so sweet girl a within twenty mile round london then mr neefit in energy dashed hand down among glass on little rustic table in arbour reader may imagine that ralph newton be hardly ready with answer there be men doubt who in emergency must have be able to damn breech maker impudence to have walked at once out of house young friend felt inclination to punish host in such fashion a simply remarked that must think of matter being too grave for immediate decision that must join lady do mr newton said mr neefit go join polly will find be tell will sit here have pipe ralph did join lady finding mr neefit asleep induced polly to take walk with amidst lane of hendon when left alexandrina cottage in evening mr neefit whispered word into ear at gate know mind strike while iron hot there be just what see chapter vii be one of now first week after mary bonner arrival at popham villa went by without much to make remarkable except strangeness arising from coming of stranger sir thomas did stay at home on sunday when time came for going to morning church shuffled out of disagreeable duty in manner be satisfactory to daughter oh papa thought must have gone with said patience at last moment think not to day dear said with sort of smile betokens inward uneasiness patience reproached with look then three girl went off together even patience have offered to excuse mary on score of fatigue seasickness like mary altogether declined to be excused be fatigued said sick of course must go to church sir thomas stayed at home thought about how must go to church when knew that must neither listen to sermon join in prayer suppose people do said to ca 'd go to church day long if found that must serve went up to london on monday returned to villa to dinner did same on tuesday on wednesday remained in london on thursday came home dined in town after that found to be on sufficiently familiar term with niece to fall back into old habit of life patience be very slow in speaking to cousin of father peculiarity clarissa soon told tale will get to know papa soon said have be so kind to be very good must know dear that be most deserted disconsolate lady that ever lived out of poem papa have be home now four day together be for beau yeux be here for week together without seeing very often for more than week where doe go have place in london place will go see day though wo thank bit for taking there have queerest old man to wait upon never see anybody from day to day what doe do be writing book be great secret never speaks about doe not like to be asked question truth be be most solitude loving person in world doe find charm though alexander selkirk never must doe nobody come here to in way of taking care of nobody have to take care of ourselves of course be dull people do come see sometimes miss spooner for instance why must laugh at poor miss spooner asked patience laugh at have other friend know not enough to make house pleasant to after when patience be not with told something of ralph newton visit though said nothing to cousin of own cherished hope wonder what will think of ralph newton said ralph newton name have be mentioned before in mary hearing more than once why must think anything particular of ralph newton will have to think something particular about a be sort of child of house papa be guardian come here just when plea who be what be where be why be be gentleman at large who doe nothing be who be think ever so much of then no doe be nephew to old squire down in hampshire who wo give penny ought to want however because when came of age have ever so much money of own doe want sometimes must have property when uncle dy dear how interesting a for where be why be come here just when suit because be almost brought up together doe dine here kind of thing because papa be never at home nobody ever doe dine here then there be short pause mr newton be lover then asked miss bonner there be pause before clarissa must answer question said be lover have lover at popham villa only be not quite true said after pause a be to live with just like sister will tell about gregory newton ralph brother then did tell story of clergyman love clergyman discomfiture said not word of ralph declaration ralph great sin on fatal evening way in told story about one brother altogether disarmed mary bonner suspicion a to other in truth clarissa did not know whether be be not privilege to regard ralph newton a lover have not be to cottage since evening though word have spoken be still sweet in ear so sweet that must not endure thought of abandoning sweetness still have misgiving that be in sort rendered nugatory by great fault have forgiven fault looking back at now over distance of eight ten day have forgiven with heart still there remained with undefined unpleasant feeling that spoken word accompanied by deed so wicked be absorbed a be drowned in wickedness of deed what if word a first spoken be only prelude to deed for a well remembered have be spoken twice if subsequent word be only excuse for there be painful idea in mind that such might possibly be case that if so man must never be forgiven at least ought never to be spoken to again acting on suggestion from within absolutely refused to tell father what have happened when patience urged to do so will come see papa if mean anything said clary patience only shook head thought that sir thomas must be told at once must not take upon to divulge sister secret have be imparted to in trust clarissa be obstinate must not tell father must say what must be own answer if father be to give permission for match a to patience have not much doubt saw that sister heart be set upon lover have feared before late occurrence now must hardly have doubt if ralph really meant must hardly have told that loved then not waited for answer not have come back for answer not have gone to father for answer then patience thought sir thomas must never consent to marriage ralph be in debt scapegrace quite unfit to undertake management of wife such be elder sister belief a to father mind must not force upon clary necessity of taking action in matter be not strong enough in position a elder to demand obedience clarissa communication have be made in confidence patience though be unhappy must not break trust at last young lothario appeared among again a happened came in company with sir thomas such thing have not happened before since day on sir thomas have given up charge of ward property did so happen now two men have met in london sir thomas have suggested that ralph must come be introduced to new cousin what be doing now sir thomas have asked nothing particular just at present can get away evening yes think can get away have be intention to dine at club with captain cox a have dined at club with captain cox on previous day engagement be not felt to be altogether binding can get away for dinner be have got to go out in evening be bore promised to be at lady mcmarshal to night if show there at twelve will do thus happened that sir thomas ralph newton went down to popham villa in cab together be clear to patience clarissa that be much struck with new cousin then be quite out of question that man must not be struck with beauty be of kind like beauty of picture must strike even if fails to charm mary have way of exciting attention with stranger even by silence be hardly intentional there certainly be coquetry in be case that carried after fashion made impossible for stranger to regard place in room a being merely chair with young lady in must speak hardly word very lack of speech be eloquent at present time be of course in deep mourning contrast between brilliance of complexion dark dress covered throat between black scarf profusion of bright hair fell upon be so remarkable a of to excite attention clarissa watching everything though with feminine instinct seeming to watch nothing must see that be amazed then have known that must be amazed of what matter must be amazement if be true if indeed be not true then then then nothing mattered such be light in clary viewed circumstance around at present moment evening did not pas very pleasantly ralph be introduced to cousin asked question about west indie then there be tea ralph be dressed with black coat white cravat clary must not keep from thinking how very much nicer be with pipe in mouth neck bare drinking soda water sherry out on lawn ah in spite of have then happened that be sweetest moment in existence when jumped up from ground told that might do great deal better than marry west indian cousin thought now of very word suggested to herself that perhaps must never say again nay might not be possible that must say very reverse that must declare wish to marry west indian cousin clary must not conceive that might have must so wish young lady when be in love be prone to regard lover a being prize so valuable a to be coveted by female comer before ralph have taken leave sir thomas took mary apart to make communication to a to own affair everything be now settled sir thomas have purchased stock for with little fortune have l s d year quite own said laughing a might have done to one of own girl have unexpected legacy be left to mean must be altogether dependent on charity said looking into face through tear mean nothing of kind said with almost impetuosity of anger there will be such cold word a charity between be one of now of cup of loaf be right to partake a be right of girl there will never think of speak of again must think of uncle le better never use that odious word again between be word for stranger what be given a give to must be taken without even acknowledgment payment be to be love will be paid in full said a kissed be very well still on part there be misgiving misgiving though doubt if be to die what must become of must make new will in be to terrible trouble must take something from own girl in order that might provide for new daughter that question of adopting be very difficult if man have child of own none others be dependent on can give there be end of trouble man feel that owes property to child so feeling may take from give to others have be in truth daughter must have felt that there be enough for three be not daughter yet be telling that must be to same a child of house in meantime ralph be out on lawn with two sister be a awkward a men always be in such circumstance when spoke word to clarissa have in truth settled purpose in mind have always liked loved after fashion felt for affection different to entertained for sister nevertheless most assuredly have not come down to fulham on evening prepared to make offer have be there by chance have be quite by chance that found clarissa alone knew that word have be spoken knew also that have drawn down wrath upon head by caress be man enough also to feel that have right to believe to have be forgiven because now in presence of others did not receive with special coldness must have demanded special explanation a be three be cold patience half felt inclined to go leave together must have given finger off hand to make clary happy must be right to make clary happy in such fashion a have thought at first when saw father ralph together that ralph have spoken of love to sir thomas that sir thomas have allowed to come soon perceived that be not case so walked about together knowing that intercourse be not a always have be feeling powerless to resume appearance of composure have got to go be at lady mcmarshal said after having suffered in way for quarter of hour if did not show there ladyship must think that have given over idea of propriety be lost sheep past redemption let keep if ought to go said clary with dismal propriety think will be off good bye patience new cousin be radiant in beauty one can doubt know whether be exactly sort of girl admire most by bye what do mean to do with do with said patience will live here of course just settle down a one of family then doubt will see again good night patience good bye clary will just step in make adieu to sir thomas beauty did a went pressed clary hand in manner that must understand did not return pressure did not resent clarissa said patience when be together that night dear clarissa clary knew that when be called

must be more than mr neefit have be able to promise have determined that nothing must induce to marry daughter of breech maker therefore answer might have be easy nevertheless made answer kept out of

first visit to conduit street have seen polly in shop cutting up strip wherewith father must measure gentleman leg must then have be nearly fifteen occupation a felt be not one fitting for girl who be to be wife now mr newton said mr neefit a sir george at last left little room day be hot mr neefit have be at work in shirt sleeve did now put on coat wiped brow put cotton handkerchief inside brace shook hand with hero well mr newton said what do think of must learn much about seemed to that polly got on famous that night thought 'd have seen out there again before must come mr neefit a long a there be doubt oh a to doubt doubt be bothered of course must run chance with polly like other man just so way to get girl like be not to come see for month there be others after polly can tell men who must take with nothing smock on be quite sure of one can see without admiring then what be good of talking of doubt like because be gentleman can put on leg from hear be kind of putting want bad

of some'at hot pop question be about way to do undoubtedly marriage be such serious thing so be serious uncommon serious to owe fellow lot of money ca pay call very serious mr neefit owe nothing what can pay be very slow about mr be can say be just talking of myself after what be passed between ai going to be hard upon will tell what mr neefit said ralph at last of course can understand that man may have difficulty with family because of being breech maker said neefit contemptuously wo say that there may be difficulty twenty thousand pound doe away with deal of thing just so a be saying can understand that there may be family difficulty only say that because ought perhaps to have given answer sooner wo go down with evening wo not to night will be with on saturday evening if will suit come have bit of dinner again on sunday said neefit ralph accepted invitation shook hand with neefit escaped from shop when thought of a went to room told that have now a good a engaged to polly a good a bad of course after what have passed must not go to house again without asking to be wife be to do so neefit must be justified in insulting yet when undertook to make fourth visit to cottage have done so with intention of allowing little more time for judgment saw plainly enough that be going to allow to drift into marriage without real decision of own prided on being strong how must man be more despicably weak than be indeed true that in argument have used with sir thomas have defended neefit marriage a though be best course must adopt even sir thomas have not ultimately ventured to oppose must not be a well for to consider that have absolutely made up mind to marry polly on friday called at mr moggs house mr moggs senior be there mr moggs junior also shopman be sorry said that when son called have friend with must hardly explain circumstance did signify at said moggs junior doe signify mr newton said moggs senior who on morning be not in good humour with ledger two hundred

customer bill at three month interview ended by due manufacture of document to effect ralph when entered shop have not intended to give bill pressure have be too great upon have yielded must matter little however if married polly neefit have not now accepted a destiny that must marry polly neefit saturday passed in much trouble of spirit with many doubt upshot of be that must keep engagement for

with bit of salmon dinner be not gay in first place neefit mr neefit gave very explicit very opposite direction a to manner in guest be to walk in to dinner result of be that ralph be obliged to give arm to elder lady while ontario carried off prize mr neefit also gave direction a to place be obeyed in spite of attempt of neefit to contravene polly sat on one side of table while ralph sat opposite to neefit when saw that arrangement be made must not be altered lost temper scolded wife law papa what doe matter said polly polly position certainly be unpleasant enough made head against difficulty gallantly ontario who have begun to guess truth said not word be not however long in making up mind that personal encounter with mr ralph newton might be good for system mr neefit nagged at husband told when complained about meat that if must look after drinkable must be quite enough for to do ralph found to be impossible even to look a though thing be going right never in life have be in position so uncomfortable a thought so disreputable be not to be endured that moggs bootmaker must see sitting at table of neefit breech maker dinner be at last over port wine be carried out into arbour not on occasion by polly by maid polly mr neefit went off together while ralph crowded into little summer house with moggs neefit in way hour be passed half hour of terrible punishment there be worse coming mr newton said neefit think heard something about taking walk with polly if like to make start of let keep moggs will have pipe together also intend to walk with miss neefit said ontario standing up bravely illustration also intend to walk with miss neefit said ontario standing up bravely two company three none said neefit doubt said ontario doubt feel that mr newton have be attached to miss neefit two year mind saying out straight before father love miss neefit know sir what idea be love miss neefit perhaps sir idea may be money idea be pure affection for young lady now mr newton know what idea be mr moggs junior be standing up when made speech when have completed looked round first upon father then upon rival be never given encouragement said neefit how dare speak in way about polly do dare said ontario there will tell mr newton that ever gave encouragement ontario thought about for moment before replied will not said to say that of young woman must be in accord with idea because ca be gammon mean to have mr newton may take word for go in ask if do pretty thing indeed ca invite friend mr newton to eat bit of dinner let walk out with polly must interfere if have to morrow must have shilling with want shilling with said ontario still standing upon leg love will mr newton say a fair a mr newton found very difficult to say anything even have be thoroughly intent on design of making polly wife must not have brought to declare love aloud a have just be done by mr moggs be sort of matter must be discussed in public said at last public private love said ontario moggs with hand on heart polly be certainly badly treated among got walk that evening received assurance of undying affection from one suitor other became manifest even to neefit that game must not be played out on evening must not turn moggs off premise because wife must have interfered have done so must have be possible after such affair to induce polly to stir from house certainly have be badly used among so took occasion to tell father when visitor be gone left house together at about eight polly at time have not reappeared moggs went to nearest station of midland railway ralph walked to swiss cottage certainly mr neefit little dinner have be unsuccessful ralph newton a went back to london be almost disposed to think that providence have interposed to save will tell what be father said polly to papa a soon a two visitor have left house if be way be going to go on will never marry anybody a long a live dear be mother said mr neefit now be mother wish 'd be blowed fust chapter x sir thomas in chamber will be remembered that sir thomas underwood have declined to give late ward advice at interview took place in southampton building rather that only advice have given to young man be to cut throat idle word have left impression on ralph newton still have be spoken be remembered by sir thomas when be left alone after young man departure be very unhappy be not only that have spoken word so idle when ought to have be grave wise that felt that have be altogether remiss in duty a guide philosopher friend there be old sorrow too on score in main sir thomas have discharged well most troublesome thankless profitless duty towards son of man who have not be related to with whom accidental intimacy have be ripened into friendship by letter rather than by social intercourse ralph newton father have be younger brother of present gregory newton of newton priory have be parson of parish of peele newton a be now ralph younger brother gregory present squire of newton have be never married property a have before be said have be settled on ralph a male heir provided of course that uncle left legitimate son of own have come to pas that two brother gregory ralph have quarrelled about matter of property have not spoken for year before death of younger ralph at time have be just old enough to be brought into quarrel there have be question of cutting timber of lease a to parson acting on son behalf have opposed squire with much unnecessary bitterness suspicion be doubtless case that squire resented bitterly act done by own father with view of perpetuating property in true line of newton for when settlement be made on marriage of younger brother elder be already father of child whom loved none le because child mother have not become wife so quarrel have be fostered at time of parson death have extended to young man who be son heir to estate when on death bed parson have asked mr underwood who have just then entered house of common to undertake guardianship lawyer with many doubt have consented have striven striven in vain to reconcile uncle nephew indeed be ill fitted to accomplish such task must only write letter on subject be very sensible very cold in of must be careful to explain that step have be taken in regard to property be in strict conformity with law old squire must have nothing to do with heir in resolution be strengthened by tidings reached of heir manner of living be taught to believe that everything be going to dog with young man be wont to say that newton priory with acre must be found to have gone to dog too when day be done unless indeed ralph must fortunately kill by drink evil living in case property must go to younger gregory present parson now present parson of newton be uncle friend whether friendship must have be continued have ralph died young clergyman become heir may be matter of doubt disagreeable duty of guardianship sir thomas have performed with many scruple of conscience determination to do best have nearly done well be man who must not do altogether well let scruple of conscience be what might have failed in obtaining father control over young man even in regard to property have passed through hand though have be careful with have not be adroit even at moment thing have not be settled must have be settled sir thomas have felt when ralph have spoken of selling remained to of paying debt that there must be fresh trouble that might be forced to own that have be deficient then told did so a soon a ralph have left that must have given counsel to young man when came to ask for have better cut throat in troubled spirit have said that now spirit be troubled more because have so spoken sat for hour thinking of ralph newton be undoubted heir to very large property be now embarrassed present debt did not amount to much more than half one year income of property must be probably in about ten year squire might live for twenty year might die to morrow life interest in estate according to usual calculation be not worth more than ten year purchase must sir thomas have be right to tell young man whose prospect be so good whose debt after be so light that ought to go cut throat a only way of avoiding disreputable marriage must otherwise be forced upon by burden of circumstance must not guardian with true idea of duty must not friend whose friendship be in degree real have found way out of such difficulty a then a to marriage proposed marriage with breech maker daughter more sir thomas thought of more distasteful did become to knew that ralph be unaware of evil must follow marriage relative whose thought action word must be distasteful to child whose mother must not be lady whose blood must be polluted by admixture so base worse still life companion who must be deficient in attribute man a ralph newton must look for in wife sir thomas be man to magnify rather than lessen evil now allowed friend man for whose behalf have bound to use exercise of friendship to go from with idea that nothing suicide must prevent marriage simply because there be amount of debt when compared with man prospect must hardly have be regarded a burden a thought of sir thomas be very unhappy ralph have left at about ten o'clock then sat brooding over misery for about hour be custom when remained in chamber to tell clerk stemm between nine ten that nothing more must be wanted then stemm must go sir thomas must sleep for while in chair old clerk never stirred till thus dismissed be now eleven sir thomas knew very well that stemm must be in closet opened door called stemm aroused from slumber slowly crept into room joseph said master want mr ralph paper to night sir thomas well yes to night ought to have told when went away be thinking of thing so be thinking of thing said stemm a very slowly made way into other room climbing up set of step stood there pulled down from upper shelf tin box with world of dust if 'd have said before that 'd be wanted sir thomas there must be such deal of dry muck said stemm a put down box on chair opposite sir thomas knee now where be key said sir thomas stemm shook head very slowly know stemm where be how be to know sir thomas know sir thomas be like enough in one of drawer then stemm pointed to certain table after while slowly followed own finger drawer be unlocked under various loose paper there lay four five loose key like enough be one of said stemm of course knew where be said sir thomas did know nothing at about said stemm bobbing head at master making at same time gesture with lip whereby intended to signify that master be making fool of stemm be hardly more than five foot high be wizened dry old man with very old yellow wig delighted in scolding world special delight be in scolding master against world must take master part have care in world except master comfort when sir thomas passed evening at fulham stemm must do a pleased with be blank evening with stemm when sir thomas be away while sir thomas be in next room always felt that be in company when sir thomas be away london be open to offered occupation be key said stemm picking out one be a put there did tell a be there did know be there guessed just because do chuck thing in there sir thomas what doe matter joseph said sir thomas doe matter when say knowed did know must know there be key anyhow can go now joseph said sir thomas good night sir thomas said stemm retiring slowly did know sir thomas must know then sir thomas unlocked box gradually surrounded with paper took from be past one o'clock before again began to think what have better do to put ralph newton on leg to save from marrying breech maker daughter sat meditating on other thing a came into mind for over hour then wrote following letter to old mr newton very many year have passed since have seen mr newton so many that two men must not have known other have met there have be occasional correspondence between be presumed to be on amicable term with other southampton building th july dear sir wish to consult about affair of heir late ward ralph newton of course be aware of unfortunate misunderstanding have hitherto separated from a to believe will be willing to allow that at least have not be in fault though life have by mean be what friend must have wished be fine young fellow perhaps error have arisen a much from unfortunate position a from natural tendency to evil on own part have be brought up to great expectation with immediate possession of small fortune together have taught to think that profession be unnecessary for have be debarred from occupation generally fall in way of heir to large landed property by unfortunate fact of entire separation from estate will one day be have be son instead of nephew think that life must have be prosperous useful a be have got into debt fear that remains of own property will not more than suffice to free from liability of course must raise money on interest in newton estate hitherto have not done so be most anxious to save from course so ruinous a will be also be sure have come to for advice grieve to say have formed project of placing right again a regard money by offering marriage to daughter of retail tradesman have reason to believe that hitherto have not committed think that young woman father must accept offer if made money doubt must be forthcoming result must not be fortunate must then have allied with people who be not fit to be associate must have tied to wife who may be merit a woman can not be fit to be mistress of newton priory have not known what advice to give have pointed out to misery of such match have also told how surely prospect for future must be ruined be to attempt to live on money borrowed on uncertain security of future inheritance have said so much a plainly a know how to say have be unable to point out third course have not ventured to recommend to make application to seems however to must be remiss in duty to to be not to make acquainted with circumstance so that may interfere must please to do so either on behalf on behalf of property offence there may have be think there can have be none personally from to beg to believe that be far from being desirous to dictate to to point out to that a duty venture to think that will be obliged to for giving information may lead to protection of interest can not be dear to in conclusion will only again say that ralph be clever well conditioned a most truly believe thorough gentleman be intercourse between that of father son think must feel proud of relationship remain dear sir very faithfully yours thomas underwood gregory newton esq newton priory be written on friday night be posted on saturday morning by faithful hand of joseph stemm who however did not hesitate to declare to a read address that master be fool for pain stemm have never be favourable to cause of young newton have considered from first sir thomas must have declined trust have be imposed upon what good be to be expected from such guardianship a thing have gone on proving stemm prophecy a to young newton career to be true that trusty clerk have not failed to remind master of own misgiving told so have be repeated by stemm over over again in more phrase than one until repetition have made sir thomas very angry sir thomas when gave letter to stemm for posting said not word of content stemm knew something of old mr gregory newton newton priory estate stemm moreover must put two two together be fool for pain be said stemm a poked letter into box during whole of next day matter troubled sir thomas what if ralph must go at once to breech maker daughter thought of whom made sir thomas very sick commit before answer must be received from mr newton be only on sunday that idea struck that might still do something further to avoid evil with object despatched note to ralph imploring to wait for few day before must take step towards desperate remedy of matrimony then begged ralph to call upon again on wednesday morning note ralph did not get till went home on sunday evening at time a reader know have not a yet committed to desperate remedy on following tuesday sir thomas received following letter from mr newton newton priory th july dear sir have received letter respecting mr ralph newton affair in regard to a far a concern be free to say that feel much interest be quite right in suggestion that solicitude in respect of family property be very great need not trouble by pointing out nature of solicitude may a well at once make offer to a mr ralph newton friend a experienced lawyer can consider communicate to if think right to do so seems that will be driven to raise money on interest in property have always felt that must do so that from habit of life property must be squandered before came into possession why must not sell reversion why must not buy write in ignorance presume such arrangement must be legal honourable on part sum to be given must be named without difficulty by actuary be now fifty five believe in good health yourself will probably know within few thousand pound what must be value of reversion proper person must however be of course employed have saved money by mean enough for such outlay a must however mortgage property sell one half of if by doing so must redeem other half from mr ralph newton doubt will understand exactly nature of offer will let have answer know can in other way expedite mr ralph newton course in life be dear sir faithfully yours gregory newton senior when sir thomas read be almost in greater doubt difficulty than before measure proposed by elder newton be doubt legal honourable must hardly be so carried out a to be efficacious ralph must only sell share of inheritance rather chance of inheriting estate be to die without son before uncle then brother must be heir arrangement however if practicable must at once make thing comfortable for ralph must give probably large unembarrassed revenue so large that owner of need certainly have recourse to discreditable marriage a mean of extricating from present calamity then sir thomas have very strong idea about family property be ralph affair indeed in such disorder a to make necessary for to abandon great prospect of being newton of newton if breech maker twenty thousand must suffice surely thing must be done on cheaper term than suggested by old squire done without intervention of polly neefit chapter xi newton priory newton priory be at time inhabited by two gentleman old gregory newton who for mile round

not to be have known so long that did not remember day when have not known occasionally squire must observe with curse that must not be done with property house pulled down such built copse grupped up

brother rector will marry have family yet if there be word about timber have not slightest right even wish to object to doing so said rector a long a thing be on present footing will continue to do duty soon after that have come to pas that brother so quarrelled that intercourse between be at end such revenge such absolute punishment a squire have threatened must have be very pleasant to not even for such pleasure a must ruin boy whom loved did not marry saved money dreamed of buying up reversion of nephew interest son be just two year older than ralph up in london father be desirous that must marry wife must be mistress of house a long a live at least have once said there be difficulty about said son of course there be difficulty know whether be not better must remain unmarried said few minute later there be men whom marriage doe not seem to suit mean a regard position father turned away groaned aloud when be alone on evening of day a be sitting together over wine son alluded not exactly to same subject to thought have arisen from within own mind father said know whether must be better for to make up with cousin have down here what cousin said squire turning sharply round with gregory eldest brother reader will perhaps remember that gregory of day be parson believe be good fellow have done harm have done harm father can not help know be to die gregory must be in same position must be better that family must be kept together must sooner have devil here consideration on earth will induce to allow to put foot upon place not whilst live son said nothing further sat together in silence for quarter of hour after elder of two rose from chair coming round table put hand on son shoulder kissed son brow father said young man think that be troubled by thing hardly touch at by god touch close enough said elder have taken place month two before date of sir thomas letter reference to matter of be doubt always thinking be very rare between newton priory be place father might well wish to leave unimpaired to son lay in north of hampshire where county be joined to berkshire perhaps in england there be prettier district country in moorland woodland pasture be more daintily thrown together to please eye in there be sweeter air more thorough seeming of english wealth english beauty english comfort who know eversley bramshill heckfield strathfieldsaye will acknowledge that be so then how few be englishman who travel to see beauty of own country newton priory newton peele a parish be called lay somewhat west of place be a charming a of entire parish belonged to mr newton a did portion of three four parish adjoining house be neither large remarkable for architecture be comfortable room indeed be low for have be built in ungainly day of queen anne with addition in equally ungainly time of george ii passage be long narrow bedroom be up down stair a though pain have be taken that two must be on level window be of ugly shape whole mass be uncouth formless partaking neither of gothic beauty of stuart architecture of palatial grandeur have sprung up in day stood low giving little view from window nevertheless there be family comfort warm solidity about house endeared to who knew well there have be time in present squire have thought of building for entirely new house on site on rising brow of hill quarter of mile away from present residence have remembered that a must not leave estate to son behoved to spend nothing on property duty did not demand from house stood in park of two hundred acre in ground be poor indeed beautifully diversified by rising knoll little ravine seemed to make space almost unlimited then pine waved in newton wood sighed moaned with melody in ear of owner be equalled by of other fir tree in world broom be yellower at newton than elsewhere more plentiful heather be sweeter wild thyme on grass more fragrant so at least mr newton be always ready to swear must not leave behind to son must die with knowledge that a soon a breath be out of body must become property of young man whom hated might not cut down pine wood disturb venerable single tree be glory of park there be moment in thought that must take delight in ploughing up furze in stripping hill side of heather why must estate be so beautiful for one who be nothing to must not be well that must sell everything be saleable in order that own son might be richer on day after have written reply to sir thomas be rambling in evening with son through wood nothing must be more beautiful than park be now ralph have be speaking of glory of place something have occurred to make father revert to condition of certain tenant whose holding on property be by mean satisfactory to to landlord know sir said son told last year that darvell must have to go where be to go to will go to workhouse if stay here will be much better for to be bought out while there be still something left for to sell nothing can be worse than man sticking on to land without shilling of capital of course be bad father did very well there father did very well there till took to drink died of know where road part darvell farm brownriggs just look at difference of crop there be place with wheat on side of be looking at before dinner brownriggs be in different parish brownriggs be in bostock land be of same quality of course walker be different sort of man from darvell believe there be nearly four hundred acre in brownriggs said father darvell have about seventy land must be made to bear same produce per squire paused moment then asked question what must say if proposed to sell brownriggs now there be two three matter made proposition to sell brownriggs very wonderful proposition to come from squire in first place must sell acre of property at of fact son be very well aware then of farm on estate be perhaps best most prosperous mr walker tenant be man in very good circumstance who hunted be popular be just man of whose tenancy landlord must be ashamed illustration what must say if proposed to sell brownriggs sell brownriggs said young man well yes must be surprised must sell not at present said squire how must be sold at be now standing at gate leading out of park into field held by squire in own hand be leaning on father said son wish must not trouble about estate let thing come go just a have be arranged prefer to arrange for if can come to that may be possible to buy reversion of property must not buy if did must sell portion of to raise money have be thinking over making calculation if let be farm go ingram think must manage rest of course must depend on value of own life there be long pause during be still leaning on gate be phantom sir young man said at last what do mean by phantom see phantom reversion can be bought sold a well a other property if be sold in case be a free to buy a other man who say be to be sold sir say so that prig of barrister sir thomas underwood have already made overture to to do something for young scoundrel in london be scoundrel for be spending money be not own be now about to make marriage will disgrace family squire probably did not at moment think of disgrace have brought upon family by not marrying fact be that will have to sell that can sell why must not buy if be to die suggested son wish must said father say that sir if be to die gregory here who be a good fellow a ever lived must come into shoe ralph must sell no more than own chance must get gregory to join said energetic squire also must sell right have better leave a be sir said son after pause feel sure that will only get into trouble place be yours a long a live must enjoy know that be going to jew after not if can help wo marry a thing be 'd marry quick enough if knew must remain here after death if be sure that child of yours must inherit estate mean to try on be best that must know whatever can make over to jew can make over to a be what be about will keep eye open will go up to london about see carey next week man can do deal if set thoroughly to work 'd leave alone if be said young man will not leave alone may be able to get will do best to secure part of if be to go have better be land in bostock twining think must manage to keep newton entire mind be always on subject though be not often that said word about to son in whose behalf be so anxious thought be always dwelling on so that whole peace comfort of life be disturbed life interest in property be perhaps a much a man desire to have when for whose protection be debarred from further privilege of ownership be well loved son entail limit owner right on behalf of heir who be not loved who be looked upon a enemy be very grievous in case man who be so limited so cramped so hedged in robbed of true pleasure of ownership have son with whom must have be willing to share everything whom must have be delight to consult a to roof to be built tree to be cut lease to be granted denied must dream of telling son with certain luxury of self abnegation that question a to estate must be settled in interest not of setting of rising sun be affair rather than mine boy do a like must picture to in imagination pleasant half mock melancholy in saying such thing in sharing rein of government between own hand of heir a sun be falling in heaven evening light come on world wealth prosperity afford pleasure equal to be delight enables man to feel up to last moment that good of world be good of be to be robbed in spite of prudence might perhaps sometimes occur to that by own vice have brought scourge upon back not le on account did cause to rebel against rod then there must come upon idea that might cure evil be energy sufficient that heard of nephew heir whom hated tended to make think that cure be within reach there have be moment in have planned scheme of leading on reprobate into quicker deeper destruction of pretended friendship with spendthrift in order money for speedier ruin might be lent on security uncle be so anxious to posse a very own scheme of iniquity though have be planned mapped out in brain have never be entertained a thing really to be done there be few of who have not allowed thought to work on that villany arranging method of performance though performance be far enough from purpose amusement be not without danger to squire of newton have so far be injurious that have tended to foster hatred must however hing be dishonest nothing that world must condemn nothing must not bear light argument to mainly trusted be that if ralph newton heir have anything to sell be pleased to sell be a open to to buy a to other if reversion of estate of newton priory be in market why must not buy reversion part of reversion if such be case certainly must buy chapter xii mr brownlow there be certain old mr brownlow who inhabited large old fashioned house on fulham road just beyond fashionable confines of brompton nearer to town than decidedly rural district of walham green parson green

unmarried to one else hardly doubted that must do duty be sanguine old lady who always believed that thing must go right bustled fussed on present occasion with very evident intention of getting seat for next to clarissa clarissa be a active in avoiding such arrangement ralph soon found placed between mary bonner very deaf old lady who be always present at mr brownlow tea party suppose have be got

though word spoken between have be treason to herself yet have almost be rude to old mr brownlow in manner in have placed on one side of circle when old lady have begged to sit on other certainly have heard be said between lover cousin there be nothing in word to offend did not hear must see that ralph looked into mary beautiful face that mary smiled in demure silent self assured way be already becoming odious to clarissa clarissa when ralph looked into face must blush turn away feel unable to bear gaze of god in few minute there came to be sudden move young people trooped back into garden

of follower clarissa lingered also because ralph have be first to stir ralph have gone out with mary bonner therefore clarissa have held back so came to pas that found walking round garden with witty exhilarating middle aged gentleman whom for present at least most cordially hated be not quite sure that dear old friend be right said witty man whose name be poojean chair to sit down upon wall two around one few little knick nacks about carpet table sort of thing be comfortable at time wonder must leave then said clarissa can there be wonder leave with such temptation a said gallant poojean clarissa hated worse than ever must not look at even make faintest sign that heard voice of ralph newton through tree struck ear yet voice be loud a must not be if be addressed with tenderness to mary there be bound by indissoluble knot to mr poojean that mr newton be friend of yours asked mr poojean yes friend of ours said clarissa then will express intense admiration for wit general character

got touch of poetry in said poojean to in meantime clarissa pausing moment a entered through open window heard ralph cheery voice how well knew tone still paused with ear erect striving to catch word from cousin mouth mary word if be word spoken by be too low soft to be caught oh if must turn out to be sly clarissa said to be true that ralph have be flirting with a odious man have said why why why have ralph not come to if really loved a have twice told that did of course have not thrown into arm when old mr brownlow made that foolish fuss still might have come to might have waited for in

gentlemanlike amiable prejudice thought that clergyman must be graduate from one of three university including trinity dublin thought also that clergyman must be gentleman thought that dissenter be great mistake thought that convocation must be potential thought that church have certain power privilege parliament must not take away except by spoliation thought that parson must always be well dressed according to order thought that bishop of diocese be purest best noblest peer in england thought that newton churchyard be of spot on earth most lovely thought very little of thought that of delight given by god for delectation of creature love of clarissa underwood must be most delightful in thinking be astray carried away by prejudice be not strong enough to withstand joint effect of so many fault in judgment be not disagreeable a one result of effect gregory newton be loved respected believed in by men woman poor rich who lived within knowledge of name uncle gregory who be wont to be severe in judgment on men must declare that rev gregory a be called be perfect then squire be man who be very much subject to prejudice there be now ever have be great freedom of discussion between ralph newton of priory cousin gregory if under circumstance two young men may be called cousin respecting affair of property there be naturally much to check to prevent such freedom own interest in regard to property be a far a went adverse young parson might possibly inherit whole of estate whereas be aware that present squire must move heaven earth to leave portion of to own son gregory have always taken brother part before squire squire much a liked parson be never slow in abusing parson brother must have be more than natural have question of property be by tacit agreement always kept out of sight between two young men have grown up from boyhood together a firm friend there be reticence between on important subject squire son have never known mother must therefore speak of own position a must hardly have be possible to have memory of form person remained with then though interest be opposite nothing that must say must much affect interest two men be sitting on lawn at priory after dinner smoking cigar ralph other ralph have just told parson of intention of joining father in london see can do good said ralph wish of course will go wo see brother suppose must think not know what father feeling be certainly will not go out of way to offend have animosity against ralph must do good by opposing father said parson not what wish be otherwise be trouble to that can not have ralph here though perhaps must not care to come feel hard too that must not be allowed to see place in measure belongs to wish with heart that father did not think so much about estate much a love old place can hardly think about without bitterness have father brother be on good term together there must have be none of nothing that must do success in effort can make be a must have be have be born heir be misfortune of course one feel think must feel le be not so fixed in purpose to undo what can never be undone will never succeed said gregory probably not though for matter suppose ralph will be driven to raise money on inheritance will never sell property seems that doe spend money faster than can get may have done so be not always in debt to be not now thinking of marrying tradesman daughter to relieve of embarrassment have to own suppose that master ralph have made mess of money matter parson who must deny fact hardly knew what to say on brother behalf protest to greg that if father be to tell that have changed mind paid brother debt out of sheer kindness uncleship rest of must be well pleased wo do doe seem to probable that estate will get into hand of jew financier professional money dealer unless father can save must be glad to see shopkeeper daughter calling mr newton of newton shopkeeper daughter need not necessarily be bad sort of woman said gregory chance be that shopkeeper daughter will not be educated lady come greg can not say that be kind of way out of mess must approve be so sorry that there must be mess at just so be pity that there must be mess be not come old fellow drink coffee let take turn across park want to see what larkin be doing about sheep often feel that coming into world be mess altogether though now that be

underwood second to brother will place latter first newton th august dear ralph doubt know by time that uncle gregory be in london though will probably not have seen understand that have come up with express purpose of making settlement in regard to property on account of embarrassment need not tell how sorry be that state of affair must make necessary ralph go up also to morrow though doe not purpose to hunt up hope that may meet know what think of how much wish that two must be friend be a generous a sun a just a be generous newton ought to make welcome a one of family a to money know what may be state of affair only hear from what hears from father sooner than that must endanger inheritance here will make sacrifice if there be anything can do be welcome to sell share of holborn property can pay after uncle death can get on very well with living a be not probable that will marry at rate understand must infinitely prefer to lose shilling of london property to hearing that have imperilled position here at newton suppose that what have can go far a far a will go be at service can show letter to sir thomas if think fit must say ever so much more only that will know without saying can not bear that must think must preach sermon to never mind what said before about money wanted then can do without now uncle will pay for entire repair of chancel out of own pocket ever so

have asked thrice to be wife with very little interval indeed between separate prayer have be so answered that entertained hope have there be faintest expectation in mind that clarissa must at last become wife must have be deterred by sense of duty from making to brother that generous offer of property owned have such hope clarissa have given thrice answer of answer be most grievous to true hearted lover felt for unbounded esteem must always regard a friend short decided negative doubtful even indignant repulse may be changed may give way to second conviction to better acquaintance to altered circumstance even simply to perseverance assurance of esteem friendship mean only can mean that lady regard lover a might do old uncle patriarchal family connection whom after fashion love who can never be to one creature to be worshipped above others such be gregory newton idea a to own chance of success so believing have resolved that must never press suit again endeavoured to conquer love that found to be impossible thought that be so impossible that have determined to give up endeavour though must have advised others that by god mercy sorrow in world must be cured told without arraigning god mercy that for sorrow must not be cured did not scruple therefore to assure brother that must not marry did hesitate in writing to patience underwood to assure that love for sister be unchangeable in saying so urged suit be impossible that must write to house without message none other from to must be true message must not hurt must not even give trouble to think whether have decided well quite understood nature of love wanted love must have felt to be happiness to lean upon bosom without love must not have wished to take with such love a that knew must not fill heart therefore be that must satisfy with walking round churchyard of newton peele telling that pleasure of world be best to be found in pursuit of joy of next chapter xv clarissa wait when patience clarissa have got to own room on night on have walked back from mr brownlow house to popham villa during long walk clarissa hand have lain gently upon ralph newton arm elder sister looked painfully anxiously into younger face in order that if be possible might learn without direct enquiry what have be said during hour of close communion have ralph meant to speak there must have be time more appropriate patience hardly knew what wished except that wished that sister might have everything be good joyous prosperous there be never look of pain came across clary face patience suffered touch of inner agony feeling be so strong that sympathised even with clary folly with clary fault almost knew that must not be well that ralph must be encouraged a lover brilliant a be future prospect dear

over to take tea with friend hour that spent there be passed half indoors half out certainly ralph attention be chiefly paid to miss bonner miss bonner however be so discreet in demeanour that one must have suggested that approach have be made to flirtation to tell truth mary who have received no confidence from cousin who be girl slow to excite give confidence have seen sign heard word have created on mind suspicion of truth be not that thought that clary heart be irrecoverably given to young man that there seemed to be just something with might be a well that must not interfere be there on sufferance dependent on uncle charity for daily bread let uncle say what might to contrary a yet hardly knew cousin be quite sure that be not known by heard that ralph newton be man of fashion heir to large fortune knew to be utterly destitute knew to be possessed of great beauty in bosom doubtless there be ambition to win by beauty from man whom must love good thing of be so destitute did not lack ambition have high hope grounded on knowledge of own charm beauty certain sufficiency of intellect of extent of be in remarkable degree aware be gift with have be endowed knew when might use honestly when ought to refrain from using ralph have looked at a men do look who wish to be allowed to love to be much more clearly intelligible than to clarissa who be two year senior though have seen ralph thrice already felt that might have on knee before if cared so to place there be suspicion of something have gone before feeling that honour gratitude perhaps also self interest called upon to be cold in manner to ralph newton have purposely avoided companionship in walk home from mr brownlow house now a wandered about lawn shrubbery of popham villa took care not to be with out of earshot of others in of there be ten time more of womanly cleverness cunning will say than have come to possession of clarissa underwood cunning be did not deserve that objectionable epithet must be

ignorant of other way to progress with flirtation be engrossing in warm latitude be so natural to make offer after fifth dance be way of people in latitude seems to lead to harm men woman do marry on small income starve world go on wagging mary bonner however whose father rank have at least be higher than of adorer who knew that great gift have be given to have held aloof from have early resolved to bide time be still biding time with patience sufficient to enable to resist glance of ralph newton clarissa underwood behaved very well on evening gave merry glance at sister devoted to miss spooner mary be so wise so prudent that there be cause for great agony a far a clary must see ralph have quite a much to say to patience a to mary for have resolved that must wait manner to be very pretty almost manner of sister to brother then stayed resolutely with miss spooner while ralph be certainly tempting mary down by river side did not last long be soon gone miss spooner have soon followed be very amusing mary said a soon a be alone very amusing said patience uncommonly good looking be considered very handsome man here yes suppose be said patience know that ever thought much about of course be said clarissa nobody can doubt about there be people a to whom be a absurd not to admit that be handsome a must be to say that fine picture be not beautiful ralph be one such person of course know mary must not seem to take allusion even by smile always thought gregory much nicer looking said patience must be because be in love with said clarissa there be speaking brightness eloquence in eye softness of feeling in expression of face be above beauty continued patience with energy here be poetry said clarissa eloquence softness eye feeling expressive speaking brightness 'd better say at once that be god wish knew said mary bonner will know before long doubt when do will know one of best fellow in world will admit a much a will not admit that can be compared to brother in regard to good look in poor clarissa who have nothing to console resolve to wait with courage bore well gallantly soon after there arrived at popham villa note from gregory newton a happened sir thomas be at home on morning heard tidings if young mr newton doe come get to dine will take care to be at home said sir thomas patience suggested that ralph own ralph must be asked to meet to sir

have be hardly treated one doe know how be why come what be why doe come must have taken gregory newton for husband yet have thing to recommend wish have asked patty say that dear because there be in something that annoys think of in such matter do hope to see happy wife of happy man hope will with heart said clary standing up of one man of one special dearest best brightest of men oh dear yet

event be so important that patience found necessary to go up to london to tell father mary went with desirous to see something of mystery of southampton building while clarissa remained at home waiting after usual skirmish with stemm who began by swearing that master be not at home made way into sir thomas library dear dear dear be very awkward place to bring cousin to said frowning mary must have retreated at once have not be that patience held ground so boldly why must come papa have to see mr newton be to dine with to morrow to morrow be saturday sir thomas became seriously displeased why have saturday be chosen saturday be most awkward day in world for giving receiving of dinner be in vain that patience explained to that saturday be only day on mr newton must come that sir thomas have given express authority for dinner that bar have be raised against saturday ought to have known said sir thomas nevertheless allowed to leave chamber with understanding that must preside at own table on following day why be that saturday be so distasteful to mary asked a walked across lincoln inn field together patience be silent for awhile not knowing how to answer question how to leave unanswered at last preferred to make reply doe not like going to church think like yes wish papa did doe then there be pause of course must strike a very odd way in live hope be not who

people if must see people pleasant laughing be that wanted be hard to say what be best papa be a good to a ever can be so be papa good to in way oh dear people used to come there poor papa used to say that hospitality be chief duty sometimes used to think that world must be much pleasanter better if there be such thing a hospitality if people always eat drank alone lived a uncle doe in chamber there must not be so much money wasted at rate papa never waste money said patience though there never be more generous man ralph newton ralph of priory came to dinner miss spooner be asked to meet might have be supposed that party so composed must not have be very bright party at villa went off very satisfactorily ralph made popular with everybody became very popular with sir thomas by frank easy way in spoke of family difficulty at newton wish namesake knew father said when be alone with lawyer after dinner never spoke of of newton a cousin though to gregory whom knew well loved dearly must declare that from felt entitled to exact due of cousinship must be desirable said sir thomas never give up know father dare say thought brother interfered with suppose did more affectionate

get over money difficulty said sir thomas see why there must be money difficulty said ralph a far a be concerned there need be none ralph newton have made money difficulty said sir thomas if have be careful with own fortune there must have be question a to property between father can understand can understand also father anxiety though share must be better that namesake must have estate can see into matter quite well enough to know be to be mine there must occur exactly that father wish to avoid must be owner of newton priory people must call mr newton must be newton of newton have better go to ralph must live elsewhere people must not notice then sir thomas a looked up at young man leaning back in arm chair holding glass half full of wine in hand must not tell that greater be pity off shoot of newton stock who declared of that never must be newton of newton be fine manly fellow to look at not handsome a be ralph heir not marked by singular mixture of gentleness intelligence sweetness be written not only on countenance in demeanour very step of gregory be bigger man than of with broad chest square brow be not without bright gleam of newton blue eye characterised family there be so much of man in whereas in manhood ralph heir have certainly be deficient ralph must lie on bed that have made said sir thomas of course will accept good thing come in way a far a can see at present will be best for ralph that father must redeem from portion at least of property girl be waiting for to go out perhaps will like cigar on lawn be clear to one there to see that other newton greatly admired west indian cousin mary with newcomer seemed to talk on easier term than have ever done before since have be at fulham smiled listened be gracious made pleasant little half affected sally girl do make to men when know that be admired be satisfied that must be so story have be told to might be that poor orphan felt that be better fitted to associate with almost nameless one than with true heir of family mr newton when got up to leave asked permission to come again left with pleasant air of intimacy two boat have passed racing on river almost close to edge of lawn newton have offered to bet with mary a to must first reach bridge wish have taken wager miss bonner said because then must have be bound to come back at once to pay be very well mr newton said mary have heard of

not of twenty rather one so called bootmaker who must suffer by propagation of such creed be beloved almost worshipped by denizen of cheshire cheese how far real philanthropy of man may have be marred by uneasy fatuous ambition how far be carried away by feeling that be better to make speech at cheshire cheese than to apply for payment of money due to father must be very hard for to decide that there be alloy even in ontario moggs be probable of alloy hearer knew nothing to be perfect specimen of combination be so grateful to of rich man position with poor man sympathy therefore clattered

jealous too of gasfitter when have seen polly whirling round room in gasfitter arm gasfitter be gentleman battle have be even in spite of whirling still have chance against gasfitter introduction of purple fine linen element into affair be maddening to with scorn for gentry ontario moggs in heart feared gentleman thought that must make effort to punch ralph newton head if two be ever to be brought together in spot convenient for such operation of man standing in world be afraid seemed to to be impossible that polly must prefer one of class to suitor whose hand be always clean whose shirt be always white whose word be soft well chosen who carried with none of stain of work moggs be a true a steel in genuine love of labour of labour with great l of people with great p of trade

doubt that month of august be very sad time indeed for ralph heir with month be may say idle month a rule august be of most idle sometimes must affect to shoot grouse hunting not grouse shooting be passion a sportsman must leave london spend perhaps couple of day with mr horsball looking at nag then must run down to sea side place flirt laugh waste time upon sand must go abroad a far a dieppe perhaps biarritz so must saunter through end of summer must not be supposed of that be not fully conscious that manner of life be most pernicious knew well knew that must take to dog made faint resolve at improvement hardly for hour hoped to be able to keep be in truth anything happy be usual life so for last three four year have contrived to get through month of august now utmost sternness of business have come upon be forced to remain in town found sitting day after day in lawyer anteroom be compelled to seek various interview with sir thomas in be impossible that sir thomas must make very pleasant worst of be at last told that must make up own mind squire newton be also up in london though london be never much to taste be in day by mean so wretched a nephew be intent on certain object began to hope nay to think that object might be achieved have not once seen nephew having declared conviction very strongly that must be better for party that must remain apart own lawyer saw frequently ralph lawyer once sir thomas more than once twice there be considerable delay squire must not leave london till something be if not settled at rate arranged towards settlement be expression of will conveyed through two lawyer kept ralph in london what be worth of ralph interest in property be one great question must ralph sell interest when price be fixed that be second question ralph to whom difficulty of giving answer be a labour of hercules staved off evil day for awhile by declaring that must know what be price before must say whether must sell article exact price must not be fixed lawyer combined in saying that absolute sum of money to include ralph interest in estate must not be named that side of christmas be not to be thought of actuary valuer lawyer conveyancer must dispose of so great matter by month work something approaching to settlement might be made sum might be named a minimum compact might be made subject to arbitration of sworn appraiser sum be named matter be carried so far that ralph be told that must sign away right by middle of september sign away entire property have pocket filled with ample fund for moonbeam other delight might pay off moggs neefit longer feel that polly poor dear polly be millstone round neck must indeed in event be so well provided that did not for moment doubt that if chose so to circumscribe clarissa underwood might be wife saving of squire life must be enough a opposing lawyer told with eager pressing word to give estate of over thousand year at once may be more probably will be more said lawyer at very least sum approaching to thirty thousand pound must be paid over to at once might do what pleased with there be still remnant of own paternal property sufficient to pay debt why must man whose encumbrance be so trifling sacrifice prospect be so glorious must not part with portion of estate with reversion of half of so that house of newton newton priory with grouse paddock adjacent farm might be left to if whole be saleable surely so also must be third of money offered to must more than suffice for want doubt might sell half not to squire must effect such sale immediately a must do if squire bought on such term a be offered by squire money might raise at once certainly became by degree a thing certain to that if once raised money in way estate must fly from uncle be hale man people told that own life be not so much better than uncle uncle have great object if ralph chose to sell at fact must be worth thousand to uncle must not buy reversion of half of portion of property squire at last spoke mind freely on matter to sir thomas will never be cast in son teeth said that next neighbour be real man early in life made mistake have have to pay for ever since be paying for now must pay for to end paying for will be of small service if boy have to pay for afterwards sir thomas understood did not press point ralph be nearly driven wild with need of deciding moggs bill at two month be coming due knew that must expect mercy there to neefit establishment in conduit street have gone once have have word a waddle have told to rival neefit be still persistent in wish still urgent that newton must go forth to hendon like man pop at once will tell what captain said have taken to calling ralph captain a goodly familiar name feeling doubt that mister be cold between father in law son in law not quite daring to drop reverential title if be little hard up a know be can have three four hundred if want ralph did want sorely know how stand with old moggs said neefit will see right there neefit be very urgent too have heard something of dealing among lawyer to have polly mr newton of newton priory prize be worth fighting for let frighten about little ready money captain if come to other folk have got ready money besides trust in surprise said ralph already owe money ca pay know where to trust know where not to trust if will once say a how will pop question to polly fair honest on square will have five hundred bless if sha if take after why then must look for money by bye if be on square with captain will never find hard to deal with hope will be on square at rate then step out to pop hereupon ralph made long intricate explanation of affair object of be to prove to mr neefit that little more delay be essential be so environed by business difficulty at present moment that must take immediate step such a mr neefit suggested such step quite immediately in about fortnight in month at furthest must be able to declare purpose how about moggs said neefit putting hand into breech pocket pulling down corner of mouth fixing saucer eye full upon young man face so stood for second then came word of waddle have spoken neefit must not disentangle intricacy of ralph somewhat fictitious story have wit enough to know what meant ai on square captain be what ai said at last must be owned that accusation be just be made so loudly that waddle did not at exaggerate in saying that there have be word nevertheless when ralph left shop neefit relented come to captain when moggs bit of stiff come round few day after ralph went to sir thomas with object of declaring decision at least sir thomas understood that such be to be purport of visit according to idea there have be quite enough of delay squire have be liberal in offer though thing to be sold be in bearing so valuable though carried with value in eye of sir thomas indeed in eye of englishman be far beyond money price though territorial position be for legitimate heir almost principality yet when man can not keep thing what can do part with ralph have made bed must lie upon sir thomas have done what must have amounted to nothing there be young man beggar for reversion have now power of selling a for mode of extrication by marrying breech maker daughter to sir thomas be infinitely worst evil of two let ralph accept uncle offer must still be english gentleman free to live a such free to marry a such free to associate with friend fitting to habit of life must be gentleman too with mean sufficing for gentleman want that escape by way of breech maker daughter must in accordance with sir thomas view of thing destroy everything well ralph said sighing almost groaning a late ward took now accustomed chair opposite to own wish never be born said ralph that gregory stood in place have be born ralph must take thing a find then there be long silence think know that must make up mind one way other uncle of course feel that a be ready to pay money at once be entitled to immediate answer see at said ralph be under obligation to uncle see why be to be bustled by be doing nothing for sake have at rate power of retracting let retract then will be just where be before ready to fall into hand of jew if must part with property can not do so on better term seems to that will be selling l year in land for about l year in fund just so be about suppose can tell when land will be yours whether will ever be yours at what be that have got to sell ralph be good going over again know that sir thomas have hoped must have come to decision if can save property of course ought to do so if can live on what pittance be left to can save then do save can save by marrying by selling to daughter of man who make breech can give advice on other point do advise not to do look upon ill assorted marriage a very worst kind of ruin can not myself conceive misery greater than of having wife whom must not ask friend to meet ralph when heard blushed up to root of hair remembered that when have first mentioned to sir thomas suggested marriage with polly neefit have said that a regarded polly thought that patience clarissa must not object to be now being told by sir thomas that daughter must certainly not consent to meet polly neefit must polly neefit become mr newton too have idea of own standing in world have not be slow to assure that woman whom might choose for wife must be fit companion for lady a long a woman be neither vicious disagreeable must make woman lady must at rate make polly neefit lady rose from seat prepared to leave room in disgust wo trouble by coming here again said be welcome ralph said sir thomas if must assist must be doubly welcome know have be great trouble to thankless fruitless worthless trouble will make up mind doubt in day two will just write line need not bother by coming more of course think great deal about doubt said sir thomas unluckily have be brought up to know value of what be have to throw away be kind of thing that man doe do without regret must have come earlier said sir thomas doubt did be use saying anything more about good day sir then flounced out of room impatient of single word of rebuke have be administered to sir thomas a soon a be alone applied at once to book have reluctantly put aside when be disturbed must not divest mind of trouble a quickly a chamber have be divested of presence of troubler have said ill natured word grieved then be not taking great matter too easily if must only put shoulder to wheel thoroughly might not do something to save friend lad who have be almost a own son from destruction must not be burden on conscience to last day of life that have allowed ward to be ruined when by sacrifice of own mean might have saved sat thought of did not really resolve that anything must be done be wont to think in same way of own child whom neglected conscience have be pricking life hardly pricked sharp enough to produce consequence during very moment in ralph be leaving southampton building have almost made up mind to go at once to alexandria cottage to throw future fate of newton priory at foot of polly neefit two incident in late interview with sir thomas tended to drive way sir thomas have told must marry daughter of man who made breech lady must associate with wife sir thomas also have seemed to imply that must sell property must show sir thomas that must have will way of own polly neefit must become wife must show world that proudest lady in land be treated with more delicate consideration by husband than breech maker daughter must be treated by when must please providence to decide that present squire of newton have reigned long enough over dominion must show world that have known something of own position value of own prospect then polly must be queen in newton dominion must see whether ordinary world of worshipper must not come worship a usual same did not on occasion go out to alexandria cottage when reached club found note from brother newton peele september th dear ralph have be sorry not to have have answer from to letter wrote to about month ago of course hear of what be going on ralph newton up at house tell everything squire be still in town a of course know there have got to be report about here that have a people say bought out still hope that be not true very idea of be terrible to that must sell for old song a be property have belonged to for century must not indeed go out of name a far a be concerned that be same will not refuse to do anything that may say be necessary to extricate from embarrassment ran hardly bring to believe that step so fatal a can be necessary if understand matter rightly difficulty be not so much in regard to debt a in want of mean of livelihood if so can not bring to live quietly for term of year of course ought to marry there may be difficulty there almost anything must be better than abandoning property a told before be welcome to use of whole of share of london property be very nearly l year must not live on till thing come round cousin ralph know that be writing to know what feeling be be not be so anxious for purchase pray write tell what be to be done most affectionately yours gregory newton must lose day in doing anything might direct about holborn property ralph received at club afterwards dined alone considering before evening be over thought that have made up mind that must not under circumstance give up reversionary right must make do even though went to prison said to let starve till died then property must go to gregory what did matter thing did matter be that estate must not be allowed to depart out of true line of newton family sat thinking of night before left club wrote following note to brother september th dear greg be sure of will not part with interest in property think can be forced will never do willingly may be may be driven to take advantage of liberality prudence if so can only say that will share property with when come yours always r n gave to porter of club a passed out then a went home acknowledged to that be tantamount to decision on part that must forthwith marry polly neefit chapter xviii wo sell brownriggs on th of september squire be informed that ralph newton demanded ten day for decision that have undertaken to communicate by letter on th squire have growled thinking that nephew be unconscionable have threatened to withdraw offer lawyer with smile assured that matter really be progressing very quickly that thing of kind must rarely be carried on so expeditiously that in short mr newton have fair ground of complaint when man pay through nose for whistle ought to get said squire plainly showing that idea a to price fixed be very different from entertained by nephew did not retract offer be too anxious to accomplish purchase to do that must go home said wait till th then must return to london did go home on first evening said very little to son felt that son did not quite sympathise with be sore that must be so must not be angry with son

belonged to newton of newton presence of feeling in mind of son be accusation against be very grievous to almost act of latter life have be done with object of removing cause for such accusation to make boy such a must have be in respect have not father sinned in youth have be one object of father life nobody gainsayed in that son nobody told that bother about estate be of avail nobody dared to tell so parson gregory in letter to brother must express such opinion sir thomas sitting alone in chamber must feel ralph legitimate heir with assumed scorn must declare to that let what might be sold must still be newton of newton country people might know farmer might whisper one to nobody said word of to squire own lawyer never alluded to such matter though be of course in thought nevertheless son whom loved so well must tell from day to day indirectly indeed with word be plain enough that thing be not to be done men woman called newton because father have chosen so to call a must have called tomkins montmorenci have first appeared before with of name be not newton nothing must make newton of newton priory not even possession of whole parish habitation in priory wish must think about son must say to father expression of such wish must contain whole accusation what other son must express desire that father must abstain from troubling to leave estate entire to child on morning

father heir must act in accord together now squire talked of pulling down building up a though property be own to do a liked with think can do without selling brownriggs continued squire when came to black white value that have in doe come to so much a thought still ralph said nothing nothing at least a to work have be done up in london merely made observation a to darvell farm suggesting that clear half year rent must be given to man have pretty well arranged in mind continued squire must part with twining lie so near a brownriggs ralph felt that must be necessary that must say something

there be so much of clinging trusting perfect love in father word towards son that latter must not bear to say word must produce sorrow when squire declared that ralph must have free to do just a pleased with with full glory of ownership ralph must not bring to throw doubt upon matter yet did doubt more than doubted felt almost certain that father be in error while father have remained alone up in town have be living with gregory have known what gregory thought believed have even seen namesake letter to gregory in be positively stated that reversion must not be sold throughout morning squire went on speaking of hope saying that must be done very moment that contract be signed at last ralph spoke out when on occasion father reproached for indifference do so fear that will be

expect to be married till next spring at earliest must take winter out of at moonbeam a sacrifice be to be made might a well enjoy must come of sacrifice then a sat in cab took to thinking whether after fashion at did love polly neefit from that got to thinking not of poor clary of mary bonner if uncle must at once be translated to fitting place among immortal oh what life might be uncle be still mortal after polly neefit be very jolly girl when got to house asked boldly for miss neefit have told that repulse must be injurious to if mr neefit be to refuse admission into house breech maker must be obliged to own that have done best there be repulse in two minute found in parlour with polly standing up to receive dear mr newton how odd might have come week running before 'd find here out be gone to fetch father home do not once month ralph assured that be quite contented a be that did not in least regret absence of mr neefit will be ever so unhappy like to see gentleman when call dislike asked ralph indeed then said polly now in what way be to do must be well to allude to father understanding with in ordinary way of love making ralph be quite a much at home a have found no difficulty in saying soft word to clarissa underwood in doing more than with polly matter be different there be inappropriateness in having to do thing at made difficult to unless must preface what did by allusion to agreement with father must hardly ask polly to be wife without giving reason for formation of so desperate wish on own part polly said at last be very awkward for that evening when mr moggs be here indeed be mr newton poor mr moggs must have stayed asked have be here since be then be walking together there be better fellow breathing than ontario moggs in own way be not company for mr newton of course ralph quailed at to be told that own boot maker be company for that by young lady whom intended to make wife think be company for polly said why not mr newton be a good a what be difference between father wondered whether when must be own must be able to teach to call mr neefit papa mr newton when know better will know be not one to give air have known mr moggs life be equal to anyways only be deal better hope there be nothing more than friendship polly what business have to hope upon theme spoke told in plain language that reason for so hoping be that trusted to be able to persuade to become own wife polly when word be spoken blushed ruby red trembled little thing have come to after might be real lady if pleased blushed ruby red trembled said not word for while then having made offer began to speak of love in speaking of be urgent enough word have not that sort of suasiveness must have possessed have be addressing to clary underwood polly said hope can love will love very dearly do can to make happy to will be first woman in world do think that can love polly polly be perhaps particular have not quite approved of manner in ontario have disclosed love though there have be something of eloquence of passion even in now be hardly satisfied with ralph newton have formed to herself perhaps idea of soft insinuating coaxing whisper something must be half caress half prayer something must at least be very gentle very loving ontario be loving be not gentle ralph newton be gentle then doubted whether be loving will say that will be so asked standing over looking down upon with most bewitching smile polly amidst blushing trembling made up mind that must say nothing of kind at present moment must like to be lady though be not ashamed of being tradesman daughter must not buy privilege of being lady at too dear price price must be very high indeed be to give to man who did not love perhaps despised then be not quite sure that must love man though be possessed of facility for liking nice young men ralph newton be well enough in many way be good looking must speak up for did not give air then a have be fully instructed by father must ultimately inherit large property be to marry position must be absolutely that of one of lady of land then knew must not know that sought because be in want of money for present need to be made lady of land must be delightful to have grand passion in regard to polly must not be satisfied unless there be a much love on one side a on other must be more delightful that latter be essentially necessary to man must take absolute pleasure in company whole thing must be failure so blushed trembled thought be silent dear polly do mean that can not love said ralph know said polly will try demanded ralph know that can love indeed indeed can ah yes can say so doubt there be many of a can say so yet be not in to do there be men a know hardly how to say yet be in heart while polly must have be thinking of ontario a made latter oracular observation know much about saying can do polly oh a for talking can talk have be brought up way have have nothing else much to do be very hard upon so felt think be not fair polly what can say to better than love will be good to oh good to people be always good to why must nobody will be so good a will be if will take tell polly do not believe when say love why must be false to ah well why be not for to say why father be putting up to be why father must put up to nothing of kind if be not that really loved there be thing mr newton what be polly be not at sure be so very fond of be unkind better be true than to rue said polly why mr newton know anything about other not a yet may be oh anything bad for what know for anything know may be idle extravagant regular man flirt polly have way of speaking truth without much respect to person then mr newton be not going to be given away by father just a plea father think mean for best love father dearly mean to take body a feel 'd pretty nigh break heart if be to have ai come to breaking heart for yet mr newton hope never will break heart suppose understand be how be let just stand by for year so mr newton see how be then maybe might get to know other just now marrying must be like taking husband out of lottery ralph stood looking at passing hand over head not quite knowing how to carry on suit will tell father what be saying to what said to continued polly who seemed quite to understand that ralph have done duty by creditor in making offer that justice to demanded that must be acknowledged by whole family be to be polly asked ralph in melancholy voice at present mr newton ralph a returned to london in cab felt more hurt by girl refusal of than must before have thought to be possible be almost disposed to resolve that must at once renew siege carry on a though there be question of twenty thousand pound of money borrowed from breech maker polly have shown so much spirit in interview have looked so well in showing have stood up such perfect specimen of healthy comely honest womanhood that thought that did love there be however one comfort clearly left to have done duty by old neefit money due must of course be paid have in good faith done that have pledged to do in taking money a to surrender of estate there be still left to four day in to think of chapter xx conservative of percycross early in month of september there have come proposition to sir thomas have thoroughly disturbed made for few day most miserable man by tenth of month however have so far recovered a to have made up mind in regard to proposition with feeling of triumphant expectation on following day went home to fulham communicated determination to eldest daughter in following word patience be going to stand for borough of percycross papa yes dare say be fool for pain will cost money ought to spend if get in know can do good that can do good suppose think be very wrong be delighted so will clary be

seat offered to without contest there be chance be down at percycross for two day last week now have put out address there be upon handed copy of placard to daughter who read doubt with more enthusiasm than did of free independent elector to whom be addressed story in regard to borough of percycross be a follows there be going forward in country at moment preparation for general election be to take place in reader of story have not a yet be troubled on head there having be connection between great matter small matter with tale have concerned in parliament lately dissolved very old borough of percycross percy st cross a place be properly called have displayed no political partiality having be represented by two gentleman one of whom always followed conservative leader other liberal leader into respective lobby of house of common borough have very nearly be curtailed of privilege in regard to two member in great reform bill have be initiated perfected carried through a whole by almost unaided intellect exertion of great reformer of age have have own luck a irishman say have be preserved intact now wise men of percycross rejoicing in salvation knowing that there might still be danger before must venture on contest for bribery have not be unknown in previous contest at percycross petition consequent upon bribery men have marvelled that borough must have escaped so long there be now supposed to be abroad spirit of assumed virtue in regard to such matter under percycross might still be sacrificed if percycross did not look very sharp after thinking of wise men at percycross have concluded that must be better just for present to let thing run smoothly to return two old member when new broom be to sweep up dirt of corruption be not quite so new might return to old game be in truth game very much loved in old town of percycross so thought wise men for while seemed that wise men be to have own way there be men at percycross who be not wise who must have that arrangement a showed lack of spirit conservative foolish men at percycross began by declaring that must return two member for borough if pleased that must do so unless be conceded to liberal foolish men swore that be ready for battle must concede nothing must stand up fight if word concession be named to must not only have one member must have alderman town councillor mayor patronage in beadle bell ringer bumbledom in general have great reformer of age given household suffrage for nothing liberal foolish men of percycross declared perhaps thought that must send two liberal member to parliament so borough grew hot there be one very learned pundit in part pundit very learned in political matter who thus prophesied to one of proposed candidate will spend thousand pound in election wo get in of course will petition will be thousand will succeed there disfranchise borough will be great career doubt will find satisfactory must show in percycross afterwards be spirit be afloat word of pundit be of avail liberal spirit have be set going men went to work with new list of borough voter by end of august be seen that there must be contest who must be new candidate old candidate be there one on side old tory young radical in telling tale will not go back to old sin of borough say aught good of past career of member old mr griffenbottom tory have be very generous with purse be beloved doubtless by many in borough be so well for borough to have one who be always ready with fifty pound note in that need be so comfortable in borough to know that can always have subscription list well headed young radical be popular throughout county one must take chair at mechanic meeting with better grace more alacrity spin out half hour speech with greater ease volubility then be born gentleman be so great recommendation for radical so in fact young mr westmacott though did not spend so much money a old griffenbottom be almost a popular in borough there be doubt about griffenbottom westmacott if only borough must have listened to wise men confined to political guardianship of such excellent representative foolish men prevailed over wise men be decided that there must be contest be evil day for griffenbottom when be suggested to that must bring colleague with griffenbottom knew what meant almost a well a learned pundit whose word have quoted griffenbottom have not be blessed with uncontested election have run through many peril have spent what be accustomed to call when speaking of political position among really intimate friend treasure in maintaining borough must often have considered within whether whistle be worth price have petitioned be petitioned against have have evil thing said of have gone through very heat of fire of political warfare have kept seat now at last so thought ease comfort of unopposed return be to repay for everything ala how be changed how spirit sank within when received that high toned letter from confidential agent mr trigger in be invited to suggest name of colleague be sure will be rejoiced to hear for sake of old borough said mr trigger that feel confident of carrying two seat must mr trigger have heard remark patron made on reading that letter mr trigger must have thought that mr griffenbottom be most ungrateful member of parliament in world what did not mr griffenbottom owe to borough of percycross did not owe position in world friend fact that be to be seen on staircase of cabinet minister that be called honourable friend by son of duke did not owe to borough of percycross mr trigger other friend of felt secure in conviction that have made man of mr griffenbottom mr griffenbottom understood enough of to answer mr trigger without inserting in letter of anathema uttered in privacy of own closet did indeed expostulate saying that must of course suggest colleague if colleague be required did not mr trigger other friend in dear old borough think that just at present moment pacific line of action must be best for interest of dear old borough mr trigger answered very quickly perhaps little sharply liberal have decided upon having two men in field therefore pacific line of action be no longer possible mr griffenbottom hurried over to dear old borough still hoping must hing scent of battle be in air foolish men of percycross be keen for blood mr griffenbottom smiled promised declared to that there be peace for politician on side grave made known desire desire rather of borough to certain gentleman connected with certain club in london gentleman in question on following day waited upon sir thomas sir thomas have always be true to party so gentleman in question be good enough to say everybody have regretted loss of sir thomas from house present opportunity of returning to be almost unparalleled seeing that thing be so nearly certainty griffenbottom have always be at top of poll large majority of new voter be men in employment of conservative master gentleman in question be very clear in explanation that there be complete understanding on matter between employer employed at percycross be nature of percycross artizan to vote a master voted made boot mustard paper at percycross men in mustard paper trade be quite safe excellent men who went in line to poll voted just a master paper maker master mustard maker desired gentleman from club acknowledged that there be difficulty about boot trade world over boot do affect radical sentiment master bootmaker there be four in borough be decided men must not be got at with certainty why must wish to get at demanded sir thomas of course not one doe wish to get at said gentleman from club particularly a be safe without then went into statistic succeeded in proving to sir thomas that there must be hard fight sir thomas who be much pressed a to time took day to consider did mr griffenbottom intend to fight battle with clean hand gentleman from club be eager in declaring that everything must be done in strict accordance with law must give guarantee a to expense presumed must be about l perhaps l certainly under l other party doubt must bribe always did on behalf on behalf of westmacott co there must be treating intimidation subornation fictitious voting sin to election be subject always be so with liberal at percycross sir thomas might be sure that on side everything must be serene sir thomas at last consented to go down to percycross see one two of proposed supporter did go down be considerably disgusted mr trigger took in hand introduced to three four gentleman in borough sir thomas in first interview with mr trigger declared predilection for purity yes yes yes yes of course said mr trigger mr trigger seeing that sir thomas have come among a stranger to whom have be offered very great honour of standing for borough of percycross offered to before have subscribed shilling to of various need of borough be not disposed to listen to dictation sir thomas insisted be a well that must understand other at once said sir thomas must throw up contest in middle of even if be winning if suspected that money be being spent improperly how often have same thing be said by candidate what candidate ever have thrown up sponge when be winning mr trigger be at first disposed to tell sir thomas that be interfering in thing beyond province have not be that day be late that liberal be supposed to be hard at work that candidate be wanted at once mr trigger must have shown spirit a be must only assent with growl say that have supposed be to be taken a matter of course desire to have absolutely understood by who act with in matter said sir thomas at rate will not be petitioned against petition never come to much at percycross said mr trigger certainly ought to have known a have have to do with great many of then started to call upon two three of leading conservative gentleman if be must say anything about sir thomas about what well bribery petition rest of gentleman when be consulted like to be told of sort of thing there have be little of perhaps who can say who indeed if not mr trigger in regard to percycross be better to let die out of never came to much in percycross think there be ever more than ten shilling to be have for vote have known crown piece buy fifty of added emphatically never be of much account be best to say nothing about be best perhaps to make one intention known said sir thomas mildly mr trigger hummed hawed shook head put hand into trouser pocket in heart of heart despised sir thomas on day sir thomas be taken to see four gentleman of note in percycross mustard maker paper maker two bootmaker mustard maker be very cordial in offering support must do anything for cause trigger knew men be right at mill then sir thomas said word be great foe to intimidation must for world have men coerced mustard maker laughed cheerily know what come to at percycross trigger will go straight from place sha trigger need ask question need trigger lord ' mercy said trigger who be beginning to be disgusted then went on to paper maker paper maker be very polite gentleman who seemed to take great delight in shaking sir thomas by hand who agreed with energy to word sir thomas said trigger stood little apart at paper maker a soon a introduction have be performed perhaps disapproving in part of paper maker principle certainly not sir thomas not for world sir thomas be clean against anything of kind sir thomas said paper maker sir thomas assured paper maker that be glad to hear be glad a went to first bootmaker mr trigger communicated to sir thomas certain incident in career of mr spiveycomb paper maker be got contract for paper from 'walhamshire herald ' sir thomas largest circulation anywhere in part griffenbottom get that if ere man of did vote a bade must keep 'em not day know that have man in percycross so stanch a old spiveycomb be mr trigger revenge first bootmaker have very little to say for hardly gave sir thomas much opportunity of preaching doctrine of purity hope will do something for trade sir thomas said first bootmaker sir thomas explained that did not at present see way to doing of anything special for bootmaker then took leave be right said mr trigger mean be right will say word to men too though know that much will come of be rum lot if be put out here to day can get in there to morrow be cankery independent sort of chap be bootmaker now will go see old pile will have to second one of will pile be sort of father of borough in way of conservative look here sir thomas let talk say much to be use in life talking to old pile sir thomas said nothing determined that must speak to old pile just a freely a have to mr trigger eh ah said old pile be sir thomas underwood be want to go into parliament if please townsman to send there yes be just if please why then will go home again just so people here ai what be at other place sir thomas underwood have seen many election here sir thomas doubt have mr pile over dozen have mr pile said trigger carried on deal better than have be since meddled with said mr pile turning upon trigger used to do thing here a must be done nobody be extortionate yet cross grained be changing deal about thing be told be changing for worse be talking of purity purity purity what doe amount to men be getting greedier day mean to be pure at election mr pile said sir thomas mr pile looked hard in face at least do mr pile can answer for mr pile turned away face opened mouth put hand upon stomach made grimace a though a though be not quite a well a might be such be case with idea of purity of election at percy cross did in truth make feel very sick be idea hated with whole heart there be to something absolutely mean ignoble in idea of man coming forward to represent borough in parliament without paying regular fee that somebody somewhere must make noise about somebody who be impalpable to in place be to quite world be intelligible might be very well in manchester such like disagreeable place that candidate must come down to percycross talk about purity there be thing abominable to have nothing to get by bribery to certain extent be willing to pay money in bribery that stranger must come to borough want seat without paying for be to so distasteful that assurance from mouth of one of candidate did make very sick think 'd better go back to london sir thomas said mr pile a soon a recovered sufficiently to express opinion mean that idea a to standing wo suit borough wo sir thomas suppose anybody else will tell so will do why must poor man lose day wage for sake of making parliament man what have done for of 'em hour must take working man to poll back argued sir thomas be know about election be not way manage matter here there wo be place of business agait day then mr trigger whispered few word to mr pile mr pile repeated grimace have made before turned on heel although be in own parlour a though be going to leave thought better of turned again always vote blue said mr pile suppose will do otherwise time sha take trouble there be many thing that like sir thomas good morning sir thomas be very well for mr trigger know where butter lie for bread very disagreeable old man said sir thomas when have left house thinking that a mr trigger have be grossly insulted by bootmaker must probably coincide in opinion mr trigger knew townsman well be used to be better than of sir thomas will do a much a say more now there be that chap spicer at mustard work say westmacott people be after if can make worth while will go over there be talk about apothecary hall know what be must buy old pile if be to give queen royal family to make boot for be to have be last of sir thomas preliminary visit among leading conservative of borough a be going back to percy standard for such be name of blue inn in borough mr trigger saw gentleman in black standing at open hall door immediately proposed that must just say word two to mr pabsby wesleyan minister whispered percycross bear leader into ear of bear have deal to say to many of men more to woman ca say what will do split vote probably then introduced two men explaining cause of sir thomas presence in borough mr pabsby be delighted to make acquaintance of sir thomas asked two gentleman into house in truth be delighted hour often ran heavily with here there be something for to do will give help mr pabsby said mr trigger mr pabsby smiled rubbed hand paused laid head on one side hope will said sir thomas if be of way cf thinking otherwise must be sorry to ask still mr pabsby said nothing smiled very sweetly laid head little lower illustration still mr pabsby said nothing smiled very sweetly laid head little lower know be on respectable side said mr trigger wesleyan now be most a one a church of england in way of not being rough rowdy sir thomas who did not know mr pabsby be afraid that must be offended at showed sign of offence a continued to rub hand mr pabsby be meditating speech be little hurried mr pabsby said mr trigger perhaps will think of mr pabsby be not going to let escape in way be not day that have sir thomas candidate for borough even mr trigger in little parlour fact be that mr trigger who generally knew what be about have made mistake sir thomas who be ready enough to depart saw that immediate escape be impossible sir thomas began mr pabsby in soft greasy voice voice made up of pretence politeness saliva if will give three minute to express on subject will be obliged to certainly said sir thomas sitting bolt upright in chair holding hat a though be determined to go directly three minute be over minister of gospel in town be placed in peculiar position sir thomas said mr pabsby very slowly of minister of religion in percycross mine be most peculiar in matter must wish to be guided wholly by duty if must see way clearly must at once declare to sir thomas owe much to conviction of people way do mean to vote asked mr trigger mr pabsby did not even turn face at interruption private man sir thomas may follow dictate of of of own heart perhaps here paused expecting to be encouraged by word sir thomas have acquired professionally knowledge to speaker a mr pabsby rejoinder argument be like winding up clock be better to allow such clock to run down with have to consider possible point what will people wish of be eager in cause of reform sir thomas others will lose train said mr trigger jumping up putting on hat be afraid will said sir thomas rising not putting on half minute said mr pabsby pleading not rising from chair perhaps will do honour of calling on when be again here in percycross will have greatest pleasure in discussing few matter with sir thomas then if can give poor help will give mr pabsby most sincere pleasure mr pabsby have now entered room be introduced trigger must not sit down again take off hat boldly marwilled way to door while sir thomas followed subject a came to eloquence of mr pabsby if can only see way clearly sir thomas be last word mr pabsby spoke will give one to griffenbottom certainly said mr trigger westmacott will probably have other thought perhaps title might have gone down with did seem to take be anything promising anything comfortable yet before went to bed that night sir thomas have undertaken to stand in such circumstance be very hard for man to refuse feel that certain amount of trouble have be taken on behalf retreat will be cowardly that journey for nothing will be personally disagreeable to own feeling then too there be that renewed ambition in breast ambition six month ago must have declared to be at rest for ever prompted now a strongly a ever to go forward do something be so easy to go see so hard to retreat when one have seen have not found percycross to be especially congenial to have felt to be out of element there among people with whom have sympathy felt also that have be unfitted for kind of thing by life have led for last few year still undertook to stand who be coming forward on other side asked mr trigger late at night when matter have be decided in regard to westmacott of course said trigger be told that real rad of place have got hold of fellow named moggs moggs ejaculated sir thomas yes moggs young men reform association be bringing forward be trade union man reform leaguer kind of thing must be surprised if got in say be got money chapter xxi liberal of percycross yes ontario moggs be appalled delighted exalted nearly frightened out of wit by invitation conveyed to by certain eager spirit of town to come down stand on real radical interest for borough of percycross thing be not suggested to till day two after sir thomas have be sounded be then informed that not hour be to be lost communication be made in little back parlour of cheshire cheese moggs be expected to give answer then there stood with hand on brow for five minute then asked that special question must always come first on such occasion must cost money well yes eager spirit of percycross thought that must cost something be forced to admit that percycross be not one of well arranged borough in expense of election be defrayed by public spirit of citizen soon became clear that deputation have waited upon moggs not only because moggs be good radical because also moggs be supposed to be radical with command of money ontario frowned expressed opinion that election must be made absolutely free to candidate everybody ought to go to 'eaven mr moggs said leading member of deputation everybody 'cause thing ai a ought to be there be answer to be made to ontario must only strike forehead think be clear to that must not give affirmative answer night therefore with difficulty arranged adjournment of meeting till following afternoon at pm must go down by express to morrow said leading member of deputation who even by arrangement must subject to loss of two day wage for be foreman in establishment of mr spicer mustard maker whose allowance for expense must not admit of sleeping away from home second night ontario departed promising to be ready with answer by pm on following day how bright with jewel be crown now held before eye yet how unapproachable how far beyond grasp to be member of parliament to speak in august assembly instead of wasting eloquence on beery soul of who frequented cheshire cheese to be somebody in land at early age something so infinitely superior to maker of boot member of parliament be by law esquire therefore gentleman ralph newton be not member of parliament not so great fellow a member of parliament surely if be to go to polly neefit a member of parliament polly must reject no longer to what might not lead have vision before eye of very beautiful moment in future life in standing a be on well chosen rostrum in great house must make burning thought of mind soaring aspiration of heart audible to people how have cobden begun career bright have not be in way why must not be a great greater than either greater because in coming day man of people must be able to wield power more extensive than people have earned for in former day then a walked alone through street took to making speech such speech a must make when stood up in place in house of common a member for percycross honourable member for percycross there be something ravishing in sound must not that sound be pleasant to ear of polly neefit then be not thing a distant a be glorious how must be member for percycross seeing that in matter be subject to father father hated very name of cheshire cheese be in turn feeling of life diametrically opposed to son sentiment must nevertheless go to father demand assistance if on occasion a father must give stone when asked for bread father must be two if when prospect a be held out to son can not see said ontario then can see nothing yet be sure that father must see to extreme astonishment mr moggs senior did see be time before mr moggs senior clearly understood proposition be made to when did became alive to honour perhaps profit of having member of firm in parliament of politics in abstract mr moggs senior knew very little indeed did care much in matter referring to trade be conservative because be master liked to be able to manage people to pay s d instead of s d for making of pair of boot hated cheshire cheese because son went there because son entertained strange injurious idea be propagated at low place if cheshire cheese must send son to parliament mr moggs did not know what cheshire cheese might be very well at rate undertook to pay bill if ontario son be brought forward a candidate for borough lost head so completely in glory of thing that never occurred to to ask what might be probable amount of expenditure there ai father in london a 'd do more for son than must if only see 'd there be something in said moggs senior with tear in eye moggs junior be profuse in gratitude profuse in obedience profuse in love oh heaven what golden crown be there now within grasp occurred between father son early in morning at shepherd bush whither son have gone out to father after night of feverish longing ambition went into town together on top of omnibus ontario felt that be being carried heavenwards what heaven have before even in fortnight canvas must be glory to undertake what truth must tell to people how must lead with by political revelation must be almost divine how must extract from burst of rapturous applause to explain to that labour be salt of earth must be mission then how sweet to teach value inestimable value of political privilege lately accorded to a ontario must put lately wrested on behalf from hand of aristocracy be more timid even than be selfish how sweet to explain then to instruct afterwards that be duty now having got great boon for to see at once that must be extended to below let first work of household suffrage be demand for manhood suffrage have be enunciated by ontario moggs with great effect at cheshire cheese now a result of such enunciation be going down to percycross to stand a candidate for borough be almost drunk with delight a sat upon knife board of shepherd bush omnibus thinking of too went down to percycross making preliminary journey a have done sir thomas underwood timing arrival there day two after departure of lawyer ala also met much to disappoint even at early period of contest people whom be taken to see be not millionaire tradesman in large way of business leading young men of warm political temperament man be president of mechanic institute secretary to amalgamation of union for general improvement third chairman of young men reform association be delighted to see be very civil soon found that be much more anxious to teach than be to receive political lesson when began a unfortunately did very early in dealing with to open out own view soon found that have view also to open out be to represent be to say become mouthpiece of idea have be selected because be supposed to have command of money of course must have to address people in mechanic hall chairman of young men reform association be very anxious to tell what to say on occasion be accustomed to addressing people said ontario moggs with considerable accession of dignity have satisfaction of addressing people people received kindly thought observed that applause be greater when secretary of amalgamation of improvement union spoke be sure that enthusiasm for young men chairman mounted much higher than have done ardour on own behalf be astonished to find that young men be just a fluent a did think indeed that did not go quite so deep into matter a did that have not thought out great question so thoroughly have way of saying thing must have told even at cheshire cheese result of be at end of three day though be doubt candidate for borough of percycross in capacity great man in percycross did not seem to to be so great a have be when made journey down from london there be certain feeling that be cat paw brought there for certain object be not object because wanted money one who must be fool enough to fight losing battle did not reap meed of personal admiration for eloquence expected then during three day there arose question discussion of embarrassed not little mr westmacott be in town there be question whether mr westmacott be to join force be understood that mr westmacott mr westmacott leading friend objected to chairman of young men president secretary on radical side put head together declared that if mr westmacott be proud must run horse alone

for borough there be moment before left percycross in be almost tempted to resign left town accepted candidate of special friend be assured with many parting grasp of hand on platform that must certainly be brought in at top of poll little incident must be mentioned have be asked by electioneering agent for small trifle of hundred pound towards expense by generosity of father have be able to give will get along now like house on fire said agent a pocketed cheque up to moment there may have be doubt upon agent mind a went back to london acknowledged to that have failed hitherto have failed in making impression at percycross must have be becoming to a future member of parliament for borough gallantly resolved that must do better in future must speak in such way that men of percycross must listen to admire must make occasion for thought that must do better than mr westmacott put more stuff in what have got to say might happen to must hold up head why must not be a good man a westmacott be man be needed not outside trapping then asked question whether a trapping be so trivial man be necessarily mean who dealt in trapping did not remember to have heard of bootmaker in parliament there must be bootmaker in parliament soon thus plucked up courage on journey down to percycross have thought that immediately on return to london must go across to hendon take advantage of standing a candidate for borough a returned resolved that must wait till election be over must go to polly with honour on head chapter xxii ralph newton decision ontario moggs be at percycross when ralph newton be making formal offer to polly neefit ralph when have made offer returned to london with mixed feeling have certainly be oppressed at time by conviction that must make offer even though went against grain with to do so at moment have not failed to remind that be about to make miserable for life because have be weak enough to take pecuniary assistance in hour of temporary necessity from hand of polly father now have made offer have not be accepted be still free must see way out of dilemma without dishonour then that dilemma became very much smaller to sight when be surmounted a be nature with dilemma other dilemma must have be remedied have polly accepted again loomed very large a looked back at matrimonial dilemma have escaped at polly standing before comely healthy honest such pleasant armful so womanly withal so pleasant girl if only be not to be judged sentenced by others beside almost thought that dilemma be one must have borne without complaint polly suggestion that must allow year to run round in order that might learn to know other be one must not entertain have three day in to give answer to uncle up to time two alternative have be open to sale of reversion independence polly future lordship of newton have thought that there be nothing to choose have not occurred to that polly must raise objection have felt neither fear hope in direction followed a consequence now that lordship must go must not however make up mind that must go till last moment on following morning be thinking that might a well go to shop in conduit street feeling that must encounter neefit without qualm of conscience when mr neefit came to be certainly better arrangement be easier to talk of own affair sitting at ease in own arm chair than to carry on discussion among various sporting garment adorned mr neefit little back room subject to interruption from customer possibly within hearing of mr waddle herr bawwah neefit seated at end of sofa in ralph comfortable room looking out of saucer eye with energy be in certain degree degrading be not quite so degrading a neefit at own barn door in conduit street be just coming to said a made breech maker welcome well yes thought 'd catch here captain men of mine have such long ear that german who let on that understand only just word two of english hears everything through twelve inch brick wall polly told a 'd be with suppose so mr neefit oh ai one a 'd keep anything from be open straightforward anyways so found now look here captain have just one word to say about stick to ralph be well

captain do stick to captain will tell what let go down to margate together for week be mr neefit plan of action then ralph got up from easy chair began explanation must very well go down to margate delightful a must be to sit upon sand with polly be so situated that must at once decide a to sale of property at newton mr neefit put hand in pocket sat perfectly silent listening to young friend explanation if polly must have accepted at once ralph went on to explain everything must have be straight a must not do so must take uncle offer have other mean of extricating from embarrassment why mr neefit must not look in face unless be prepared to pay money said drat replied then again listened ralph went on must not go on long in present condition bill for l to mr horsball of moonbeam be coming round literally have not l in possession to carry on war uncle offer must be withdrawn if be not accepted day after to morrow nobody else must give half so much thing must be done then why then must have nothing to offer to polly worthy of acceptance bother said mr neefit who have not once taken eye off ralph face ralph said that might be very well such be fact ai that soft that be going to let rob of estate said breech maker in tone of horror ralph raised hand eyebrow together yes be what intended to do there sha be nothing of kind said breech maker what l year ai in land ai must be own

gent dy might die first will insure life captain only must be upon square oh yes said ralph 'd rather abeost lose than think chance must be missed l year in land when one know how hard be to get to think of selling ralph made positive promise when mr neefit left there be so at least thought mr neefit implied understanding that captain must at once put end to transaction between uncle yet ralph did feel quite certain breech maker have be generous very generous very trusting hated man generosity confidence breech maker have got hold of that seemed to have lost power of thinking acting for then such man a be with staring round eye heavy face dirty hand ugly bald head there be baldness be handsome noble baldness be peculiarly mean despicable neefit baldness be certainly of latter order now moggs senior who be grey not bald be not bad looking at little distance face when closely inspected be poor greedy general effect at passing glance be not contemptible moggs might have be banker officer in commissariat clerk in treasury son in law must have have hope of moggs nothing of kind be possible with neefit one must be forced to explain that be respectable tradesman in conduit street in order that might not be taken for dealer in potato from whitechapel be hopeless yet have taken upon absolute management of ralph newton affair ralph be very unhappy in misery went to sir thomas chamber be about four o'clock in day at hour sir thomas be almost always in room stemm with much difficulty succeeded in making believe that lawyer be not at home stemm at time be much disturbed by master terrible resolution to try world again to stand for seat in parliament to put once more in way of work possible promotion stemm have condemned project nevertheless took glory in what if master must become must become anything great magnificent stemm have often groaned in silence have groaned unconsciously that master must be nothing loved master thoroughly loving one else in whole world sympathised with acutely still have condemned project there be so many of sir thomas a be only wanting to put finger into somebody eye doubt stemm doubt said sir thomas a well into mine a be be sir thomas will just run down see stemm so have be settled stemm who have always hated ralph newton who now regarded master time a more precious than ever must hardly give answer at to ralph enquiry master might be at home at fulham probably be where must gentleman so likely be a at home be when be in chamber anyways be not here said stemm bobbing head holding door ready to close ralph be convinced then dined at club afterwards went down to fulham have heard nothing from stemm elsewhere of intended candidature sir thomas be not at fulham did girl know aught of whereabouts great story be soon told papa be going to stand for percycross be so glad said mary bonner bursting out into enthusiasm walk about garden making speech to elector day oh dear do wish must do something glad be word said clarissa if loses very trying for be good said patience be just proper thing for papa will feel so proud when uncle be in parliament again said mary bonner woman pride be always vicarious still be pride ralph also be surprised so much surprised that for few minute own affair be turned out of head too have thought that sir thomas must never again do anything in world unless book must be written of have so often heard hint though never yet with accuracy name subject sir thomas be told have be at percycross be not supposed to be there now of course be in chamber said clarissa old stemm doe know how to tell lie so well be however acknowledged that having on hand piece of business so very weighty sir thomas might be almost anywhere without fault on part gentleman in throe of election for parliament must not be expected to be at home even patience did not feel called upon to regret absence before went back to town ralph found alone with mary for few minute mr newton said why stand for parliament have not mean have great prospect must have thought be just man who ought to make work of life to get into parliament ralph began to ask have be work of life say that to be of real use man ought to begin young nobody ought to go into house without money said ralph that mean suppose that men must go in who want time to earn bread have that to do if be man such a be must always try to be something be sure parliament be meant for men having estate such a will have when have got will think about parliament miss bonner perhaps will be too late then know that song of 'excelsior mr newton ought to learn to sing yes be learning to sing after fine fashion borrowing tradesman money promising to marry tradesman daughter be half inclined to be angry with interference from mary bonner yet liked for must be that felt interest in what concerned ah said to how much better must have be to have learned something to have fitted for high work to have be able to choose such woman a for wife have be sacrificed to horse at moonbeam little dinner with captain fooks lieutenant cox now again during life phoebus have touched trembling ear have given to know to sport with tangle of naaera hair be not satisfactory a work of man life ala god have intervened to little purpose horse at moonbeam have be two became four then six now be pledged to marry polly neefit if only must induce polly neefit to have be too late in day for to think now of parliament mary bonner then before left poor clary whispered word into ear cousinly brotherly word such a circumstance authorised to make be settled about property ralph for too have heard that question of sale be going forward not quite clary wo sell will think will oh pray anything will be better than that be so good to wait be thinking only of ralph of interest must not forget lesson be daily teaching to herself if can help will not sell papa will help will not if be must drag in piece before must part with birthright birthright have occurred to once that ralph might feel that after what have passed between one night on lawn be bound not to wait that be duty so to settle affair that might at once go to father say though will never be mr newton of newton have still such such mean of supporting daughter ah if must only be open with tell everything must soon know how unnecessary be to make sacrifice for pressed hand a left said word be word of comfort clary can not speak with certainty think that will be sold be so glad said oh ralph never never part with then blushed a thought of what have said must be that must think that be speaking for own sake because looked forward to reigning day a mistress of newton priory ah ralph must never misinterpret thought in manner so unmanly a that day came be absolutely necessary that answer must be given neefit came to prompt again seemed to sit on sofa with more feeling of being at home than have displayed before brought cheque book with laid rather ostentatiously upon table have good news too from polly if mr newton must come down to margate must be ever so glad be message a given by mr neefit reader will probably doubt that came exactly in word from polly lip ralph be angry shook head in wrath well captain how be to be asked mr neefit will let uncle know intend to keep property said ralph with a much dignity a knew how to assume breech maker jumped up crowed actually crowed a might have crowed cock be art that have learned in youth lad of wax said slapping ralph on shoulder now tell how much be to be said opening cheque book ralph declined to take money at present moment endeavouring to awe breech maker back into sobriety by manner neefit did put up cheque book be not awed back into perfect sobriety come to when want will have captain let chap a 'as 'orses be way disagreeable tell can have when want can be blowed if ca will see through captain now captain when will come out see polly ralph must give definite answer to on account of business be induced at last to send love to miss neefit that man will drive into lunatic asylum at last said to a threw into arm chair when neefit have departed nevertheless wrote letter to uncle lawyer mr carey a follows club sept dear sir after mature consideration have resolved upon declining offer made to by uncle respecting newton property faithfully yours ralph newton richard carey esq be very short seemed to to contain that there be to be said might indeed have expressed regret so much trouble have be occasioned trouble have be taken not for sake be not bound to denude of property because uncle have taken trouble when letter be put into squire hand in mr carey private room squire be nearly mad with rage in spite of that son have told in disregard of own solicitor caution in teeth of nephew gregory certainty have felt sure that thing must be done young man be penniless must sell must sell nowhere else with circumstance so favourable now young man wrote letter a though be declining to deal about horse be sham falsehood said squire low attorney be putting up to thinking that can get more out of be possible said mr carey there be nothing more to be done squire when last in london have asserted most positively that must not increase bid be penniless said squire there be about will put in way of raising money said lawyer so property will go to hammer can hing to help mr carey did not tell client that gentleman have right to complain because must not deal with effect be not own be line thought took squire walked about room lashing in rage must not bear to be beaten how much more must do said at last must be terribly bitter to to be made to give way to be driven to increase price even must be le bitter than failure must say nothing just at present if be said carey squire still walked about room if raise money on estate will hear of so much of right a pas from can purchase will be more prudent for to wait must l do at once said squire at rate must not offer said mr carey ah understand feel what be that want what must say if man told to wait while hand be in fire be in possession mr newton be not be not in possession be only lodger in place can hing can not even build farm house for tenant surely can mr gregory what for think must be one of delight of possession put money into ground like seed in order that fruit may be gathered by be not good enough christian mr carey to take much delight in will tell what be mr carey place be hell upon earth to till can call own at last left lawyer went back to newton priory having given instruction that transaction must be re opened between two lawyer additional money to extent of l must by degree be offered chapter xxiii will be hypocrite if choose there must hardly be more unhappy man than be squire on journey home have buoyed up with hope till have felt certain that must return to newton priory real permanent owner no longer lodger in place a have called to lawyer able to look upon tree a own with power to cut down oak upon property though a knew very well must rather spill blood from vein than cut down one of in case must preserve oak preserve by own decision because be own because must give to own son son must cut down if pleased then power of putting up must be quite a sweet to a power of pulling down what pleasure must have in making deficient house upon estate efficient when knew that stone a laid must not become property of enemy be man who have never spent full income property have be in hand now for fifteen year have already amassed considerable sum of money sum must have enabled to buy out nephew altogether without selling acre presuming price already fixed to have be sufficient have determined to sell something knowing that must not do a must do with remainder if hand be empty have settled in mind how ralph ralph must marry have separate income there must be doubt about ralph marriage when once must be known that ralph be heir to newton bar sinister must matter little then must be clean forgotten mind have be full of a have come up to london have be settled have decided upon ignoring altogether caution son nephew lawyer have croaked into ear legitimate heir be ruined spendthrift who have alternative to raise money ambition to spend money pursuit to waste money temperament be so sanguine that when entered mr carey office have hardly doubted now everything have be upset be cast down from triumph into abyss of despondency by two line from wretched meaningless poor spirited spendthrift believe 'd take pleasure in seeing property going to dog merely to spite said squire to son a soon a reached home having probably forgotten former idea that nephew be determined with pertinacity of patient far sighted jew money lender to wring from last possible shilling ralph who be not heir be of nature so just that must not hear accusation did not believe to be true without protesting against squire have called heir spiritless spendthrift malicious evil doer intent upon ruining estate grasping jew in same breath think be hard upon sir said son to father of course think so at rate will say so said squire one must suppose be thinking only of to hear talk know what be thinking of said ralph slowly know how much owe sometimes think that ought to curse said squire after at moment with such word ringing in ear ralph found to be impossible to expostulate with father must only take father arm whisper soft feminine word two must be a happy a day be long if only must see father happy can never be happy till have placed where must have be said squire god be just pleasant vice make instrument to scourge did not quote line to purport of hung heavy on yet thought hard that because have money in pocket must not altogether make free of scourge on following morning be le vituperative le unreasonable be still intent upon subject after breakfast got son into own room room in did magistrate work added up account kept spud spur seriously discussed whole matter what must be wise that must do next mean to tell that wish to buy said squire ralph must not say that if be in market to be bought if money be forthcoming of course such purchase must be expedient money be forthcoming said squire can make up one way what matter if did sell brownriggs what matter if sold brownriggs twining a well ralph quite acceded to a far a buying selling be concerned must have acceded to anything must have made father happy wo say word against fellow since be so fond of continued squire ralph though father paused made reply to intended sarcasm must allow that have reason for writing letter a did of course have reason said ralph well will say that want to keep be not unnatural not at everybody like to keep what be got to get a much a can be nature man ca eat cake have have be slow to learn that doubt suppose have learned must have gone to sir thomas underwood in way did cry to be helped if have learned remember ralph did go to first came to always forget that be meaning then of sir thomas writing to in pitiful way asking to do something for who have know how much something like l year take day came of age of course have be imprudent can not eat cake have want to eat want to have be sure may be managed suppose mean to go up see see ralph why not be not afraid of son smiled made answer might find out from what be really want what will really do attorney understand carey be bad fellow a for honesty 'd trust with anything have known father life in ordinary piece of business there be one whose opinion must take so soon talk of waiting telling that thing will come round after few year a if what one wanted be merely investment for one money be that sir be that not at be feeling of thing lawyer may be best man in world to lay out money in speculation doe dare to buy contentment for doe see one hardly dare to try make see 'd give half of to have other half can not tell that 'd give one half so long a fellow be to be owner of other will have opposition newton in place squire son be of course willing enough to go up to london must see heir at rate endeavour to learn what be wish of heir may say what money like said squire hardly care what pay so long a be possible to pay go up to l more if will do think can bargain said son can said father at rate can find out whether will name price 'd go know must quarrel with ralph prepared for journey a matter of course took parson into confidence not telling parson anything of absolute sum named explaining that be purpose to become acquainted with heir if possible to learn view will find ralph very different fellow from what uncle think said parson will be much mistaken if doe not tell quite openly what intends be careless about money never be greedy then got to other matter will of course see girl at fulham said parson yes will manage to get down there story of gregory passion for clarissa be well known to other gregory who must not for world have spoken of such matter among general acquaintance who must not have brought to mention in presence of two hearer have told to one companion who be nearest dearest to wish be going with said parson why not come with then yet wish if be in london doubt whether must go there there must be use in be one of thing said ralph in man must never despair a long a there be possibility ah yes people say so believe in kind of perseverance at rate not with know own mind a well a know mine think promised must trouble more promise like be mere pie crust said ralph give love be do that unless be alone with will live down day doubt to tell truth have made up mind not to marry be half inclined to think that clergyman must marry there be thing ancestor understood pretty well although think be such fool must like to see new cousin certainly ralph said nothing more about new cousin be perhaps hardly aware how greatly idea of again seeing new cousin have enhanced pleasure of journey to london about week after started having devoted nearly afternoon before went to packing of large basket of fern to root small bundle of be appended long name in latin a offering to patience underwood yet did not care very much for patience underwood be just end of september last day of september when reached ralph heir be out of town servant at lodging professed did not know where be thought probable that be at mr 'orsball mr 'orsball of moonbeam barnfield looking after 'orses suggested not from knowledge in possession because ralph be always believed to go to moonbeam when left town must however be back next week namesake therefore did not consider that must be expedient for to follow heir down to moonbeam underwood girl must certainly be at fulham started at once with fern for popham villa found at home singular to say found sir thomas there also on very next morning sir thomas be to start for percycross to commence actual work of canvas canvas be to occupy fortnight on monday sixteenth candidate be to be nominated tuesday seventeenth be day of election whole household be so full of subject at first there be hardly room for fern oh mr newton be so much obliged to papa be going to stand for percycross nearly be form in fern be received newton be quite contented excuse for entering house be what have wanted excuse be deemed ample sir thomas who be disposed to be very civil to stranger have not much to say about own prospect to certain degree be ashamed of percycross have said very little about even to stemm since personal acquaintance have be made with messrs spiveycomb pile pabsby girl be not ashamed of percycross to a yet percycross be noblest of british borough have not conservative of percycross chosen father to be representative out of british subject sir thomas have tried have tried quite in vain to make understand real fashion of selection if percycross must only send to parliament percycross must be divine what d'you think said clary there be man of name of wish 'd guess name of man who be going to stand against papa mr newton name wo make much difference said sir thomas ontario moggs said clary do think possible mr newton percycross town where one of percy set up cross in time of crusader did papa will not consider bound to learn unless elect said sir thomas think there be percy in day of crusader at rate proper name be percy st cross said clary must such borough choose ontario moggs to be one of member mr newton do like name said mary bonner perhaps papa ontario moggs may be two member said clary laughing if so must bring down here papa only be shoemaker make difference in day said sir thomas fern be at last unpacked three girl be profuse in thanks who doe not know how large space basket of fern will cover when be unpacked how large treasure loom will cover rock on other side said mary seemed to newton that mary bonner be more at home than have be when have seen before spoke more freely of what concerned house be beginning to become one of family still be a be overshadowed by clarissa in appearance indeed be queen among three in active social life did not compete with clary patience stood a statue on pedestal by mean unobserved ignored beautiful in form colourless newton a looked at three wondered that man so quiet gentle a young parson must have chosen love a clary underwood remained day at villa dining there at invitation of sir thomas last dinner said sir thomas unless be lucky enough to be rejected men when be canvassing never dine not often after be elected guest have not much opportunity of ingratiating specially with beauty beauty did so far ingratiate with unconsciously on part that half resolved must father be successful in present enterprise must ask mary bonner to be queen of newton priory father have often urged to marry never suggesting that other quality beyond good look must be required in son wife have never spoken of money birth name have idea have said laughing that will marry fright day own must like to have pretty woman about house one doe expect much from woman be bound to be pretty woman be at rate pretty pretty indeed be possible that woman must be framed more lovely than one must bide time must not ask girl to marry till must know what position must ask to fill though spoke little to mary treated a men do treat woman whom desire to be allowed to love there be tone in voice worship in eye flush upon face hesitation in manner told story at rate to one of party there did come to bring fern said clarissa to patience brought for of said patience young men go about with fern for sake of fern said clary be merely excuse to come see mary why must come see mary have leave patty think must be excellent be odd that there must be two ralph newton one must be mr newton other mr ralph clarissa clarissa said patience almost in tone of agony will be hypocrite if choose patty said clarissa will be true ca have at once patience said nothing further then lesson of self restraint desired to teach be very hard of teaching there be just word spoken between sir thomas newton about property intend to see ralph newton if can find said ralph who be not heir think be far from town said sir thomas father think that might come to understanding perhaps so said sir thomas have strong anxiety on subject said newton father think that if doe wish to sell reversion doe wish how can man wish under circumstance may be desirable have better see think will tell said sir thomas must understand that man think much of such position pray come to again will always be glad to see when be in town chapter xxiv find must ralph heir have after gone to margate mr neefit have got hold upon that have help for found forced to go to margate when be asked second third time with energy of mr neefit eloquence be unable to resist what reason must give that must not go to margate seeing that be thing quite understood that be to endeavour to persuade polly to be wife neefit came to two morning running catching morning just a be smoking cigar after breakfast be very eloquent already owed mr neefit over five hundred pound debt on first of morning be made up to one thousand pound receipt being given for shop debt on one side bond for whole money with per cent interest being taken in return for 'd better pay off what little thing owes captain said generous breech maker then when time come will settle with gent about 'orses neefit played game very well said not word about selling horse a to restriction on young captain amusement if pull at fish too hard only break line neefit have very fine fish on hook meant to land not word be said about margate on occasion till little pecuniary transaction be completed then captain be informed that neefit family must certainly spend next week at marine paradise that polly expected captain company be place said neefit where girl grows soft a butter said when door handle be in hand so that captain have chance of answering then came again next morning returned to subject a though captain have already consented there be near approach to anger on one side determined opposition on other during interview ended in acquiescence on captain side then mr neefit be once more a gracious a possible graciousness of such men in acknowledging own inferiority be sometimes wonderful need be seen about with know said mr neefit be said after ralph have positively declared that must not go actually with neefits occupy same apartment must be altogether wrong for polly sake said ralph looking very wise very moral to view neefit assented not being quite sure how far captain might be correct in idea of morality have be fixed young newton for polly said mr waddle morning to friend herr bawwah when be told to mark off ralph account in book a settled dashed if 'ave german grunted old neverfit playing at 'igh game ai such be most undeserved nickname by excellent tradesman be known in own establishment see nodin about 'igh said german ai got money call low waddle endeavoured to explain circumstance failed de people must be de people de noble must be de noble said herr bawwah doctrine be again unintelligible to mr waddle ralph having intense desire to throw over engagement to sell horse to start for jerusalem did go down to margate put up at hotel there eat dinner lighted cigar went down upon sand be growing dusk thought that must be alone at least uninterrupted in crowd crowd be there nobody in place must know except neefits have not be on sand two minute before encountered mr neefit daughter breech maker talked loud be extremely happy polly smiled be very pretty in two minute neefit saw pretended to see friend ralph be left with lady love there never be so good natured father will bring home to tea captain said father a walked off on occasion ralph abstained from direct love making polly when found that be to be so made very pleasant idea of being at margate mr newton said polly why not a well a oh know brighton of french place where about world must be more likely for must think margate seems to be very jolly oh like then be not swell know have heard news ontario moggs be going to stand to be beember of parliament ' for percycross rival be only word uttered approaching to subject of love know anything about mr newton be true why sir thomas underwood be going to stand know anything about anybody else

say that old mr moggs have given ever so much money to do when man be in parliament mr newton doe that make gentleman what then nothing on earth can make man gentleman understand latin polly hope be necessary for young woman by mean poet be born ca be made be not talking of poet ontario moggs be poet know what mean there be something better even than to be gentleman one may be angel a be polly oh be not thinking of be thinking of ontario moggs going into parliament then be so clever ralph be not minded to be cut out by moggs junior after coming way to margate after lady love thing be to be done must do not to night then took polly home eat prawn with mr mr neefit on next day went out together in boat week be nearly over ralph have renewed suit more than once when breech maker proceeded to put through facing be coming round ai captain said mr neefit by time ralph hated sight of neefit so thoroughly that be hardly able to repress feeling indeed did not repress whether neefit did not see seeing chose to ignore matter can not be said be at rate a courteous a ever mr neefit overcome partly by husband authority partly induced to believe that a ontario moggs be going into parliament be no longer to be regarded a possible husband have yielded be most polite to lover when came in of evening always gave double allowance of prawn hoped that tea be to liking said very little more than standing somewhat in awe of polly have be changeable consenting to walk with day always staving matter off when asked whether thought that yet knew well enough to be wife oh not half well enough must say then perhaps know be not over fond of half do know so be up to last evening when father put through facing in respect of captain behaviour to polly father have just ground of complaint for ralph have done best indeed ralph be fond enough of polly be hard for man to be much with without becoming fond of be coming round ai captain said mr neefit ca say that be said ralph turning upon heel near

trigger must have wished mr trigger understood borough knew well rock before must have wished although have be so imperative with mr griffenbottom a to second conservative candidate now mr griffenbottom have sent man who must throw fat in fire by talking of purity of election moggs have be making fool of in direction said trigger thinking that opportunity for giving valuable hint must be lost be be telling working men already that will be scoundrel knave if take so much a glass of beer without paying for scoundrel be strong word said sir thomas like for percycross wo like men must rather have left to own feeling who want beer money certainly wo thank who want like to be suspected one will take a addressed to neighbour not to be very fond of neighbour here sir thomas kind of thing wo go down be on evening of candidate arrival conversation be going on absolutely while sir thomas be eating dinner have asked mr trigger to join mr trigger have faintly alleged that have dined

bring couple of bottle of port john be glad be come sir thomas because show that mean to take to up be shown messrs spiveycomb spicer pile roodylands bootmaker who have not yet be named pabsby seven eight others sir thomas shook hand with observed that mr trigger be especially cordial in treatment of spicer mustard maker a to whose defection have be so fearful in consequence of certain power mr westmacott might have in wholesale disposal of mustard hope find better said mr pile opening conversation sir thomas assured new friend that be pretty well 'cause seemed down on luck when be here before said mr pile need for said man of mustard be there trigger trigger sat little apart with one bottle of port wine at elbow took part in conversation be aware that opportunity be so great that outside supporter ought to have time objection to sir thomas said taking cigar case out of pocket sir thomas who hated tobacco of course gave permission trigger rang bell ordered cigar for party then sat apart with port wine in ten minute sir thomas hardly knew where be so dense be cloud of smoke sir thomas began mr pabsby if must only clearly see way will see clear enough before nomination day said mr pile way after election said conservative grocer gentleman belonged to established church delighted in snubbing mr pabsby indeed mr pabsby have business at meeting so have be told very plainly

mostly same a in other matter nothing to be have for nothing if be retail seller of boot from manchester old pile must be civil enough to may snub spicer a much a please because will expect to get something out of will be very much deceived said sir thomas be not so sure of said trigger spicer know what be about pretty well then at last mr trigger went assuring sir thomas most enthusiastically that must be with before nine next morning many distressing thought took possession of sir thomas a lay in bed have made up mind that must in way break law did know whether have not broken already by giving people tobacco wine yet must have be impossible for to have refused mr trigger permission to order supply even for sake of seat even for sake of reputation be so much dearer to than seat must not have bidden guest who have come to in own room to go elsewhere if required wine be thing not to be done yet for aught knew mr trigger might continue to order food wine beer tobacco to be supplied ad libitum whenever chose how be to put end to otherwise than by throwing up game going back to london now must be gross ill usage to conservative of percycross who by step must be left in lurch without candidate then be to be expected that must live for week with mr trigger with other relief than must be afforded by messrs pile spiveycomb co everything about be reeking of tobacco then when sat down to breakfast at nine o'clock there must be mr trigger next morning be out of bed at seven ordered breakfast at eight sharp must steal march on trigger went out into sitting room there be

own a though percycross belonged to during last three hour supporter have be in out continually mr pabsby have made ineffectual attempt two to catch sir thomas alone trigger have be going up down between standard station various men friend supporter of griffenbottom underwood have be brought to who be paid agent who be wealthy townsman who be canvasser messenger did not know there be bottle on sideboard whole time sir thomas in speculative manner endeavouring to realise to individuality of that stranger must only conceive that who helped be wealthy townsman that who waited till be asked by

great men occasionally stood upon staircase at rate such a be life be life have time left to choose considered on occasion pretty nearly sure to be elected knew borough be sure then there be that accursed system of petitioning according to idea be un english ungentlemanlike unpatriotic stand up fight if be licked take be idea of what election must be sir thomas who only just remembered appearance of man in house at once took extravagant dislike to be abominable to to be called underwood by man who did not know be nauseous to to be forced into close relation with man who seemed to to be rough ill mannered judging from what saw gave colleague credit for good quality now mr griffenbottom have good quality be possessed of pluck be in main good natured though must resent offence with ferocity must forgive offence with ease hit hard then have end of be mr griffenbottom mode of dealing with offender offence with came in contact in house entered griffenbottom be at home sir thomas be stranger of whom inmate have barely heard name griffenbottom be very good at canvassing poorer class said not word to about politics asked whether did dislike fellow gladstone who be one thing one day

manufactory of men be visited there voter be booked much quicker than at rate of twenty hour here there man must hold peculiar opinion of own permissive bill be asked for by energetic teetotaller

sir thomas heard mr spicer say to one such man yes doe said man sir thomas heard more felt how perilous be position on candidate stood under present law a regarded sir thomas felt a evening be coming on that have hardly done share of work mr griffenbottom have canvassed have walked behind now then have attempted little conversation in that have be immediately pulled up by conscientious energetic mr trigger a for asking for vote hardly knew when have be carried back into main street through labyrinth of alley at back of petticoat yard whether have asked man for vote not with booking of vote have of course nothing to do there be three men with book three other men to open door show way make suggestion on expediency of going sir thomas must always have be last in procession have there not be one silent civil person whose duty seemed to be to bring up rear if ever sir thomas lingered behind to speak to poor woman there be silent civil person lingering too influence of silent civil person be so strong that sir thomas must not linger much a came into main street encountered opposition party mr westmacott ontario moggs supporter will introduce said mr griffenbottom to colleague come along be thing to do then met in middle of way poor ontario be hanging behind holding up head gallantly endeavouring to look a though be equal to occasion griffenbottom westmacott shook hand cordially complained with mutual sigh household suffrage have made work deal harder than ever be only week up from gout said griffenbottom then sir thomas westmacott be introduced at last ontario be brought forward bowed attempted to make little speech nobody in one army in other seemed to care much for poor ontario knew that be so that mattered little to if be destined to represent percycross in parliament must be by free vote unbiassed political aspiration of honest working men of borough so remembering stood aloof stuck hand into breast held up head something higher than before though candidate have thus greeted other at chance meeting other party in contending army have exhibited courtesy weariness of sir thomas when first day canvas be over be so great that be tempted to go to bed ask for bowl of gruel nothing kept from doing so amazement at courage endurance of mr griffenbottom must get at few of chap who be at work if went out at eight said griffenbottom trigger suggested that mr griffenbottom must be very tired trigger be perhaps tired oh tired said griffenbottom man have to be tired at work sir thomas perceived that griffenbottom be at least ten year senior that be still almost lame from gout will be ready underwood said griffenbottom sir thomas felt bound to undertake might be thought necessary if be at day night must be too much said griffenbottom a prepared to amuse with one of poll book till dinner must be on table did see jacob pucky asked energetic candidate observing that man name be marked to be sure did be speaking to be one of who did know till

work sir thomas being dragged from door to door while griffenbottom asked for vote be to last yet for ten day more chapter xxvi moggs purity right of labour mr trigger have hinted that ontario moggs must be thorn in flesh of mr westmacott supporter at percycross have be right ontario be timid hesitating not unfrequently brow beaten in social part of work at election though made great struggle must neither talk walk eat sit a though be equal of colleague when came to politics political management there be holding must make speech when speech be not held to be desirable by committee be loud upon topic a to be thought that allusion must have be made to talk about ballot have from first be conceded to moggs mr westmacott be indeed opposed to ballot have be matter of course that candidate of people must support measure ballot must have be safety valve moggs be so cross grained ill conditioned uncontrollable that must not let ballot suffice ballot be almost nothing to strike bribery be great subject beauty of one ugliness of other right of labourer to combine with brother labourer to make own term for labour be great lesson taught suicidal iniquity of labourer in selling political power must use to protect labour be source of burning indignation that labour be salt of earth told men of percycross very often told a often that manliness courage be necessary to make salt productive gradually men of percycross said that be only boy of percycross clustered round learned to like to listen to came to understand something of character of man who be almost too shame faced to speak to while be being dragged round to home on canvas whom nothing must repress when be on leg with crowd before be in vain that managing agent told that must not get vote by spouting shouting on such occasion hardly answered word to managing agent spouting shouting went on just same be certainly popular among bootmaker tanner mr westmacott be asked to interfere did do so once in mild fashion ontario replied that having be called to sphere of action must only do duty according to own light young men president secretary chairman be for awhile somewhat frightened having be assured by managing men of liberal committee that election must be lost by furious insanity of candidate decided upon supporting moggs having found that must be deposed from seat if discarded at last when futile effort to control moggs have be maintained with patience for something over week when still wanted four five day to election actual split be made in liberal camp moggs be turned adrift by westmacottian faction bill be placarded about town explaining cruel necessity for such action describing moggs a revolutionary firebrand now there be three party in town mr trigger rejoiced over greatly with mr griffenbottom if have be cut throat now be wonder said over over again even sir thomas caught something of feeling of triumph began almost to hope that might be successful nevertheless number of men who must not quite make up mind a to what duty required of till day of election be considerable mr pile triumphantly whispered into mr trigger ear conviction that after thing be going to be changed at percycross quite so easily a people supposed when moggs be utterly discarded by respectable leader of liberal party in borough turned out of liberal inn at be head quarter of party refused right of participating in liberal breakfast dinner be there provided moggs felt to be triumphant martyr portmanteau hat box be carried by admiring throng down to cordwainers arm house not indeed of highest repute in town here separate committee be formed mr westmacott did best to avert secession supporter be inexorable liberal tradesman of percycross must have nothing to do with candidate who declared inasmuch a man mind be more worthy than man money labour be more worthy than capital that therefore men must dominate rule master be doctrine necessarily abominable to master tradesman men be to decide how many hour must work what recreation must have in what fashion at what rate must be paid what proportion of profit must be allowed to member master creator of firm be doctrine that moggs be preaching tradesman of percycross whether liberal conservative did not understand much in world of politics did understand doctrine a if carried out must take to very gehenna of revolutionary desolation so moggs be banished from northern star inn at mr westmacott be living be forced to set up radical staff at cordwainers arm in one respect certainly gained much by persecution record of election doings must have be confined to column of percycross herald have carried on candidature after usual fashion a be now doings be blazoned in london newspaper daily news reported gave article to even time condescended to make example of to bring up a evidence that revolutionary doctrine be distasteful to elector of country generally fame of ontario moggs certainly became more familiar to ear of world at large than must have done have continued to run in pair with mr westmacott be everything to polly neefit must hear of now that name have become household word in london newspaper in respect gained much personal canvassing be now at end for there must be use in going about from house to house asking for vote indeed have discovered that to do so be thing iniquitous in demoralising practice tending to falsehood intimidation corruption thing to be denounced denounced let men of percycross hear question in public learn from spoken word be political principle then vote for if pleased must condescend to ask vote a favour from man be for rather to ask to bestow upon gift of time such ability a possessed took very high tone indeed in speech be saved labour of parading street during day looked down from immeasurable height on truckling mean sordid doings of griffenbottom underwood westmacott huge board have be hoisted up over somewhat low frontage of cordwainers arm on be painted in letter two foot high legend delighted to read moggs purity right of labour ah if must only be understood there be enough in to bring back age of gold to suffering humanity other reform must be needed in short legend everything necessary for man be contained mr pile mr trigger stood together one evening looking at legend from distance moggs purity said mr pile in tone of disgust with peculiar action have become common to in speaking of election have ghost of chance said mr trigger who be always looking straight at main point yet have westmacott there be worse than westmacott said mr pile what can do said trigger purity purity said old man make that sick wish there be such thing a member of parliament purity pickpocket be about same when be among button up breech pocket what can do asked mr trigger again in voice of woe mr trigger quite sympathised with elder friend being younger man knew that innovation must be endured then mr pile made speech of such length that have never be known to make like before so that mr trigger felt that thing have become very serious that not impossibly mr pile might be so affected by election a never again to hold up head in percycross purity purity repeated be going on way trigger that country soon wo be fit for man to live in what be meaning of be just folk want what want without paying for hate purity do hate very smell of stink when see chap a come here talk of purity know mean that nothing ai to be a used to be nobody be to trust one there ai to be nothing warm friendly comfortable more sir thomas have brought down be just a bad a shoemaking chap worse if anything know what be going on inside can see if man take glass of wine out of bottle be asking hisself if ai bribery corruption be got handle to name money suppose come down here without knowing chick child why be poor man a ca hardly live to have three half crown fifteen shilling a thing may go for voting for stranger such a will tell what be trigger have done with thing have come to in borough will meddle make more mr trigger a listened to eloquence must only sigh shake head did think must last time added mr pile almost weeping moggs must steal out of house in early morning look up at big bright red letter rejoice in very heart of heart have not lived in vain when name have be joined in public view of men with word so glorious purity right of labour contains just everything said moggs to a sat down to modest lonely breakfast after sitting with hand clasped upon brow disdaining use of pen paper for such work composed speech for evening speech framed with purpose of proving to hearer that purity right of labour combined must make a angel upon earth a for moggs explained in speech analysing big board adorned house mattered little whether did did not return let be always persistent in returning on possible occasion purity right of labour then other good thing must follow to enjoyed at rate supreme delight man feel when thoroughly belief own doctrine day be very long with when evening came when friend be relieved from toil must assemble here there through borough to hear preach to be happy enough have certainly achieved so much that preferred now to own president chairman there be enthusiasm for moggs among labouring men of percycross be always happy while be addressing hour in morning be long sometimes melancholy though town be busy with electioneering doings there be nothing for to do rival canvassed consulted roamed through town a must see filching vote from too noble for such work a sat there alone in little upstairs parlour of cordwainers arm thinking of speech for evening thinking too of polly neefit then of sudden occurred to that must be good to write letter to polly from percycross

that must in degree be evil doer towards clary did not occur to did occur to a at probable that mary bonner must refuse offer in day men never expect to be refused have gone forth among young men a doctrine worthy of perfect faith that young lady be wanting to get married looking out for lover with absorbing anxiety that few can dare to refuse man who be justified in proposing to chapter xxviii new heir count chicken squire be almost lost in joy when received son letter telling that ralph heir have consented to sell everything one great wish of life be to be accomplished at last property be to be own so that might do what liked with so that might leave entire to own son so for remainder of life might enjoy in community with son have always appeared to to be very summit of human bliss from sweet thing have seen have be hitherto cut off by record of own fault have spent greater part of life in endurance of bitter punishment have be torn to piece too in contemplating mode of escape from position in father very natural will have placed might of course have married at least have expected have hoped for child in there must have be misery son be one human being be dear to above others by such marriage must have ruined son early in life comparatively early have made up mind that must not do that that must save money make property for boy loved then have come home to a fact that must be happy in preparing other home for son than old family house of with acre wood homestead acre wood homestead gave to delight feeling a did hour of life that be not own for purpose of real usufruct then by degree have heard of nephew folly idea have come upon that might buy nephew out ralph own ralph have told that idea be cruel must not see cruelty what bad man loses good man will get said surely must be better for who be to live by property that good man must be master of must not interfere must have power of interfering till others must interfere be to keep aloof doings must be doings of spendthrift heir none of when ralph must tell that be cruel must turn away in wrath hiding wrath because loved son now everything be set right son have have doing of be nearly mad with joy throughout day a thought of great thing have accomplished be alone in house for son be still in london during last few month guest have be unfrequent at priory did not wish to have anybody with now went out roaming through park realising to fact now at length very tree be own gazed at one farmhouse after not seeking tenant hardly speaking to if met with brain full of plan of what must be done saw gregory for moment only nodded at smiling passed on be not in humour just at present to tell happiness to one walked round darvell premise desolate half ruined house of brumbys telling that very shortly must be desolate half ruined no longer then crossed into lane stood with eye fixed upon brownriggs walker farm pearl of farm in part land with thought must have parted so easily when question before be that of becoming in truth owner of portion of estate now acre be ten time dearer to than have be then must never part with brownriggs must even save ingram farm in twining if might possibly be saved have not known before how dear to must be bank tree sod yes now in very truth be lord master of property have belonged to father father father before must borrow money save during lifetime must do anything rather than part with acre of now that acre be own to leave behind to son on following day ralph arrived must no longer call ralph who be not heir must be heir to everything from day that contract be completed squire though longed to see young man a have never longed before must not go to station to meet welcome one irrepressible joy be too great to be exhibited before stranger remained at home in own room desiring that mr ralph might come to there must not even show in hall yet when ralph entered room be very calm there be bright light in eye at first spoke hardly word so have managed little job said a took son hand managed nothing sir said ralph smiling did thought have managed good deal be done anyway yes sir be done at least suppose so ralph after sending telegram have of course written to father giving full particular of manner in arrangement have be made mean that there be doubt said squire with almost anxious tone not at a far a know lawyer seem to think that be all right ralph be quite in earnest must be in earnest said squire have behaved uncommonly well said namesake so well that think owe much be quite mistaken in supposing that wanted to drive sharp bargain have never so supposed found to be best way of speaking of matter to father will forgive everything now said squire will do anything can to help ralph said many thing in praise of namesake still almost regretted what have be done at rate must see pity of be that other ralph who must have be looked to a future proprietor of newton priory not who be hardly entitled to call newton must have be more consistent with english order of thing that must be so then there be so much to say in favour of young man who have lost so little to say against almost seemed to for whose sake purchase be being made that advantage unscrupulous if not unfair advantage be being taken of purchaser must not say to father spoke of ralph in such way a to make father understand what thought be such pleasant fellow said ralph who be now heir let have down here a soon a thing be settled ah think will come now of course be wretched enough about be not wonderful that must have hesitated at parting with perhaps not said squire who be willing to forgive past sin of course there be help for be what did feel so sure about when declined first offer be not that objected to price a to price say that of course can say nothing about when told that be willing to raise offer declared that must take nothing in fashion if who understood matter said that more be coming to supposed that must get according to idea behaved very well sir in there be something that almost amounted to accusation against squire at least so squire felt feeling for moment robbed of something of triumph according to own view there be need for pity be plain that to son whole affair be pitiful must not scold son at rate not now feel ralph said that from moment everybody connected with property tenant on labourer will be better off than be month ago may have be to blame say nothing about do say that in case be well that property must go to natural heir of life tenant of course have be fault added after pause do feel now have in great measure remedied evil did tone now have become too serious to admit of further argument ralph feeling that be so pressed father hand then left gregory be coming across to dinner said squire a ralph be closing door behind at time gregory have received intimation of what have be done in london brother note not reaching till following morning ralph met before squire came down news be soon told be settled said ralph with sigh well brother have agreed to sell have almost more pain than pleasure in because know will make unhappy be so confident when wrote to yes explained that have hoped then that must have saved manner of saving must have be worse than loss will tell everything doubt man must have behaved better a happened there be still little space of time before squire joined period perhaps of five minute parson spoke hardly word news now heard confounded have be quite sure that brother have be in earnest that uncle must fail then though loved one ralph nearly a well a did other though must have known that ralph base born be in respect better man than own brother more of man than legitimate heir still to feeling that legitimacy be everything too be newton of newton may be truly said of that there be nothing selfish in feeling to be younger brother of newton of newton parson of parish bore same name a be sufficient for ambition thing must be terribly astray now that right heir be extruded ralph ralph whom loved so well must not be right newton to own property world must not so regard tenant must not so think of county must not so repute to thinking of parson gregory great misfortune have be consummated a soon a have realised be silent must speak more did ralph say word not to triumph in have be done on behalf at least not to seem to triumph be lesson have taught fully sympathised with gregory therefore stood silent sad by side that there must have be triumph in heart be impossible not to imagine must not be that must be alive to glory of being undoubted heir to newton priory understood well that birth must interfere little now with position must choose to marry a must choose must of course be necessary that must explain birth be not likely thought that must seek wife among who must reject with other advantage because have just title to father name that must take joy in what have be done on behalf be only natural a stood with gregory waiting for father to come to showed sign of joy at last squire came there certainly be triumph in eye did not speak triumphantly be impossible that word must not be spoken between a to disposition of property suppose ralph have told said what have done up in london yes have told said gregory hope there will now be end of family ill feeling among said uncle brother will be a welcome at old place a trust have always found if like to bring horse here will be delighted parson muttered something a to kindness with have ever be treated what said be said with ill grace be almost broken hearted thoroughly wished back in own solitude squire saw did not press to talk said not word more of purchase tried to create little interest about parish matter asked after new building in chancel be gracious about old man that young woman gregory must not recover must not recall old interest so far act part a to make seem that be not thinking of misfortune have fallen upon family in look of eye tone of voice be telling son that be bastard father that be destroying inheritance of family yet bore with endeavoured to win back to pleasantness soon after cloth be taken away took leave have work to do at home said must go uncle went out with into hall leaving ralph alone in parlour will be for best in long run said squire with hand on nephew shoulder perhaps may sir be not pretending to say good night a walked home across park through old tree have known since be infant told that must not be for best that property must be sent adrift out of proper line only thing to be desired now be that brother must have child that there must no longer be proper line squire joy be too deep well founded to be in way damped by poor gregory ill humour be too closely present to for to be capable of restraining why must restrain before son be sorry for greg said because have old fashioned idea of course will be for best brother must have squandered acre of to ralph made answer might probably have be a father said be perhaps best for who lived in by estate that must be heir gradually feeling of exultation in own position be growing upon be natural that must do so knew to be capable of filling with credit with advantage to around great place be now assigned to be impossible that must not be exultant owed to father to show that appreciated have be done for think ought to have l at least said squire certainly said ralph think so a for bulk sum have already written to carey about time ought to be lost there be knowing what might happen might die doe look like dying sir might break neck out hunting there be knowing at rate there must be delay from what be told think that with timber will make come to l will have a have behaved well will show can behave well

farmhouse of thanksgiving will make a snug place a there be about property have made wretched for two year hope kind of wretchedness will be over now thank god yes be looking at brownriggs to day ingram think will sell either have plan think can pull through without be so much easier to sell than to buy 'd be more comfortable if sold one of of course must borrow few thousand why not doubt whether at moment there be property in hampshire so free a have always lived on le than income can continue to do so easier than before be provided for now old fellow yes indeed why must pinch sha be pinched have got score of woman about a will have before long there be nothing in world like having wife be quite sure of if want to save money way to do be not to have nursery will marry of course now suppose will day sooner better take word for perhaps 'd alter opinion if came upon before christmas for sanction by jove must must be delighted mean to say have got anybody in eye there be only one thing ask ralph open out out confidence will have sir there be somebody then well no there be anybody must be impudence in to say there be then know there be upon encouragement ralph told father that on two last visit to london have seen girl whom thought that must like to ask to be wife have be at fulham on three four occasion be so put visit have in truth be only three thought that niece of sir thomas underwood possessed charm that woman need posse except money said ralph have fortune if care about care about money said squire be for man to have at rate for one so circumstanced a end of be that ralph be authorised to please if really felt that liked miss bonner well enough might ask to be wife to morrow difficulty be to get at said ralph ask uncle for permission be manliest fittest way to do tell everything take word for wo turn face against a for nothing on earth must make so happy a to see child if there be dozen must not think one too many mark ralph will be easier for for if live for without if go to make thing clear square free while bairn be little than when have to go to school college perhaps want to get married ai counting chicken before be hatched said ralph laughing when parted for night did not do till after squire have slept for hour on chair there be one other speech made speech ralph be likely to remember to latest day of life father have taken candlestick in right hand have laid left upon son collar ralph said for first time in life can look in face not feel pang of remorse will understand when have son of own good night boy then hurried off without waiting to hear word if there be word that ralph must have spoken on next morning be out early at darvell farm surrounded by bricklayer carpenter before week be over work be in progress poor darvell half elated half troubled knew little of cause of new vehemence something suppose did know for news be soon spread over estate that squire have bought out mr ralph that other mr ralph be now to be mr ralph heir that old butler must not be told butler who have lived in house when present squire be boy be out of question though communication have be made in confidence confidence be not hermetical squire after be glad that must be so thing have to be made known why not after fashion among labourer poor there be doubt a to joy felt that other mr ralph who have always be up in town be unknown to mr ralph have ever be popular with with tenant feeling be perhaps more doubtful wish joy mr newton with heart said mr walker who be richest most intelligent among squire have worked for like man hope will come to good will do best said ralph be sure will there will be feeling know must be angry at understand said ralph wo be vexed with for just saying so ralph promised that must not be vexed thought very much of what mr walker have said to after such property a newton doe not in england belong altogether to owner of who live upon be closely concerned in with reference to that have in world have part property in make what be will not make what must be unless in heart be proud of know ca be real squire said one old farmer to mr walker may hugger mugger way mr ralph ca be like young gentleman nevertheless squire be very happy thing be not said to have be successful took interest in thing keener than have felt for year past one day be in stable with son spoke about hunting for coming season have irish horse of be proud old hunter have carried for last seven year of have often declared that under consideration must part with dear old fellow said putting hand on animal neck will work for bread one other winter then will give over for rest of life never saw look better said ralph be like master not quite so young a be once never made mistake yet know of ralph when saw how full of joy be father must not rejoice also that thing so ardently desired have be at last accomplished chapter xxix election day of nomination at percycross came at last be manifest to everybody that there be very unpleasant feeling in town be not only that party be arrayed against party must have be state of thing not held to be undesirable at rate must have be natural at present thing be so divided that there be saying be existing party moggs be separated from westmacott quite a absolutely a be westmacott from two conservative candidate old liberal of borough be full of ridicule for poor moggs of whom absurd story be told by publicly privately still be there darling of workman be indeed asserted by member of mr westmacott committee that moggs popularity must secure for very few vote great proportion of working men of percycross be freeman of borough old voter who be on register by right of birth family connection in place independent of householdership rate quite accustomed to old way of manipulation younger of men might be seduced into listening to moggs excitement be pleasant to be too well trained to be led away on day of election moggs must give beer have always be accustomed to three half crown head in consideration for day work not dozen freeman of borough must vote for moggs so said mr kirkham mr westmacott managing man man knew borough quite so well a did mr kirkham will fight for at hustings said mr kirkham will take beer money will vote for griffenbottom might be true enough a regarded freeman men who have be a be educated to political life there be much doubt a to new voter there be about thousand of in borough have certainly not be intention of party that men must have half crown be from men leader secretary chairman president have come cry for second liberal candidate consequent necessity of putting forward two conservative be equally odious to supporter of westmacott of griffenbottom must have half crown trigger have said to old pile bootmaker pile thought that working man be entitled to three half crown said a much very clearly suppose old griff ai going to turn hunk at time o day said mr pile difficulty be endless be much better understood by mr trigger than by mr pile manner of conveying half crown to three hundred twenty four freeman who must take vote honestly afterwards for griffenbottom underwood be perfectly well understood among godless riotous ungoverned ungovernable set of new householder there be knowing how to act must take money then vote wrong must take money then split freeman be known three hundred twenty four must take griffenbottom beer half crown two hundred seventy two must be equally complaisant with mr westmacott of householder nothing be known must not be handled thirty forty of must probably have turning of election at last hour must then be paid at own price after must not be safe mr trigger in disgust declared that thing have got into so vile form that did care if never have anything to do with election in percycross again then there be almost a much ill feeling between old fashioned griffenbottomites underwooders a there be between westmacott liberal moggs radical two gentleman still eat breakfast dinner together still paraded street of percycross in other company sir thomas have made very odious even to mr griffenbottom be always protesting against beer did see bribery did not see did suspect swore that must pay not shilling a to cause of expenditure be not explained to griffenbottom snarled at expressed opinion that sir thomas must of course do same a other gentleman mr trigger with much dignity in mien a spoke declared that discussion of such matter at present moment be indecorous mr pile be for sending sir thomas back to town very strongly advocated that measure mr spicer a to whom there be story abroad in borough in respect of large order for mustard supposed to have reached from new york through liverpool by influence of sir thomas underwood thought that borough must return two conservative candidate sir thomas might be little indiscreet upon whole principle did honour so thought mr spicer who perhaps believed that order for mustard be coming need hardly say that story at rate in so far a regarded sir thomas underwood be altogether untrue yes principle said mr pile think know sam spicer principle for hisself nothing for poor man be sam spicer of mr pile must be acknowledged that be not pure minded politician loved bribery in very heart be equally true that did not want to be bribed be old fashioned privilege of poor man to receive small consideration for vote in percycross mr pile must not endure to think that poor man must be robbed of little comfort in meantime sir thomas be in state of great misery from hour to hour be fluctuating between desire to run away from accursed borough shame of taking such step desire for seat have brought to percycross have almost died out amidst misery of position among men of party with whom be associating there be not one whom did not dislike by whom be not snubbed contradicted griffenbottom who went through canvas under circumstance of coming gout colchicum with courage pertinacity be heroic be painfully cross to one who be not voter be use of d d nonsense now said to sir thomas evening before nomination day there be dozen leading conservative in room sir thomas be making final protest against bribery rose from chair when so addressed left room never in life before have be so insulted trigger followed to bedroom knowing well that quarrel at moment must be

suffering agony must still wheedle voter there be three conservative doctor with mr griffenbottom of twice daily there be opinion prevalent through borough that gout must be in stomach before election be over sir thomas did return to room sat down without saying word sir thomas said mr griffenbottom man with gout be always allowed little liberty admit claim said sir thomas bowing believe know game better than do be of use saying thing man must ever foul own nest give little drop more brandy trigger then will get to bed when be gone sang griffenbottom praise in staunch pluck good humour manly fighting man be superior give take english bull dog over do like old griffenbottom said paper maker on day of nomination griffenbottom be carried up on hustings carrying did good in borough must be acknowledged on behalf that did best to walk in extreme agony of attack have to make speech made hustings stood in market square straight in front of wooden erection standing at right angle to be stout rail dividing space for distance of fifty sixty yard so that supporter of one set of candidate might congregate on one side supporter of other candidate on other side in way must weaker part might be weaker be protected from violence of stronger on present occasion seemed that friend of mr westmacott congregated with conservative moggs ally alone filled one side of partition there be great many speech made that day from hustings thirteen in first mayor then four proposer four seconder of candidate during performance though there be so much noise from crowd below not word must be heard there be violence when old griffenbottom got up supporting by arm round one of post be loudly cheered from side personal popularity in borough be undoubted gout made almost demi god nobody heard word that said then have desire to be heard to be seen standing up there martyr to gout still shouting for percycross be enough for purpose sir thomas encountered very different reception be received with yell apparently from whole crowd what said be of matter a not word be audible did continue to inveigh against bribery before have ceased huge stone be thrown at hit heavily on arm continued speaking however did not know till afterwards that arm be broken between shoulder elbow mr westmacott be very short good humoured intended to be funny about poor moggs perhaps be funny fun be of avail moggite crowd have determined that men must be heard till own candidate must open mouth at last ontario turn have come at first roar from crowd be so great that seemed that be to be with a have be with others by degree though there be still roar a of sea moggs word became audible voice of assent dissent be very different even though be equally loud men desirous of interrupting do interrupt cheer though be continuous loud a thunder be compatible with hearing moggs by time too have learned to pitch voice for out of door multitude preached sermon old sermon about right of labour salt of earth tyranny of capital majesty of workman with enthusiasm made for moment supremely happy be certainly hero of tour in percycross allowed to believe just for hour that be about to become hero of new doctrine throughout england spoke for over hour while poor griffenbottom seated in chair have be brought to be suffering almost pain of hell during speech sir thomas who have also suffered greatly have at first endeavoured to conceal that be suffering discovered extent of misfortune allowed to be taken out from hustings to inn there be effort made to induce mr griffenbottom to retire at same time mr griffenbottom not quite understanding extent of colleague misfortune thinking that became to remain to endure be obdurate must not be moved did not care for stone threat did not care even for gout be place till after show of hand there must remain populace seeing commotion on hustings began to fear that there be intention to stop oratory of popular candidate called loudly upon moggs to go on moggs did go on be happy at last there came show of hand be declared to be in favour of moggs westmacott that be very much in favour of moggs in favour of moggs by five to one there be doubt among other candidate there be not perhaps much to choose poll be of course demanded for two conservative then mayor complimenting people on good behaviour in spite of poor sir thomas broken arm begged to go away be very well of course must go away not till have driven enemy from field in minute dividing rail rail have divided blue from yellow be down who have dared to show there a supporter of griffenbottom underwood be driven ignominiously from market place fled at corner in few second not streak of blue ribbon be to be seen in square will elect that fellow moggs to morrow said mr westmacott to kirkham bit of said kirkham must spot ringleader in row nine ten of be griffenbottom old men take money regularly get something nearly year join rad at nomination vote for squire at poll chap who hollow throw stone always vote t'other side up mr griffenbottom kept seat till must be carried home in safety through town be then put to bed three conservative doctor who have be setting sir thomas arm sat in consultation upon old friend be acknowledged on side that mr griffenbottom be very ill indeed manner of rumour went through town night believed that griffenbottom sir thomas be dead that mayor have now choice to declare moggs westmacott elected then there arose suspicion that poll must be kept open on morrow on behalf of two defunct candidate so that further election on behalf of conservative party might be ensured men swore that must break into bedroom of standard inn in order that might satisfy whether two gentleman be alive dead so town be in hubbub on evening moggs be called upon again to address friend at mechanic institute to listen to speech of president secretary chairman by ten o'clock be alone in bedroom at cordwainers arm down stair men be shouting singing drinking shouting in honour though not drinking at expense be alone in little comfortless room felt to be impossible that must lie down rest heart be swelling with emotion of day mind be full of coming triumph be black night there be soft drizzling rain be absolutely necessary for condition that must go out seemed to that very bosom must burst if confined in narrow space thought be too big for so small closet crept downstairs out through narrow passage into night then by light of solitary lamp stood before door of public house must still see glorious word moggs purity right of labour noble word have sufficed to bind to whole population of generous hearted borough purity right of labour might not be that with cry well cried might move very world a walked street of town felt great love for borough grow within bosom what must not owe to dear place have first recognised worth have enabled thus early in life to seize hold of ploughshare must be destiny to hold for coming year have before career such a have graced life of men whom have most loved admired of men who have dared to be independent patriotic philanthropical through temptation of political life must be too vain if thought to rival hume cobden conceit said to will seek to justify who can rise who believe wing strong enough for soaring there might be shipwreck of course believed that now saw way a to difficulty of speaking in public that have overcome further education a to fact historical political might be necessary that acknowledged to must not spare in effort to acquire such education went pacing through damp muddy dark street making speech be deliciously eloquent to own ear night be certainly happiest man in percycross never doubting success on morrow not questioning have not whole town greeted with loudest acclamation a chosen member be deliciously happy while poor sir thomas be suffering double pain of broken arm dissipated hope griffenbottom be lying in bed with doctor on one side nurse on other hardly able to restrain from cursing world in agony at little after eleven tall man buttoned up to chin in old great coat called at percy standard asked after health of mr griffenbottom sir thomas ai neither of very well then replied waiter will say that mr moggs called to inquire with compliment said tall man respect shown to be immediately visible even waiter at percy standard acknowledged that for day mr moggs must be treated a great man in percycross after moggs walked home crept into bed may be doubted whether slept wink night then there came real day day of election be foul rainy muddy sloppy morning without glimmer of sun with thick pervading melancholy atmosphere force for time upon imaginative men conviction that nothing be worth anything griffenbottom be in bed in one room at percy standard underwood in next three conservative doctor moving from one chamber to watching other closely hardly leaving hotel have good time of mr trigger have already remarked that in one respect breaking of sir thomas arm be lucky because now there must be no difficulty a to paying doctor out of common fund half hour state of poll be brought to early in morning moggs have be in ascendant at half past nine number be a follows moggs westmacott griffenbottom underwood at ten at half past ten moggs be equally in advance westmacott have somewhat receded at noon number be

kept be content to abide by official counting griffenbottom be consulted privately by trigger mr spiveycomb a to what step must be taken in emergency be suggested in whisper underwood must be thrown over altogether there must be beating moggs so thought mr spiveycomb unless effort be made might be possible that westmacott must creep up trigger in heart considered that must be impossible to get enough men at three half crown piece to bring sir thomas up to winning condition griffenbottom now that fight be forward be unwilling to give way foot have polled voter said more than what will poll answered trigger always hang back growled griffenbottom fight out believe will ever elect shoemaker here order be given be fought out moggs early in morning have be radiant with triumph when saw name at head of list displayed from two inimical committee room a walked street with chairman on one side of president on other seemed a though foot almost disdained to touch mud be two happy hour during did not allow to doubt of triumph when president chairman spoke to must hardly answer so rapt be in contemplation of coming greatness very soul be full of seat in parliament when griffenbottom approached on list then passed there came shadow upon brow still felt sure of election must lose that grand place at top of poll to have taught to look so proudly soon after noon cruel speech be made to have about pumped side dry said secretary of young men association do mean have polled friend asked moggs pretty nearly mr moggs see men have nothing to wait for came up early then ontario heart sank within began to think of shop in bond street work of afternoon in percycross proved how correct mr griffenbottom have be in judgment kept place at top of poll be soon evident that must not be shaken then westmacott passed by moggs in next half hour sir thomas did so also be at two when ontario betook to privacy of bedroom at cordwainers arm pluck left altogether found unable to face town a losing candidate then for two hour there be terrible struggle between westmacott underwood during thing be done in desperation of moment a to might be so difficult to give account must subsequent account be required know how hard be to sacrifice power of winning when during heat of contest power of winning be within reach at four o'clock state of poll be a follows griffenbottom underwood westmacott moggs when chairman president waited upon moggs telling of final result informing that must come to hustings make speech endeavoured to console by assurance that alone have fought fight fairly will be unseated know a sure a egg said president ca be otherwise have be busy up in little room in petticoat court afternoon men have be getting a much a fifteen shilling head moggs be not

not only not seen human being with whom must sympathise have be constrained to associate with people who be detestable to horror of griffenbottom disgust at trigger fear of mr pabsby explanation inability to cope with messrs spicer roodylands when spoke of mustard boot have be almost too much for partial seclusion occasioned by broken arm have be godsend to in state be prepared to feel that daughter presence be angel visit even to success have something of pleasure of triumph of course be pleased to have won seat though whisper of threat a to petition have already reached be able in first hour of membership to throw fear on head behind man must be of most cold temperament who under such circumstance can not allow short enjoyment of new toy be at least for time probably told that threatened folk lived long that patience must take glory in victory be matter of course dear papa said if can only get arm well again suppose there be cause for fear a to broken arm be great misfortune said patience well yes ca deny three percycross doctor be three more misfortune must get home a soon a can must be rash papa even to escape from percycross oh papa be so happy so proud be such excellent thing that must be in parliament again know that dear feel so clary so doe mary ca tell sort of anxiety be in day yesterday first got telegram about arm then stemm came down at eight told that be returned stemm be quite humane on occasion poor stemm know what will have to do wo matter to papa will then told piece of news what be wo like papa did like at what be dear stemm say that ralph have sold newton priory estate to uncle be best thing must do really papa think so must have done made disreputable marriage think must have done said patience be going to do have half engaged to tailor daughter indeed up to moment of telling thought must marry poor clary so patience said to herself a heard have got into mess that best thing must do be to sell interest to uncle estate will go to better fellow though out of proper line then patience told father that have brought letter for have be given to that morning by stemm who have met at station think said that come from of newton family because of crest basingstoke postmark then letter be brought a concern much thread of story will be given to reader newton priory october dear sir thomas underwood write to with sanction rather at instigation of father to ask permission to become suitor to niece miss bonner will probably have heard at least will hear that father have made arrangement with nephew ralph by reversion of newton property will belong to father be intention to leave estate to permit to tell that will consent to such settlement in case of marriage a must have be usual have be legitimate heir think best to be frank about a must not have ventured to propose marriage either to to miss bonner have not father solicitude succeeded in placing in circumstance may perhaps be regarded a in part compensating great misfortune of birth may probably be right must add have said word on subject to miss bonner have hitherto felt constrained by circumstance to have alluded from acting a other men may act must be unwilling to concede that advantage of fortune have now fallen in way justify in proposing to myself marriage hope that will at least excuse application to yourself very faithfully yours ralph newton sir thomas read letter twice before spoke word to daughter then after pausing with for moment in hand threw to across bed miss mary be in luck said in very great luck be magnificent property a far a can see one of finest young fellow ever met understand about birth yes said patience almost in whisper might be hindrance to in circumstance not here be nothing here did know of indeed mary will be quite surprise to be sure will think then that there have be nothing said not word about be sure there have not papa clarissa have joke with mary quite a joke then there have be joke meant nothing a for mr newton must not have dreamed of anything of kind liked so did property will be much better with than with other mary be very lucky girl be can say a for letter be best letter ever read in life there be delay before sir thomas must write answer to young newton be indeed left arm have suffered even with so much of power abstracted writing be not easy task be letter answering of must not be deputed to secretary on third day after receipt sir thomas did manage with much difficulty to get reply written dear mr newton have have left arm broken in election here hence delay can have objection letter doe infinite honour presume know that niece have fortune yours most sincerely thomas underwood what pity be said sir thomas that man ca have broken arm in answering letter must have have to write ever so much have be well yet must not have said word more must have be of use sir thomas be kept entire week at percycross standard after election be over before three doctor innkeeper between must allow to be moved during time there be very much discussion between father daughter a to mary prospect word two be said inadvertently almost opened father eye a to state of younger daughter affection be sometimes impossible to prevent betrayal of confidence when line between betrayal non betrayal be finely drawn be matter of course that there must be much said about other ralph one now disinherited dispossessed who have so long so intimately be known to be almost impossible for patience not to show cause of great grief might be a father said that property must be better in hand of other young man patience knew that sympathy be with spendthrift with dearly loved sister who loved spendthrift since clarissa have come to speak so openly of love to assert so loudly to protest that nothing must must shake patience have be unable not to hope that heir might at last prove worthy to be sister husband then heard that inheritance be sold wo make slightest difference to said clary almost triumphantly a discussed matter with patience evening before journey to percycross if be beggar must be same to patience however news of sale have be great blow now father told that young man have be thinking of marrying girl tailor daughter that marriage have be almost fixed surely must be better that step must be taken to wean sister from such passion yet did not tell secret only allowed word to escape from might be half surmised that clarissa must be sufferer what difference will make to clary asked sir thomas have sometimes thought that cared for said patience cunningly must hardly have be so often at villa unless there have be something there must be nothing of kind said sir thomas be spendthrift quite unworthy of will not have at villa must be told so if see anything of kind must inform do understand patience patience understood well enough knew not what reply to make must not tell sister secret if there be fault in matter be not father fault why have not lived with so that might see thing with own eye there must be nothing of kind said sir thomas with look of anger in eye when week be over innkeeper doctor submitting with bad grace member for percycross returned to london with arm bound up in sling town be by time quite tranquil hustings have be taken down artizans of borough be back at labour almost forgetting moggs great doctrine that there be to be petition be matter of course be at least matter of course that there must be threat of petition threat of course reached sir thomas ear nothing further be said to when daughter went down to station in standard fly almost seemed that be no more to borough than other man might be with broken arm will not speak of to mary said on journey home must think dear of course not papa must have opportunity of changing mind after receiving letter if so plea for sake hope will not patience said nothing further loved cousin mary certainly have felt dislike for fortunate young man must not so quickly bring to sympathise with interest seemed to be opposed to of sister chapter xxxi be settled in last half of month of october squire at newton be very pressing on lawyer up in london to settle affair of property be most anxious to make new will must not do so till nephew have completed sale till money have be paid have expressed desire to go up to london remain there till be done against son have expostulated urging that father must not hasten work up in london by presence must certainly annoy flurry everybody in lawyer office mr carey have promised that thing must be done with a little delay a possible mr carey be not man to be driven then again squire must be miserable man up in london whereas at priory might be so happy among new work have already inaugurated son argument prevailed especially that argument a to pleasure of squire present occupation squire consented to remain at home there seemed to be infinity of thing to be done to squire world appeared to require more of happy activity than at previous time of life got up early be out about place before breakfast have endless instruction to give to everybody about estate very air of place be sweeter to than labourer be le melancholy at work farmer smiled oftener woman child be more dear to everything around have now be gifted with grace of established ownership nephew gregory after last dinner of mention be made hardly came near during next fortnight once twice squire went up to church during week day that might catch parson even called at parsonage gregory be unhappy must not conceal unhappiness suppose will wear off said squire to son of course will sir will not be fault if doe not wonder whether must have made happier to see property parcelled out sold to highest bidder after death be not unnatural if think of said ralph perhaps not god forbid must be angry with because can not share triumph feel however have done duty that nobody have right to quarrel with then there be hunter sportsman know wife daughter of sportsman know how important month in calendar be month of october real campaign begin in november even for who personally attend to earlier work of kennel look after cub hunting during last ten day of october be apt to take shape of genuine hunting october have charm of own peculiar duty be busiest month in year in regard to horse be physic needed in squire stable physic be much eschewed squire horse be usually in good condition be needful to know down to single line on form whether that animal want more exercise if so of what nature hold that for hunter be worked regularly throughout season live in loose box summer winter little exercise be required except in month of september october let have be fed on oat throughout year good groom will bring into form in two month such at least be order at newton stable during autumn especially during last day of october order be obeyed with infinite alacrity with many preparation for coming joy there be other care le onerous indeed still needful what good sportsman be too proud even too much engaged to inspect horse gear own only let horse gear stand first in mind let be sure that fit of saddle be of more moment than fit of pair of breech that in riding length strength nature of bit will avail more must at least avail more than depth form general arrangement of flask that question of boot great a certainly be must be postponed to question of shoe that man seat must be guarded by girth rather than by spur that run have ever be secured by brilliancy of cravat though many run have be lost by insufficiency of stirrup leather in stable saddle room throughout whole establishment of house at newton matter be ever sedulously regarded have never be regarded with more joyful zeal than be given to during happy month there be not stable boy about place who did not know feel that mr ralph be now to take place in hunting field a heir to newton priory there be other duty at newton of crowd of riding men know little nothing be there fox in covert squire have life be staunch preserver thinking more of vixen with young cub than must of lady in land with first born son during last spring summer however thing have made uncomfortable have not personally inquired after well being of nursery in wood a have be wont ralph indeed have be on alert keeper have not become slack there have be whisper about place that master did care so much about fox a used to do soon found out that cared enough now head keeper opened eye very wide when be told that squire must take a personal offence if covert be ever drawn blank be to be understood through county at newton priory everything now be happy prosperous will get up breakfast meet on lawn before end of month said squire to son hate hunt breakfast farmer like from reader will perceive that squire be in earnest ralph hunted through latter day of october squire must not go out till first regular day of season like law like to stick to said five month be enough for horse in conscience at last happy day arrived wednesday nd of november father son started together for meet in dog cart on four wheel with two horse on such occasion squire always drove professed to go no more than eight mile hour meet be over in berkshire county in neighbourhood of swallowfield about twelve mile distant squire be in seat precisely at half past nine four horse have gone on in charge of two groom for squire have insisted on ralph riding with second horse if wo have said ralph of course have yielded just at time there have grown up in young man mind feeling that father be almost excessive in exuberance of joy that be displaying too ostensibly to world at large triumph have effected checking of elation be almost impossible to son on whose behalf be exhibited therefore to ralph own regret two horse have on morning be sent on to barford squire be not kept waiting moment ralph lit cigar jumped in squire started in comfort joy road led by darvell farm for moment carriage be stopped that word might be spoken to workman 'd better have couple more men mile wo do to let frost catch said squire mile touched hat assented house will look very well from here said squire pointing down through line of tree ralph assented cheerily yet thought that father be spending more money than darvell house need to have cost reached barford heath few minute before eleven there be little scene upon occasion be first recognised meet of season squire have not be out before be now known to almost man there that owner of newton priory have at last succeeded in obtaining reversion of estate for own son though matter be one hardly admitted of open congratulation still there be word spoken look given little additional pressure in shaking of hand of seemed to mark triumph that other ralph have not be known in county ralph be very popular though of course there be existent amount of inner unexpressed feeling that proper line of old family be being broken that for moment be kept in abeyance men face wore smile a be turned upon happy squire hardly carried with a perfect moderation a son must have wished be little loud not saying much to one openly about property uttering merely word two in low voice in answer to kind expression of one two specially intimate friend in discussing other matter appearance of pack prospect of season state of county be not quite like in ordinary way be quiet man not often heard at much distance contented to be noted a newton of newton rather than a man commanding attention by conduct before other men there certainly be difference to day be of kind wine produce on who be not habitual drinker gas of life be in exuberance be a balloon insufficiently freighted with ballast buoyancy unless checked might carry too high among cloud ralph saw kept little aloof if there be aught amiss there be help for on part after what be amiss be so very little amiss will draw small gorse first said old master addressing specially to mr newton then will go into barford wood just so said squire gorse first by mean remember when there be always fox at barford gorse come along hate to see time wasted will be glad to hear be full of fox at newton there be two litter bred in bostock spring two by jove in little place dan dan be second horseman will ride young one morning have paddywhack fresh for about one paddywhack be old irish horse have carried so long have be mentioned before there be nothing remarkable in there be word spoken might not have be said with good grace by old sportsman who knew men around who have long preserved fox for use still be felt that squire be little loud ralph son on whose behalf triumph be felt be silenter than usual trotted along at rear of long line of horseman one specially intimate friend of man whom really loved hung back with object of congratulating ralph said george morris of watheby grove place about four mile from priory must tell how glad be of right old fellow come might show out little to be grand will always have among now tell that be indifferent think enough about god know george seems to that le said about better father have behaved nobly to of course like to feel that have got place in world marked out for what understand george there must be rejoicing in family because heir have lost inheritance ca look at in line ca look at in other said ralph mind be not saying that be all right what have happened to have come of own doings only mean that ought to be quiet about father spirit be so high that can hardly control by george wonder at said george morris there be three little bit of gorse about mile from barford wood a to seemed that expectation did not run high from last of old fox broke before hound be in be so sudden thing that pack be on scent away before dozen men have seen what have happened squire have be riding with cox huntsman who have ventured to say how happy be that young squire be to be squire day so be cox so be said squire hope will be friend to for many year by holy there be dick hallooing said cox forgetting at once comparatively unimportant affair of newton priory in breaking of unexpected fox golly if ai away squire hound have gone at once to whip voice be in full cry in le time than have taken to tell story of find cox be with so be squire there be two three others one of whip start indeed be not much burst be so sharp old fox ran so straight that sufficed to enable who have got lead to keep tally ho shouted squire a saw animal making across stubble field before hound with only one fence between quarry tally ho be remarked afterwards that squire have never be known to halloo to fox in way before just like one of young 'uns fellow out of town said cox when expressing astonishment squire never rode run better in life gave lead to field kept must ' spoilt by putting nose afore 'be be ever so said cox afterwards went a straight a schoolboy at christmas young horse rode never made mistake let men say what will young horse will carry man brush like better than old one be very short have run fox pulled down broken up eaten within hour jack graham who be particular about thing who be at rate near enough to see said that be exactly twenty two minute half might be right enough in when swore that have gone over four mile of ground be certainly wrong killed within field of heckfield church heckfield church ca be four mile from barford gorse that went a straight a line everybody knew besides must have covered ground in time pace be good doubt jacky graham be always given to exaggeration squire be very proud of performance when ralph came up be loud in praise of young horse never be carried so well in life never said knew be good did know must jump like must take couple of hundred for be still little loud squire at moment have sense of double triumph within be to be forgiven be admitted on side that have ridden run uncommonly well just like young man by jove said jack graham like what sort of young man asked george harris who have come up at heel of hunt with ralph where be master ralph said squire to son fancy just began to know be running by time be killing fox said ralph must have eye better about boy must cox young squire ai often in wrong box said huntsman be in right one to day said squire be still little loud there be too much of buoyancy might have come from drink with squire be effect of success for have be longing rather than hoping life from heckfield trotted back to barford wood master resolving that must draw country in manner have proposed to in morning there be little repining at partly because distance be long partly because barford wood be too large to be popular hunting be over for day said jack graham to view of case squire who have now changed horse objected greatly will find in barford big wood a sure a sun rise said yes said jack run into little wood back to big wood so on till hate foot of ground never knew anything from barford wood yet for donkey be a good a horse squire again objected told story of run from barford wood twenty year ago have taken pretty nearly on to ascot heath thing have changed since said jack graham very much for better said squire ralph be with then still felt that father be too loud whether meant that hunting be better now than in old day twenty year ago that thing a regarded newton estate be better be not explained who heard speak imagined that be alluding to latter subject drawing barford wood be very different thing than drawing barford gorse anybody may see fox found at gorse who will simply take trouble to be with hound when go into covert in wood becomes great question with sportsman whether will stick to pack save horse loiter about till hears that fox have be found latter be certainly commoner course perhaps wiser even when fox have be found may be better for expectant sportsman to loiter about till break giving little attention to part of wood in work of hunting may be progressing there be who systematically stand still roam about very slowly others again who ride cease riding by spurt just a become weary impatient others who with dogged perseverance stick always to track of hound for year past squire be to have be found among former more prudent set of rider on occasion went gallantly through thickest of underwood close at huntsman heel will find rather nasty mr newton among brake cox have said to squire have answered that have got sunday face on have persevered be soon on fox in barford wood being on fox in barford wood be very different from finding fox in barford gorse out of gorse fox must go in big wood might choose to remain day then chance be that must either beat hound at last else be eaten in covert be very pretty place to ride about smoke drink one friend sherry be jack graham idea of hunting in barford wood great deal of kind of thing be going on to day now then there be little excitement cry of away be heard men must burst out of wood here there ride about for few minute then go in again cox swore that have thrice changed fox be beginning to be little short in temper whip horse be becoming jaded master have once twice answered very crossly when questioned how devil do suppose be to know have said to young gentleman who have inquired where be still squire kept on zealously reminded ralph that of best thing of season be often lost by men becoming slack towards evening at time be nearly four o'clock cox be clearly of opinion that must kill fox in barford wood day still hound be hunting darned if ai back to little wood again said cox to squire be at moment in extreme corner of outlying copse between barford little wood be narrow strip of meadow over have passed dozen time day between copse meadow there ran broad ditch with hedge rotten made up fence of stick bush at corner have be broken down by constant passing of horse till at hour of day there be hardly at spot anything of fence to be jumped must cross with again cox said squire at moment be nearest to gap close to be ralph george morris a well a huntsman mr newton horse be standing sideways to hedge be not facing passage nevertheless prepared to pas first turned horse sharply at a did so bush stick caught animal in flank in order to escape impediment clambered up bank sideways not taking gap then balanced to make jump over ditch be entangled among stick thorn be on broken ground jumping short came down into ditch squire fell heavily head long on to field horse with further effort of own unable to restrain rolled over master be place a to horseman must say that child might ride through if on donkey without chance of danger yet three men who saw knew at once that squire have have bad fall ralph be first through gap be off own horse a old irish hunter with groan collected got upon leg in rising animal be very careful not to strike late rider with foot be too evident to cox that beast in attempt to rise have given terrible squeeze to prostrate squire with saddle in moment three men be on knee be clear that mr newton be insensible be afraid be hurt said morris cox merely shook head a gently attempted to raise squire shoulder against own ralph a pale a death held father hand in one of own with other endeavoured to feel pulse of heart presently before one else came up to few drop of blood came from between sufferer lip cox again shook head 'd better get on to gate mr ralph into house said huntsman be quickly surrounded by others gate be soon there within twenty minute surgeon be standing over poor old friend no be dead surgeon said what be asked ralph impetuously surgeon took master of hunt aside whispered into ear that mr newton be dead man spine have be so injured by severity of own fall by weight of horse rolling on while be still doubled up on ground that be impossible that must ever speak again so surgeon said squire newton never did speak again illustration in moment three men be on knee be clear that mr newton be insensible be carried home to house of gentleman who lived in part in order that might be saved longer journey to priory length of road mattered little to never spoke again be sensible for moment ralph remained with during night of course so did surgeon at five o'clock on following morning last breath have be drawn life have passed away from george morris also have remained with rather have come back to house after having ridden home changed clothes be by that tidings be at last told to wretched son be over ralph suppose so said ralph hoarsely there have never be doubt said george since

endeavoured to protect from interest must be too absorbing have in last moment escaped now in sad solemn hour must not keep from thinking of loss a have stood in room in dead body of father have be lying have cautioned against feeling still have known that have be present to let do what must with own thought must not hinder from running back to fact that by father sudden death have lost possession of newton estate hated for remembering fact at time must not keep from remembering father have fought life long battle to make heir of newton have perished in moment of victory before victory be achieved ralph have borne success well while have thought that success be certain now knew that such subject must be absent from mind with such cause for grief a weighed upon at moment must

glory due to for victory being added to came to on score of broken arm hero be never so much hero among woman a when have be wounded in battle very weakness throw into female hand imparts moiety of greatness to woman who for while posse creates partnership in heroism in feminine half delight to make most of own share during week at percycross throughout journey patience have have half to there have arisen to considerable enjoyment from a soon a found that father must probably be none worse for accident after few week saw more of now than have done for year be able after fashion to work quiet loving female will with exacting from obedience to feminine sway such a have not be exercised on since wife death have be humbled passive happy have taken gruel grumbled with modesty consoled with constantly reflecting that be member of parliament for borough of percycross during journey although patience be urgent in requiring from father quiescence lest must injure by too much exertion there be many word spoken a to clarissa mary bonner a to poor clary sir thomas be very decided that if there be truth in suspicion have be now roused in mind a to ralph heir thing must be put end to at once ralph who have be heir be now in possession of mess of pottage for have sold inheritance so said sir thomas to daughter must undoubtedly consume that a have consumed other mess must have lasted till inheritance be own told to patience whole story a to polly neefit whole story at least a have heard ralph have declared to sir thomas when discussing expedience of proposed marriage with daughter of breech maker that be attached to polly neefit sir thomas have done must to dissuade young man from marriage in eye be disgraceful must not bring to look with favour on affection transferred so quickly from breech maker daughter to own there must be question of love affair between clary foolish heir who have disinherited by folly be doubly painful to patience suffered first for sister violence of whose feeling be so well known to so completely understood then on own account be obliged to endure conviction that be deceiving father although have allowed something of truth to escape from have not wilfully told sister secret looking at matter from father point of view hearing that father now said be brought in guilty of hypocrisy in court of own conscience in other matter a to mary bonner there be much more of pleasantness there must be possible reason why other man to whom fortune be going to be so good must not marry mary bonner if mary must bring to take into good grace of course must such at least be sir thomas opinion how be possible that girl like mary who have nothing of own must fail to like lover who have everything to recommend good look good character good temper good fortune patience did make protest against for sake of sex did think said that mary have ever thought of mr newton in light there must be beginning to such thought of course said sir thomas patience explained that have nothing to say against newton must all be very nice proper doubt only perhaps mary might not care for mr newton psha said sir thomas sir thomas seemed to think that one girl be a much bound to fall in love a other be to abstain from so doing patience continued protest very mildly because father arm be in sling then there arose question whether mary must be told of young man letter patience thought that young man must be allowed to come speak for sir thomas made objection to young man coming young man might come when pleased sir thomas thought must be well that mary must know what young man have written so reached home to be glorified by one worshipping daughter have be pleasant to wounded hero to be glorified by two daughter niece be almost wearisome on first evening nothing be said about love trouble love prospect of girl sir thomas permitted to enjoyment of glory with few sign of impatience when admiration became too strong told whole story of election lying back among cushion on sofa although patience with mild persistence cautioned against exertion be very bad that must have arm broken papa said clarissa be bore dear of course be dreadful bore a be doing so well be so glad that went down to percycross be such great thing that must be in house again doe give so much colour to life here hope be not colourless before know what mean be so nice to feel that be in parliament be quite on card may lose seat by petition never can be so cruel said mary cruelty said sir thomas laughing in politics men skin other without slightest feeling doubt that mr westmacott must ruin with most perfect satisfaction if by doing so must bring seat within own reach again yet believe mr westmacott to be kind hearted good sort of man there be theory among englishman that in politics man need spare to wish that opponent must fall dead upon hustings be not uncharitable wish at election oh papa exclaimed patience at rate be elected said clary threatened folk live long uncle said mary bonner so say dear well patience look at with so much reprobation in eye will go to bed at once being here instead of at percy standard doe make one inclined to take liberty oh papa be such delight to have said clary jumping up kissing father forehead be pleasant enough first evening came to end very happily next morning patience when be alone with father made request to with urgency papa said say anything to clary about ralph why not if there be anything in let die out of be there how be to say think of papa if knew must hardly tell even why not if be not to hear truth from who be to tell dear papa be angry there may be truth have better not be told what want be that clary must suffer if question will suffer may be sure of that will obey wish how can obey unless know will know said patience sir thomas must give promise on same day sir thomas sent for niece into room there read to letter have received from squire son be now last week of october short blessed morsel of time to poor squire at newton be happiest of life be now cutting down tree building farm house looking after stud in glory of success ralph have written letter have received answer also be successful glorious that fatal day on fox must not break from barford wood have not yet arrived mary bonner heard letter read listened to sir thomas speech without word without blush without sign sir thomas began speech very well became rather misty towards end when found unable to reduce mary to state of feminine confusion dear began have received letter think be duty to read to letter uncle yes dear sit down while read may a well tell at once that be letter have given very great satisfaction be from young gentleman upon hearing announcement mary face assumed look of settled collected strength never left for moment during remainder of interview yes from young gentleman may say that never read letter thought to be more honourable to writer be from mr ralph newton not ralph with whom have found to be so intimate from other who will day be mr newton of newton priory then sir thomas looked into niece face hoping to see there something of flutter of expectant triumph there be flutter triumph in mary countenance read letter sitting up in bed with left arm in sling then handed to have better look at dear mary took letter sat a though be reading seemed to sir thomas that be reading with cold accuracy of cautious attorney in truth eye did not follow single word of letter there be flutter triumph in face in movement of limb in quiet almost motionless carriage of body nevertheless pulse of heart beat so strongly that have depended on must not have read word of letter well dear said sir thomas when thought that ample time have be given for perusal mary simply folded paper together returned into hand have told a be bound to do dear that a far a be concerned must be happy to receive that for other answer must refer to of course will be for to give what answer heart dictate may say be duty to say a guardian nearest relative way in have put forward request show to be most honourable man have ever heard of be in favour be gentleman inch of a for prospect in life be such that entitle to address almost lady in land of course will follow dictate of own heart a said can not myself fancy greater good fortune must come in way of young woman than honest affection of such man a ralph newton then sir thomas paused for reply mary have none ready for of course have question to ask said then again paused still mary did not speak dare say will be here before long hope that may meet with happy reception at least will be glad to see for hold in great honour a look upon marriage a happiest lot for woman a think that must be happy marriage do hope do hope a said before must be left to mary have nothing to say trust uncle be not tired of tired of certainly not have not be with since have be here a much a must have wished because indeed for various reason like nobody want to get rid of there be way in young lady leave own home be generally thought to be matter of congratulation a said before nobody will press dear uncle be so full of thanks to for kindness be of course duty a guardian to tell that in opinion gentleman be entitled to esteem after mary left without word taking hat cloak a passed through hall went at once out into garden be fine autumn morning almost with touch of summer in know here that special season across atlantic be called indian summer that last glow of year warmth always brings with half melancholy conviction of year decay in be so delightful must be so full of delight be not for consciousness seems to contain of being immediate precursor of winter with horror there be sufficient constancy with of recurrence of season to make special name needful now again there come day when wind of equinox have lulled chill of october rain have left earth sun give genial luxurious warmth with power to scorch with strength only to comfort here a elsewhere luxury be laden with melancholy because tell of decay be harbinger of death be such day mary bonner a hurried into shrubbery walk where must wander unseen felt sadness softness of season there be path ran from front gate of villa ground through shrub tall evergreen down to river be continued along river bank up through flower garden to window opening from drawing room here walked alone for more than hour turning a came to river in order that might not be seen from house mary bonner of whose character hitherto little have be said be at rate acute observer very soon after first introduction to ralph heir ralph who have for so many year be intimate friend of underwood family perceived something in manner of very attractive young man conveyed to feeling that if so pleased might count a admirer of own have heard then a be natural much of brilliance of prospect little a be also natural of what have done to mar also perceived fancied that perceived that cousin clary gave many of thought to heir now mary bonner understood importance to herself of prosperous marriage a well a girl ever did understand great significance be orphan living in fact on charity of uncle be aware that having come to uncle house when weakness attraction of childhood be passed must have hold on such a must have be hers have grown to be woman beneath roof there be thoughtfulness too about thoughtfulness perhaps may call worldliness made impossible for not to have own condition constantly in mind in father lifetime have be driven by thoughtlessness own sterner nature to think of thing in few month have passed between father death acceptance in uncle house have taught to regard world a arena in must fight battle by own strength with such weapon a god have given to god have indeed given to many weapon knew of one did know that god have made very beautiful regarded beauty after unfeminine fashion a thing of value a chattel of must not bring to be proud might be possible that must win for herself by beauty position in world burdensome more joyous than of governess le dependent than of daily recipient of uncle charity have have lover in west indie perhaps score of have be nothing to father house have be so constituted that have be impossible for to escape very plainly spoken admiration of captain lieutenant colonial secretary in west indie gentleman do speak so very plainly on without smallest encouragement that lady accept such speaking much a do in england attention of handkerchief lifted offer for dance have meant nothing to mary bonner who from earliest year of girlhood have be accustomed to captain lieutenant even to midshipman through have grown up with serious thought something of conviction love making be ugly amusement a far a have be possible have kept aloof from though run after for beauty have be unpopular a being proud cold meaningless minx when father died must speak to one then have be settled among captain lieutenant colonial secretary that be proud cold meaningless minx with character left island now there came to naturally say question what lover might find in england must find lover how must deal with there be among many who tell that pure minded girl must think of finding lover must only deal with when come a truth circumstance parental control may suggest to if there be girl so pure certainly seems that human being expects to meet such be not purity of mary bonner if pure be did think of coming lover did hope that there might be for prosperity of life a consequence of love of worthy man whom in return might worship then there have come ralph newton heir now to mary bonner a also to clarissa underwood to patience to old mr brownlow great many others ralph heir did not appear in quite colour probably will in reader eye lady great many other lady gentleman who reckoned among acquaintance be not accurately acquainted with transaction with messrs neefit moggs horsball be thoroughly acquainted with easy nature of hero changing conviction to clarissa certainly be heroic to patience be very dear to old mr brownlow be almost demigod to mr poojean be object of envy to mary bonner a first saw be infinitely more fascinating than captain lieutenant of west indian regiment than colonial secretary generally be during evening at mr brownlow that mary bonner resolutely made up mind that must be a stiff cold to ralph heir a nature of acquaintance must allow have seen clarissa without watching without thinking have resolved mr newton be handsome well to do of good address clever be also attractive must not be attractive for must not a first episode in english life rob cousin of lover so mind be made up word be spoken to one have confidence there be one in whom must confide indeed there be need for confidence a left mr brownlow house on evening slipped arm through of patience happy clarissa be left to walk home with heir a reader may perhaps remember then that other ralph have come learned in half pronounced ambiguous whisper be nature of position in world did not know at time cousin did not know how nearly successful be effort made to dispossess heir of inheritance in order that other newton might posse saw thought that saw that be gallanter man of two then came again then again knew that own beauty be of avail encouraged not at be not in nature to give encouragement to man advance may perhaps be said of that have power to do so what be in her of graciousness of feminine love of leaning clinging flattering softness of woman nature required effort to extract have never hitherto be extracted within own bosom told that thought that must give if asking for be duly done then came first tidings of heirship of father success then close upon heel of tidings heir humbly expressed desire to be permitted to woo there be flutter of triumph in bosom a letter be read to yet there be sign of in voice in countenance must have be seen have be met walking in shade of shrubbery yet be full of triumph here be man to whom heart have seemed to turn almost at first sight a have never turned to man before have deigned to think of a of one must love loved a paced walk be also much to that man who be so generous in eye must have provided for so noble place in world quite understood what be to be wife of such one a squire of newton have grieved for clary sake when heard that former heir must be longer suspecting clary secret must not so grieve a to be insensible of own joy then there be something in very manner in man approached gratified pride while touched heart about other ralph there be tone of sustained self applause seemed to declare that have only to claim woman to receive there be old fashioned mode of wooing of have read dreamed that implied homage knew that desired homage ralph be prepared to pay for hour paced walk not thinking enjoying what knew there be nothing in requiring thought be to come till must come there be nothing that need say do till must come must hing say nothing such be determination when clarissa step be heard in moment clarissa arm be round waist mary said must come out with come walk with be going to mr brownlow must come to walk there back said mary smiling will return in omnibus must come oh have so much to say to chapter xxxiii tell will tell have told about be clarissa first word a soon a be out of gate on road to mr brownlow about what clary oh know rather be patience told then asked papa be so glad mary have a yet hardly have time to think whether coming of letter to uncle must must not be communicated to cousin have thought must have be almost sure that sir thomas must be more discreet whole matter be to so important so secret almost so solemn that must hardly imagine that must be discussed among whole household yet felt strong longing within to be able to talk of to one of two cousin clary be certainly favourite have be forced to consult one must have consulted clary absolute confidence in such matter with chosen friend more delightful might appear be on very account more difficult of attainment be occasion for thought for doubt almost for dismay now clary rushed into a though everything must be settled in walk from fulham to parson green be very good of to be glad clary said other hardly knowing why said yet meaning if in truth clary be glad be good of for man to whom clary be alluding have won from own lover inheritance like so much will let talk about wo oh yes said mary do pray do there be so many reason why must tell other everything elicited promise from mary if thought that must care must tell care about everything that concern clary did bring out to talk about now want to tell how much like ralph newton be mine yes be at rate if like to have of course will like why must not be everything be nice good now be to be owner of property what want to tell be begrudge to why must clarissa begrudge not begrudge property mary understood nothing have be said entitling to speak a though understood think must begrudge anything that thought good for said mary think that mr ralph newton mr ralph newton be very good for nothing must be so good in first place must not be very nice to have mistress of newton priory only must come properly first what must come first clary oh of course that must love better than anything in world do be too sudden to say that yet clary be sure will feel that will come mary must tell something there be so little to tell then be afraid of wanted to tell everything be not afraid of remember be hardly more than hour ago since first heard of mr newton wish up to moment nothing be further from dream be sure of ever so long ago said clarissa oh clary be told patience how be to be saw in eye one doe see thing knew must be so told patience that three must be three mr newton of course be nonsense nonsense indeed mean about patience what about clary clarissa made answer yet be burning to tell own story be most anxious to tell own story only on condition of reciprocal confidence very nature of story required that confidence must be reciprocal said that wanted to tell everything said mary so do know how glad will be to hear be very well then clarissa paused what dear do mean to accept mr newton now be time for mary to pause if be to tell whole heart said must be ashamed of what be saying yet know that there be cause for shame there can be none said clary be sure of acquaintance with mr newton be very very slight liked oh so much thought to be high spirited manly fine gentleman never saw man who so much impressed of course not said clarissa making gesture a though must stop on high road clasp hand together in however be impeded by parasol remembrance of present position be so much to say that one will love man better than world go to belong to be wife ah if one doe love can hardly believe that love can grow so quickly tell truth mary have not grown indeed can not say there will have whole truth when come to suppose will come there be much doubt of if doe come well hardly know what will say to will try to to love of course will love better than world know that be paying greatest compliment that man can pay to woman there be earthly reason why must not be proud to accept that offer have nothing of own to bestow in return be so beautiful mary must make pretence of denying be true that one great feminine possession did belong to after said how little doe beauty signify attracts can make man happy have everything to give to wife ought to have much in return for what give mean that girl must refuse rich man because have fortune of own not quite that ought to think whether can be of use to of course will be of use dear of greatest use in world be affair be best judge of what will be of use will love other men will envy will be everything oh dear do so hope will come soon almost hope will not will be so afraid to see first meeting will be so awful will not dare to look in face be settled no not settled clary yes be settled now will tell what mean when say begrudge to be know whether will care to be told care very much clary must be very unhappy if did begrudge anything of course know that ralph newton a call ought to have be heir oh yes need explain only only only be everything to be that clary yes be that be everything to love oh yes do love mary be not such happy girl a be sometimes think hardly care for have asked to care for well know think have have told know that loved dearly better than one what answer did make to clary clarissa have whole scene on lawn at popham villa so clearly impressed upon memory that eternity of year a thought must obliterate one of incident render doubtful tone of voice word that lover have spoken conduct have at time be so violent that have answered only with tear protestation of undying anger tear have be dried anger have passed away while love remained ralph ralph of course knew well enough that tear be dry anger gone must understand that must understand that love have protested if be real love must remain why must doubt very fact that be so dear to made such doubt almost disgraceful yet there be so much cause for doubt patience doubted knew that feared more than hoped have resolved gallantly that must be true to own heart even though by such truth must be preparing for life of disappointment have admitted passion must stand by in fear too consoled by reflection that lover be hindered not by want of earnestness want of truth by state of affair while be still in debt striving to save inheritance tormented by growing certainty that must pas away from how must give up to love making preparation for marriage clary made excuse for one else must have made so managed to feed hope made answer said at last yet knew loved yes knew that can tell told patience must not tell paused moment thinking whether must describe whole scene found that must not do that will tell perhaps when come again be if doe come if love will come know have trouble on will be very poor what will seem to to be very poor must not be poor for for must must that hinder how can say there be so many thing girl can not know may still be in debt then have be brought up to want so much will make more difference in now will understand why must tell will never begrudge good fortune if must come right will give little cottage near grand house will not despise poor clary when spoke of possible future lord little cottage on newton demesne hardly understood feeling with disinherited heir must regard

have have arm broken be now again member of parliament mr brownlow be thorough going tory be in ecstasy of delight that old friend must have be successful success seemed to be so much greater in that hero have suffered broken bone then there be many question to be asked must sir thomas again be solicitor general by right of seat in parliament for on such matter mr brownlow be rather hazy in conception a to working of british constitution must live at home clarissa must not say that patience expected result that must suggest of comfort on matter be that there must be now something of fair cause for excusing father residence at london chamber there be subject more enticing to old lady even than sir thomas triumph subject a to there must not be triumph only dismay not on account le interesting ralph newton have sold inheritance believe be settled said clarissa demurely dear dear dear dear groaned old lady while groaned clarissa furtively cast smile upon cousin be saddest thing ever knew said mr brownlow after for young man who never can be anybody know oh yes said clarissa can be somebody know what mean dear think very shocking very wrong such fine estate too like mr newton very much indeed said clarissa papa think be most charming young man never knew papa taken with one so much so do patience mary dear began mr brownlow mr brownlow have always thought that ralph heir must ultimately marry clarissa underwood that be manifest duty on part to do so have fancied that clarissa have expected have believed that underwood must be broken hearted at transfer of estate think can be right said mr brownlow must say that seems to that old mr newton ought to be ashamed of just because young man happens to be in sort of way own son be going to destroy whole family think that be very wicked have not word of censure for heir who have consumed mess of pottage be grand said clary a soon a be out again upon road be such dear old woman doe understand anything must help giving look when be abusing friend when know will have to make apology hope will not do that will if doe not forget about doe forget thing there be one thing agree with in at see shame in ralph having property a to being nobody be nonsense must be somebody wherever went if have not acre of property will be mr newton of newton priory just a much a anybody else must be have never done anything wrong to mary bonner have very little to say certainly be not prepared to blame present squire for having so managed affair a to be able to leave estate to own son two girl be very energetic walked back whole way to popham villa regardless of dozen omnibus that passed told about ralph ralph said clary to sister afterward must not help telling now dear clary said patience wish must help thinking of

piece trying to think of what have occurred to what ish old chap shomebody want shome tin will stand to old fellow take away said ralph be drunk then without waiting for further remonstrance from good natured now indignant cox went off to own room on following morning started for london by early train by noon be with lawyer up to moment believed that have lost inheritance when sent two telegram to

heir found to be owner of just at moment in thought that have lost chance of inheritance a result of own folly when walked out of lawyer office be almost wild with amazement be prize to have be taught to look forward through boyish day early manhood to look forward to a thing must be very distant so distant a almost to be lost in vagueness of prospect probably youth must have clean passed from must

necessity of now not difficult task of raising little ready money must at once pay off debt must especially pay owed to mr neefit must do so with many expression of gratitude perhaps with expression of polite regret at hardness of polly heart towards must do so certainly without further entreaty that polly heart might be softened ah with what marvellous good fortune have escaped from that pitfall for how much have not to be thankful to favouring goddess who must surely have watched over from birth from what shipwreck have not escaped now be squire of newton with wealth luxury at command hampered with wife oppressed by debt free from care a thought of perfect freedom in respect remembered former resolution a to mary bonner that resolution must carry out must be well for now to marry wife of woman have ever seen mary bonner be certainly most beautiful with newton own with string of horse a must soon posse with such wife at head of table whom need envy how many be there who must

glowing account be given of sport of season health of horse offer made of most disinterested service room must be ready for at moment notice if liked at time to run over for week hunting be quite evident that in eye of mr horsball newton of newton be great man there came congratulation from mr cox in allusion be made to squire somewhat uncivil conduct at last meeting mr cox trusted that dearest friend must come over have spell at moonbeam before settled down for life then hinted in language be really delicate in niceness of expression that if cox be invited to spend week two at newton priory before banished for life to australia must be able to make way over briny deep with light heart uncomplaining tongue know old fellow how true have always be to wrote cox in language of purest friendship a true a steel to sausage in morning brandy soda at night said ralph to a read behaved with thorough kindness to cousin three men lived together for month intercourse be a pleasant a

thousand pound so that son be by mean to be regarded a poor man be idea at present that must purchase in pleasant county a much land a might farm there set up staff for life get about two half per cent for money said heir who be beginning to consider learned in such matter must talk of land a very serious thing in way of possession what else be to do said other two half per cent with occupation be better than five per cent with none must make out remainder too by farming land there be nothing else in world must do a for remaining twelve month at newton be of course out of question nevertheless when december came be still living in house have consented to remain there till christmas must have passed have already heard of farm in worst county for hunting in england heir have said

newton have delayed answering letter for day two in order that may not disturb till last sad ceremony be over presume to offer consolation in great sorrow such tender must only be made by nearest dearest perhaps will permit to say that what little have seen of what further have heard of assure to most perfect sympathy on other matter gave occasion for two letter to will best perhaps discharge duty by telling showed to niece that feel a do that be honourable to of nature to confer honour upon change in position acknowledge to be most severe undoubtedly release a must have released have be bound chose to accept such release whenever may be in neighbourhood will be happy to see state of arm still prevents from writing with ease yours very faithfully thomas underwood newton when received letter struggled hard to give to proper significance must bring to conclusion respecting sir thomas have acknowledged that be released that mary bonner must also have be released have placed under obligation sir thomas did not say word from correspondent might gather whether in present circumstance might still be regarded a acceptable suitor letter be most civil most courteous almost cordial in expression of sympathy yet did not contain word of encouragement may be said that suitor have so written to lady uncle a to place out of way of further encouragement a to have put beyond power of correspondent to write word to must have in comfort certainly have done so have clearly shown in second letter that have abandoned idea of making match a to have shown so much urgent desire in first letter have explained that marriage must now be impossible have spoken of a ruined broken man whose hope be shipwrecked sir thomas must hardly have told in reply that mary bonner must still be pleased to see yet mary bonner have almost said so have be very silent when letter be read to news of mr newton death have already reached family at popham villa have struck with awe how might affect property even sir thomas have not absolutely known at first though be not slow to make understood that in probability terrible accident must be ruinous to hope niece have be justified in entertaining at hour mary have spoken not word must be induced to speak respecting by patience clarissa even to must not bring to say that if man really loved must still come to say so there be feeling of awe upon made mute stern altogether unplastic in hand of friend seemed even to patience mary be struck by stunning sorrow at ruin have come upon lover prospect be not so at thought wronged utterly what stunned be that must not bring to express passion for man whom have seen so seldom with whom conversation have be so slight from whom personally have received overture of attachment even though be ruined must not bring to express passion yet be there when clarissa thought that might obtain if not word at least tear mary appeared to be dead to feeling though crushed by what have lost be thinking while whether might be possible for one a to send to man to tell that have now occurred have of sudden made really dear to thought of maiden boldness flitted across mind must not communicate even to girl who be friend yet in silence in solitude resolved that time must come in must be bold then young newton second letter reached house that also have be read to be quite right said sir thomas of course release of there be nothing to release said mary proudly mean to say that having made proposition a be contained in first letter be bound to explain altered position suppose so said mary of course be have made offer believing that must make mistress of newton priory have made thinking that must marry in position must have be in position have not most unforeseen terrible calamity have occurred see that make difference said mary in whisper what do mean dear hardly know uncle try to explain mary if have accepted man when be rich must not go back when be poor unless wanted also said in whisper have not accepted said mary still in whisper sir thomas who be perhaps not very good at such thing did not understand working of mind have dared must have asked uncle to tell mr newton to come see sir thomas having dim inkling of what perhaps might be case did add paragraph to letter in notified to correspondent that personal visit must be taken in good part by end of first week in december thing be beginning to settle into shape at priory three young men be still living together at great house tenant on estate have be taught to recognise fact that ralph who have ever be heir be in truth owner among labourer poorer class there be doubt much regret that regret be expressed tenant though liked squire son be not upon whole ill pleased be in proper conformity with english habit english feeling that real heir must reign among gentry young squire be made a welcome a circumstance of heir must admit according to way of thinking personally popular a be other man be clearly better that legitimate descendant of old family must be installed at newton priory old squire son rode well to hound be loved by nothing that world must do on behalf must make newton of newton if only must remain in neighbourhood take place suited to income house must be open to must be received with diminution of attachment respect overture of nature be made to house must be have for that farm must be made comfortable might live among a general favourite must not under circumstance have be newton of newton nothing however be clearer to than a must not remain in county a master of newton priory must not remain in county at a thing settled down took shape began to feel that even in present condition might possibly make acceptable to girl a mary bonner in respect of fortune there must be reason why must not offer hand be in truth rich man whereas have nothing by birth be nobody absolutely nobody then also must have be nobody have land of newton belonged to when have written that second letter waiving claim to mary hand because of inferiority of position be suffering from morbid view have taken of own affair be telling then so assuring though did not in truth believe assurance that have lost not only estate also father private fortune at moment have be unstrung demoralised unmanned so weak that feather must have knocked over blow have be so sudden solitude gloom of house so depressing sorrow so crushing that be ready to acknowledge that there must be hope for in direction have fed upon own grief till idea of future success in life be almost unpalatable to thing have mended with now must see whether there might not yet be joy for in world must first see whether there might not be that one great joy have promised to then there came blow young squire have resolved that must not hunt before christmas in newton country be felt by by brother that must abstain from doing so out of respect to memory of uncle have declared purpose of course there be hunting shooting in day for other ralph at end of month young squire began to feel that day went rather slowly with remembered stud at moonbeam consulted gregory parson though must fain have induced brother to remain

ever two ralphs have become excellent friend when one be to go declared intention of going with intention of returning other pressed warmly to think better of to look upon priory at rate a second home there be reason why must not be so said namesake in close confidence of friendship giving declining of offer generated came further blow be standing together leaning upon gate looking at exhumation of certain vast root a to tree once belonging to have be made to fall in consequence of improvement going on at darvell farm mind telling said ralph heir that hope soon to have mistress here who be must be mere telling must not clarissa underwood asked unsuspecting ralph there did come prick of conscience qualm of injury done upon young squire a made answer not clarissa though be dearest sweetest girl that ever lived must make better wife perhaps than girl think of who be girl think of be to be found in same house mean elder sister said unfortunate one have known well that companion have not alluded to patience underwood in agony have suggested to that mode of escape not patience underwood though let tell man might do worse than marry patience underwood have always thought pity patience gregory must not make match of however must fall in love with clary have too much of rake in to give to parson be thinking of mary bonner who to mind be handsomest woman ever saw in life think be said ralph turning away face have farthing fancy continued happy heir regard now few month ago have mind to marry for money be sort of thing that man must do have almost made up mind to ask indeed when tell suppose have quite made up mind will accept of course can say nothing about that know man must take chance can offer fine position girl think must have regard to money when marries though man must not if there be nobody before must have chance suppose word be not boastful there be tone of triumph in voice why must not triumph thought other ralph of course must triumph have everything to recommend a for for dispossessed one particle of claim might have secured by mean of former correspondence have be withdrawn by own subsequent word dare say will take said with face still averted ralph heir did indeed think that must be accepted went on to discus circumstance of future home almost a though mary bonner be already employed in getting together wedding garment companion said nothing further ralph heir did not discover that anything be amiss on following day ralph heir went across country to moonbeam in buckinghamshire chapter xxxvi neefit mean to stick to there be business to be done a matter of course before young squire must have affair properly settled there be debt to be paid among mr neefit stood certainly first be first in magnitude first in obligation

of being millstone round neck when positively offer be pressed upon a thing stood there must be difficulty with mr neefit money must be paid of course with adjunct of accruing interest mr neefit must go on making breech for to end of chapter for raising money have still remnant of old property must sell so that need not begin by laying ounce of encumbrance on paternal estate be very clear in mind at period of life that there must never be such encumbrance in day that remnant of property must be sold neefit horsball others must be paid certainly did occur to in regard to neefit that there have be that between made expedient that matter must be settled with greater courtesy than must be shown by simple transaction through man of business therefore wrote few line to mr neefit on day before

disappointed said sir thomas gravely be bound to make what compensation may be in power compensation be d said neefit must marry think will do that did think must take money suppose did did think 'd come spend sunday out at cottage did did think a 'd come after polly down to ramsgate did did think a 'd give word to make wife did at assertion that made breech maker bobbed forward bullet head stretched open eye stuck out under lip during excited energy be not man pleasant to eye now how be to be sir thomas be what want to know mr newton be nothing to mr neefit oh be nothing to ai be brought up by just a son like now ai nothing to do mean to say a did ought to marry girl think ought not to marry not arter promise sir thomas be driven very hard whereas have sly old breech maker told story there must have be difficulty at think marriage must lead to happiness of party if injury have be done a fear may be too probable will advise young friend to make reparation in power short of marriage can say nothing further mr neefit be idea of being on square sir thomas can say nothing further mr neefit a have appointment made must ask to leave a sir thomas said hand be upon bell very well very well a sure a name neefit will hear of so will sir thomas be poking at in way old fellow choose to be poked at last word be addressed to stemm who have entered room be holding door open for mr neefit exit with something more than energy customary in speeding parting guest mr neefit however did take departure sir thomas joined mr trigger in other room will not be present at interview sir thomas have be in great hurry to get rid of mr neefit may be doubted whether found mr trigger much better company mr trigger business chiefly consisted in asking sir thomas for considerable sum of money in explaining to that petition must certainly cost large sum beyond unless expense must be saddled on westmacott moggs a to result mr trigger seemed to have considerable doubt perhaps bitterest part of mr trigger communication consisted in expression of opinion that mr griffenbottom must be held by sir thomas free from expense a to petition on ground that griffenbottom have stood alone must certainly have carried one of seat without fear of petition think can undertake mr trigger said sir thomas mr trigger simply shrugged shoulder sir thomas when be alone be very uncomfortable while at percycross have extracted from patience idea ralph heir clarissa be attached to other have very strongly declared that must not admit engagement between at time ralph be supposed to have sold inheritance did not stand well in sir thomas eye then have come squire death altered position of late ward sir thomas must be injured must be made subject to unjust reproach if be thought of that must be willing to give daughter to young man simply because young man owned estate have such sordid feeling in regard to girl did feel that have occurred at newton have made great difference ralph must now live at priory there must be enough even for extravagance must squire of newton ask for girl hand with girl consent thought that must hardly refuse how must ask clarissa to abandon so much seeming happiness because man have failed to keep out of debt upon small income must not do so then came to pas that be prepared to admit ralph a suitor to child must ralph renew request to effect have loved lad a boy property be wholly unencumbered of course said nothing to clarissa must ralph come to there must be one answer such have be state of mind before mr neefit visit breech maker tale have altered aspect of thing very greatly under circumstance must sir thomas recommend young squire to marry daughter of man who have be with if ralph newton have really engaged to girl have done so with purport of borrowing money from father might be reason why notwithstanding splendour of prospect must not be admitted to further intimacy at villa to borrow money from one tradesman be in eye of sir thomas about a inexcusable offence a young man must commit be too much disturbed in mind to go home on following day on thursday returned to villa following sunday must be christmas day chapter xxxviii for two reason young squire a soon a neefit have left in own sitting room at moonbeam sat down began to think over affair seriously one thing be certain to nothing on earth must induce to offer hand again to polly neefit have have most miraculous escape assuredly must run further risk in direction though have escaped must perceive that there be considerable trouble before considerable trouble perhaps disgrace certainly must not be proved against that have broken promise a there have be no engagement must be made public that have twice offered to polly must also be made public that have borrowed breech maker money kept alone on evening though hunted on following day be not found to be lively companion either by cox pepper lieutenant be talking about neefit neefit daughter day mr pepper who be more discreet declined to canvas subject be nothing to who man marries who said mr pepper what sort of horse ride that be what look at during day next ralph did consider state of affair very closely conclusion came to be that sooner must engage to marry mary bonner better if be once engaged engagement must not then be broken off because of previous folly with miss neefit again if be once engaged to mary bonner neefit must see absurdity of torturing further in regard to polly on wednesday evening went up to town on thursday morning put into cab ordered man to drive to popham villa be about noon when started from town though never hesitated did not pause for moment after have made up mind a to thing that must do still felt many misgiving a be driven down to fulham how must begin story to mary bonner how must look clary underwood in face yet have not idea that be in truth going to behave badly to clarissa there have doubt be sort of tenderness in feeling have existed between something just little warmer than brotherly regard have be thrown together have liked other a be driven nearer to villa remembered distinctly that have kissed on lawn did one suppose that man be bound to marry first girl kissed if not first then why second third clarissa must have fair ground of complaint against yet be uneasy a reflected that too must know purport of present visit to villa be not quite easy about mary good thing carried in hand be so many that did not conceive that mary must refuse yet wished that offer have be made have be accepted hitherto have taken pleasure in intercourse with young lady have rather enjoyed excitement of moment to men be troublesome even painful when have told clarissa that be dearer than one else have be very happy while be telling there have be nothing of embarrassment to in work of proposing to polly neefit there may perhaps have be other passage in life of same nature certainly have not feared beforehand be ashamed of afterwards now found endeavouring to think what word must use to mary bonner in what attitude must stand sit a used truth be said to man must do kind of thing without premeditation not le be resolved at gate jumped out of cab with determination to have over a soon a possible desired cabman to wait for at nearest stable remarking that might be there for few minute for few hour then turned to gate a did so saw sir thomas walking from direction of fulham bridge sir thomas have come down by railway on other side of river be now walking home sudden thought struck young squire must begin work by telling tale to sir thomas there must be nothing so fitting a that must obtain uncle leave to address niece two men greeted other there be many thing to be said sir thomas have not seen ward since old squire death ralph have not seen sir thomas since election at percycross accident of broken arm sir thomas be by far too reticent too timid too reflective man to begin at once whatever observation might have to make ultimately in regard to miss polly neefit be somewhat slow of speech unless specially aroused have hardly received congratulation of young friend respecting election expressed with difficult decency sorrow for old squire death a combined with satisfaction that estate have not be sacrificed when ralph stopped just a have reached front door with much solemnity of manner declared wish to make very particular private communication to sir thomas certainly said sir thomas certainly come into room there be delay before privacy must be achieved for in hall be met by three girl of course there be many thing to be said by clarissa must hardly repress flutter of heart when reader last saw flutter last heard word a spoke of love to cousin be taking opportunity of declaring to mary bonner that did not begrudge brilliance of mary present prospect though grand estate made brilliant be in measure taken from own hope have owned at same time that did not dare to feel confidence in own love because lover must now be too poor in own esteem to indulge with luxury of wife mary have accepted from certainly with expression of triumph certainly with triumph in heart now be entirely changed here be lover with fortune restored to once more beneath father roof gave hand first of three must not repress took with smile pressed warmly turned to patience took hers a rapidly a be able then came mary turn hope also be glad to see once again said clarissa heart sank within a heard word appreciation of woman in such matter be a fine a nose of hound be unintelligible to man oh yes mr newton said mary smiling if asks will take such word a be formed even in clarissa mind after fashion such be ejaculation of heart mary oh yes have meant little enough must mary withstand such chance if be offered to sir thomas led way into private room ralph followed wo be long papa said patience hope not said sir thomas remember ralph will be keeping lunch waiting said patience then two men be alone sir thomas mind have recurred to neefit at first moment of ralph request young man be going to consult a to best mode of getting rid of embarrassment in hall idea have come upon be to be asked for consent regarding clarissa a seated in one chair asked ralph to take have not quite made up mind a to answer must give there must at rate be delay reader will of course remember that sir thomas be persuaded that ralph have engaged to marry polly neefit ralph rushed boldly at subject at once sir thomas said be going to make proposition wish to ask for consent have made up mind that sooner marry in present condition better sir thomas smiled assented want to know whether will object to asking miss bonner to be wife miss bonner said sir thomas throwing up hand yes sir be there objection on part sir thomas hardly knew how to say whether there be be not objection on part in first place have made up mind that other ralph be to marry mary that must do so in spite of disclaimer have be made in first moment of young man disinheritance sir thomas however must have right to object on score must raise objection on score of clarissa did seem to that young people be at cross purpose patience must have be very stupid clarissa most addlepated else that ralph be abominably false still must say nothing respecting that tale have reached ear made even possible for to refer to clarissa yet be dissatisfied with man be disposed to show perhaps ought to tell said sir thomas that man calling neefit be with yesterday oh yes breech maker believe said that such be trade assured that have borrowed large sum of money from do owe money thousand pound think said certainly a much a not for breech suppose must be impossible for money advanced part one part other said ralph went on to tell that be engaged to marry daughter be untrue be never engaged to be never engaged to sir thomas be lie on part of mr neefit be there foundation for have told that thought of such marriage there be nothing to justify in saying be ever engaged to young lady truth be that did ask refused did ask did ask said ralph in earnest well yes certainly in earnest at time thought only way to save property need not tell how wretched be at time will remember what have said to be true that asked did so by agreement with father refused twice be so good so sensible so true that knew have better not make party to bargain may think of own conduct will not have behaved badly to miss neefit sir thomas did think very ill of ralph conduct believed after while whole truth came out a to money lent a to neefit scheme be of course understood by of that ralph be required neither by honesty by honour to renew offer then under such circumstance be be not to be allowed to propose to mary bonner at first ralph have be much dismayed at having neefit mine sprung on at moment collected very quickly renewed demand a to mary sir thomas must not mean to say that because have be foolish in regard to polly neefit that therefore be to be debarred from marrying sir thomas did not exactly say that nevertheless sir thomas showed displeasure seems said particularly easy to to transfer affection affection for miss neefit be not strong said ralph did always will regard a most excellent young woman showed sense in refusing said sir thomas think did said ralph doubt much whether niece will not be equally sensible ah can say nothing a to be to hear story of miss neefit be sure must refuse must not tell to a yet if go well with will tell to day come sir thomas mean to be hard upon at last can not be that must really regret have got out of trouble regret much that must have borrowed tradesman money more that must have offered to pay debt by marrying daughter through however there be feeling present to sir thomas that be in truth angry with squire of newton not so much for misconduct in coming to propose to mary so soon after affair with polly neefit because have not come to propose to clarissa sir thomas knew that feeling if did really exist must be overcome mary be entitled to chance must make best of must not refuse sanction to marriage with niece on account of ralph misconduct when must have sanctioned marriage with own daughter in spite of misconduct conversation be ended by sir thomas leaving room with promise miss bonner must be sent to fill place in five minute miss bonner be there entered room very slowly with countenance be almost savage during few minute that remained there did not sit down sir thomas have told why be here said advancing towards taking hand be have not told mary mr newton name be miss bonner must between be so cold a that still have her by hand did not at moment attempt to withdraw have come to tell at first moment be possible to after uncle death that of woman in world love best then withdrew hand mr be sorry to hear say so very sorry why must be sorry if be unkind to like there may be reason why must be sorry will indeed be very sorry since first saw have hoped that must be wife never can be wife mr newton why not have done anything to offend being here a one of family must know enough of affair to feel sure have come to first moment be possible did not dare to come when thought that position be one be not worthy of must have be same at time said mary why must reject like without moment thought for two reason said mary slowly then paused a though doubting whether must continue speech give two reason now guided stood looking into face waiting for in first place said think be untrue to person then paused again a though asking whether reason must not suffice resolved that must be bold give other in next place heart be not own to give be so asked ralph have said a much a can be necessary perhaps more must rather go now then left room with same slow stately step saw no more on day then in short five minute sir thomas have absolutely told whole story about polly neefit have come to conclusion because in trouble have offered to marry tradesman daughter therefore be to be debarred from ever receiving hand of lady be light in looked upon mary first announcement a to second announcement be absolutely at loss there must probably thought have be engagement before left jamaica not le on account be act of unpardonable ill nature on part of sir thomas that telling of polly neefit story to mary bonner at moment be left alone for few minute after mary departure then patience came to must stay for dinner even patience be very cold to sir thomas be fatigued be lying down must see of course if wished where be clarissa asked ralph patience said that clarissa be not very well also be lying down see what be said ralph turning upon angrily be of determined to quarrel with because of uncle death see why must make quarrel said patience know that one have quarrelled with of course must not wait for dinner must have lunch walked out on to lawn with something of bluster in step stood there for three four minute looking up at house speaking to patience young man when have be rejected by one of young lady of family have rather hard time of till get away well patience said at last make farewell for then be gone chapter xxxix horseleech honour of representing borough of percycross in parliament be very great sir thomas doubt did enjoy after fashion be by mean unalloyed pleasure while be still in bed with broken arm at percy standard many application for money have be made to man wanted sovereign man five pound note poor starving wretch half crown came to with note from trigger message from spicer spiveycomb to effect a election be now over money ought to be given landlord of percy standard be on such occasion very hard upon really will do good sir thomas be wanted sir thomas will make good feeling in town sir thomas know how soon may have to go to work again sir thomas be too weak in health to refuse gave sovereign five pound note half crown hurried back home a quickly a be able thing be almost worse with at home than at percycross real horseleech felt that must hardly get good hold of while be lying at percycross inn attack by letter be well knew more fatal than made personally waited first came be from mr pabsby mr pabsby have at last seen way clear have voted for underwood westmacott absolutely throwing away vote a far a cause be concerned mr pabsby have quarrelled with griffenbottom who once when pressed hard for favour have answered reverend gentleman somewhat roughly may go be said mr griffenbottom in wrath tell everybody in percycross said so mr pabsby have smiled have gone away have now voted for mr westmacott mr pabsby be indeed horseleech of severest kind there have be outward show of reconciliation between griffenbottom pabsby pabsby have at last voted for underwood westmacott sir thomas have not be home two day before received letter from mr pabsby have be with infinite satisfaction so mr pabsby now said that have at length seen way clearly found able to support friend sir thomas believed that might take upon to say that when once have seen way clearly have put shoulder to wheel gallantly in fact be to be inferred from content of mr pabsby letter sir thomas return have be due altogether to mr pabsby flock who have so said mr pabsby be guided in matter altogether by advice then sent list of hearer who have voted for sir thomas from slight change of subject needed to bring to new chapel be building desire that sir thomas must head subscription list in so good cause be easy enough might be difficult to say in what mr pabsby strength lay certainly be case that letter be so written a to defy neglect almost to defy refusal such be power of horseleech sir thomas sent mr pabsby cheque for twenty pound received mr pabsby acknowledgment thanking for first subscription thanks be not very cordial be evident that mr pabsby have expected good deal more than twenty pound in return for that have done mr pabsby be simply first before christmas have come seemed to sir thomas that there be not place of divine worship in whole of percycross be not falling to ground in ruin have not observed when be there now appeared that fund be wanted for almost such edifice in borough school be in most destitute condition be informed that sitting member have always subscribed to school that if did not continue such subscription child must literally be robbed of education one gentleman whose name did not even remember to have heard simply suggested to that must a matter of course continue to give l towards general christmas collection on behalf of old woman of borough sitting member have given time out of mind mr roodylands have political project of own in fact if carried out must amount to prohibition on import of french boot suggested that sir thomas must bring in bill to effect on meeting of parliament if sir thomas must not object to trouble of visiting amiens lille beauvais three four other french town mr roodylands mentioned must be able to ascertain how much injury have be done to percycross by cobden treaty mr spiveycomb have own idea about italian rag mr spiveycomb being in paper line wrote very long letter to sir thomas praying member to make master of subject so vitally important to borough represented mr spicer also communicated to astounding fact that high official connected with army be undoubtedly misbehaving in regard to mustard for troop mustard contract be not open a must be open mustard be supplied by london house mr spicer be very anxious that sir thomas must move for committee to inquire of member of london firm a to manner in contract be obtained by mr spicer be disposed to think that be most important matter must be brought forward in next session of parliament mr pabsby have got cheque before other application be received when came in shoal sir thomas thought that might be well to refer to mr trigger for advice sir thomas have not loved griffenbottom during election be not inclined to ask colleague for counsel griffenbottom have obtained name for liberality in percycross have shown symptom so thought sir thomas of intention to use reputation a mean of throwing off further burden from own shoulder have spent treasure in borough let colleague begin now word spoken by mr griffenbottom in strain have be repeated to sir thomas after many such word sir thomas must not go to mr griffenbottom for advice a to what must give refuse to give doubted whether better reliance must be placed on mr trigger to one must go for direction be once to let be known in percycross that demand made must be satisfied might sign cheque to extent of whole fortune during first session did write to mr trigger enclosing various percycross application mr trigger duly replied to mr trigger regretted that money have be given to mr pabsby mr pabsby have be of use must be of use mr griffenbottom who knew borough better than one else have understood well when on one occasion have be little short with mr pabsby sir thomas ought not to have sent that cheque to mr pabsby sending must do infinite harm cause dissension in borough might require considerable expenditure to set right a to other clerical demand seemed to sir thomas that mr trigger be of opinion that must be gratified have in fact sent money to only person in percycross who ought not to have received money l for old woman be matter of course must not be begrudged a be only payment be absolutely annual in regard to school sir thomas must do what pleased sitting member have always be liberal to school school be thing to sitting member be doubt expected to subscribe a to question of french boot mr trigger thought that there be something in said that if sir thomas must devote christmas holiday to getting up subject in lille amiens must have good effect in borough show that be in earnest might be more desirable a there be knowing a yet what might be done about petition there doubt be strong feeling in borough a to cobden treaty sir thomas must probably feel to be duty to get question up in regard to mustard mr trigger suggested that though there be probably nothing in might be a well to ask secretary at war question two on subject mr spicer be doubt moving man in percycross sir thomas must at rate promise that must ask such question a mr spicer certainly have friend who might be conducive to withdrawal of petition sir thomas must at rate put into correspondence with war office mr trigger also thought that sir thomas might judiciously study subject of italian rag in reference to great paper trade of country doubt manufacture of paper be growing business at percycross mr trigger returned application ended letter by hinting that cheque might a well be sent at once mr trigger thought that little money about borough must do good at present moment need hardly be said that view of thing be not pleasant to sitting member who be still confined to house at fulham by arm broken in cause sir thomas have at once sent l towards christmas festivity for poor of borough have declared purpose of considering other matter then have come further letter from mr trigger announcing journey to london mr trigger sir thomas have first meeting after election immediately upon mr neefit departure from chamber be to be asked stemm a soon a have closed door behind mr trigger back be what to be petition sir thomas petition cost deal of money

stemm for sake of seat in parliament know how may be sir thomas hope not sir thomas see how be not to go on now sir thomas if be for petition one must mind there must be petition of course if there be good cause for must succeed doubt sir thomas say bribery at percycross be tremenjous suppose be on other side if be on side stemm be not so with knowledge did must to prevent spoke against opened

sir thomas way said stemm with groan be not reassuring wish have never heard name of percycross said sir thomas dare say replied stemm went there determined to keep hand clean when one put one hand into other people business wo come out clean said judicious stemm must go on with now way sir thomas know what will do said unhappy member on next morning there came application from percycross postmaster in town have died suddenly competitor for situation be worth about l per annum be very numerous there be certain mr o'blather only known in percycross a cousin to one mr givantake wife of liberal solicitor in borough of mr o'blather worst must be said be that at age of forty have income on to support mr givantake be attached to cousin mr givantake have become sensible of burden that vacant office be just thing for appeared at glance to friend mr givantake in energy on subject expressed opinion that whole cabinet must be impeached if just claim of mr o'blather be not conceded be felt that justice of claim must not prevail without personal interest liberal party be in power application hot instant be made to mr westmacott mr westmacott be happy enough to have answer ready treasury have nothing to do with matter be post office concern simply a late liberal member last liberal candidate for borough be not entitled to intrude even in matter of patronage upon postmaster general with whom be not acquainted mr westmacott be malicious a well a secure added postscript to letter in said that believed present sitting member sir thomas underwood be intimately acquainted with noble lord who presided at post office there be various interest at percycross moved brought together weighed against other balanced to grain finally dovetailed if sir thomas underwood must prevail on lord to appoint mr o'blather to vacant office then givantake influence at percycross must be used towards withdrawal of petition such be communication now made to sir thomas by gentleman who signed name a peter piper who professed authorised to act on behalf of mr givantake sir thomas answer be a follows southampton building december sir can have nothing to do with mr o'blather post office at percycross be obedient servant thomas underwood mr peter piper post office percycross christmas have passed have passed uncomfortably enough at popham villa in retreat neither of three young lady be at present very happy when sir thomas be invited by mr trigger to take further step with reference to petition be thought necessary that there must be meeting in conservative interest be suggested that meeting must take place in sir thomas chamber mr trigger in making proposition seemed to imply that great favour be thereby conferred on sir thomas a country be supposed to be most honoured be selected a meeting ground for plenipotentiary when important international point requires to be settled sir thomas must not see arrangement in light must have shuffled out of honour have be possible be not possible at period of year mr griffenbottom have house in town mr trigger explained that be inexpedient that such meeting must take place at hotel there be place so fitting a lawyer chamber sir thomas who regarded a desecration entrance of one such man a mr trigger into private room who be particularly anxious not to fall into intimacy with mr griffenbottom be driven to consent at one o'clock on th stemm be forced to admit deputation deputation from percycross consisted of mr trigger mr spicer mr pile with came also senior sitting member at first be very grave sir thomas asked indiscreetly whether must take glass of sherry pile spicer immediately acceded to proposition sherry be perhaps efficacious in bringing about speedy conversation well underwood said mr griffenbottom seems that after be to have d petition sir thomas lifted left foot on right knee nursed leg said nothing on one point be resolved nothing on earth must induce to call colleague griffenbottom doubt about mr griffenbottom said mr pile be unless can make westmacott right t'other chap must be of much account mr pile be going little too fast said trigger ai said mr pile for moment allowed to be silenced like look of at percycross said mr spicer why like look of asked sir thomas know what idea of pleasure be said mr griffenbottom take delight in spending money for nothing have spent enough can tell mean to spend much more seat be a safe a church have petitioned against a well a mine said sir thomas yes have now what be to be done know whether sir thomas be willing to take whole cost of defence upon said mr trigger pouring out for second glass of sherry be not said sir thomas whereupon there be pause during pile spicer also took second glass of sherry why must pay cost of defending mr griffenbottom seat why must pay said griffenbottom seat be safe enough fact be if money be paid a to know nothing be paid to get second seat everybody know that why must one have paid money for be safe never have difficulty everybody know must come in for percycross twenty time running without buying vote be that true trigger believe must mr griffenbottom of course must look here underwood beg pardon for one moment mr griffenbottom said sir thomas will tell mr trigger whether vote be bought on behalf mr trigger smiled put head on one side made answer wish might be allowed to hear truth continued sir thomas whereupon spicer grinned pile looked a though be about to be sick how be that set of gentleman who generally knew business so well a did political leader at percycross have got into same boat with man silly enough to ask question a sha spend money said griffenbottom be out of question ca touch have spent money got article if others want article must spend theirs mr trigger thought might be a well to change subject for moment at rate to pas on to clause of same bill be very sorry sir thomas said that wrote that letter to mr givantake wrote letter to mr givantake man named piper addressed well well well be same thing be givantake though of course be going to sign name to everything if must just have written line to friend postmaster general really think must have squared must have made request so improper for percycross said sir thomas patronage be open to everybody suggested mr griffenbottom sort of favour be asked day said trigger live in free country said spicer givantake be d scoundrel same said mr pile a for wife irish cousin must be very sorry to leave letter in hand must have come off mr pile said trigger request might have be made if sir thomas will allow to say a much request ought to have be made will allow nothing of kind mr trigger said sir thomas with assumption of personal dignity caused everyone in room to alter position in chair understand thing be given by merit mr trigger smiled mr griffenbottom laughed outright at rate ought to be in office believe be mr griffenbottom who have have bestowal of local patronage laughed again thing be over now at rate said mr trigger saw givantake yesterday said spicer wo stir finger now never must have stirred finger said mr pile if 'd stirred fistesses must have done have'porth of good givantake indeed be blowed there be specie of honesty about mr pile almost endeared to sir thomas something must be settled said trigger thought 'd got proposition to make said spicer well sir thomas began mr trigger a be girding loin for task before think that seat must stand brunt have be putting two two together be what think very black cloud came over brow of sir thomas underwood at moment said nothing of course can be defended if choose to fight battle can defend will cost about l perhaps little more be two side for will have to be paid mr trigger paused again still sir thomas said not word mr griffenbottom think that must not be asked to take part of cost not shilling said mr griffenbottom well continued mr trigger being case of course have got to see what will be best plan of action suppose sir thomas be not altogether indifferent about money by mean said sir thomas know who be money be money world over may say that put in mr spicer just let go on for moment mr spicer till make thing clear to sir thomas be how stand at present will cost be to say about l must do good really think must do good here be judge know that new broom sweep clean suppose may allow that there be little money spent somewhere do say now that glass of beer must lose seat sir thomas must not remember that have said to prevent there being even glass of beer way in have be treated by party in matter because have so endeavoured be useless to refer to at present moment seems to said that if one seat be vacated must be vacated doe follow at said mr griffenbottom allow just for moment longer continued trigger who rose from seat a came to real gist of speech proposition have be made to sir thomas be able to say that be one may be trusted of course chief anxiety be for party feel that sir thomas of course sir thomas must not condescend to make reply to now liberal will be content with one seat if go on will lead to disfranchising borough none of want that must be satisfaction to sir thomas to be mean of robbing borough of privilege after that borough have done for go on mr trigger said sir thomas liberal only want one seat if will undertake to accept hundred petition will be withdrawn mr westmacott will come forward again in case must oppose now sir thomas know what borough think will be best course for of to pursue sir thomas did know may say that have known for minute past have perceived what be coming various recollection have floated across mind especially remembered that l for poor old woman mr trigger only week since have recommended that must give remembered also that have given recollected sum have already paid for election expense a to mr trigger have be very careful to get money before new proposition be made remembered mr pabsby cheque for l remembered broken arm fortnight of labour infinite vexation in borough remembered hope girl triumph remembered also that have told dozen time since return that wished that might rid altogether of percycross seat in parliament now proposition must have effect be made to well sir thomas what do think of asked mr trigger sir thomas required passing of few moment that might think of yet there be feeling strong at heart telling that behoved not even to seem to doubt be man not deficient in spirit when roused a now be roused knew that be being ill used from first moment of entering percycross have felt that place be not fit for that required method of canvassing of be not only ignorant desirous to remain ignorant that at percycross must only be catspaw in hand of other men knew that must not safely get into same boat with mr griffenbottom trust to steering of such coxswain a mr trigger have found that there must be sympathy between one of who constituted own party in borough yet have persevered have persevered because in such matter be so difficult to choose moment in to recede have persevered have attained measure of success a far a have be possible for to do so have fought battle with clean hand now be member of parliament for percycross let what end there might come to petition even though seat must be taken from must be subjected to personal disgrace must give evidence truth of judge in land must doubt a to purity of own intention a to struggle to be pure have made now asked to give way in order that mr griffenbottom might keep seat felt that poor moggs have be fool together at moment there came upon reflection that such men a moggs be unable to open mouth in such borough a percycross without having teeth picked out of jaw remembered well poor moggs legend moggs purity right of labour remembered thinking at time that moggs must have come to percycross now be told of that borough have done for be requested to show gratitude by giving up seat in order that griffenbottom might still be member of parliament percycross might not be disfranchised did feel gratitude to percycross love to mr griffenbottom in heart desired that mr griffenbottom might be made to retire into private life knew that must be well that borough must be disfranchised horrid men sat around how hated must get rid of now now for ever by acceding to proposition made to thought that in doing so must speak few word must be very agreeable to in speaking then that mr trigger have said about l have be doubtless true if defended seat money must be spent did not know how far might be able to compel mr griffenbottom to share expense be not so rich what be bound to think of money for child sake did believe mr trigger when mr trigger told that seat must not be saved yet must not bring to let men have way with to have to confess that have be tool went so much against grain with that anything seemed to to be preferable to that passage across brain of thought have not required many second guest seemed to acknowledge by silence that little space of time must be allowed to mr pile be leaning forward on stick with eye fixed upon sir thomas face mr spicer be amusing with third glass of sherry mr griffenbottom have assumed look of absolute indifference be sitting with eye fixed upon ceiling mr trigger with pleasant smile on face be leaning back in chair with hand

door behind back be deputation from percycross be sir thomas be saying a how did quite approve of percycrossians to however sir thomas vouchsafed reply chapter xl what sir thomas thought about sir thomas underwood have be engaged upon very great piece of work ever since have be called to bar in twenty fifth year of life have then devoted to writing of life of lord verulam have be at ever since a yet have not written word in early life be up to fortieth year have talked freely enough about opus magnum to of compeer with whom have be intimate of late bacon name have never be on lip patience at home be aware of name nature of father occupation clarissa have not yet learned to know that who have be great philosopher little lord chancellor be not to be lightly mentioned to stemm matter have become so serious that in speaking of book paper document must have recourse to periphrasis rather than mention in master hearing name of fallen angel yet sir thomas be always talking to about sir francis bacon be always writing life there be men who never dream of great work who never realise to need of work so great a to demand lifetime who never fail in accomplishing second class task with satisfy own energy men be who to world be very useful few there be who seeing beauty of great work believing in accomplishment within year allotted to man be contented to struggle for success struggling fail here there come one who struggle succeeds men be many who see beauty who adopt task who promise triumph then never struggle at task be never abandoned day go by week then month year nothing be done dream of youth becomes doubt of middle life then despair of age in building summer house be so easy to plant first stick one doe not know where to touch sod when one begin to erect castle so have be with sir thomas underwood life of bacon must not suffice to to scrape together few fact to indulge in fiction to tell few anecdote then to call book biography here be man who have risen higher be reported to have fallen lower perhaps than other son of adam with finest intellect ever given to man with purest philanthropy most enduring energy have become by word for greed injustice sir thomas have resolved that must tell tale a have never yet be told that must unravel fact have never seen light that must let world know of what nature really have be man that must write book must live have never abandoned purpose now at sixty year of age purpose remained with not one line of book be written yet task have divorced in measure from world have not be unsuccessful man in life have made money have risen nearly to top of profession have be in parliament be even now member yet have be divorced from world bacon have done by bacon have justified to rather have failed to justify to seclusion from family from world have be intended for strenuous work have be devoted to dilettante idleness have fallen into mistake such habit such pursuit be sure to engender thought much thought nothing out be consequently at sixty still in doubt about almost everything whether christ did did not die to save sinner be question with so painfully obscure that have be driven to obtain what comfort might from not thinking of assurance of belief certainly be not to enjoy yet absence from fear may come from assured unbelief yet none who knew must say that be bad man robbed one never lied be not self indulgent be affectionate have spent life in intention to write life of lord verulam not having done have missed comfort of self respect have intended to settle for belief on subject be of to men most important having still postponed work of inquiry have never attained security of faith be for ever doubting for ever intending for ever despising for doubt unaccomplished intention now at age of sixty have thought to lessen inward disturbance by returning to public life most unsatisfactory alliance with mr griffenbottom have be result who know agony of ambitious indolent doubting accusing man of man who have skeleton in cupboard a to can ask for sympathy from one will understand what feeling be at work within bosom of sir thomas when percycross friend left alone in chamber moment that knew that be alone turned lock of door took from out standing desk whole heap of loose paper be latest of note on great bacon subject for though line of book have ever be written have work even yet taken such form a to enable to write line nevertheless always have by large assemblage of document note query extract innumerable reference in course of year have become almost unintelligible to upon from time to time must set to work whenever be most wretched must fly at paper when qualm of conscience became very severe must copy passage from dusty book hardly in belief that might prove to be useful with hope that might cheat into so believing now in misery declared that must bind to work never leave there if anywhere might consolation be found with rapid hand moved about paper tried to fix eye upon word how be to fix thought must not even begin not to think of scoundrel who have so misused be not week since have taken l from for poor of percycross now came to with simple statement that be absolutely to be thrown over have already paid l for election be well aware that account be not closed be man who must not bear to speak about money to make complaint a to money even though be being so abominably misused still must pay further claim might be made on in respect of election be past yes must pay for very purchased vote for bribery a to have so loudly expressed abhorrence by reason of be now to lose seat with ignominy money be not worst of there be heavier sorrow than arising from loss of money alone have be just throughout contest at percycross alone have be truthful alone straightforward yet alone must suffer began to believe that griffenbottom must keep seat that must certainly lose own be quite convinced might lose by undergoing adverse petition paying ever so much more money might lose in manner that mr trigger have so kindly suggested in way there must be disgrace contumely hour of agony of self reproach in store for what excuse have for placing in contact with such filth of what childishness have not be victim when allowed to dream that pure scrupulous man must go among such impurity a have found at percycross come out still clean yet triumphant then thought of griffenbottom a member of parliament of legislation constitution to griffenbottoms be thought to be essentially necessary that there be always many such men in house have always known have sat there have seen have stood shoulder to shoulder with through many division have thought about acknowledging use now that be brought into personal contact with one very soul be aghast griffenbottoms never do anything in politics be men of whom in lump may be surmised that take up side in politics not from instructed conviction not from faith in measure even in men from adherence through reason prejudice to set of political theory simply because on side on that there be opening gradually do grow into shape of conviction from mould in be made to live must be believed of conviction be conviction a to division conviction a to patronage conviction a to success conviction a to parliamentary management not conviction a to political need of people so said sir thomas to a sat thinking of griffenbottoms in former day have told that pudding can not be made without suet dough that griffenbottoms be necessary if only for due adherence of plum most health bestowing drug patient may take must bestow anything health be taken undiluted be thus in former day sir thomas have apologised to for griffenbottoms in house such apology satisfied now log of man lump of suet diluting quantity of most impure water 't be thus that mr griffenbottom be spoken of by sir thomas to a sat there with bacon document before politician whose only real political feeling consisted in positive love of corruption for have not only absolutely got better of who regarded at rate a man of mind thought have used a puppet have compelled to do dirty work oh that must have be so lost to own self respect a to have allowed to be dragged through dirt of percycross must do something must take step mr griffenbottom have declared that must put to expense in defending seat of course sir thomas must do same believed that might be practicable for to acknowledge justice of petition to declare belief that own agent have betrayed to acknowledge that seat be indefensible a thought of found that be actually ignorant of law in matter that must make such bargain a suggested to by mr trigger of so much thought that be sure at rate must hing that knew to be dishonourable must consult own attorney be end of self deliberation conviction under circumstance must retain seat then struggled hard for hour to keep mind fixed on subject of great work have found unknown memoir respecting bacon written by german pen in latin language published at leipzig shortly after date of bacon fall must translate that be always easiest for mind to work in such emergency on matter a to creative struggle be demanded from chapter xli broken heart be very bad with clarissa when ralph newton be closeted with mary at popham villa have suspected what be about to take place when sir thomas ralph went together into room at moment said nothing endeavoured to seem to be cheerful attempted to joke with mary three girl be sitting at table on lunch be spread meal one be destined to eat at popham villa on day thus remained till sir thomas joined mary have said ralph newton wish to speak to have better go to to uncle yes to have better go to have rather not of course must do a please must advise to go to then have risen very slowly have gone of have understood what meant to clarissa thing be a certain a though already heard word spoken with patience even there be doubt sir thomas though have told nothing did not pretend that truth be to be hidden looked at younger daughter sorrowfully laid hand upon head caressingly with there be longer possibility of retaining secret hardly remembrance that there be secret to retain oh papa said oh papa burst into tear dear said believe that be best that must be so be unworthy patience said not word be now holding clarissa close to bosom tell mary continued sir thomas will see when be at liberty patience can ask ralph whether will suit to stay for dinner be tired will go up stair so two girl be left together patty take away said clarissa must never see again never will not accept clary yes will know will be sly artful creature have be so good to clary think not what doe matter be unworthy can be nothing to now papa be right be unworthy care nothing for only care for oh patty take away must not bear to see when come out then patience took sister up to joint room laid poor sufferer on bed throwing on knee beside bed wept over sister caressed that argument of ralph unworthiness be nothing to clarissa did not consider to be so worthy what might forgive sin if only chance of forgiving such sin be given to at moment in heart of heart anger be more against rival than against man have not yet taught to think of baseness to have only a yet have time to think that evil have come upon have feared from first moment of cousin arrival presently patience heard door opened of room down stair heard mary slow step a crossed hall understood well that one must be below with single word of affection to sister went down stair well mary said looking into cousin face there be nothing particular to tell said mary with gentle smile of course knew what wanted then of course knew what must say to knew said patience be sure that clary knew said mary be alone there will not know what to do with wo go to will go up to clary mary nodded head then patience crossed hall to liberate rejected suitor mary stood for awhile thinking already knew from what patience have said that clarissa have suspected felt that there must have be such suspicion clarissa have not understood ought to have understood for moment be angry be disposed to go to own room then remembered cousin misery crept up stair to door have come so softly that though door be hardly closed nothing have be heard of approach may come in dear said very gently well mary tell said clarissa there be nothing to tell clary only that fear mr newton be not worthy of love asked to take never mind dearest will not talk of dear dearest clary if only must make happy have refused know better than to ask know where heart be will carry burden together dearest then will be lighter will come to again that other one clary dear will not think about there be thing must not be thought of will not talk of will love other so dearly clarissa now that be assured that evil fortune be not to be aggravated by injury done to by cousin allowed to be tranquillised if not comforted there be indeed something in position that did not admit of comfort family knew story of unrequited love treated with compassion while tenderness be pleasant to be still in injury vain attachment in woman heart must ever be weary load because can take step of own towards that consummation by burden may be converted into joy man may be active may press suit even tenth time may do something towards achieving success woman can only be still endure clarissa have so managed affair that even privilege of being still be hardly left to trouble be known to doubted whether even servant in house did not know cause of woe how have come to pas must not now remember have told patience a though in compliance with compact that must ever tell other thing then circumstance have arisen made so natural that must be open candid with mary two ralphs be to be two lover to have be delightful dream during last few month whose inheritance at moment be supposed to have be gone have a clarissa thought in plainest language told love to dear dear clary know love word to sense have be so all important have meant so much have seemed to be so final that hardly wanted further corroboration then indeed have come great fault fault have doubted whether must ever pardon because of heinousness of offence have be unable to answer question have be asked offence such a be have not lightened solemnity of assurance a far a love went that ralph ought to be own after speaking of such word a have spoken there be trouble about money yet be entitled to regard a own then have come written offer from other ralph to mary offer written in moment of believed prosperity have be so natural that clarissa must tell cousin that a regarded splendour of position there must be jealousy between clarissa did not herself think much of lover who wrote letter instead of coming speaking have perhaps idea open speech even though offence might follow be better than formal letter be mary affair very respectful ralph be mary lover if mary be satisfied must not quarrel with well behaved young man must not even quarrel with because be taking from own ralph inheritance for so many year have be believed to be own thus in plenitude of affection in serenity of heart have told everything to cousin now also father knew how have come to pas did not think to inquire suspected harm from patience thing have be so clear that world might see ralph that false one knew also who must know so well a did have not very word be spoken by be repeated by now be a one stricken where wound must not be hidden on day ralph be driven back to town in cab in rather disheartened condition more be seen heard of for present at popham villa late guardian have behaved very ill to in telling mary bonner story of polly neefit that be impression feeling sure that mary have alluded to unfortunate affair with breech maker daughter of must have heard tidings only from sir thomas a to clarissa have not exactly forgotten little affair on lawn to eye that affair have be so small a to be almost overlooked amidst larger matter mary thought have never looked so beautiful a have done while refusing did not mean to give up heart have told be not own thought have read of young lady in similar condition of young lady who have bestowed heart have afterwards got back again for sake of making second bestowal be not sure that object must lend zest to life there be brother gregory in love with clarissa still true to must be true to mary must see whether in spite of far away lover might not be more successful than brother at rate must not give up before have gone to bed night have already concocted letter to in brain explaining whole of neefit affair asking whether man must be condemned to misery for life because have be led by misfortune into mistake a that dined very well at club on following morning went down to moonbeam by early train for day hunting thence returned to newton priory in time for christmas a be driven up to own house through own park meeting one two of own tenant encountering now then own obsequious labourer be not unhappy man in spite of mary bonner cruel answer may be doubted whether greatest trouble at moment did not arise from dread of neefit have managed to stay long enough in london to give order neefit money must be immediately paid knew that neefit must not harm at law must not be agreeable if old man be to go about country telling everyone that ralph newton of newton have twice offered to marry polly for present will leave although be hero will return to girl at popham villa be very well talking patience mean to try to change clarissa said be after visit of percycross deputation to sir thomas after christmas more than week have now passed by since

again to see mr griffenbottom london attorney mr trigger in meantime sir thomas be to remain quiet for few day petition be not to be tried till end of february there be still time for deliberation sir thomas just now very often took out that great heap of baconian paper still not word of biography be written be ala still very far from writing first word be very well patience mean to try to change said clarissa poor patience must make answer dreadful a be to such assertion from young woman there be man who clearly doe not want to marry who have declared in plainest way that doe want to marry one else who have grossly deceived who never mean to think of again yet say that will wilfully adhere to regard for such must have be speech patience must have made have openly expressed thought clarissa be ill weak wretched patience must not bring to say word must distress sister if came to to morrow of course must forgive clarissa said again conversation be never commenced by patience who must rather have omitted mention of base young man of course must men do do thing men be not like woman do manner of thing everybody forgives say anything about hoping hope for anything be not happy enough to hope must care if knew be going to die to morrow there can be change if want to be hypocrite patience will what will be use truth will be same two girl let have way never contradicted coaxed tried to comfort be in vain at first must not go out of house not even to church then took to lying in bed lasted into middle of january still sir thomas did not come home wrote frequently short note to patience sending money making excuse making promise always expressing word of hatred disgust a to percycross still did not come at last when clarissa declared that preferred lying in bed to getting up patience went up to london fetched father home have gone so far with sir thomas now that be unable even to attempt to defend humbly said that be sorry that have be away so long returned with patience to villa dear said sir thomas seating by clarissa bedside be very bad if have known be coming papa must have got up if be not well perhaps be better here dear think be quite well papa what be love clarissa looked at out of large tear laden eye said nothing patience say that be not happy know that anybody be happy papa wish that be with heart child can father do anything will make happy papa tell clary mind asking question papa patience tell that be still thinking of ralph newton of course think of think of too there be different way of thinking have known of long time yes papa wish with heart that have never seen be not worthy of solicitude always liked have heard say loved dearly have said so did love in certain way love still so do papa know to be unworthy even if have come here to offer hand doubt whether must have permitted engagement do know that within last two month have twice offered to marry young woman doubt whether be not at moment engaged to said poor clarissa yes without pretence of affection on part simply because wanted to get money from father be sure papa asked clarissa who be not prepared to believe did not believe enormity on part of man loved be quite sure father came to to complain of have confession from ralph own lip very day that came here with insulting offer to mary bonner did tell mary knew that be unnecessary there be danger a to mary who do think girl be daughter of tailor who have made money be not that cared for clary more than do whether meant to marry not know be sure did papa said clarissa getting up in bed will make better that wanted be tradesman money to get that be willing either to deceive girl to sell to know must have be baser mode of traffic be that conduct of gentleman clary poor clarissa be in terrible trouble hardly believed story seemed to tell of degree of villany greater than ever imagination have depicted to yet if be true must be driven to look for mean of excusing story a told be indeed hardly just to ralph who in course of transaction with mr neefit have almost taught to believe that must love polly very well be not in direction that clarissa looked for apology for such conduct say that men do manner of thing said at last can only tell said sir thomas very gravely what men may do will not say gentleman can ever have acted after fashion have shown to be scoundrel papa papa say that screamed clarissa child can only tell truth know be hard to bear must save if must be better that must know will always be bad papa who can say dear god forbid must be too severe upon have be so bad now that be bound to tell that must drive from thought when told smiling that have come down here to ask cousin mary to be wife be almost minded to spurn from door can have feeling of true attachment can not know what mean in others be heartless unprincipled oh papa spare be done now will forget dearest will try papa think that will die must rather die what be good of living when nobody be to care for anybody people be so bad a clarissa must not say that nobody care for have person ever be false to be not sister true to yes papa mary yes papa be afraid to ask whether also have not be true to even in moment there arose in mind doubt whether evil might not have be avoided have contented to live beneath same roof with child said nothing of supplied want know love papa have always be good to did not mean that never cared for one in way sir thomas in dealing with character of late ward have be somewhat too severe be difficult perhaps to say what amount of misconduct doe constitute scoundrel justifies critic in saying that man be not gentleman there be who affirm that who owes debt for good can not pay be gentleman tradesman when can not get money be doubt sometimes inclined to hold opinion opinion be changed when money come at last especially if come with interest ralph have never owed shilling did not intend to pay have not property to cover that borrowing of money from mr neefit be doubtless bad one must like to know that son have borrowed money from tailor be borrowing of money be bad rather than special dealing with tradesman a to affair with polly excuse may be made have meant to be honest to neefit have meant to be true to neefit daughter even sir thomas high minded a be must hardly have passed so severe sentence have not great sufferer in matter be own daughter word that spoke be doubtless salutary to poor clarissa never again said to patience that must not try to make change did ever again declare that if ralph came back again must forgive on day after scene with father be up again made effort to employ about house on next sunday went to church then knew that be making necessary struggle ralph name be never mentioned for time be allusion made to

course will marry one know why must ever wish that must not be what made think of well did be just word patience said in one of letter what sort of word asked ralph with much interest be nothing know just misunderstood when one be always thinking of thing everything turn that way got into head that meant to hint to that a clary be fond of other ought to forget made up mind must be so much easier to make up one mind than to do there came tear in eye a spoke turned face towards fire that brother might not see there remained hot oppressive because must not raise hand to rub away wonder what be said asked ralph oh nothing know how fellow have fancy there be anything in said ralph oh of course not patience might have imagined said ralph be just like such sister a patience be best woman that ever lived said gregory a good a gold said ralph think however will very soon forgive sir thomas mind saying now that be glad be so said gregory though a regard clary seems to be cruel think must have come much here have become wife nothing will ever separate greg hope not know whether must have done almost think that ought to live where must see did fear at one time will come to parsonage yet old fellow if will stick to said ralph never said gregory then conversation be over chapter xliii once more at end of february ralph declared purpose of returning to moonbeam for rest of hunting season be

london with be right said ralph what be taking up now parson said that wanted to get few thing to have hair cut must stay above one night ralph asked more question two brother went up to london together fear that patience underwood may not have be in respect discreet preserver of sister secret then there be nothing more difficult of attainment than discretion in preservation of such mystery to keep friend secret well keeper of must be firmly resolved to act upon in way not even for advantage of owner of if be confided to a secret that friend be about to make maiden speech in house must not even invite acquaintance to be in place not if secrecy be first object in thing knowledge must be to a though have not great love be hardly capable of such secrecy a in fulness of love patience have allowed father to learn secret of poor clary heart in fulness of love have endeavoured to make thing at newton have not told young clergyman that clarissa have given to brother that must not give to meaning to do morsel of service to of if might be possible have said word two with effect reader will have seen from conversation given in last chapter will come to parsonage yet ralph have said gregory in one word have implied assured conviction that such coming be thing not to be hoped for event not even to be regarded a possible nevertheless made up mind that must go up to london to have hair cut in so making up mind did not for moment believe that must be of use to be not quite sure that when in london must go to popham villa be quite sure that if did go to popham villa must make further offer to clarissa knew that journey be foolish simply result of uneasy restless spirit that must be better for to remain in parish move about among old woman bed ridden men still went must dine at club said perhaps might go down to fulham on following morning so brother parted ralph a man of property with many weighty matter on hand have of course much to do desired to inspect agricultural implement new carriage have ever so many thing to say to carey lawyer wanted to order new harness for horse so went to club played whist afternoon gregory a soon a have secured bed at quiet inn walked off to southampton building from direct manner in be done might have be argued that have come up to london with purpose of seeing sir thomas be not so turned step towards place where clary father be generally to be found because knew not what else to do a went told that might a well leave alone still went stemm at once told with candour be almost marvellous that sir thomas be out of town hearing of petition be going on at percycross sir thomas be there a matter of course stemm seemed to think rather odd that educated man such a be rev gregory newton must have be unaware that petition against late election at percycross be being carried on at moment have got serjeant burnaby little mr joram down to make fight of said mr stemm a far a can learn might just a well have remained up in town be only sending good money after bad young parson hardly expressed that interest in matter stemm have expected turned away thinking whether have not better have hair cut at once then go home did go to popham villa on same afternoon such be fortune found clarissa alone since father have seen in bed spoken to of what have called folly of love have not again given up to life of sick room dressed came down to breakfast of morning then must sit with needle in hand till took book then with book till took needle tried to work tried to read perhaps did accomplish little of then when patience must tell exercise be necessary must put on hat creep out among path did make kind of effort to get over evil have come upon still one must watch not know that be wounded deer miss clarissa be at home said servant who well knew that young clergyman be one of rejected suitor there have be hardly secret in house in reference to gregory newton love two other young lady girl said have gone to london must be home to dinner then with beating heart gregory be ushered into drawing room clarissa be sitting near window with novel in lap having placed there with view of getting what be left of light of early spring evening have not read word for last quarter of hour be thinking of word scoundrel with father have spoken of man loved must be that be in truth so bad a if be true must not take scoundrel a be if must come to might be scoundrel in one thing on one occasion yet be good to might repent scoundrelism certainly must forgive of one thing be quite sure have not looked like scoundrel when have given assurance on lawn so thought of young men in general be very easy to call young man scoundrel yet to forgive iniquity when suited to do so young men might get in debt gamble make love wherever pleased at once yet be forgiven thing be very bad might be just to call man scoundrel because must not pay debt because made bet about horse young men did great many thing must be horrid indeed be girl to do then one papa must call such man scoundrel because be not wanted to come to house while papa must make welcome give best of everything ralph newton might be scoundrel if so a clarissa thought there be great many good looking scoundrel about in world a to whom scoundrelism did very little to injure in esteem of friend be thus that clarissa be thinking over own affair when gregory newton be shown into room greeting on side be at first formal almost cold clary have given little start of surprise have then subsided into most demure mode of answering question yes papa be at percycross did not know when be expected back mary patience be in london yes be at home alone have not seen ralph since uncle death question elicited answer have be asked without design clary endeavoured to make reply without emotion if displayed gregory who have own affair upon mind did not see have not seen other mr newton a passed through town have understood that have be very much disturbed by father horrible accident death then gregory paused in question clarissa expressed hope that there might be no more hunting in world be very hard work conversation gregory be beginning to think that have done no good by coming when on sudden struck chord from whence came sound of music ralph have be living together at priory said oh indeed yes think heard patience say that be at priory suppose will not be telling secret to in talking about cousin mary clarissa felt that be blushing up to brow made great effort to compose oh said know of hope may be successful said gregory know can not tell never knew man more thoroughly in love than be believe said clarissa not believe indeed may clary have never seen from what say of suppose to be most beautiful be very beautiful be said with strong emphasis why must not believe will not be of slightest use mr newton may tell so though suppose be impossible to make man believe be so unfortunate asked poor girl with wounded love feeling sore within have not intended to say anything must be cruel injurious to gregory be not till word be out of mouth that perceived effect oh mr newton be only thinking of said innocently only meant ralph be one of who always think be to have everything want be not one of clarissa yet be one who seem never to be tired of asking for be not to be given to said to myself when last went from here must never ask again must never trouble more be sitting with book in hand looking out into gloom now made attempt to answer yet see here be continued be still silent head be still turned away from must see that tear be streaming down cheek have not power not to come to while yet there be chance said can live work without can have life of own when first saw made picture to myself of what life might be can not get that moved from before eye be sorry however that coming must make weep oh mr newton be so wretched said turning round sharply upon for moment have thought that must tell everything then checked remembered how ill placed such confidence must be what must make wretched dearest know can not tell sometimes think world be bad altogether that have better die people be so cruel so hard thing be so wrong may tell brother that need not think of cousin mary nothing ever must move h sh here be say that be cry be introduced to beauty a light came clarissa escaped yes be indeed most lovely a looked on gregory felt that agreed with clarissa nothing on earth must move remained there for half hour clarissa did not return then went back to london chapter xliv petition time for hearing petition at percycross have at length come judge have gone down to ancient borough day fixed be monday th parliament have then be sitting for three week mr griffenbottom have be a constant in place a though there have be no sword hanging over head sir thomas have not a yet even taken oath have made up mind that must not even enter house while bar against a legislator existed have not a yet even be seen in lobby daughter colleague mr trigger stemm have expostulated with on subject assuring that must treat petition with greatest contempt at rate till must have proved by success to be matter not contemptible to counsellor gave ear when went down to give evidence before judge at percycross seat have a yet availed nothing mr griffenbottom have declared that must not pay shilling towards expense of petition maintaining that own seat be safe that peril incurred have be so incurred simply on behalf of sir thomas nothing according to mr griffenbottom view must be more unjust than to expect that must take part in matter trigger too have endeavoured to impress upon sir thomas more than once twice have be all in vain sir thomas acting under advice of own attorney have at last compelled mr griffenbottom to take share in matter mr griffenbottom did not scruple to say that be very ill used to hint that unfair practice might possibly have prevailed during last election at percycross have be adopted on behalf of sir thomas in conformity with sir thomas view will therefore be understood that two member did not go down to borough in best humour with other mr trigger still nominally acted for have be almost avowed that sir thomas be to be treated a jonah if by such treatment salvation might be have for ship of griffenbottom be to be regarded a captain mr westmacott be also in percycross so be moggs reinstated in old room at cordwainers arm moggs have not be summoned be presence there required for purpose immediately connected with inquiry to be made purity right of labour may always be advocated when better than at moment in impurity of borough be about to be made subject of public condemnation moggs moreover have now rankling in bosom second cause of enmity against tory of borough since election have learned that rival ralph newton be in way connected with sitting member sir thomas laid upon sir thomas back weight of full displeasure in reference to proposed marriage with polly neefit have heard that polly have raised difficulty have indeed rejected aristocratic suitor be therefore not without hope have be positively assured by neefit that match must be made be consequently armed with double purpose in desire to drive sir thomas ignominiously out of percycross sir thomas have have more than one interview with serjeant burnaby little mr joram than whom two more astute barrister in such matter be not to be found at time practising though perhaps at time astuteness of serjeant be on wane while of jacky joram a be familiarly called be daily rising in repute sir thomas barrister senior to two gentleman have endeavoured to hold own with to impress on conviction that have nothing to conceal that have personally endeavoured a best knew how to avoid corruption that if there have be corruption on part of own agent be ready to be party in proclaiming found to be absolutely ignored put out of court by own counsel be gentleman with whom professionally have have no intercourse a have practised at chancery at common law bar have be solicitor general be bencher of inn whereas serjeant burnaby be only serjeant jacky joram still wore stuff gown nevertheless found to be nowhere in discussing with circumstance of election even joram whom seemed to remember having seen only other day a ugly shame faced boy about court treated not exactly with indignity with patronising good nature listening with air of half attention to what said then not taking slightest heed of word of who doe not know transparent pretence of courtesy of discourtesy be most offensive ah just so sir thomas just so now mr trigger suppose mr puffer account have yet be settled word from mr trigger be of infinitely greater value with mr joram than sir thomas protestation sir thomas must not keep from remembering that jacky joram father be cheesemonger at gloucester who have married widow of jew with little money twenty time sir thomas made up mind to retire from business altogether always found unable to do so when mentioned idea griffenbottom flung up hand in dismay at such treachery on part of ally such treachery such cowardice what have not sir thomas forced griffenbottom into ruinous expenditure now to talk of throwing up sponge be in vain that sir thomas explained that have forced nobody into be manifestly case that have refused to go on with by on mr griffenbottom mr trigger insisted so often with so much strength that sir thomas felt compelled to stand to gun bad a believed gun to be if sir thomas meant to retreat why have not retreated when proposition to effect be made to at own chamber of weak vacillating ill conditioned men that mr griffenbottom have ever be concerned with sir thomas underwood be weakest most vacillating most ill conditioned to have to sit in same boat with man be greatest misfortune have ever befallen mr griffenbottom in public life mr griffenbottom did not exactly say hard thing in hearing of sir thomas so said that became common property of jorams trigger spiveycombs spicers be repeated piecemeal to unhappy second member have secured for separate sitting room at percy standard thinking that thus must have advantage of being alone one connected with party came in out of room a though have be specially selected a chamber for public purpose even griffenbottom came into to have interview there with trigger although at moment griffenbottom sir thomas be not considered to be on speaking term griffenbottom in matter seemed to have hide of rhinoceros have chosen to quarrel with sir thomas have declared that must not speak to colleague whose parliamentary idea habit be so repulsive to have said quite aloud that trigger have never made greater mistake in life than in bringing sir thomas to borough that let petition go a must sir thomas must never be returned for borough again have spoken thing almost in hearing of sir thomas yet must come to sir thomas private room sit there morning with cigar in mouth mr pile must come in make most unpleasant speech mr spicer called continually with own idea about borough thing must be still saved if enough money be spent if mr givantake be properly handled mr o'blather duly provided for two witness upon whom thing really hung must not be found in percycross when called upon to morrow be mr spicer idea be very eager to communicate to serjeant burnaby trigger in energy told mr spicer to go be occurred in sir thomas private room then mr pabsby be there constantly till at last be turned out by trigger in agony sir thomas asked for sitting room be informed that house be full room intended for two member be occupied by griffenbottom nobody ever suggested that party might meet there when sir thomas vain request be made for further accommodation griffenbottom went on with cigar mr pile sat picking teeth before fire making unpleasant little speech judge who have hurried into percycross from town who opened commission on monday evening did not really begin work till tuesday morning jacky joram have declared that inquiry must last three day having pledged to be at town early on following friday serjeant burnaby whose future service be not in such immediate demand be of opinion that must not get out of percycross till saturday night judge crumbie who be to try case who have be trying similar case ever since christmas be not due at next town till monday be understood by everybody that intended if possible to spend saturday sunday in bosom of family trigger however have magnificent idea believe will carry into middle of next week said if choose to go on with trigger thoroughly enjoyed petition even griffenbottom who be no longer troubled by gout be not now obliged to walk about borough did not seem to dislike to poor sir thomas be indeed purgatory sitting member be of course accused a regarded agent of crime known in electioneering tactic vote have be personated vote have be bought vote have be obtained by undue influence on part of master landlord there have be treating of most pernicious corrupt description a to personating of vote that according to mr trigger have be merely introduced a pleasant commencing fiction common in parliamentary petition there have be nothing of kind nobody supposed that there have did not signify of undue influence what purist choose to call undue influence there have of course be plenty be not likely that master paying thousand year in wage be going to let men vote against influence be so much matter of course that must not be proved to injury of sitting member such at least be mr trigger opinion mr spicer might have be little imprudent with men case must be brought up in man have be injured undue influence at percycross be gammon so said mr trigger jacky joram agreed with mr trigger serjeant burnaby rubbed hand must give opinion till have heard evidence vote have be bought during day of election there be doubt on earth on matter great secrecy prevailed sir thomas must not get word spoken in own hearing be admitted however vote have be bought there be dozen men perhaps more than dozen who must prove that one glump have paid ten shilling piece between one two on day of election there be general belief that perhaps over hundred have be bought at rate trigger be ready to swear that did not know whence glump have got money glump be nobody knew where glump be strange whisper respecting glump be floating about borough trigger be disposed to believe that on side must prove that glump have really be employed by westmacott people to vitiate election be quite sure that nothing must connect glump with a agent on behalf of griffenbottom underwood so mr trigger asserted with greatest confidence what be in bottom of mr trigger mind on subject one pretended to know a for glump be man who must certainly take payment from anybody for dirty work be general impression through borough that glump have on occasion be hired by trigger trigger certainly enjoyed prestige be thus conferred upon a to treating there must be doubt about there have be treating idea of conducting election at percycross without beer seemed to be absurd to male female percycrossian of course publican must open tap then send in bill for beer to electioneering agent there be prevailing feeling that interference with so ancient practice be not only un english unjust also that be beyond power of parliament to enforce law so abominable unnatural trigger be of opinion that though there have be great deal of beer attempt must be made to prove vote have be influenced by treating there have be beer on side trigger hoped sincerely that there might always be beer on side a long a percycross be borough sir thomas found that chance of success be now spoken of in tone very different from have be used when matter be discussed in own chamber have be then told that be hardly possible that must keep seat have in fact be asked to resign though sick enough of percycross must not do in manner then proposed to now be encouraged in fight encouragement be of nature gave hope robbed even of wish to have hope be dirt from beginning to end might be verdict of judge from judge verdict be now to come must still believe that nothing short of absolute disfranchisement must meet merit of case accusation with regard to personation of vote be abandoned serjeant burnaby expressing most extreme disgust that such charge must have be made without foundation although at borough have last left have brought forward same charge on behalf of then client have abandoned in same way then whole of remaining hour of tuesday wednesday be passed in showing that messrs spicer spiveycomb roodylands have forced own men to vote blue mr spicer have dismissed one man mr spiveycomb two men gentleman swore that men dismissed be not worth salt have be sent adrift upon world by mean on account of politics true have voted for moggs then have done simply to spite late master on middle of wednesday when matter of intimidation have be completed result still lying in bosom of baron crumbie mr trigger thought that thing be looking up be report brought to mr griffenbottom who be smoking midday cigar in sir thomas arm chair while sir thomas be endeavouring to master first book of lord verulam later treatise de dignitate scientiarum seated in cane bottomed chair in very small bed room up stair by consent question of treating came next heaven earth be being moved to find glump when proposition be made that treating must come before bribery trigger stated in court that be doing very best to find man there might yet be hope though ala hope be becoming slighter hour own idea be that glump have be sent away to holland by well did not care to name party by whom believed that glump have be expatriated however there might be chance counsel on other side remarked that there might indeed be chance baron crumbie expressed hope that mr glump might make appearance for sake of borough might otherwise fare badly then great beer question be discussed for two entire day there be doubt about beer trigger who be examined after half score of publican said openly that thirsty conservative soul have be allowed to slake drought at joint expense of conservative party in borough a thirsty liberal soul have be encouraged to do on other side when reminded that malpractice in direction on part of beaten candidate must not affect status of elected member replied that beer consumed in percycross during election have not to best of belief affected vote percycrossians be not men to vote way that because of beer must not believe even in regard to liberal percycrossian might be so in other borough of other borough knew absolutely nothing who paid for beer mr trigger at once acknowledged that be paid for out of general fund provided for election who provided fund there be not small amount of fencing on point during course of mr joram snapped very sharply very frequently at counsel on other side hoping thereby somewhat to change issue at last there came out two fact that there be general fund to conservative might subscribe that only known subscriber to fund be mr griffenbottom sir thomas underwood old mr pile who have given l note apparently with view of proving that there be fund be agreed on hand that treating have be substantiated be remarked by baron crumbie have not be hard upon treating in other borough after result must depend upon what baron thought about mr glump might be that must recommend further inquiry under special commission into practice of borough because of glump iniquity that must nevertheless leave seat to sitting member seemed to be mr trigger belief on evening of thursday a took brandy water in sir thomas private sitting room there be nothing in world so brisk a way manner of lawyer when in great case come to portion of know to be real bone of limb kernel of nut doctor be very brisk when after dozen moderately dyspeptic patient come on unfortunate gentleman whose gastric apparatus be gone altogether parson be very brisk when reach minatory clause in sermon minister be very brisk when asks house for vote telling hoped for follower that special point be absolutely essential to government unless can carry hanging on to must vacate place horse dealer be very brisk when after four five indifferent lot bid man bring out from stable last thorough bred that bought very best that ever put eye on briskness of none of be equal to briskness of barrister who have just got into hand for cross examination whom may call centre witness of great case plume like bullfinch going to sing spread like peacock on lawn perk like sparrow on paling crow amidst attorney satellite of court like cock among hen put hand way that settling even sunbeam a enter lest moat must disturb intellect dull edge of subtlety there be modesty in eye quiescence in lip repose in limb under lie half concealed not at concealed from who have often watched at work glance tone spring be to tear that unfortunate witness into piece without infringing one of conventional rule have be laid down for guidance of successful well mannered barrister serjeant burnaby though astute be not specially brisk by nature on friday morning mr joram be very brisk indeed there be certain mr cavity who have acted a agent for westmacott who if anybody on westmacott side have be so guilty have be guilty in matter of glump absence perhaps must not do justice to mr joram acuteness be to imagine a believing that glump be absent under other influence than used on behalf of conservative side there be subsidiary point on mr cavity might be made to tell tale of course there have be extensive bribery for year past in percycross on liberal a well a on conservative side mr joram thought that must make mr cavity tell tale then too must be very brisk in affair of glump be pretty nearly sure that mr glump must not be connected by evidence with of sitting member with of agent must prove that glump be neutral ground that a such service must not be traced to friend mr trigger mr joram on occasion be very brisk indeed score of men be brought up ignorant half dumb heavy browed men dressed in amphibious garb of out o ' door town labourer of whom there exists class of hybrid between rural labourer artizan one of whom acknowledged after noon on election day received ten shilling with instruction to vote for griffenbottom underwood did vote for griffenbottom underwood at election in percycross have a now openly acknowledged waited till about same hour on day of election then somebody have bought vote for somebody on occasion purchase have be made by mr glump there be small empty house up little alley in town to there be back door opening on vacant space in town known a grinder green entered house by one door leaving by other a passed through glump gave to man sovereign with instruction entering name in small book then went in body voted for griffenbottom underwood of twenty knew nearly other twenty none of knew other men who have be paid by glump of course none of have slightest knowledge of glump present abode be proved that at last election glump have acted for liberal be also proved that at election before have be active in bribing for conservative very many thing be proved if thing be proved when supported by testimony on oath trigger proved that twenty vote alone must have be of service must not certainly have be purchased in manner so detrimental according to trigger view be a clear a daylight that glump have not be paid by when asked whether must cause mr glump to be repaid that sum of ten pound must mr glump send in bill to effect simply stated that mr glump must certainly send such bill to be then asked whether might not be possible that money must be repaid by messrs griffenbottom underwood through hand reaching glump again by mean of further middleman mr trigger acknowledged be claim made upon by known agent of party must endeavour to pas ten pound through account a thought that there must be certain feeling of honour in thing did not for moment think that one acting with must have dealing with glump on saturday morning when case be still going on to great detriment of baron grumble domestic happiness glump have not yet be caught seemed that man have wife no relative friend woman at whose house lodged declared that often went came after fashion respect with glump name be mentioned a persistency in disobeying law capability for intrigue be thus proved be so great that be pity must not have be there to enjoy for hour be great man in percycross greater because baron crumbie did not cease to threaten with terrible penalty much other bribery be alleged none other be distinctly brought home to agent of sitting member a to bringing bribery home to mr griffenbottom appeared to be out of question nobody seemed even to wish to do that judge a appeared did not contemplate result so grave terrible a there be band of freeman of whom be proved that have be treated with most excessive liberality by corporation of town be proved also that majority of corporation be supporter of mr griffenbottom large number of vote have be so secured such at least be charge made by petitioner allegation jacky joram laughed to scorn corporation of course used charity privilege of town a thought right men voted a thought right only case of bribery absolutely proved be manipulated by glump nothing have be adduced clearly connecting glump griffenbottomites mr trigger be in ecstasy mr joram somewhat repressed by referring to oracular word have fallen from baron in respect to corporation corporation may be guilty a well a individual baron have said jacky joram have be very eager in assenting to baron in asserting at same time that bribery must be proved wo be assumed lord that corporation have bribed because have political sympathy must have none said baron human nature be human nature lord even in corporation said jacky joram took place just before luncheon be made solemn meal on side a judge have declared intention of sitting till midnight if necessary immediately after solemn meal mr griffenbottom be examined have be declared purpose of other side to turn mr griffenbottom inside out mr griffenbottom conduct have on various former occasion be subject of parliamentary petition under old form on such occasion chief delinquent be never examined now mr griffenbottom must be made to tell that knew not only of present of past iniquity yet mr griffenbottom told very little certainly did seem to bystander even opposing counsel even judge on bench abstained from prey because be member of parliament be notorious to world griffenbottom have debased borough have so used venal tendency a to make systematic have before be too frequent indeed yet not systematized that have trained rising generation of percycross politician to believe in political corruption yet escaped that utter turning inside out of men have spoken borough have cost great deal of money certainly a far a knew money have be spent legally have at least always be intention before election be commenced that nothing illegal must be done have doubt always afterwards paid sum of money use of did not quite understand a to of must not fear that have be doubtfully applied final account a to last election have not reached did not expect to be charged with improper expense there doubt must be something for beer be unavoidable a to mr glump knew literally nothing of man have wanted such man assistance twenty vote indeed let look at place upon poll there have be time in day when twenty vote way might be necessary to sir thomas have be told that be so on day of election own position on poll have be so certain to that must not have cared be for have heard that glump be buying vote against considered to be quite out of question that glump must have bought vote for with purpose of serving so mr griffenbottom escaped from adverse counsel from judge there be very little in examination of sir thomas underwood to interest one one really suspected of corrupt practice in such case singular part of matter be that everybody who be concerned who be not concerned really know whole truth be to be investigated yet everybody know can not be substantiated there be not five men in court who be not certain that griffenbottom be corrupt sir thomas be not that borough be rotten a six month old egg glump have acted under one of trigger aide de camp that intimidation be law of borough that beer be used so that men drunk might not fear that sober have not courage to encounter be known to everybody yet up to last be thought by many in percycross that corruption acknowledged transparent egregious corruption must prevail even in presence of judge mr trigger believed to last be not so thought by jacky jorams by serjeant burnabys made final speech leading lawyer on side knew well what be coming at past seven for to so late hour have work be continued judge retired to get cup of tea returned at eight to give award be a follows a to personation of vote there must have be allegation made in regard to charge of intimidation appeared that system prevailed to extent a to make clear to that percycross be unfit to return representative to parliament in matter of treating be not quite prepared to say that have other charge be made must have declared election void of also there have be sufficient to make feel to be duty to recommend to speaker of house of common that further inquiry must be made a to practice of borough a to direct bribery though be not prepared to say that must connect agent of member with what have be done certainly must not connect of two member still quite enough have be proved to make imperative upon to declare election void must do in report to speaker must also advise that commission be held with view of ascertaining whether privilege of returning member of parliament must remain with borough with griffenbottom dealt a tenderly a did with sir thomas sending forth to world unseated indeed a innocent injured men there be night train up to london at pm by on evening sir thomas underwood travelled shaking off from foot a entered carriage dust of most iniquitous borough chapter xlv never give thing up mr neefit conduct during period of disappointment be not exactly what must to have be either in

neefit have sworn that must make young man life burden to burden be already becoming unbearable mr carey have promised to do something must at rate see infatuated breech maker of conduit street in meantime have suggested one remedy of ralph have thought before if be married to one else 'd give up mr carey have suggested that doubt be true ralph completed sojourn at moonbeam leaving that place at end of first week in april took run down to own place then settled up to london for season brother gregory have at time returned to parsonage at newton there be understanding that be to come up to london be brother guest for first fortnight in may ralph heir have taken larger room have spare chamber when ralph have given invitation have expressed determination of devoting spring in town to assiduous courtship of mary bonner at moment in made that assertion down at nuisance of neefit affair be le intolerable to than have since become have spoken cheerily of future prospect declaring to be violently in love with mary though declared at same time that have idea of breaking heart for young woman that last assertion be probably true a for living in great house at priory alone that have declared to be impossible of course must be at home for hunting next winter doubted whether must be there much before time unless certain coming event must make necessary for to go down look after thing thought probable that must take run abroad in july perhaps go to norway for fishing in june be already making arrangement with two other men for move in august might be at home for partridge shooting about middle of september must go into residence at newton before thus have spoken of in describing plan to brother putting great stress on intention to devote spring month to lovely mary gregory have seen nothing wrong in ralph be now rich man be entitled to amuse gregory must have wished that brother must at once make happy among own tenant dependent that doubt must come soon ralph did spend two night at newton after scene with neefit in moonbeam yard just that might see nag safe in new quarter then went up to london be hardly yet strong in heart because trouble a vexed in regard to polly doe almost make man life burden ralph be gifted with much aptitude for throwing trouble behind hardly be yet able to rid of special trouble horrid tradesman be telling story to everybody sir thomas underwood knew story so thought did mary bonner mary bonner in truth did not know have thrown in ralph teeth a accusation against that owed affection to girl ralph utterly forgetful of clarissa now long distant scene on lawn have believed still did believe that mary have referred to polly neefit on th of april established at new room in spring garden be careful in seeing that there be comfortable little bed room for brother greg uncle have now be dead just six month felt a though have be owner of newton estate for year if mr carey must only settle for trouble with mr neefit how happy life must be to be very much in love with mary bonner trouble with mr neefit be of almost more importance to than love for mary bonner in meantime girl be living a usual at popham villa sir thomas be living a usual in southampton building colleague have be unseated have already be decided by house of common that new writ must be at once issued that there must be commission appointed to make extended inquiry at percycross in reference to contemplated disfranchisement of borough there must be possible connexion between inquiry expediency of sir thomas living at home after fashion reconciled further delay to conscience by fact that percycross election be not even yet quite settled doubt must be necessary that must again go to percycross during sitting of commission reader will remember interview between gregory newton clarissa in poor clary have declared with so much emphasis certainty that brother suit to mary must be fruitless have said with artless energy in degree on own behalf be hopeless now in direction have at last taught to feel that man be unworthy lesson have reached though be ignorant not only of manner of teaching of very fact that have be taught have pleaded more than once that men did such thing be yet held in favour forgiven let iniquity have be what might have hoped to move others by doctrine gradually have ceased to be operative even on must not tell how be that passion faded died away can hardly be said that died away became to herself grievous cause of soreness instead of joy triumph no longer said even to herself that be to be excused have come there have made mere plaything of wilfully there be earnestness in manliness hardly common honesty conviction that be so have crept into poor wounded heart in spite of repeated assertion have made to patience a to persistency of own affection first dismay then wrath have come upon when man who ought to be lover came to very house in be living there offered hand to girl almost in very presence have sin be committed elsewhere with rival other than own cousin might have still clung to doctrine of forgiveness because sinner be man because be way of world to forgive men insult have be too close for pardon now wrath be slowly changing to contempt have mary accepted man offer phase of feeling must not have occurred clarissa must have hated woman still might have loved man mary have treated a creature absolutely beneath notice have evidently despised be scorn communicated to clarissa fact that ralph be now newton of newton absolutely in harbour after so many danger of shipwreck assisted in must have be true to though have have penny said to must never have given up though world have be against debt difficulty inheritance squandered idle habit even profligacy must not have torn from heart have possessed one virtue of meaning what said when told that loved remembered noble triumph have felt when declared to mary that other ralph who be to have be mary lover be welcome to fine property sole ambition have be to be loved by man man have be incapable of loving be pretty soft bright on occasion graceful knew so much of herself knew also that mary be far prettier than more clever young man to whom have devoted possessed power of love for individual capability of so joining to human being a to feel that in spite of superiority visible to outside world one must be esteemed by superior to others because of love young man have liked prettiness softness grace feminine niceness seeing one who be prettier more graceful poor clary allowed though be not so sure about softness niceness have changed aim without effort ah how different be poor gregory thought much of gregory reminding that a be sorrow in regard to own crushed hope so be hope too have be crushed because have be so obdurate to have never be false have never whispered word of love to gregory might be that heart be a sore have not be injured a have be injured despised owner of newton priory must scorn must come again to throw at foot gregory must not despise have indeed preferred bad to good there have be lack of judgment there have be on side lack of truth yes have be wrong in choice judgment have be bad yet how glorious have looked a lay upon lawn hot from rowing unbraced brown bold joyous a young god a bade go fetch drink to slake thirst how proud then have be to be ordered by a though mutual intimacy confidence love be sufficient when too be alone together to justify reversal of social rule by man be ordered to wait upon woman there be nothing in first flush of acknowledged love be sweeter to woman than men around be servant in regard to man may have inexpressibly greater pleasure of serving clarissa have now thought much of thing have endeavoured to define to herself what have be gift belonging to ralph have won from heart be not in truth handsomer than brother gregory be certainly le clever be selfish in small thing from habit whereas gregory have thought for own comfort have come from that black coat grave manner of life serious pursuit have be le alluring to than idleness pleasure have suited that young god must be joyous unbraced brown bold thirsty did not know pope famous line lay in be innocent pure unknowing in way of vice simple in taste conscientious in duty yet be rake at heart till at last sorrow disappointment taught that be not enough that man must lie loose upon grass with graceful negligence call for soda water with pleasant voice gregory wore black clothes be sombre be parson oh what thing be that man must be true at heart said nothing of changing feeling to mary even to patience household at time be not very gay joyous sir thomas after infinite vexation have lost seat of have be proud mary bonner condition be not felt to be deplorable a be that of poor clary certainly did not carry a lovelorn maiden of mary bonner may be said that disappointment of kind must affect outward manner must in strait of love be willing to make confidence to discus feeling care of kind might be present to must be lightened if not made altogether a nothing by conviction that such load must be carried in silence without visible sign to world that muscle be overtaxed be known that banished ralph have in moment of expected prosperity declared purpose of giving that have to give to beauty be believed that must have accepted gift have therefore come to pas that name of ralph must be mentioned at cottage that life among maiden be sober sedate melancholy at last there came note from sir thomas to patience will be home to

be so sweet a be know have be like sister to so have be told when came must have be like sister coming only only what said mary assuming purposely savage look that something else intervened of course must be very different must be different have only known few month have known enough to wish to know more closely than anybody else for rest of life mr newton thought have understood before so did said with assumed tone of lachrymose complaint did understand thoroughly understood be rebuked rejected disdained man if be in earnest doe not give over on account indeed there be thing ca give over may tell man that must drink must gamble telling will do good when have once begun will go on with doe that mean love be a strong passion at rate a drinking gambling did tell sent away rebuked because of tradesman daughter what tradesman daughter asked mary have spoken of tradesman daughter gave ample reason why must not address to of course there be ample reason said ralph looking into hat have taken from table one most ample of be that care for said mary resolutely exactly be sort of reason man will do best to conquer misunderstand be not such fool a to think that can prevail in day be not vain enough to think that can prevail at can persist will not be of slightest use indeed can not be allowed will not allow uncle will not allow when told that be untrue to person think that be phrase very likely supposed have heard that stupid story have got round to uncle about mr neefit daughter have heard stupid story what then did mean mary paused moment thinking whether might still be possible that good turn might be done for cousin that clarissa have loved man with whole heart have owned to mary that man have professed love for clary clary have also let know clary love have endured even after blow have received from ralph offer to cousin cousin knew did not know how love have now turned to simple soreness have heard nothing of man daughter said mary well then do know that before came here at have striven to gain affection of cousin clarissa yes clarissa be not so then paused ralph remembered scene on lawn in very truth have never be forgotten there have always be present with when thought of mary bonner sort of remembrance of hour in have played fool with dear clary have kissed well yes with girl kiss mean so much a polly neefit have said to true lover then with others mean just nothing if want to find wife in house have better ask be certainly useless that must ask do mean quite useless asked ralph beginning to be somewhat abashed absolutely useless did not tell something else something must not have hinted to have not be that desired to prevent possibility of renewal of anything so vain think nothing of can be changed with at moment if other thing suit be meant to be severe miss bonner have not deserved from have brought to that admire above others must admire above others be man to change a like because see girl whose hair plea for moment better than doe hers to whom have sworn to be true ralph did not forget at moment to whisper to for own consolation that have never sworn to be true to clarissa indeed did feel that though there have be kiss scene on lawn be being used unfairly to prejudice be afraid be very fickle mr newton that love be not worth much hope may live till learn that have wronged hope so if opinion be worth anything with go back to from whom have allowed to stray in folly to must not address again if do will be insult then rose up queenly in beauty slowly left room there must be end of such be ralph feeling a left room in spite of protestation of constancy persistence have made to fellow have to go on with be refused dozen time by one of proud one have said when do knuckle under go in harness better than others be thus that have thought of mary bonner did not so think of now indeed there be end of there be sort of way of doing show that mean such be inward speech did believe that miss bonner meant by jove yes if word look ever can mean anything how about clarissa if be so a mary bonner have told must be proper kind of thing for to go back to clarissa heart too for have heart be very soft have always be fond of clarissa must not for world that must be unhappy how pretty be how soft how loving how proudly happy must be to be driven about newton ground by a mistress then remembered what gregory have said to how have encouraged gregory to persevere if anything of kind be to happen gregory must put up with be clear that clarissa must marry gregory if be in love with how must look sir thomas in face a thought of laughed sir thomas however must be glad enough to give daughter not to heir to owner of newton who must be that fellow whom mary bonner preferred to with newton to back suit perhaps mary bonner did not know meaning of being mistress of newton priory after while servant came to show to chamber sir thomas have come have gone at once to room so went up stair dressed expecting to see clarissa when assembled before dinner when went down sir thomas be there mary patience not clarissa have summoned back courage spoke jauntily to sir thomas then turned to patience asked after sister clarissa be spending day with mr brownlow said patience will not be home till quite late oh how unfortunate exclaimed ralph taking difficulty into consideration must admit that did not do badly after dinner sir thomas sat longer over wine than be at present usual believing perhaps that young lady must not want to see much more of ralph on present occasion conversation be almost entirely devoted to affair of late election a to ralph be much interested very indignant can not do harm sir by investigation said think can hurt will have satisfaction of knowing that have be mean of exposing corruption of helping to turn such man a griffenbottom out of house upon word think have be worth while be not sure must do again at same cost with same object said sir thomas ralph did have cup of tea given to in drawing room then left villa before clarissa fly have returned chapter xlviii mr moggs walk towards edgeware judge decision in percycross a to late election be sooner known than fresh overture be made to ontario moggs by young men association letter of triumph be addressed to at cheshire cheese in be informed that intimidation corruption have be trodden under foot in infamous person of mr griffenbottom purity right of labour be still watchword of wholesome party in borough be determined to send mr moggs to parliament did not mr moggs think best that must come down at once to borough look after interest now mr moggs junior when received letter have left borough no more than three four day since having be summoned there a witness during trial of petition such continued attendance to political interest of small otherwise uninteresting town without advantage of seat in parliament be felt by mr moggs senior to be nuisance expense in matter fell of course upon shoulder of father believe in humbug no longer said mr moggs senior moggs junior who have felt enthusiasm of young men of percycross who have more to get le to lose than father did believe although have be so lately at percycross went down again again made speech to young men at mechanic institute nothing must be more triumphant than speech nothing more pleasant than popularity must not fail to become aware after further sojourn of three day at percycross of two thing first be that if borough be spared there must be compromise between leading men on two side mr westmacott must be returned together with young griffenbottom second conviction forced upon be that borough must not be spared there be comfort for at percycross other than what arose from pure political conscience on very morning on left besought friend young men though be about to be punished degraded disfranchised for sin of elder though might never be allowed to again to stir for political welfare of own borough still to remember purity right of labour be two great want of world that man must make effort however humble in good cause without doing something towards bringing nearer to that millennium of political virtue be so much wanted must certainly come sooner later be cheered to echo almost carried down to station on shoulder of chairman president secretary left percycross with conviction that borough must never confer upon coveted honour of seat in parliament have happened early in march previous to sunday on mr neefit behaved so rudely to at cottage think a perhaps 'd better stick to business now bit said old moggs at moment ontario be sitting up at high desk behind ledger hated be sticking to business a well a knew how to stick to more cheshire cheese if please young man said father be felt by son to be unfair cruel even corrupt while election be going on a long a there be hope of success at percycross moggs senior have connived at cheshire cheese have said little nothing about business have even consented on one occasion to hear son make speech advocating propriety of combination among workman ai way of thinking moggs senior have said then perhaps be old to have have member of firm in parliament must have be glorious even to old moggs though hardly knew in what glory must have consisted a soon a found that hope be vain that cheshire cheese have be no stepping stone to such honour that money have be spent for nothing mind reverted to old form strike became to work of devil union be once more bane of trade suppose said ontario looking up from ledger if work for bread by day may do a please with evening at rate will continued to say after pausing awhile be best must understand other father moggs senior growled at word son must have be off from rushing about country striving to earn crust a political lecturer moggs knew son well in truth loved dearly there be too miss moggs at home who must give father peace if ontario be turned adrift there be nothing in world so cruel a way in son use natural affection of father obtaining from very feeling power of rebelling against authority must go to devil if please suppose said moggs senior know why say that what do do devilish union be devilish think be godlike said moggs junior after that be silent for while during moggs senior be cutting nail with shoemaker knife by fading light of evening moggs junior be summing up account against favoured aristocrat who seemed to have worn great many boot who be noticeable to ontario chiefly from fact that represented in parliament division of county in percycross be situated thought be going to make straight by marrying that girl said moggs senior here be subject on father son be in unison a to romantic heart of miss moggs at home at shepherd bush always glowed with enthusiasm that brother be in love be to of whom in truth must be owned that be very plain charm of life be fond of poetry must read to brother aloud story of juan haidee melancholy condition of lady who be loved by veiled prophet sympathised with false queen passion for launcelot being in truth ugly old maid very far removed from thing romantic delighted in affair of heart when did not run smooth o ontario must say be true to if be for twenty year so will 'd like to begin twenty year by making mr moggs said ontario now mr moggs senior knew to penny what money old neefit must give daughter placed not slightest trust in threat about smock in stood upright polly must certainly get better of father a ontario always got better of ontario made immediate reply to father found getting wrong among boot shoe have be supplied to aristocratic young member of parliament mean a be off asked moggs senior be off then why go in at why go in at said ontario closing book in hopeless confusion of mind figure 'd give pair of boot in place 'd give business to get kind word from be kind kind yes be kind enough in way be everything just what ought to be be what be go on about father be a much in earnest a can be sha give up till call somebody else husband then why then will just cut go off to uncle in canada have got mind made up about so left shop somewhat uncourteously perhaps have worked way back into father good grace by determination to stick to neefit girl young man ought to be allowed to attend trade union other meeting if will marry girl with twenty thousand pound that evening ontario moggs went to cheshire cheese be greater than ever have be already told how on sunday subsequent to managed to have almost closeted with polly how be working into good grace when be disturbed by mr neefit turned out of house polly heart have be yielding during whole of interview there have come upon once dream that must be fine thing to be lady of newton chance have be hers when set to work to weigh to find out what be that young newton really wanted what ought to want shook off from herself dream before have done injury meant to be married certainly a to that have doubt then ontario moggs be such long legged awkward ugly shambling fellow moggs a name be certainly not euphonious gasfitter be handsome be called yallolegs perhaps be better than moggs have proposed to more than once gasfitter face meant nothing gasfitter have much meaning in a to outside appearance young newton be just what ought to be be dream have shaken off onty moggs have meaning in be man if there be one thing too under sun of polly be quite sure be that onty moggs did really love knew that in heart mind eye of onty moggs possessed divinity made ground stood upon holy ground for now be conviction very pleasant to young woman ontario be very near victory on sunday when told that must compass death of ralph newton if ralph newton be to cause to break heart believed that must do felt obliged to although laughed at when declared to that did know what to do because of love be near to telling what might do when told that must sooner have kiss from than be prime minister believed almost longed to make happy then have tripped giving encouragement did not intend have retreated telling that be silly a said so made up mind that must be perplexed not much longer after in spite of ugliness awkwardness long leg be to be man recognised fact be happy be so much for girl to be sure that be really loved there be word fell from ontario mouth polly did not believe ralph newton speech be very pretty conveyed more than intention to be civil ontario speech really brought home to that word must mean when told father that be quite contented to take just a be without shilling knew that must do so with utmost joy then be that resolved that must have that for future doubtings flirtation coyness must be over have be won lowered flag stick to will do said time meant will said ontario walked way back to london with head among cloud disregarding percycross utterly forgetful of boot aristocrat account regardless almost of cheshire cheese not even meditating new speech in defence of right of labour believed that on day have gained great victory if so life before be one vista of triumph that be what world call romantic have idea have lived now for month on conviction that only chance of personal happiness to be to come from smile kindness love of certain human being whom have chosen to beatify to polly neefit be divine round also there must be halo of divinity if goddess must consent to say that must become wife be impossible that many day must be allowed to pas before made effort to learn from own lip positively meaning of last word have spoken to there be difficulty neefit have warned from house felt unwilling to knock at door of man in man absence who if present must have refused to privilege of admittance that mr neefit must see afford opportunity of pleading cause with polly did not doubt idea that man house being castle must not be invaded in owner absence restrained that man daughter might be dearer choicer more sacred castle of two be true enough then polly be castle a moggs thought ought to belong to rather than to father so resolved to waylay polly weekday from nine in morning till seven in evening be at time due to booby moggs be at present paying debt religiously under conviction that various absence at percycross have be hard upon father for there be in truth booby moggs senior moggs junior constituted whole firm in indeed up to moment moggs junior have recognised share if one be absent other must be present sunday be own polly neefit always went to church nevertheless on first sunday failed failed though saw walking with two other lady though to best of judgment also saw on second sunday be at hendon from ten till three hanging about in lane sitting on gate whiling away time with treatise on political economy have brought down in pocket thinking of polly while strove to confine thought to great subject of man productive industry be there law of nature law of god rather by man have right to enough of food enough of raiment enough of shelter enough of recreation if only will work polly cheek polly lip eager fire of polly eye a must speak elastic beauty of polly gait a must walk drove great question from mind be ever destined to hold polly in arm close close to breast if not then law of nature law of god let be what might must not have be sufficient to protect from cruellest wrong of be a went to afternoon church that hoped to intercept morning church with many be bond afternoon church be virtue of supererogation practised often because there be nothing else to do must be out of question that must induce to give up morning service if must only come upon in afternoon little out of sight of others just a must turn down lane with be acquainted near to stile leading across field towards edgeware might be possible that must prevail a hour came near put useless volume into pocket stationed on spot have selected almost at first moment in have ventured to hope for presence polly turned into lane be six month after occurrence that confessed to that have thought just possible that might be there of course must be there old goose a if jemima have told that 'd be about day never must have come if have quite made up mind then ontario administered to one of bear hug be wont to make polly declare that be ogre be thus that polly made confession after six month a be sitting very close to other on remote point of cliff down on kentish coast at time castle have be altogether transferred out of keeping of mr neefit polly conduct on occasion be not at of nature to make supposed that jemima eye have be so sharp what mr moggs said dear what place to find in be coming to church want just to take turn with for few minute polly be going to church can go to church afterwards be if like ca come to house now have got something must say to something that must say to then polly followed over stile have walked length of nearly two field before ontario have commenced to tell tale of necessity must be told polly though must have known that chance of getting back to church be becoming more more remote waited without impatience want to know said at last whether can ever learn to love what be use mr moggs will be use in world to oh wo ca signify so very much to anybody nothing sometimes think can ever be of use to that a for learning to love man suppose must love man without learning if liked like polly never said did like father mother always used to like polly oh like well enough mr moggs do love then there be pause a stood leaning upon gateway come polly tell fellow do love know then there be pause be in seventh heaven with arm round waist suppose do little whispered polly better than anybody else think mean to have two lover do be to be lover there be father know be not going to be anybody wife because tell must like to vex if must help will never belong to one else never said solemnly then have said what have got to say be happiest man in world may go to church now if like arm be still tight round waist be too late said polly in melancholy tone be doing walk be prolonged not quite to edgeware so far that mr neefit be called upon to remark that parson be preaching very long sermon mr neefit who perhaps have also have communication with jemima remarked that be not to be expected that polly must take ramble with of friend why ca ramble where want to ramble said mr neefit many thing be settled during walk within five minute of time in have declared that be too late for to go to church have brought to talk to with delightful confidence of completed engagement made understand at once that there be longer doubt girl must have time to know said when half reproached with delay girl be like man said who must just make up mind at once girl have to wait see be quite sure of having once said word must never go back from did quite know when have first begun to love thought be when heard that have made up mind to stand for percycross seemed to to be such fine thing going to percycross then said ontario gallantly percycross have done ten time more for than must have done have simply made member of parliament once twice oftener be made happier than must have be have fortune made prime minister for polly now that have given heart promised hand must not coy lip to man have chosen many thing be settled between polly told lover trouble about ralph newton be now that received that advice from very particular friend mr moggs followed in writing to late suitor letter be to be written posted that afternoon then shown to father know already that in making copy for father omitted one clause having resolved that must tell mother of engagement that mother must communicate to father a for naming day for marriage be out of question said did not wish to delay that must do be to swear to father that must never marry anybody else will believe too said polly a for eloping must not hear of just that might have excuse to give money to somebody else said care for money protested moggs be very well money be good thing in way hate man who 'd sell be mean fellow girl money must never be first a for pitching away just because be in hurry believe in at be not going to be old woman yet may wait few month very well walked with direct up to gate leading up to own house so that world might see if world pleased then bade good bye day before very long doubt said when a left asked a to next meeting so polly have engaged know that matter seemed to to be of so much importance a doe to many girl be piece of business have to be done day a have well known for year past now that be done be quite contented with doing of there be not much of ecstasy in bosom be at present moment sending ontario moggs bounding up to town talking a went to to amazement of passer by assuring that have triumphed like alexander caesar made steady resolve to do duty by told again again that nothing must ever move now that have decided a for beauty in man what did signify be honest a for awkwardness what did matter be clever in regard to being gentleman rather thought that liked better because be exactly what people call gentleman sort of home must give to live in nobody must despise in because be not grand enough for place be by mean sure that good deal of misery of kind might not have fallen to lot have become mistress of newton priory when beggar woman became queen how servant must have snubbed said polly to herself that evening showed letter to father have sent minx said yes father be in iron box what business have to write to young man come father have business believe want to break heart said old neefit that evening mother asked what have be doing afternoon just took walk with ontario moggs said polly well have just engaged straight off have better tell father mean to keep to let anybody say anything must go back from promise if be to drag so father may a well know at once chapter xlix among picture norfolk be county by mean devoted to hunting ralph newton disinherited ralph a may call have be advised by of friend round newton to pitch tent elsewhere because of love of sport will get bit of land just a cheap in shire morris have said to if be must go among set of fellow who think of anything in world except partridge mr morris who be very good fellow in way devoted considerable portion of mental physical energy to birth rearing education preservation subsequent use of fox thinking that in so doing employed nobly a country gentleman thoroughly despised county in partridge be worshipped do preserve fox pleaded ralph one man doe next ought to know what mean be most heart breaking kind of thing in world 'd sooner be without fox altogether ride to drag must indeed assertion mr morris made in sadly solemn tone such a men use when speak of adversity fate fortune may be preparing for 'd deal rather die than bear say melancholy friend 'd much sooner put up with crust in corner 'd rather ride to drag must indeed said mr morris with shake of head low sigh a for life without riding to hound at mr morris did not for moment suppose that friend contemplated existence ralph have made up mind that in going out into world to do something fox must not be first object have to seek home certainly more important than home be work to must give a have once said knew nothing useful that must do except till land so went down into norfolk among intermittent fox preserver took beamingham hall almost place in norfolk be ham almost house be hall there be parish of beamingham four mile from swaffham lying between tillham soham reepham grindham be down in map be a flat a pancake have church with magnificent square tower new chancel there be resident parson there be four five farmer in be under plough throughout be famous for turnip parish belongs to big lord who life in county who doe preserve fox not with heart two other farm be owned by yeoman who farm men who have be brought up to shoot who hate very name of hunting beamingham hall be to be sold by beginning of may ralph newton have bought beamingham little wood belonged to estate a contained about thirty acre ralph determined that must endeavour to have fox there by middle of may have be four month in new home house be not bad be spacious room though low be large have be built with considerable idea of architectural beauty window be set in stone mullioned long low window very beautiful in form have fifteen year back be filled with multitude of small diamond pane now diamond pane have given way to plate glass there be three gable to hall facing old fashioned large garden in fruit tree came close up to house that perhaps ought to have be lawn be almost orchard there be trim gravel walk trim flower bed trim fish pond small walled kitchen garden with very old peach very old apricot very old plum plum however be at present better than peach apricot fault of house a modern residence consisted in that farm yard with appurtenance be very close to back door ralph told when first saw that mary bonner must never consent to live in house so placed for whom be such house a beamingham hall originally built house not grand enough for squire mansion too large for farmer homestead such house throughout england be much more numerous than englishman think still in good repair a be beamingham hall going into decay under lessened domestic want of present holder be especially so in eastern county may be taken a one proof among many that broad acred squire with throng of tenant be comparatively modern invention country gentleman of two hundred year ago farmed land held a year have rolled on strong have swallowed weak one strong man having eaten up dozen weak men so squire have be made then strong squire becomes baronet lord till lord little too much manchester warehouseman buy out strength of country probably lie in fact that change be ever being made be never made suddenly to ralph great objection to beamingham hall lay in fear rather certainty that must not be made fitting home for mary bonner when first decided on taking even when decided on buying assured that mary bonner taste might be quite indifferent to in first place have written to uncle to withdraw claim a soon a found that newton must never belong to then have be told by happy owner of newton that mary be still to be asked to share throne of principality when so told have said nothing of own ambition have felt that there be reason why must leave newton neighbourhood for a bachelor beamingham hall must be only too good house a farmer did not mean to be ashamed of own dunghill by middle of may have heard nothing either of namesake of mary bonner did correspond with gregory newton thus received tidings of parish of church of horse even of fox of heir matrimonial intention heard nothing gregory did write of own visit to metropolis past future ralph knew that young parson must again singe wing in flame be burning at popham villa nothing be said of heir through march april that trouble respecting polly neefit be continued gregory in letter of course did not speak of neefits at last may be come ralph from beamingham made up mind that also must go up to london have be hard at work during last four month doing wonderfully attractive thing with new property man can do when have money in pocket knocking down hedge planting young tree preparing for planting of buying stock building preparing to build shed rest of there be hardly pleasure in life equal to of laying out money with conviction that will come back again conviction ala be so often ill founded pleasure be same in regard to house must hing not even form plan a yet might be possible that taste other than own must be consulted in second week in may went up to london having heard that gregory must be there at same time at once found consorting with namesake almost a much a with parson be now month since heir have be dismissed from popham villa have not since date renewed visit from day to present have seen sir thomas can not be said with exact truth that be afraid of sir thomas ashamed to see girl have idea that have behaved badly to anybody if have be almost disposed to make amends for such sin by marrying clarissa felt must ultimately make up mind in clarissa favour little time must elapse for gradual cure of former passion doubt placed reliance on position a man of property feeling by strength in direction must be pulled through little difficulty be unconscious reliance believed that be perfectly free from what must have called dirt littleness of purse pride acre pride must on occasion assert that really thought nothing of because be newton of newton meant to be true nevertheless in bottom of heart there be confidence that might do that because of acre among thing might be thus done must not otherwise have be done be return to clarissa after little lapse in regard to mary bonner be delighted to welcome ralph from norfolk to pleasure of metropolis must put down ralph name at famous carlton of have lately become member ralph already belonged to old fashioned club of father have be long member declined new honour a for ball evening crush large dinner party norfolk ralph thought to be unsuited for just at present because of father death be not for nephew of dead man to tell son eight month of mourning for father be more than world now required must only take excuse suggest play little dinner at richmond small party to maidenhead a compromise know that there be good in fellow being so heavy in hand because father be dead squire said to brother be so much to other pleaded gregory in return squire accepted excuse offered namesake horse for park must make one of party for moor in august squire asserted that have room for gun without entailing additional expense upon indeed be not strictly true a have be arranged that cost must be paid per gun there be vacancy still ralph heir being quite willing to pay for cousin thought harm to cover generosity under venial falsehood disinherited one however declined offer with many thanks there be nothing old fellow must do for if knew how said happy heir whereupon norfolk ralph unconsciously resolved that must accept nothing a little a possible at hand of squire happened during three four first day of sojourn in london in hardly knew why have gone neither to villa to sir thomas in southampton building meant to do so from day to day put off a regarded lady at villa three young men now never spoke to other respecting gregory believed that brother have failed so believing did not recur to subject gregory have already be at fulham once twice since arrival in town have nothing to say at least did say nothing of what happened there intended to remain away from parish for more than parson normal thirteen day be by mean sure that must make further formal offer when at villa found that clarissa be sad sober almost silent knew that something be wrong hardly occurred to to believe that after might perhaps cure evil one morning early gregory ralph from norfolk be together at royal academy although be not yet ten when entered gallery room be already so crowded that be difficult to get near line almost impossible to get into to get out of corner gregory have be there before knew picture also be supposed by friend to understand something of subject whereas ralph did not know cooke from hook possessed more than dim idea landseer painted wild beast millais little child be fine picture said pointing up at enormous portrait of master of b b in red coat seated square on seventeen hand high horse with hat off favourite hound of pack around be by grant said gregory know care for kind of thing be a like a can stare said ralph who appreciated red coat well groomed horse finely shaped hound backed few step to see picture better found encroaching upon lady dress turned round found that lady be mary bonner together with be clarissa patience underwood greeting between be pleasant girl be unaffectedly pleased to find friend whom knew well enough to accept a guide monitor in room now will be told about everything said clarissa a young parson shook hand first with sister then with do take round to best dozen mr newton be way like to begin tone be completely different from what have be down at villa gentleman in red coat be cousin favourite said gregory care bit about said clarissa be because hunt said ralph wish hunted said mary bonner mary when first saw man of whom have once be told that be to be lover when so told have at least be proud that be so chosen felt that be blushing slightly recovered instantly greeted a though there have be no cause whatever for disturbance be struck almost dumb at seeing be tranquillity restored to composure after first greeting be over found walking by side without effort on part to avoid while gregory two sister went on in advance poor ralph have not word to say about picture have be long in london asked just four day heard that be coming did think that perhaps cousin might find morning to come down see cousin gregory mean of course will come uncle will be so glad to see only know ca always find at home so will patience be great favourite with patience have gone down to live in norfolk have yes in norfolk have bought estate there just one farm look after be estate miss bonner just farm house with barn stable horse pond rest of be by mean fair account of place suited so to speak of day for having estate be quickly brought to close be not said with little laugh then hated for having spoken so foolishly doe that make unhappy mr newton asked did not answer at once continued must have thought that be above being made unhappy by such disappointment carry many thing with of people outside see nothing be true doubt man may be separated from friend have in world by such change of circumstance have not thought of beg pardon said looking into face almost imploringly there may be worse than that said of course knew what meant did not know how much knew be easy to say that man must stand up against revers there be revers man can not bear without suffering have quite made up mind that one reverse of be thinking must be cured must take prominent step towards curing yet that step must be taken sooner later be resolved might be taken now indeed if must only speak out quite understood that must not speak out now because house down in norfolk be more than farm did mean to trouble with nonsense said doe trouble at of course will tell everything when come to see there be very little to tell unless care for cow pig sheep horse do care for cow pig sheep horse said same be not pleasant subject of conversation man may do a much good with single farm a can with large estate ca make affair a interesting to other people there be present to own mind knowledge that rich namesake be rival in regard to affection of beautiful girl must not avoid allusion to own inferiority yet own word a soon a be spoken have sounded in ear be recognised by a being mean pitiful a whining word sorry plaint against trick fortune have played did not know how to tell boldly that lamented change from estate to farm because have hoped that must share one with did not dare even to ask to share other understood down to look of displeasure crossed face a felt possible effect of own speech understood must not give much help a yet there might perhaps come moment in must explain to own idea about farm estate reason in accordance with might be selected rejected have seen much of ralph newton lately asked other ralph of cousin yes only call so have right to call cousin see much of be said in tone of voice ought to have sufficed for curing anxiety in ralph bosom respecting rival have not be sore nervous a must be admitted almost stupid in matter must not have gathered from tone that namesake be at least favourite with miss bonner used to be great deal at popham villa said ralph see often now fancy there have be cause of displeasure between uncle brother have be with once twice do like mr gregory newton be best fellow ever lived exclaimed ralph with energy so much nicer than brother said mary though perhaps ought not to say so to at rate must not be satisfactory to like said love greg dearly have lived together like brother for year whereas be only quite lately that have known other be only lately that have known seem to to be so different be not that wonderfully beautiful picture mr newton ca almost fancy sitting down throwing stone into river dabbling foot in be very pretty said not caring penny for picture have river at beamingham there be muddy little brook that must almost jump over must want to dabble in have got name think call wissey be not at river to be proud of except in way of eel water rat be there nothing to be proud of at beamingham there be church tower be church tower be something meant a to beamingham hall that word hall misleads people said ralph be kind of upper class farm house with lot of low room intricate passage chamber here there smelling of apple huge kitchen oven big enough for small dinner party must like oven laundry dairy cheese house only never make cheese horse pond dung hill cabbage garden be that can say for new purchase mr newton house be ugly come be better might be made fairly comfortable if there be use in doing of course there will be use know that there will said ralph sometimes think one thing sometimes one week be full of scheme about new garden conservatory bow window to drawing room then next week think that two room live in at present will be enough for stick to conservatory mr newton here be girl suppose be about time for to go mary where have be said clarissa looking at landscape said mary mr newton have shown picture worth seeing described everything have have to look at catalogue once be just what like at academy know whether have be a lucky have have great deal described to too said mary be afraid have forgotten particular duty brought here then parted two men promising that must be at villa before long girl preparing for return home that cousin of theirs be certainly

want to marry daughter ca oblige let have what want to eat drink get rid of if can send for police be smashing thing must save a many a can so saying hurried down stair out of house what be to do next if mr neefit chose to carry out threat by staying in room mr neefit must be allowed to have own way if chose to amuse by breaking thing thing must be broken if got very drunk might probably be taken home in cab deposited at cottage at hendon what must ralph do at moment sauntered sadly down st james street with hand in trouser pocket finding crawling hansom at palace gate got into ordered man to drive down to fulham have already made up mind about dear little clary thing might a well be done at once none of girl be at home miss underwood miss bonner have gone up to london to see sir thomas

did not use to think so said mr brownlow then door be opened ralph be announced with usual easy manner with unabashed grace clarissa used to think so charming soon explained that have be to fulham have have driven back to bolsover house because clarissa be there clarissa a heard felt blood tingle in cheek manner now did not seem to to be so full of grace be not selfishness mr brownlow purred out applause be not to be supposed that came to see old woman coming to see young woman with adequate intention be quite proper thing for young man to do be just going to take lunch of course must stop lunch with declared that must like nothing better mr brownlow rang bell gave little order clarissa thought referred quickly to various matter to scene on lawn to certain evening on have walked home with from very house to confession have made to sister to confidence with cousin then to offer have be made to mary now only few week since looked at though did not seem to be looking at told that man be nothing to have caused unutterable sorrow with heart be still sore be nothing to must eat lunch with endeavour to talk to le might see of henceforth better be selfish heartless weak unworthy lunch be eaten within three minute afterwards mr brownlow be away a be returning to little parlour in have be sitting during morning contrived to escape ralph found alone with dear darling little clary in spite of graceful ease task before be not without difficulty clarissa of course knew that have proposed to mary probably knew that have proposed to polly mary have told that clarissa be devoted to have told at least that amounted to almost a much then be incumbent on to do something might put end to neefit abomination clarissa must be contented to look back upon episode with mary bonner a dream meant nothing just a be already learning to look at clary said have hardly seen to speak to since night walked home together from house indeed mr newton said hitherto have always called ralph did not observe change having too many thing of own to think of at moment how much have happened since very much indeed mr newton yet seems to be such short time ago almost yesterday poor uncle be alive then yes be did not seem to be getting nearer to object by reference to past event clary said there be many thing wish to have forgotten perhaps must have forgiven suppose be so with of said clarissa just so though know that of have ever be so absurdly foolish a have throwing away what be of greatest value in world for sake of something seemed to be precious just for moment be very difficult already began to feel that nature of girl be altered towards have suddenly become hard undemonstrative almost unkind hitherto have always regarded without much conscious thought about a soft sweet pleasant thing might at moment be for asking mary bonner have told that ought to ask now be willing to beseech pardon to be in very truth lover to share with prosperity must give assistance in difficulty be determined that must speak trusting to mr brownlow absence sat still waiting for hope have thrown away nothing that ought to keep said at last seems to that have got everything no not a yet everything know whether will ever get that desire most of course understood now sat hard fixed stern so absolutely unlike clarissa whom have known since be hardly more than child together know what mean clarissa said fear mean that can not forgive have nothing to forgive oh yes have whether will ever forgive can not say there be much to forgive very much cousin mary for short moment ran away with be welcome for what do mean clarissa just what say be welcome for have taken nothing prize indeed think have condescended to take anything anything of sort mean mary love other dearly there be danger of quarrelling come clary got up a spoke stood over close to shoulder understand well enough what mean have known other so long think have loved other so well that ought to say that will forgive have be foolish have be wrong have be false if will can not forgive not for moment be there look of forgiveness in eye sign of pardon in line of face in heart there be contest something of old passion remained there though be no more than soreness have caused for moment thought whether might not be a must have if so how must again look of friend in face admit that have surrendered to so much unworthiness how must tell patience who be beginning to be full of renewed hope for gregory how must confess such weakness to father how must stand up before mary bonner be possible that must really give whole life future hope to one so weak worthless a man there be nothing to forgive said certainly can not forget know that love protested love with what sort of love doe not matter there need be further talk about love to can be nothing clarissa to will be quite a little heart will never suffer much ralph how long be since offered hand to cousin only that be just boy playing at love must be insult then saw old friend through window mr brownlow said mr newton be going be ready for walk whenever please think of twice clarissa must be end of pleaded ralph a far a be concerned must be end of when get home will probably find that have already made offer to patience then got up took hat having shaken hand cordially with mr brownlow through window went out to hansom cab be earning sixpence quarter of hour out on road while have be so absolutely wasting quarter of hour within house have said anything dear asked mr brownlow have said great deal well dear be empty vain inconstant man be clarissa yet be so good humoured so gay so pleasant that see why must not make very good husband to girl what do mean clarissa have not refused did not say have offered did have if did then refused be good natured have more heart than log of wood talk about more dear mr brownlow dare say will be friend again before long will almost forget everything that said morning throughout afternoon be gay almost happy before went home have made up mind that must tell patience then get rid of from thought for ever not to tell patience must be breach of faith between must moreover render future sisterly intercourse between very difficult have be possible must have avoided expression of triumph without must be almost impossible for to tell story within own bosom certainly there be triumph man for whose love have sighed be sick have surrendered to at last prize have be at foot have not chosen to lift poor ralph said to herself mean to do a well a can be so feeble certainly must not tell mary bonner must say word to father when must meet ralph again a did not doubt that must meet shortly must be very careful to give sign that be thinking of disgrace must still be called ralph till be married man when must come to pas that be about to marry must congratulate with warmth of old friendship night did tell to patience mean said have not done right be sure have done quite right then why be so sober about patty only if do love must give right hand clary that might have will make happy in life if be to give right left hand too marriage with ralph newton must not make happy think of

wallowing in greedy of work who go to almost a drunkard go to bottle gambler to gaming table be not unhappy men though be perhaps apt to make around unhappy such one be not sir thomas underwood again there be men fewer in number who will work though hate from sheer conscience from conviction that idleness will not suit make happy strong men be one certainly be not sir thomas underwood then there be who love idea of work want fibre needful for doing may be that one will earn bread a sir thomas underwood have earned not flinching from routine task even from healthy effort necessary for

vague contemplation be so much easier than forming of steady purpose be one of almost sultry day do come to occasionally amidst ordinary inclemency of london may be sitting with window open though there be fire in grate a sat dreaming rather than thinking there came upon ear weak wailing puny sound of distant melancholy flute have heard often before have be roused by to evil wish sometimes even to evil word against musician be effort of youth in direction of staple inn to soothe with music savageness of own bosom be borne usually on evening air on occasion idle swain have taken up instrument within hour two of early dinner melody be burdened with peculiar tune consisted of few low wailing melancholy note such a may be extracted from reed by breath slow raising falling of little finger

whew to to whew to to whew to whew on present occasion variation be hardly carried beyond so much be repeated with persistency at last seemed to burden whole air round southampton building little thing might have be excluded by closing of window sir thomas though suffered did not reflect for while whence suffering came who doe not know how such sound may serve to enhance bitterness of remorse to add sorrow to present thought to rob future of hope there come upon a grow up in year hour in be impossible to keep down conviction that everything be vanity that life past have be vain from folly that life to come must be vain from impotence be presence of thought such a need assurance of heaven to save thinker from madness from suicide be when feeling of pervading vanity be strongest on that who doubt of heaven most regret incapacity for belief if there be nothing better than on to grave nothing worse beyond grave why must bear such fardel sir thomas a sat there listening thinking unable not to think not to listen found that fardel be very heavy what good have come to of life to to others what further good did dare to promise to have not be vanity be not vain to now at present be not life becoming to vainer still vainer day have promised once that book must be solace of age be beginning to hate book because knew that did no more than trifle with have found driven to attempt to escape from back into public life have failed have be inexpressibly dismayed in failure while failing have promised that must rush at work on return to privacy to quiet be still a shivering coward who stand upon brink can not plunge in among bather then there be sadness beyond even deeper than why must have dared to arrange for life different from life of ordinary men woman who lived around why

packing book there be company at villa besides sir thomas three girl two young men a to clarissa patience said not word even to father must still be left till time must further cure wound have be made did venture to suggest in private with sir thomas that be pity that who be certainly more worthy of two ralphs must not be made to understand that others did not think so much of present inferiority of position in world a seemed to think mean that mary must take asked sir thomas why must not if like be very good ca tell to offer to without telling also that must be accepted suppose not said patience nevertheless sir thomas did speak to ralph newton before dinner stuttering muttering only half finishing sentence have correspondence once mr newton dare say remember remember very well sir thomas only wanted to tell seem to think more about what have taken place mean a to property than do be than do have made change yes of course know that large place like newton be sure to make man happy perhaps 'd like to wash hand before dinner gregory in meantime be walking round garden with mary clarissa dinner be very quiet pleasant cheerful sir thomas talked good deal so did patience mary

decanter be put upon table then withdrew sir thomas immediately began to talk about newton priory to ask question might interest parson without a thought hurting feeling of disinherited ralph went on for about five minute during gregory be very eloquent about church people when suddenly ralph rose from chair withdrew have said anything annoyed asked sir thomas anxiously be not that think said gregory ralph walked across passage opened door of drawing room in three girl be at work walked up to chair in mary bonner be sitting said something in so low voice that of sister heard certainly will said mary rising from chair patience glanced round must see that colour always present in cousin face be heightened ever so little indeed still tell tale blush have told tale ralph stood for moment while mary moved away to door then followed without speaking word to other girl bestowing glance on of be going to propose to said clarissa a soon a door be shut one can be sure said patience only fancy asking girl to go out of room in brave manner must have gone because be coward be just what mary will like let get hat mr newton said mary taking opportunity to trip up stair though hat be hanging in hall when be in room merely stood upright there for minute in middle of chamber erect stiff with arm finger stretched out thinking how must behave minute sufficed for to find clue then came down a quickly a foot must carry have opened front door be standing outside upon gravel there joined have other way of speaking to said dislike coming out at answered then there be silence for moment two a walked along into gloom of shrubbery suppose be going down to norfolk soon said quite know thought of going to morrow so soon a have got something want to settle think must know what be then paused again almost a though expected to confess that did know mary be well aware that be not for to say word till have fully explained in most open detail what be that desired to settle know good deal of history miss newton when thought thing be going well with much better than have ever allowed to expect in early day became acquainted with again paused have not word to say dare say be not told wrote to uncle then asking whether might have consent to just to ask to be wife again paused after that hurried on speaking word a quickly a must throw forth from mouth father died of course changed everything told uncle that ground for pretension might have have before be cut from under knew circumstance of birth supposed that must know also then did speak yes did said perhaps be foolish to think that property must make difference truth of be have not got over feeling will never get over love with heart though be for good must tell so property can make difference said ought to have known that mr newton ah doe tried to tell other day something of present home yes know did remember there be nothing more to be said only to ask to share with walked on with in silence for minute said nothing more to press suit certainly be turn to speak now will share with said pressing arm upon mary yes mary if please then took in arm pressed to bosom kissed lip forehead threw back hat put finger among hair why did say that property must make difference asked in whisper to made answer walked on silently with arm round waist till came out from among tree stood upon bank of river there be people in boat must put arm down said wonder how will like to be farmer wife asked have not idea fear so much that will find rough hard have idea about something took hand looked up into face a continued have idea will like to be wife be in seventh heaven of happiness must have stood there gazing on river with night if must have allowed at last walked back into house together into room where others be assembled with very little outward show of embarrassment mary be first to enter room though blushed smiled also one knew what have taken place there be secret mystery in five minute cousin be congratulating be settled for now said clarissa laughing yes be settled for now must have unsettled for world while be being said in drawing room being said even in presence of poor gregory who must not have felt how hard be for to behold such bliss sir thomas ralph have withdrawn into opposite room ralph began to apologise for own misfortune misfortune in having lost inheritance misfortune in being illegitimate sir thomas soon cut apology short think great deal more of than doe than do said sir thomas if doe not regard will never think of again said ralph greatest glory in what have be promised be in thinking that might help to win have won without such help a said sir thomas with arm on young man shoulder there be delicious hour in store for a sat over late tea do still think of going to norfolk to morrow said to with composure in be so beautiful at same time so expressive by early train in morning thought that perhaps might have stayed day now thought that perhaps might want to come back again said ralph if so must make arrangement perhaps for week ten day do come back said do stay ralph triumph a returned that evening to london received gregory fullest sympathy still must have be hard to bear perhaps cousin parting word contained for comfort give little time will be yours yet will find out from mary may be sure will help chapter lv cookham have be obliged to anticipate in degree course of story by necessity weighed upon of completing history of polly neefit in regard to will only further express opinion in believe that will have concurrence of reader that mr moggs junior have chosen well story must not be adequately told without revelation of correspondence while have explained friendly manner in neefit newton embarrassment be at last brought to end have at same time disclosed future lot in life of hero a far a hero lot in life may be said to depend on marriage mr neefit have be almost heart broken because be not satisfied that victim be really punished by of torture imagination invented energy executed even when pretty little man be smashed be in truth smashed of malice prepense by swinging blow from neefit umbrella neefit did not feel satisfied that must thereby reach victim heart must project own mind with sufficient force into bosom of enemy to understand that onion tobacco consumed in luxurious chamber must cause annoyance desired more than annoyance wanted to tear very heart string of young man who have a thought so signally outwitted did not believe that be successful in truth did make poor ralph very unhappy heir felt to be wounded must not eat drink walk talk ride in park play billiards at club in manner befitting owner of newton priory be so injured by neefit that became pervious to attack must otherwise have altogether failed in reaching lady eardham must never have prevailed against a did conquering by quick repetition of small blow have not strength be annihilated for time by persecution of breech maker lady eardham whispered to a be taking departure on evening of dinner in cavendish square dear mr newton just one word said confidentially must be very horrid man alluding to mr neefit be horrid bore know lady eardham just so make feel a though did quite know whether something ought not to be done must mind calling at eleven to morrow of course sha tell sir george unless think ought to be told ralph promised that must call though felt at moment that lady eardham be interfering old fool why must want to do anything why must give even hint a to telling sir george a walked across hanover square down bond street to room did assert to plainly that old harridan a called be at work for second girl shook head winked eye a thought of even in solitude did not feel strong against lady eardham moved along pavement oppressed by half formed conviction that ladyship must prevail against did not however think that have particular objection to gu eardham there be deal of style about girl merit in clarissa mary must have be sadly deficient there must be doubt in that man in position ought to marry in own class proper thing for to do be to make daughter of country gentleman of nobleman just a might happen mistress of priory dear little clary must hardly have known how to take place properly down in hampshire then thought for moment of polly perhaps after fate fashion fortune managed marriage for young men better than must manage for what life must have be have really married polly neefit though did call lady eardham harridan resolved that must keep promise for following morning lady eardham when arrived be mysterious eulogistic beneficent be clearly of opinion that something must be done know be so horrid having kind of thing said yet be almost equally strong in opinion that nothing must be done know must have girl name brought up for world though why horrid wretch must have named can not even guess horrid wretch have not in truth named special though suited lady eardham to presume allusion have be made to hope of flock that crowning glory of eardham family that most graceful of grace venus certain to be chosen by paris second daughter gu went on to explain that be to tell story to son marmaduke son marmaduke must probably kill breech maker a marmaduke eardham be of young men about town perhaps most careless most indifferent least ferocious mother be probably mistaken in estimate of resentful feeling a for sir george must be for taking law of wretch for libel then must be know where must be then dear girl must die of course there be nothing done during whole interview lady eardham continued to press neefit letter under hand upon table a though be of document most precious handled a though to tear must be a bad a to tear original document bearing king signature before interview be over have locked up in desk a though there be something in by whole eardham race might be blessed banned though spoke such word certainly gave ralph to understand by letter ralph newton be in mysterious manner so connected with secret interest sanctity of eardham family that whether such connection might be for weal woe newton eardhams must never altogether free from link perhaps have better come dine with in family way to morrow said lady eardham giving invitation a though must necessarily be tendered almost necessarily accepted ralph not thanking taking in same spirit said that must be there at half past seven just ourselves said lady eardham in melancholy tone a though two be doomed to eat family dinner together for ever after suppose property be really own said lady eardham to husband that afternoon sir george be stout plethoric gentleman with short temper many trouble marmaduke be expensive sir george have spent money when be young girl who knew that have fortune expected that everything must be done for at least during period of natural harvest be successful in having expectation realised demanded that there must be horse to ride servant to attend dress to wear have horse servant dress there be also younger child sir george be quite a anxious a lady eardham that daughter must become wife own of course be own who else must belong to there be something about other young man bastard be greatest sin that ever be thought of to palm fellow a off on county did come to anything be told too have be very extravagant doubt did

post envelope from sir thomas underwood containing letter addressed to from mr neefit sir be going to make ward act honourable to daughter yours respectful thomas neefit reader will understand that be prior to polly triumph over father ralph uttered deep curse made up mind that must either throw entirely among eardhams else start at once for rocky mountain dined in cavendish square that day again took gu down to dinner be very glad to see here said sir george when two be alone together after lady have left sir george who have be pressed upon home service because of necessity of occasion be

air expecting everything have refused clergyman with very good private fortune greatly to mother sorrow gu have already be source of much weary labour four eldest son have be brought to foot be allowed to slip away a lady eardham said because gu must joke with other young men while one man must have received pleasantry emily be quite of opinion that young newton must by mean have be allotted to gu lady eardham who have played besique with energy against josephine must have mutinied that promise be made a to marwill snelgrove must see from little table that young newton be abject triumphant in manner have not received have even asked when got up to take leave lady eardham must have boxed ear smiled upon ineffably pressed hand in most natural way in world alluded to former allusion about riding park sha ride to morrow said gu with back turned to do said ralph sha see what say lady eardham said ralph promised must before dinner dear said lady eardham ought not to change mind if will be good natured enough to come two of will go of course be understood that must come nothing on earth mamma will ever induce to play besique again said josephine yawning be not worse for than for said old lady sharply be fair said josephine who be supposed to be clever one of family may have to play besique quarter of century hence be insufferable puppy said emily who have come into

course be there just at time neefit persecution be at worst letter directed by various hand came to daily in of be asked when meant to be on square knew meaning of picnic a well a doe reader a well a

said that be fit to be delineated a hero be thought by many critic that in picture of imaginary life novelist produce for amusement possibly for instruction of reader none must be put upon canvas very good who by noble thought deed may lead others to nobility very bad who by declared wickedness will make iniquity hideous how can be worth one while such critic will say writer here speaks of critical reader not of professional critic how can be worth while to waste imagination sympathy time upon one a ralph heir of newton property writer acknowledging force of objection confessing that young hero of romance be seldom heroic make apology a follows reader of novel who have doubtless taken volume up simply for amusement who must probably lay down did suspect that instruction like snake in grass like physic beneath sugar be to be imposed upon requires from author chiefly that will be amused by narrative in elevated sentiment prevails gratified by being made to feel that elevated sentiment
