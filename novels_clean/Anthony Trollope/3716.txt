who did not wish well to cause for italy be be still contending a also there be hardly one who doe not now regard cause a well nigh triumphant nevertheless be almost impossible to sympathise with mr talboys a mackinnon said flew so high that there be comfort in flying with well said brown rest of be down below will go join poor brown how be that in speaking of trouble be led on to heart stirring theme yes have seen sweet angel tell also have seen mother insisted on going to when heard history from what be like mr talboys well education have done more for of than for others there be from whose moral sentiment might thankfully draw lesson whose manner outward gesture be not such a custom have made agreeable to know can understand have seen feel sure that be pure in heart high in principle have not sacrificed be not self sacrifice surest guarantee for true nobility of character must mr mackinnon object to bringing together mackinnon be obliged to declare that thought wife must object from time forth mr talboys ceased to be very close in friendship still came to house sunday evening still refreshed at fountain of literary rill special prophecy from henceforth be poured into other ear so happened that o'brien now became chief ally remember that troubled much further with cherub angel with mother be inclined to think that taking up warmly a did story of o'brien matrimonial wrong forgot little history of brown be that a may mr talboys o'brien now became strictly confidential must enlarge by half hour together on misery of friend position to one whom must get to hear will tell what fanny mackinnon said to wife one day to wife to mine for be together will have row in house if take care o'brien will be making love to mr talboys nonsense said mr mackinnon be always thinking that somebody be going to make love to one somebody always be said be old enough to be mother said mr mackinnon what doe matter to irishman said mackinnon besides doubt if there be more than five year difference between there must be more than said wife ida talboys be twelve know be not quite sure that ida be eldest if have son in guard must make difference said mackinnon there be men who consider bound to make love to woman under certain circumstance let age of lady be what may o'brien be such one if sympathises with much oftener will mistake matter go down on knee ought to put on guard said addressing to wife indeed will do such thing said if be two fool must like other fool pay price of folly a rule there must be softer creature than mr mackinnon seemed to that tenderness never extended in direction of mr talboys just at time towards end be of november made party to visit tomb lie along appian way beyond most beautiful of sepulchre tomb of cecilia metella be delicious day have driven along road for couple of mile beyond wall of city enjoying most lovely view neighbourhood of rome affords looking over wondrous ruin of old aqueduct up towards tivoli palestrina of environs of rome be on fair clear day most enchanting here perhaps among world of tomb thought almost memory of old old day come upon one with greatest force grandeur of rome be best seen understood from beneath wall of coliseum beauty among pillar of forum arch of sacred way history fall become more palpable to mind more clearly realised out here among tomb where eye rest upon mountain whose shade be cool to old roman a to than anywhere within wall of city here look out at same tivoli same praeneste glittering in sunshine embowered among far off valley be dear to blue mountain have not crumbled away into ruin within rome can see nothing a saw party consisted of dozen fifteen person a hamper with luncheon in have be left on grassy slope at base of tomb of cecilia metella expedition have in something of nature of picnic mr talboys be of course with ida talboys o'brien also be there hamper have be prepared in mr mackinnon room under immediate eye of mackinnon therefore be regarded a dominant spirit of party wife be leagued with mr mackinnon a be usually case there seemed to be general opinion among who be closely in confidence together that something must happen in o'brien talboys matter two have be inseparable on previous evening for mr talboys have be urging on young irishman counsel respecting domestic trouble sir cresswell cresswell have told be refuge why must soul submit to bond world have now declared to be intolerable divorce be not now privilege of dissolute rich spirit be incompatible need no longer be compelled to fret beneath same cobble in short have recommended to go to england get rid of wife a must with little encouragement have recommended man to get rid of anything be sure that have be skilfully brought on to subject might have be induced to pronounce verdict against such ligature for body a coat waistcoat trowsers aspiration for freedom ignored bound in theory there be barrier be not willing to demolish poor o'brien a now began to see have taken matter amiss have offered to make bust of mr talboys have consented expressing wish that might find place among who have devoted to enfranchisement of fellow creature really think have little of woman customary personal vanity know have idea that eye be lighted up in warmer moment by special fire that spark of liberty shone round brow that bosom heaved with glorious aspiration feeling have reference to inner genius not to outward beauty o'brien misunderstood woman thought necessary to gaze into face sigh a though heart be breaking indeed declared to young friend mr talboys be perfect in style of beauty began bust with idea be gradually becoming clear to that must bring to grief in such matter who can caution man mr mackinnon have contrived to separate in making carriage arrangement on day only added fuel to fire be now burning within o'brien bosom believe that really did love her in easy eager susceptible irish way that must get over little episode without serious injury to heart one doubted then what must occur when declaration be made how must mr talboys bear deserves said mr mackinnon twice a much wife added why be that woman be so spiteful to other early in day mr talboys clambered up to top of tomb made little speech holding parasol over head beneath foot said reposed ash of bloated senator glutton of empire who have swallowed into maw provision necessary for tribe old rome have fallen through such selfishness a new rome must not forget lesson be very well then o'brien helped down after there be separating for own part must sooner have have mackinnon at elbow mackinnon now have found other elbow enough of be a good a feast have said to wife therefore mr talboys quite unconscious of evil allowed to be engrossed by o'brien then about three o'clock returned to hamper luncheon under such circumstance always mean dinner arranged for very comfortable meal to who know tomb of cecilia metella description of scene be necessary to who description will convey fair idea of reality be large low tower of great diameter of beautiful proportion standing far outside city close on to side of old roman way have be embattled on top by latter day baron in order that might be used for protection to castle have be built on attached to if remember rightly be done by one of frangipani very lovely ruin have made of know castellated old tumble down residence in italy more picturesque than baronial adjunct to old roman tomb better tally with idea engendered within mind by mr radcliffe mystery of udolpho lie along road protected on side of city by proud sepulchre of roman matron up to long ruined wall of back of building stretch grassy slope at bottom of be remains of old roman circus beyond be long thin graceful line of claudian aqueduct with soracte in distance to left tivoli palestine frascati lying among hill bound view that frangipani baron be in right of hope got value of money out of residence built for doubt however that did little good to who lived in close neighbourhood have very comfortable little banquet seated on broken lump of stone lie about under wall of tomb wonder whether shade of cecilia metella be looking down upon have heard much of in latter day yet know nothing about can conceive why be honoured with bigger tomb than other roman matron there be then among party who believed that might still come back among with due assistance from cognate susceptible spirit explain to cause of widowed husband liberality ala ala if may judge of roman by true reason for such sepulchral grandeur must redound little to credit of lady cecilia metella to of crassus bereaved desolate lord did not come among on occasion of banquet possibly because have table there to turn in preparation for presence have done so must not have be more eloquent of thing of other world than be mr talboys have said that mr talboys eye never glanced more brightly after glass of champagne be inclined to think on occasion may have done so o'brien enacted ganymede be perhaps more liberal than other latter day ganymede to whose service mr talboys have be accustomed let not however be suspected by one exceeded limit of discreet joyousness by mean generous wine penetrated perhaps to inner cell of heart brought forth thought in sparkling word otherwise might have remained concealed there be nothing in what thought spoke calculated to give umbrage to anchorite to vestal word two said sung about flowing bowl once called for falernian beyond converse be chiefly of right of man weakness of woman of iron age that be past of golden time be to come called toast drank to hope of latter historian of nineteenth century then be that bade o'brien fill high bowl with samian wine irishman took at word raised bumper waved over head before put to lip be bound to declare that did not spill drop true 'falernian grape said a deposited empty beaker on grass beneath elbow viler champagne think ever swallowed be theory of wine not palpable body present there a be in flesh inspired there be really something grand about on occasion enthusiasm almost amounted to reality mackinnon be amused encouraged a must confess did also mr mackinnon made useless little sign to husband really fearing that falernian must do good office too thoroughly wife getting apart a walked round circle distributing viand remarked that woman be fool must disgrace observed that after disposal of bumper worshipped rosy god in theory only therefore saw occasion to interfere come bacchus said come silenus if thou wilt know that ye be hovering round graf of departed favourite ye too nymph of egeria pointed to classic grove be close to a sat there in olden day ye did not always despise abode of men why must invoke presence of god who can become godlike be deity of present age for will table be spread with ambrosia for will nectar flow upon whole be very good fooling for awhile a soon a be tired of arose from seat began to stroll about place be beginning to be little dusk somewhat cool evening air be pleasant lady putting on shawl did not seem inclined at once to get into carriage at rate mr talboys be not so inclined for started down hill towards long low wall of old roman circus at bottom o'brien close at elbow started with ida dear have better remain here said to daughter will be tired if come a far a be going oh mamma will not said ida get tired much quicker than do oh yes will besides wish to come there be end of for ida mr talboys o'brien walked off together while looked into other face must be charity to go with said mackinnon do be charitable then said wife must be lady said be pity that mother of spotless cherub be not here for occasion said hardly think that one le gifted will undertake such self sacrifice attempt of kind must however now have be too late for be already at bottom of hill o'brien have certainly drunk freely of pernicious content of long necked bottle though one must fairly accuse of being tipsy nevertheless might have made others drunk have made bold dared to do perhaps more than might become man if under circumstance must be fool enough to make avowal of love to mr talboys might be expected a thought to do now watched a made for gap in wall led through into large enclosed space of old circus have be arena for chariot game have gone down with avowed purpose of searching where might have be meta ascertaining how driver must have turned when at full speed for awhile have heard voice rather voice especially heart of man o'brien must suffice for emergency have heard say have assumed strange habit of calling men by simple name a men address other when did to mackinnon who be much older than have be amused by other lady of party have taken to call mackinnon when mr talboys be not by have felt comedy to be le safe with o'brien especially when on one occasion heard address a arabella did not seem to be in way struck by doing so supposed therefore that have become frequent between what reply made at moment about heart of man know then in few minute disappeared through gap in wall none of followed though must have seemed most natural thing in world to do so have nothing out of way be expected a be remained there round tomb quizzing little foible of dear friend hoping that o'brien must be quick in what be doing that must undoubtedly get slap in face metaphorically felt certain for none of doubted rigid propriety of lady intention of strolled into building of got out on to road of be thinking that o'brien be very slow considerable time before saw talboys reappear through gap at last however be there at once saw that be alone came on breasting hill with quick step when drew near must see that there be frown a of injured majesty on brow mackinnon wife went forward to meet if be really in trouble must be fitting in way to assist of woman mr mackinnon be last to see woman suffer from ill usage without attempting to aid certainly never liked mr mackinnon said afterwards be bound to go hear tale when really have tale to tell mr talboys now have tale to tell if chose to tell lady of party declared afterwards that must have acted more wisely have kept to herself o'brien word to answer be well able to take care of mr mackinnon said after silly man have taken answer when got not however that o'brien have taken answer quite immediately a far a must understand from what heard of matter afterwards at present moment mr talboys came up rising ground alone at quick pace man have insulted said aloud a well a panting breath must allow a soon a be near enough to mr mackinnon to speak to be sorry for said mr mackinnon suppose have taken little too much wine no be premeditated insult base hearted churl have failed to understand meaning of true honest sympathy will forget about when be sober said mackinnon meaning to comfort what care what remembers what forgets said turning upon poor mackinnon indignantly men grovel so in idea yet a mackinnon said afterwards have be telling be fool for last three week men grovel so in idea that can not understand feeling of true hearted woman what can forgetfulness remembrance be to must not remember insult be possible must forget mr mackinnon only have gone forward to meet nevertheless spoke so loud that heard who be still clustered round spot on have dined what have become of mr o'brien lady whispered to have field glass with looking round saw hat a be walking inside wall of circus in direction towards city very foolish must feel said lady doubt be used to said considering age know said first who might have be perhaps three year younger than mr talboys who be not herself averse to excitement of moderate flirtation then why must have be averse seeing that have not a yet become subject to will of imperial lord must have felt much more foolish said third if have listened to what said to well know said second nobody must have known anything about then in few week must have gradually become tired of other in ordinary way in meantime mr talboys be among there have be no attempt at secresy be still loudly inveighing against grovelling propensity of men be quite true mr talboys said one of elder lady then woman be not always so careful a must be of course mean to say that there have be fault on part fault on part of course there have be fault on part one can make mistake without fault to extent took to be man of sense be fool go to naples indeed did want to go to naples asked mr mackinnon yes be what suggested be to leave by train for civita vecchia at six to

conceited about after said that unmarried lady if poor mr o'brien have not shown so much premature anxiety with reference to little journey to naples thing might have gone quietly after unmarried lady be wrong in judgment mr talboys be proud conceited in matter not proud of having excited admiration of irish lover be proud of own subsequent conduct gave credit for coming out strongly a noble minded matron believe think said mr mackinnon that virtue be quite spartan unique if remains in rome will boast of through whole winter if doe may be certain that o'brien will do same said mackinnon in spite of having fled from field be upon card that may get best of mr talboys be very excellent woman have proved excellence beyond doubt nevertheless be susceptible of ridicule felt little anxiety to hear
