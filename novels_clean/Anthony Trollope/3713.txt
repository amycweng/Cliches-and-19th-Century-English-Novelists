perfectly safe moment be away must see aaron trows eye gleaming at across room at last however slept when saw that be at rest told that work must then begin hitherto caleb morton have lived in respect life of man of peace now asking question a to propriety of what must do using inward argument a to line of conduct girded sword on loin prepared for war wretch who have thus treated woman whom loved must be hunted down like wild beast a long a have arm leg with to carry on hunt must pursue miscreant with weapon might come to hand might heaven help at need a dealt forth punishment to man if caught within grasp who have hitherto known morton in island must not recognise man a came forth on day thirsty after blood desirous to thrust into personal conflict with wild ruffian who have injured meek

in morning of constable from st george before day be over be joined by two three of warder from convict establishment there be with also friend two thus party be formed numbering together ten twelve person be of course armed therefore might be thought that there must be small chance for wretched man if must come upon track at first searched together thinking from tidings have reached that must be near to gradually spread along rock between st george ferry keeping watchman on road so that must not escape unnoticed into island ten time during day did anastasia send from cottage up to morton begging to leave search to others come down to not for moment must lose scent of prey what must be said that have be so treated that others have avenged sent back to say that father be with now that must come when work be over in job of work life blood of aaron trow be counted up towards evening be congregated on road near to spot at path turn off towards cottage when voice be heard hallooing to from summit of little hill lie between road sea on side towards ferry presently boy came running down to full of news danny lund have seen said boy have seen plainly in among rock then came danny lund small negro lad about fourteen year of age who be known in part a idlest most dishonest most useless of race on occasion however danny lund became important one listened to have seen said pair of eye moving down in cave of rock well knew have be in cave often said must get there again not now not while pair of eye be moving at bottom of so went up over hill morton leading way with hot haste in waist band held pistol hand grasped short iron bar with have armed ascended top of hill when there open sea be before on two side on third be narrow creek over ferry passed immediately beneath foot be broken rock for on side towards sea earth grass of hill descended little way towards water down among rock went silently caleb morton leading way danny lund directing from behind mr morton said elderly man from st george have not better let warder of gaol go first be desperate man will best understand way in answer to morton said nothing must let one put foot before still pressed forward among rock at last came to spot from whence might have sprung at one leap into ocean be broken cranny on sea shore into sea beat surrounded on side one by huge broken fragment of stone at first sight seemed a though must have admitted of path down among to water edge when scanned more closely be seen to be so large in size that man must climb from one to be singularly romantic spot now well known to there for have visited over over again that morning in there said danny lund keeping well behind morton body pointing at same time to cavern high up among rock quite on opposite side of little inlet of sea mouth of cavern be not twenty yard from where stood at first sight seemed a though must be impossible to reach precipice on brink of now stood ran down sheer into sea fall from mouth of cavern on other side be a steep danny solved mystery by pointing upwards showing how have be used to climb to projecting rock over head from thence creep round by certain vantage of stone till be able to let down into aperture now at present moment be unwilling to make essay of prowess a cragsman have said be up on that projecting rock thrice there have seen eye moving in cavern be quite sure of fact of pair of eye declined to ascend rock again trace soon became visible to by knew that one have passed in out of cavern recently stone when examined bore mark of friction passage repassage over will always give at spot from whence climber left platform commenced ascent side of stone have be rubbed by close friction of man body light boy like danny lund might find way in out without leaving such mark behind heavy man must do so thus before long be satisfied that aaron trow be in cavern before then there be long consultation a to what must do to carry on hunt how must drive tiger from lair that must not again come out except to fall into hand be to of matter of course must keep watch ward there though might be for day night be process did not satisfy morton did not indeed well satisfy of be not only that desired to inflict punishment on miscreant in accordance with law also that did not desire that miserable man must die in hole like starved dog that then must go after to take out wretched skeleton there be something in idea so horrid in way that agreed that active step must be taken warder of prison felt that must all be disgraced if must not take prisoner alive yet who must get round perilous ledge in face of such adversary touch to man while climbing there must send headlong down among wave then fancy told to what might be nature of embrace with animal a driven to despair hopeless of life armed a knew at rate with knife if first adventurous spirit must succeed in crawling round that ledge what must be reception might expect in terrible depth of cavern called to prisoner bidding come out telling that must fire in upon if did not show not sound be heard be indeed possible that must send bullet to perhaps corner of cavern if so in way might slaughter even of be not sure who must tell that there might not be protected nook in must lay secure who must tell when man be struck whether be wounded will get to said morton speaking with low dogged voice so saying clambered up to rock to danny lund have pointed many voice at once attempted to restrain one two put hand upon to keep back be too quick for now stood upon ledge of rock can see asked below can see nothing within cavern said morton look down very hard massa said danny very hard indeed down in deep dark hole then see big eye moving morton now crept along ledge rather be beginning to do so having put forward shoulder arm to make first step in advance from spot on be resting when hand be put forth from one corner of cavern moutha hand armed with pistoland shot be fired there must be doubt now that danny lund be right doubt now a to whereabouts of aaron trow hand be put forth pistol be fired caleb morton still clinging to corner of rock with arm be seen to falter be wounded said one of voice from below then expected to see fall into sea did not fall after moment two proceeded carefully to pick step along ledge ball have touched grazing cheek cutting through light whisker that wore have not felt though blow have nearly knocked from perch then four five shot be fired from rock into mouth of cavern man arm have be seen indeed one two declared that have traced dim outline of figure sound be heard to come from cavern except sharp crack of bullet against rock echo of gunpowder there have be no groan a of man wounded sound of body falling voice wailing in despair for few second be dark with smoke of gunpowder then empty mouth of cave be again yawning before eye morton be now near still cautiously creeping first danger to be exposed be that enemy within recess might push down from rock with touch on other hand there be three four men ready to fire moment that hand must be put forth then morton must swimwas known to be strong swimmerwhereas of aaron trow be already declared by prison gaoler that must not swim two of warder have now followed morton on rock so that in event of making good entrance into cavern holding enemy at bay for minute must be joined by aid be strange to see how different men conducted a stood on opposite platform watching attack officer from prison have other thought of prisoner be intent on taking alive dead to be little nothing what became of morton be business to encounter peril be ready to do sofeeling however by mean sorry to have such man a morton in advance of very little be said by have wit about remembered that word spoken for guidance of ally must be heard also by escaped convict prey be sure sooner later have not morton be so eager in pursuit must have waited till plan have be devised of trapping without danger townsman from st george of whom dozen be now standing there be quick eager loud in counsel stay where be mr mortonstay awhile for love of godor hell have down now time caleb in on now youll have close with morton close with at once only chance there four of here well fire on if a much a show limb of word a be heard by poor wretch within must have sounded to a barking of pack of hound thirsting for blood for at rate there be longer hope in world reader when chance have taken into hunting field have ever be lot to sit by on horseback watch digging out of fox operation be not uncommon one in country be held to be in accordance with rule of fair sport for think that when brute have so far saved must be entitled to benefit of cunning will not now discus propriety impropriety of practice in venery can never however watch doing of work without thinking much of agonising struggle of poor beast whose last refuge be being torn from over head there lie within few yard of arch enemy huntsman thick breath of hound make hot air within hole sound of voice be close upon ear breast be nearly bursting with violence of effort at last have brought to retreat then pickaxe mattock be plied above head nearer more near to press foeshis double foe human caninetill at last huge hand grasp be dragged forth among enemy almost a soon a eye have seen light eager nose of dozen hound have moistened in entrails ah know that be vermin vermin after whom have be risking neck with bold ambition might ultimately witness death struggle nevertheless must fain have saved that last half hour of gradually diminished hope aaron trow be now like hunted fox doomed to be dug out from last refuge with addition to misery that hound when caught prey must not put at once out of misery when first saw that throng of men coming down from hill top resting on platform knew that fate be come when called to to surrender be silent knew that silence be of avail to who be so eager to be captor matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty to thinking there be difficulty there be there score of men fully armed within twenty yard of if showed trace of limb must become mark for bullet then if be wounded one must come to if allowed to lie there without food till perished must not be well for to yield then called again be still silent that idea of yielding be very terrible to heart of man when worst have come to worst did not ocean run deep beneath cavern month a yelled at hallooed making preparation for death presence of mind deserted poor wretch have stolen old pistol on one of marauding expedition of one barrel have be loaded that in mad despair have fired now a lay near mouth of cavern under cover of projecting stone have weapon with hand have have knife have dropped from during struggle on floor of cottage have now nothing hand be considering how might best use in ridding of first of pursuer man be near armed with power majesty of right on side whereas on side aaron trow have hope raised head that might look forth dozen voice shouted a face appeared above aperture dozen weapon be levelled at must see gleaming of muzzle of gun then foot of pursuer be already on corner stone at cavern mouth
