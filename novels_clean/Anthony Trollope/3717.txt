be case with so many men have formed view for have theory of life money for money sake have declared to to be bad money a concomitant to thing be in good have declared to to be good also concomitant in affair of marriage have now missed well have made up mind to must put up with loss have mean of living of own mean not so extensive a might have be desirable that must be well for to become married man looking merely to state of life a opposed to present state have fully resolved on point therefore there be nothing to repent that patty woolsworthy be good affectionate clever beautiful be sufficiently satisfied must be odd indeed if be not so satisfied now seeing that for last four month have so declared to daily with many inward asseveration yet though repeated now again that be satisfied think that be so fully satisfied of a have be throughout whole of four month be sad to say so feari fear that such be case when have plaything how much of anticipated pleasure vanishes especially if be won easily have told none of family what be intention in second visit to devonshire now have to bethink whether must be satisfied what must sister say who have married honourable augustus gumbleton gold stick in waiting to majesty privy council must receive patience with open arm make much of about london then how far must london suit patience must patience suit london there must be much for to do in teaching must be well for to set about lesson without loss of time so far got that night when morning came went step further began mentally to criticise manner to have be very sweet that warm full that ready declaration of love yes have be very sweet butbut when after little joke did confess love have not be little too free for feminine excellence man like to be told that be loved hardly wish that girl be to marry must fling at head ah yes be thus argued to a on that morning went through arrangement of toilet then be brute say pretty reader have never said that be not brute remark many such brute be to be met with in beaten path of world highway when patience woolsworthy have answered coldly bidding go back to london think over love while seemed from manner that at rate a yet did not care for while be absent from therefore longing for possession of charm talent bright honesty of purpose have seemed to thing most desirable now be own have in fact be own from first heart of country bred girl have fallen at first word from mouth have not so confessed to be very nicevery nice indeed loved dearly have not sold too cheaply by mean say that be not brute whether brute be honest man have remotest dream either then on morning during following day on such thought pressed more quickly on mindof breaking away from pledged word at breakfast on morning told to miss le smyrger that lady with warm gracious intention confided to purpose regarding property have always regarded patience a heir said will do so still oh indeed said captain broughton be great great pleasure to to think that will give back little property to sister child will have mother thus will come together again ah said captain broughton have own idea about property did not even under existing circumstance like to hear that aunt considered at liberty to leave acre away to one who be by blood quite stranger to family doe patience know of asked not word said miss le smyrger then nothing more be said upon subject on afternoon went down received parson benediction congratulation with good grace patience said very little on occasion indeed be absent during greater part of interview two lover then walked up to oxney combe there be more benediction more congratulation went merry a marriage bell at rate a far a patience be concerned not word have yet fallen from dear mouth not look have yet come over handsome face tended in way to mar bliss first day of acknowledged love be day altogether happy when prayed for a knelt beside bed there be feeling in mind that fear need disturb joy will pas over next three four day very quickly merely saying that patience did not find so pleasant a first day after engagement there be something in lover mannersomething at first must not definewhich by degree seemed to grate against feeling be sufficiently affectionate that being matter on did not require much demonstration joined to affection there seemed to be hardly liked to suggest to herself harsh word must be possible that be beginning to think that be not good enough for then asked questionwas good enough for if there be doubt about that match must be broken off though tore own heart out in struggle truth however be thisthat have begun that teaching have already found to be so necessary now have one essayed to teach patience german mathematics with young lady free consent believe that must have be found meek scholar be not probable that must be meek when found self appointed tutor teaching manner conduct without consent so matter went on for four five day on evening of fifth day captain broughton aunt drank tea at parsonage nothing very especial occurred a parson miss la smyrger insisted on playing backgammon with devoted perseverance during whole evening broughton have good opportunity of saying word two about change in lady love life in london must requireand word said alsosome single slight word a to higher station in life to must exalt bride patience bore itfor father miss la smyrger be in roomshe bore well speaking syllable of anger enduring for moment implied scorn of old parsonage then evening broke up captain broughton walked back to oxney combe with aunt patty father said to before went to bed seems to to be most excellent young man dear papa answered kissing terribly deep in love said mr woolsworthy oh dont know about answered a left with sweetest smile though must thus smile at father joke have already made up mind that there be still something to be learned a to promised husband before must place altogether in hand must ask whether thought liable to injury from proposed marriage though must deny such thought must know from manner of denial what true feeling be too on night during silent walk with miss le smyrger have entertained similar thought fear be obstinate said to then have half accused of being sullen also if be temper what life of misery have before have fixed day yet aunt asked a came near to house not yet dont know whether will suit to fix before leave why be other day be in such hurry ahyesi have thought more about since then must have imagined that must depend on patty think said miss le smyrger standing up for privilege of sex be presumed that gentleman be always ready a soon a lady will consent yes in ordinary case be so when girl be taken out of own sphere own sphere let caution master john not to talk to patty about own sphere aunt penelope a patience be to be wife not yours must claim permission to speak to on such subject a may seem suitable to then partednot in best humour with other on following day captain broughton miss woolsworthy did not meet till evening have said before few ill omened word have passed lover lip that must probably be at miss le smyrgers house on following morning ill omened word did pas lover lip then remained at home did not come from sullenness even from anger from conviction that must be well that must think much before met again be anxious to hurry meeting thoughthis base thoughtwas that must be sure to come up to combe after did not come therefore in evening went down to asked to walk with went away by path led to helpholme little be said between till have walked mile together patience a went along path remembered almost to letter sweet word have greeted ear a came down way with on night of arrival remembered nothing of sweetness then have not made as of during last six month be thought very much have possession of mind patience said at last having hitherto spoken only indifferent word now again since have left parsonage patience hope realise importance of step be about to take of course do answered what odd question be for to ask because said sometimes almost doubt seems to a though thought must remove from here to new home with more trouble than when go from home up to combe be that meant for reproach john not for reproach for advice certainly not for reproach be glad of must wish to make think how great be leap in world be about to take then again walked on for many step before answered tell then john said when have sufficiently considered what word must speak a spoke bright colour suffused face eye flashed almost with anger what leap do mean do mean leap upwards well yes hope will be so in one sense certainly must be leap upwards to be wife of man loved to have privilege of holding happiness in hand to know be ownthe companion whom have chosen out of must indeed be leap upwards leap almost to heaven if be so if mean upwards in other sense be thinking of social scale then captain broughton thought be doing dishonour doing dishonour yes doing dishonour that father be in world esteem greater man than mine be doubtless true enough that a man be richer than be a woman be doubtless also true dishonour also if thing can weigh with now patiencei think can hardly know what word be saying to pardon think hing that can give meno gift of descriptioncan weigh aught against be giving if have wealth rank of greatest lord in land must count a nothing in such scale ifas have not doubtedif in return for heart have given thenthenthen have paid fully when gift such a be going nothing else

arranged before go probably not said then subject be dropped for time john said just before went to bed if there be anything wrong between patience conjure to tell have better ask replied can tell
