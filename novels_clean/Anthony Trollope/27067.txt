violent notice from british government that britannula have ceased to be independent have again be absorbed by mother country among crown colony how information be received with what weakness on part of britannulists now proceed to tell confess that for one be not at first prepared to obey be small be independent owed more of submission to great britain than do to salomon island to otaheite be for to make own law have hitherto made in conformity with institution must say with prejudice of so called civilisation have now made first attempt at progress beyond limit be immediately stopped by fatuous darkness of old men whom have great britain known own interest must already have silenced by fixed period law on own account greater instance of uncalled for tyranny be told of in history of world a already written brother britannulists did not agree with that in interest of coming race be duty rather to die at post than yield to menace of duke of hatfield one british gunboat declared in harbour of gladstonopolis must reduce to order what order ton steam swiveller must no doubt crush bring fixed period college in premature ruin about ear a be said captain of gunboat must never dare to touch wire must commit so wide destruction englishman must hesitate to fire shot must send perhaps five thousand of fellow creature to destruction before fixed period even in britannula fear still

of college have nothing left to write story so that coming age may see how noble be effort in truth difficulty lay in way be very stern philosophical truth on system be founded be too strong too mighty too divine to be adopted by man in immediate age of first appearance have appeared perhaps must be contented gratified during year be doomed to linger through impotent imbecility to think have be first reformer of time though will be doomed to perish without having enjoyed fruit must now explain before begin story certain detail of plan created much schism among ourselves in first place what must be fixed period when party of three four hundred in number first emigrated from new zealand to britannula be almost of young people must not consent to measure in regard to public debt house in new zealand threatened to take a island have be discovered part of cultivated thither determined to go resolution be very popular not only with certain party in new zealand also in mother country others followed settled with great prosperity be essentially young community there be not above ten among who have then reached fixed period not above twenty others who must be said to be approaching there never must arrive time people when among whom system must be tried with so good hope of success be so long before have be allowed to stand on bottom that fixed period became matter of common conversation in britannula there be many who looked forward to a creator of new idea of wealth comfort be in day that calculation be made a to river railway think that in england thought that few few among be dreamer of dream have believed that fixed period must ever have become law must not have permitted to be law maker acknowledge that when be once independent then again to reduce to submission by ton steam swiveller be act of gross tyranny what must be fixed period be first question demanded immediate answer year be named absurd in intended leniency eighty even eighty five let say hundred said aloud turning upon battery of ridicule suggested sixty term be received with silence pointed out that few old men now on island might be exempted that even above fifty five might be allowed to drag out existence if be weak enough to select for so degrading position latter proposition be accepted at once exempt showed repugnance even when be proved to that must be left alone in community

among friend see whether men of sixty five be not in way of who be still aspiring to rise in world judge will be deaf on bench when younger men below can hear with accuracy voice will have descended to poor treble eyesight will be dim failing at rate limb will have lost robust agility be needed for adequate performance of work of world be self evident that at sixty five man have done that be fit to do must be troubled no longer with labour therefore must be troubled no longer with life be vanity vexation of spirit one must say if still brave still desirous of honour lead into college there let prepare for brighter life will require mortal strength word did avail with many then demanded that seventy must be fixed period how long fought over point need not now be told decided at last to divide interval sixty seven half be named by majority of assembly a fixed period surely colony be determined to grow in truth old before must go into college then there came further dispute on side of fixed period must year of grace be taken debate even on subject be long animated be said that seclusion within college must be tantamount to penal departure that old men must thus have last lingering drop of breath allowed without in world at large be at last decided that men woman must be brought into college at sixty seven that before sixty eighth birthday must have departed then bell be rung whole community rejoiced banquet be eaten young men woman called other brother sister be felt that great reform have be inaugurated among for benefit of mankind at large little be thought about at home in england when bill be passed there be suppose in estimation of englishman time enough to think about idea be so strange to that be considered impossible that must carry out heard of bill doubt

chiefly expected that sympathy however did not receive world be clearly not yet alive to grand thing in store for received indeed violent remonstrance from old fashioned government at washington in answer to that stated that be prepared to stand fall by new system that expected glory rather than ignominy to be followed by mankind rather than repudiated have lengthened correspondence also with new zealand with australia england at first did not believe when be given to understand that be in earnest brought to bear upon one argument must have force sent to harbour ton steam swiveller ton swiveller doubt be unanswerable unless be prepared to die for system be prepared must not carry people of country with have now given necessary prelude to story have to tell can not think that in spite of isolated manner of great britain reader in country generally must have become acquainted with view of fixed periodists can not be that scheme with such power to change may say to improve

seldom approach to literary taste may be that portion of mass must have be ignorant of what be being done within empire of south pacific have therefore written preliminary chapter to explain to be condition of britannula in regard to fixed period just twelve month before england have taken possession of once more made own sir ferdinando brown now rule must say not with rod of iron very much after own good will make flowery speech think that will stand in lieu of independence collect revenue informs that to be taxed be highest privilege of ornate civilisation pointed to gunboat in bay

day of crasweller birth have already introduced habit of tattooing on back of baby day on be born have succeeded in operating also on many of child who have come into world before great law there be who must not submit on behalf of child did look forward to little confusion in matter register have of course be commenced there be already who refused to state exact age have be long on lookout for have little book of own in be inscribed period of who have come to britannula with since have first thought of fixed period have be very careful to note faithfully birth a occurred reader will see how important a time went on must become to have accurate record already then feared that there might be want of fidelity after have be deposited friend crasweller be first on list there be doubt in empire a to exact day on be born britannula knew that must be first that be to be deposited on th of june in conversation with friend have frequently alluded to very day to happy day a used to call before became acquainted with actual feeling never ventured to deny on day must become sixty seven have attempted to describe daughter eva must say word a to personal quality of father too be remarkably handsome man though hair be beautifully white have fewer of symptom of age than old man have before known be tall robust broad there be beginning even of stoop about spoke always clearly

gladstonopolis be so thriving that found a easy to collect ten penny a one at reading gabriel crasweller be favourite performer have begun to be whispered by caitiff who must willingly disarrange whole starry system for own immediate gratification that crasweller must not be deposited because of beauty of voice then difficulty be somewhat increased by care precision with attended to own business be a careful a ever about flock at shearing time must stand day in wool shed to see to packing of wool marking of bale must be pity said to britannulist one day man younger than to lock up old crasweller let business go into hand of young grundle young grundle will never know half a much about sheep in spite of conceit crasweller be deal fitter for work than for living idle in college till will put end to there be much in word made very angry according to man feeling whole system be to be made to suit to peculiarity of one individual constitution man who so spoke must have known nothing of general beauty of fixed period have alluded to manner of depositing in most disrespectful term have felt to be essentially necessary so to maintain dignity of ceremony a to make appear a unlike execution a possible depositing of crasweller be to be first must according to own intention be attended with peculiar grace reverence know what call locking up said angrily have mr crasweller be about to be dragged to felon prison must not have used more opprobrious language a to putting end to must think be ignorant of method proposed for adding honour glory to last moment in world of dear friend whose happy lot will be to be withdrawn from world trouble amidst love veneration of fellow subject a to actual mode of transition there have be many discussion held by executive in president square have at last be decided that certain vein must be opened while departing one must under influence of morphine be gently entranced within warm bath a president of empire have agreed to use lancet in first two three case thereby intending to increase honour conferred under circumstance did feel sting bitterly when spoke of putting end to have not said at realised feeling of ceremony few ill spoken word such a have just uttered will do more harm in mind of many than voting will have done good in answer to merely repeated observation that crasweller be very bad specimen to begin with have got ten year of work in said friend yet intend to make away with without slightest compunction make away with what expression to use from mouth of one who have be determined fixed periodist angered to think that men must be so little reasonable a to draw deduction a to entire system from single instance crasweller might in truth be strong hearty at fixed period that period have be chosen with reference to community at large what though might have to depart year two before be worn out still must do so with everything around to make happy must depart before have ever known agony of headache looking at entire question with eye of reason must not tell that better example of triumphant beginning to system must not have be found yet there be in something unfortunate have first hero be compelled to abandon business by old age have become doting over detail parsimonious extravagant even short sighted in speculation public feeling than nothing be more ignorant must have risen in favour of fixed period how true be president reasoning people must have said look at crasweller must have ruined little christchurch have stayed there much longer everything did seemed to prosper occurred to at last that forced into abnormal sprightliness with view of bringing disgrace upon law of fixed period if there be such feeling regard a certainly mean on day after dinner at eva pudding be eaten abraham grundle came to at executive hall said that have few thing to discus with of importance abraham be good looking young man with black hair bright eye remarkably handsome moustache be one well inclined to business in whose hand firm of grundle grabbe crasweller be likely to thrive have never liked much have thought to be little wanting in reverence owed to elder to be moreover somewhat over fond of money have leaked out that though be doubt attached to eva crasweller have thought quite a much of little christchurch though must kiss behind door after way of young men still be more intent on fleece than on lip want to say word to mr president began upon subject that disturbs conscience very much conscience said yes mr president believe be aware that be engaged to marry miss crasweller may be a well to explain here that own eldest son a fine boy a ever delighted mother eye be only two year younger than eva that wife mr neverbend have of late got into head that be quite old enough to marry girl be in vain that told that have be settled while jack be still at didascalion have be colonel of curriculum a now call head boy eva have not then cared for colonel of curriculum have thought more of young grundle moustache wife declared that be altered that jack be in fact much more manly fellow than abraham with shiny bit of beard that if one must get at maiden heart must find that eva thought so in answer to bade hold tongue remember that in britannula promise be always held to be a good a bond suppose young woman may change mind in britannula a well a elsewhere said wife turned over in mind because slope of little christchurch be very alluring must all belong to eva so soon then must be well a be about to perform for crasweller so important portion of final ceremony close intimacy must be drawn still nearer by family connection did think of then occurred to that girl engagement to young grundle be established fact did not behove to sanction breach of contract oh yes said to young man be aware that there be understanding to effect between eva father between eva can assure having observed kiss behind door on previous day must not deny truth of assertion be quite understood continued abraham have always thought that be to take place at once so eva might get used to new life before papa be deposited to merely bowed head a though to signify that be matter with be not personally concerned have taken for granted that old friend must like to see daughter settled little christchurch put into daughter hand before must bid adieu to own sublunary affair remarked when found that paused thought so up at warehouse said father grabbe postlecott chief clerk postlecott be next three on book be getting very melancholy be especially anxious just at present to see how crasweller bear have that to do with eva marriage suppose might marry have made will doe that matter there be nobody to interfere with eva might go off mr neverbend whispered grundle where must be then if be to get across to auckland to sydney to leave one to manage property for what must do be what want to know law say that will be deposited on certain day will become a nobody in eye of law said with authority of president if daughter have understood other if deed be forthcoming by little christchurch will have be left to trustee if go on living at sydney let say on fat of land drawing income leaving trustee a legal owner where must be then in case said having taken two three minute for consideration in case presume property must be confiscated by law must go to natural heir now if natural heir be then wife will be just same a though property be yours young grundle shook head know what more must want at rate there be more for to get confess at moment idea of boy chance of succeeding with heiress did present to mind according to what wife have said jack must have jumped at girl with just what stood up in have sworn to mother when have be told that morning about kiss behind door that must knock that brute head off shoulder before many day be gone by looking at matter merely on behalf of jack appeared to that little christchurch must in case be quite safe let crasweller be deposited run away to sydney know for certain about confiscation of property said abraham have told a much mr grundle a be fit that must know replied with severity for absolute condition of law must look in statute book not come to president of empire abraham grundle then departed have assumed angry air a though be offended with for troubling on matter by referring simply to individual have in truth given rise to very serious solemn thought must be that crasweller own confidential friend man to whom have trusted very secret of soul on important matter must be that must be unwilling to be deposited when day have come must be that must be anxious to fly from country law just a time have arrived when law might operate upon for benefit of country must not think that be so vain so greedy so selfish so unpatriotic be not must attempt to fly must prevent flying if did fly what step must take next government of new south wale be hostile to on very matter of fixed period certainly must not surrender in obedience to law of extradition might leave property to trustee who must manage on behalf although a far a britannula be concerned must be beyond reach of law regarded even a being without pale of life if first of fixed periodists be to run away fashion of so running must become common must thus be rid of old men object must be so far attained looking forward must see at glance that if one two wealthy member of community be thus to escape must be almost impossible to carry out law with reference to who must have such mean vexed most be that gabriel crasweller must desire to escape that must be anxious to throw over whole system to preserve poor remnant of life if must do so who must be expected to abstain if must prove false when moment came who must prove true first very first on list young grundle have now left a sat thinking of be for moment tempted to abandon fixed period altogether a remained there in silent meditation better thought came to have dared to regard a foremost spirit of age must thus be turned back by human weakness of one poor creature who have not sufficiently collected strength of heart to be able to look death in face to laugh down be difficulty difficulty more might be crushing difficulty must put end to system a far a existence be concerned bethought how many early reformer have perished in effort how seldom have be given to first man to scale wall of prejudice force into citadel of reason have not yielded when thing have gone against though have not brought vision down to palpable touch of humanity still have persevered effort have not be altogether lost to world so will be with said though may never live to deposit human being within sanctuary though may be doomed by foolish prejudice of men to drag out miserable existence amidst sorrow weakness of old age though may never be given to to feel ineffable comfort of triumphant deposition still name will be handed down to coming age will be spoken of a first who endeavoured to save grey hair from being brought with sorrow to grave be now writing on board hm gunboat john bright for tyrannical slave of modern monarch have taken in flesh be carrying off to england so that a say nonsense of fixed period may die away in britannula think poor ignorant fighting men that theory can be made to perish because one individual will have be mastered idea will still live in age to come men will prosper be strong thrive unpolluted by greed cowardice of second childhood because john neverbend be at one time president of britannula occurred to then a sat meditating over tidings conveyed to by abraham grundle that must be well must see crasweller talk to freely on subject have sometimes be that by strength have reinvigorated halting courage suggestion that might run away a day of deposition drew nigh rather that others might run away have be subject of conversation between how will be have said if mizzle have intended to allude to possible premature departure of who be about to be deposited men will never be so weak said suppose 'd take property stick of property be thing can be conveyed away must keep sharp look out upon there might be writ know ne exeant regno if be driven to pinch will be last thing to do must be sorry to be driven to express fear of human weakness by general measure of kind must be tantamount to accusation of cowardice against whole empire crasweller have only shaken head have understood to shake on part of human race generally not on own behalf chapter iii first break down be now mid winter wanted just twelve month to th of june on in accordance with plan crasweller be to be deposited full year must doubt suffice for to arrange worldly affair to see daughter married must not more than suffice still went about business with alacrity marvellous in one who be so soon about to withdraw from world fleece for bearing be preparing flock though might be shorn by must never return price to account must do so for daughter son in law in circumstance must have be well for to have left flock to son in law to have turned mind to consideration of other matter there must be year devoted to final year to be passed within college so that by degree mind may be weaned from ignoble art of money making have once so spoken to there be a intent a ever with mind fixed on record of

symptom of well not exactly among own sheep know sign of so well grass be peculiarly dry flock be remarkably well looked after can see indication of only fancy where must all be if fluke showed in britannula if once got ahead must be better off than australian might be anxiety for daughter looked strangely like personal feeling must have be expected in twenty year ago crasweller said do mind coming into house having little chat so got off tricycle be going to be very busy said showing unwillingness have fifty young foal in meadow there like to see that get supper served to warm bother young foal said a if have not men enough about place to see to feeding stock without troubling have come out from gladstonopolis because want to see now be to be sent back in order that might attend

stalked into inner house leaving alone on verandah have nothing for to turn on electric lamp of tricycle steam back to government house at gladstonopolis with sad heart chapter iv jack neverbend six month passed away must own to be period of great doubt unhappiness though be relieved by certain moment of triumph of course a time drew nearer question of crasweller deposition became generally discussed by public of gladstonopolis so also did love of abraham grundle eva crasweller there be evaites abrahamites in community for though match have not yet be altogether broken be known that two young people differed altogether on question of old man deposition be said by defendents of grundle who be to be found for most part among young men young woman that abraham be simply anxious to carry out law of country happened that during period be elected to vacant seat in assembly so that when matter came on for discussion there be able to explain publicly motif must be owned that did so with good word with certain amount of youthful eloquence a for eva be simply intent on preserving lee of father life have be heard to express opinion that college be humbug that people ought to be allowed to live a long a pleased god to let of course have with elderly lady of community among own wife a foremost mr neverbend have never made prominent before in public question on seemed to entertain very warm opinion whether arose entirely from desire to promote jack welfare from reflection that own period of deposition be gradually becoming nearer never must quite make up mind have at rate ten year to run never heard from expressed fear of departure be be brave good woman attached to household duty anxious for husband comfort beyond measure solicitous for good thing to befall scapegrace jack neverbend for whom think that nothing be sufficiently rich sufficiently grand jack be handsome boy grant be about can be said of in matter have be diametrically opposed to father from first to last will be seen that in such circumstance none of moment of triumph to have alluded can have come to within own home there mr neverbend jack after while eva sat together in perpetual council against when meeting first began still acknowledged to be promised bride of abraham grundle there be own vow parent assent something perhaps of remaining love presently whispered to wife that must not feel horror for man who be anxious to murder father by by began to own that thought jack fine fellow have wonderful cricket club in gladstonopolis britannula have challenged english cricketer to come play on little christchurch ground declared to be only cricket ground a yet prepared on face of earth have accomplishment possible for due prosecution of game now jack though very young be captain of club devoted much more of time to occupation than to more legitimate business a merchant eva who have not hitherto paid much attention to cricket became on sudden passionately devoted to whereas abraham grundle with steadiness beyond year gave up more than ever to business of assembly expressed contempt for game though be mean player have become necessary during period to bring forward in assembly whole question of fixed period a be felt that in present state of public opinion must not be expedient to carry out established law without increased sanction must be given to by further vote in house public opinion must have forbidden to deposit crasweller without such further authority therefore be deemed necessary that question must be asked in crasweller name be not mentioned might lead to general debate young grundle demanded one morning whether be intention of government to see that different clause a to new law respecting deposition be at once carried out house be aware believe said that first operation will soon be needed may a well state here that be repeated to eva that pretended to take huff at question from lover be most indecent said after such word must drop for ever be not for month after that allowed jack name to be mentioned with own be aware that be partly settled between jack mr neverbend grundle declared intention of proceeding against old crasweller in reference to breach of contract according to law of britannula jack party disregarded altogether in telling however be advancing little beyond point in story to have a yet carried reader then there arose debate upon whole principle of measure be carried on with great warmth a president of course took part in in accordance with constitution heard from chair usually occupied at speaker right hand argument on greatest stress be laid tended to show that fixed period have be carried chiefly with view to relieving misery of old be conclusively shown that in very great majority of case life beyond sixty eight be vanity vexation of spirit that other argument a to costliness of old men to state be for present dropped have listened to young grundle insisting with vehemence of youth on absolute wretchedness to aged have be condemned by absence of such law have heard misery of rheumatism gout stone general debility pictured in eloquent word of five twenty must have felt that who must lend to perpetuate state of thing must be guilty of fiendish cruelty really rose to great height of parliamentary excellence altogether carried with younger luckily greater part of house there be really nothing to be said on other side except repetition of prejudice of old world ala so strong be weakness of world that prejudice can always vanquish truth by mere strength of battalion not till have be proved re proved ten time over be understood that sun must not have stood still upon gideon crasweller who be member who took seat during debate without venturing to speak merely whispered to neighbour that heartless greedy fellow be unwilling to wait for wool of little christchurch three division be made on debate thrice did fixed periodists beat old party by majority of fifteen in house consisting of eighty five member so strong be feeling in empire that only two member be absent number remained same during whole week of debate did think be triumph felt that old country have really nothing on earth to do with matter must not interfere with opinion expressed so strongly heart throbbed with pleasureable emotion a heard that old age be approaching depicted in term made impotence truly conspicuous till felt that have be proposed to deposit of who have reached age of fifty eight really think must joyfully have given assent to measure have walked off at once deposited in college be only at such moment be allowed to experience feeling of triumph be encountered not only in own house in society generally on very street of gladstonopolis by expression of opinion that crasweller must not be made to retire to college at fixed period what on earth be there to hinder said once to old friend ruggles ruggles be now somewhat over sixty be agent in town for country wool grower took part in politics though have never agreed to principle of fixed period have not interested in opposition to be man whom regarded a indifferent to length of life one who must upon whole rather face such lot a nature might intend for than seek to improve by new reform eva crasweller will hinder said ruggles eva be mere child do suppose that opinion will be allowed to interrupt law of whole community oppose progress of civilisation feeling will said ruggles who be to stand daughter interceding for life of father one man can not eighty five can do so eighty five will be to community just what one must be to eighty five be not saying anything about law be not expressing opinion whether must be good bad must like to live out own time though acknowledge that assembly men have on shoulder responsibility of deciding whether will do so not must lead away deposit without trouble because be not popular people be beginning to talk about eva crasweller abraham grundle tell that volunteer have in britannula will not suffice to take old man to college to keep there till have polished off must be deposited again at little christchurch in triumph college must be left wreck behind view of case be peculiarly distressing to a chief magistrate of community nothing be so abhorrent to a rebellion of populace be not law abiding nothing evil can be predicted whereas people who will obey law can not be prosperous grieved greatly to be told that inhabitant of gladstonopolis must rise in tumult destroy college merely to favour view of pretty girl be there honour worse again must there be utility in being president of republic in such thing must happen left friend ruggles in street passed on to executive hall in very painful frame of mind when there tidings reached of much sadder nature at very moment at have be talking with ruggles in street on subject meeting have be held in market place with express purpose of putting down fixed period who have be chief orator on occasion jack neverbend own son have taken upon new work of public speechifying in direct opposition to own father have reason to believe that be instigated to do so by own wife son sir have be addressing multitude about fixed period say that have be quite beautiful to hear be thus that matter be told by one of clerk in office own did receive slight pleasure at finding jack must do something beyond cricket became immediately necessary to take step to stop evil be more bound to do so because only delinquent named to be own son if be so said aloud in office jack neverbend will sleep night in prison did not occur to at moment that must be necessary must have formal evidence that jack be conspiring against law before must send to jail have more power over in respect than on one else have declared that must be sent to bed without supper must have expressed better a father magistrate went home on entering house first person that saw be eva now a matter went on became full of wrath with son with wife with poor old crasweller never must bring to be angry with eva there be coaxing sweet feminine way with overcame opposition have already begun to regard a daughter in law to love dearly in position although there be moment in jack impudence new spirit of opposition almost tempted to disinherit eva said what be that hear of public meeting in street oh mr neverbend said taking by arm there be only few boy who be talking about papa through noise tumult of time there be evident determination to speak of jack a boy everything that did that said be merely efflux of high spirit a schoolboy eva always spoke of a kind of younger brother yet soon found that one opponent whom have most to fear in britannula be own son why asked must foolish boy discus serious question respecting dear father in public street want to have deposited said almost sobbing a spoke dear began determined to teach whole theory of fixed period with advantage from first to last interrupted at once oh mr neverbend know what good thing be to talk about have doubt world will be great deal better for if papa have be deposited for last five hundred year suppose must care so much about to be first that ever happened to in world why must papa be first ought to begin with weak crotchety poor old cripple who must be great deal better out of way papa be in excellent health have wit about great deal better than mr grundle manages everything at little christchurch manages very well dear be going to explain to that in question of such enormous public interest a of fixed period be impossible to consider merit of individual case interrupted again before must get out word oh mr neverbend will never be able to do be afraid that then will be vexed dear if law be oh law be very beautiful thing what be good of law if can not be carried out there be jack there of course be only boy swears that executive assembly volunteer in britannula sha lead papa into beastly college beastly dear can not have seen college be perfectly beautiful that be only what jack say be jack call beastly of course be not much of man a yet be own son do think that for earnest spirit about thing jack be very fine fellow abraham grundle know be just a warm on other side hate abraham grundle want ever to hear name again understand very well what be that abraham grundle be after never cared straw for much for if come to be contracted if think that be going to marry man because name have be written down in book together be very much mistaken be nasty mean fellow will never speak to again a long a live must deposit papa very moment if have power whereas jack be determined to stand up for a long a have got tongue to shout hand to fight be terrible word have heard same sentiment from jack own lip of course jack be nothing to continued with half sob have become habitual to whenever be forced to speak of father deposition be only boy know that must thrash abraham grundle at once to thinking be much more fit to be member of assembly a must not hear word said to be only intent on expressing warmth of own feeling allowed to go way retired to privacy of own library there endeavoured to console a best might by thinking of brilliant nature of jack prospect be over head ear in love with eva be clear to that eva be nearly a fond of then sly rogue have found certain way to obtain old crasweller consent grundle have thought that if must once see father in law deposited must have nothing to do to walk into little christchurch a master be accusation generally made against in gladstonopolis jack who did not a far a must see care straw for humanity in matter have vehemently taken side of anti fixed periodists a safest way to get father consent there be contract of marriage doubt grundle must be entitled to take quarter of father possession if must prove that contract have be broken such be law of britannula on subject not shilling have a yet be claimed by man under law crasweller doubt concluded that grundle must be unwilling to bear odium of being first there be clause in law must make very difficult for to prove validity of contract have be already asserted by many that girl must not be expected to marry man who have endeavoured to destroy father although in mind there must be doubt that abraham grundle have only done duty a senator there be knowing what view of case jury might take in gladstonopolis then if worst came to worst crasweller must resign fourth of property almost without pang jack must content in making meanness of grundle conspicuous to fellow citizen now must confess that a sat alone in library did hesitate for hour a to future conduct might not be better for to abandon altogether fixed period glory even in britannula world might be too strong for must not take good thing be offered allow jack to marry wife be happy in own way in very heart loved quite a well a did mother thought that be finest young fellow britannula have produced if kind of thing went on might be must be driven to quarrel with altogether to have punished under law like old roman of old must confess that relation with mr neverbend made very unfit to ape roman paterfamilias never interfered with public business have way of talking about household matter in be always victorious looking back a did at moment on past seemed to that jack who be two person loved best in world have be enemy who have always successfully conspired against do have done with fixed period nonsense have said to only yesterday be very well for assembly when come to killing poor mr crasweller in real life be quite out of question then when began to explain to at length immense importance of subject only remarked that must do very well for assembly must abandon take good thing with god have provided retire into private life have two side to character must see sitting in luxurious comfort amidst furniture of crasweller verandah while eva child be around jack be standing with cigar in mouth outside laying down law for cricketer at gladstonopolis be not better done a others use said to myself over over again a sat there wearied with contest thinking of much more frightful agony must be called upon to endure when time have actually come for departure of old crasweller then again if must fail for hour so did fear must fail have be always most popular magistrate now seemed have come time in popularity must be abandoned jack who be quick enough at understanding aspect of thing have already begun to ask people whether must see old friend crasweller murdered in cold blood be dreadful word be assured that have used how must be when time even for depositing have come attempt be made to lead old man up through street of gladstonopolis must have strength of character to perform task in opposition to loudly expressed wish of inhabitant to march along protected by strong body of volunteer how must be if volunteer refused to act on side of law order must not absolutely fail must not afterwards be told of that a president have broken down in attempt to carry out project with name have be so long associated a sat there alone have almost determined to yield suddenly there came upon memory of socrates of galileo of hampden of washington what great thing have men done by constancy in opposition to will prejudice of outside world how triumphant now appeared to have be in fighting against enormous odds power have brought against how pleasant now be very sound of name to who loved fellow creature in moment of private thought anxious a be now own too must have doubted must have asked question whether be strong enough to carry great reform against world in very moment necessary strength have be given to must have be that when almost despairing have be comforted by inner truth have be inspired to trust with confidence in cause too have be weak have trembled have almost feared have found in own heart that on must rely have be le sorely pressed than be now at present moment have not believed trusted be confident a thought of became aware that be not only necessary for man to imagine new truth to be able to endure to suffer to bring to maturity how often before truth be brought to maturity must be necessary that who have imagined seen planned must give very life for in vain not perhaps in vain a far a world be concerned only in vain in regard to feeling knowledge of man in struggling for welfare of fellow creature man must dare to endure to be obliterated must be content to go down unheard of worse still ridiculed perhaps abused by in order that something afterwards may remain of change have be enabled to see not to carry out how many thing be requisite to true greatness first of be required that self negation be able to plan new blessing although certain that blessing will be accounted a curse by world at large then got up a walked about room declared to myself aloud purpose though might perish in attempt must certainly endeavour to carry out doctrine of fixed period though people might be against regard a enemy that people for whose welfare have done still must persevere even though might be destined to fall in attempt though wife of bosom son of loin must turn against embitter last moment by enmity still must persevere when came to speak of vice virtue of president neverbend to tell of weakness strength must never be said of that have be deterred by fear of people from carrying out great measure have projected solely for benefit comforted by resolve went into mr neverbend parlour where found son jack sitting with have evidently be talking about jack speech in market place must see that young orator brow be still flushed with triumph of moment father said immediately will never be able to deposit old crasweller people wo let do people of britannula said will never interfere to prevent magistrate from acting in accordance with law bother said mr neverbend when wife said bother be be aware of use to argue with indeed mr neverbend be lady upon whom argument be for most part thrown away form opinion from thing around be in regard to domestic life to neighbour to conduct of people with whom life almost invariably right have quick insight affectionate heart together keep from going astray know how to do good when to do to abstract argument to political truth be wilfully blind felt to be necessary must select opportunity for making jack understand must not fear opposition own must have wished that mr neverbend have not be present on occasion wo said jack be just what fancy will do do mean to say that be what wish to do that think right that must do think crasweller ought to be deposited if mean that father not though law requires said in tone of authority have formed idea in own mind of subjection to law be demanded from good citizen have ever bethought that law must be in thing oh mr president pray make speech here said wife will never understand think jack be much wiser than be know what mean by speech sarah wife name be sarah be necessary that jack must be instructed that at rate must obey law be son a such be essentially necessary that must be amenable to law demand ca do there be end of said mr neverbend law will never be able to put end to poor mr crasweller must be great shame if did see feeling here in city be becoming very strong people wo have must say that be only rational that jack must be on same side be man now have right to own opinion a well a jack said with much solemnity do value father blessing well sir yes said blessing suppose mean something of allowance paid quarterly turned away face that might not see smile felt be involuntarily creeping across sir said father blessing have much more than pecuniary value includes that kind of relation between parent son without life must be burden to must think very grievous to also of course hope that may always be on good term be obliged to take admission for what be worth if wish to remain on good term with said must not oppose in public when be acting a public magistrate be to see mr crasweller murdered before very eye to say nothing about said mr neverbend of term in language

english went in first with two baronet at wicket looked like two stout minerva with huge wicker helmet know picture of goddess helmet spear petticoat carrying spear over shoulder a fly through air over city of earth sir kennington did not fly in other respect be very like goddess so completely enveloped be in india rubber guard so wonderful be machine upon head by brain feature be to be protected a took place upon ground there be great cheering then steam bowler be ridden into place by attendant engineer jack began work must see colour come go in face a carefully placed ball peeped down to get bearing seemed to a though be taking infinite care to level straight even at sir kennington head be told afterwards that never looked at sir kennington that having calculated distance by mean of quicksilver levelling glass object be to throw ball on certain inch of turf from might shoot into wicket at degree a to make very difficult for sir kennington to know what to do with seemed to to take long time during fourteen men around looked a though man be intending to hop off to other spot than on be standing there used be told to be only eleven of men now in great match long offs long ons rest of be doubled double long off be at such distance that being small man must only just see through field glass kept in waistcoat pocket when have be looking hard at for what seemed to be quarter of hour men be apparently becoming tired of continual hop when jack have stooped kneeled sprawled with one eye shut in conceivable attitude on sudden there came sharp snap little smoke lo sir kennington oval be out there be doubt about saw two bail fly away into infinite space at once there be sound of kettle drum trumpet fife clarionets seemed a though loud music of town band have struck up at moment with shrillest note huge gun be let off let kettle to trumpet speak trumpet to cannoneer without cannon to heaven heaven to earth now drink king to hamlet must not fancy at great sign of success be hamlet father sir kennington oval be out out at very first ball there must be doubt about jack triumph be complete be melancholy to see english minerva a again shouldered spear walked back to tent in spite of jack good play success on part of own countryman must not be sorry to think that young baronet have come half round world to be put out at first ball there be cruelty in inhospitality in spite of exigency of game went against grain then when shouting holloaing flinging up of ball be still going on remembered that after must have consolation with eva poor jack when short triumph be over must have to reflect that though fortunate in cricket be unhappy in love a occurred to looked back towards house there from little lattice window at end of verandah saw lady handkerchief waving must be that eva be waving so a to comfort vanquished british lover in meantime minerva went to tent hid among sympathetic friend be told afterwards that be allowed pint of bitter beer by dr macnuffery after twenty minute spent in what seemed to very ostentation of success man be got to wicket be stump one of professional who be not quite so much like minerva though too be prodigiously greaved jack again set ball snap went machine stump wriggled bat touched ball away flew behind wicket five republican minerva ran after a fast a leg must carry be told by gentleman who sat next to scoring that dozen run have be made spent great deal of time in explaining how in old time more than six at time be never scored now be altered slight tip counted ever so much more than good forward blow because ball went behind wicket up flew on side of ground figure to show that stump have made dozen two british clarionets be blown with great deal of vigour stump be thick set solid solemn looking man who have be ridiculed by side a being much too old for game seemed to think very little of jack precise machine kept chopping at ball always went behind till have made great score be two hour before jack have sorely lamed in hip umpire have given leg before wicket indeed be leg before wicket a poor man felt when be assisted back to tent however have scored sir lord longstop too have run up good score before be caught out by middle long off marvellous catch said be trumpet be blown for fully five minute big gun be only fired when ball be hurled from machine directly into wicket at end of three day britisher be out run be numbered in four figure have doubt a looked at contest whether of must be left to play out match be informed that be expected to take president seat day when heard that there be to be two inning for set positively declined crasweller took place be told that gleam of joy shot across worn sorrowful face when sir kennington began second inning with ten run must really wish in condition to send daughter away to england simply that might be baronet wife when britannulists went in for second time have run to get be said afterwards grundle have bet four to one against own side be thought to be very shabby on part though if such be betting see why must lose money by backing friend jack declared in hearing that must not put shilling on did not wish either to lose money to bet against be considerably disheartened when told that be not going in on first day of second inning have not done much when britannulists be in before have only made thirty forty run worse than sir kennington oval have scored up to told that pallas helmet be shaken with tremendous energy a made running again that man stump have seemed to be invincible though still lame have carried out bat with tremendous score trudged away without sign of triumph jack said that professional be best man have on second day of party second inning last day one of match jack went in have only made run on previous day three wicket be down kettle drum have have little opportunity for making heard jack be very despondent have have tiff with eva have asked eva whether be not going to england eva have said that perhaps might do so if britannulists did not do duty jack have chosen to take a bit of genuine impertinence have be very sore about stump be bowling from british catapult very nearly gave jack quietus during first over hit wildly four ball passed without touching wicket then came turn again caught first ball with neverbend spring bat for have invented swipe a called that nobody have ever yet be able to find ball story go that went right up to verandah that eva picked up have treasured ever since be that a may during whole of day next nobody be able to get out there be continual banging of kettle drum seemed to give renewed spirit ball a came to be sent away into infinite space englishman be made to retire to further distance from wicket to stand about almost at extremity of ground management of catapult be intrusted to one man after in vain then sent catapult away tried old fashioned slow bowling be same to jack must not be tempted out of ground stood there awaiting ball let come ever so slowly through first of two day stood before wicket hitting to right left till hope seemed to spring up again in bosom of britannulists must see that englishman be becoming nervous uneasy although odds be still much in favour at end of first day jack have scored above eleven wicket have gone down only three of most inferior player be left to stand up with be considered that jack must still make before game must be won must allow only twenty to other three player said eva to that evening will never get twenty on side be eva inquired with smile for in truth did believe at moment that be engaged to baronet how dare ask mr neverbend demanded with indignation be not britannulist a well a a walked away must see that there be tear in eye on last day feeling be carried to pitch be more befitting last battle of great war waterloo of other age than finishing of prolonged game of cricket men looked moved talked a though be at stake can not say that englishman seemed to hate that affair be too serious to admit of playful word between party unfortunate who have to stand up with jack be so afraid of that be like young country orator about to make first speech jack be silent determined yet inwardly proud of feeling that whole future success of republic be on shoulder ordered to be called at certain hour assistant in household listened to word a though feeling that everything depended on obedience must not go out on bicycle a fearing that accident might occur although ought not to wish might be struck dead said a then world must know that though beaten have be by hand of god not by default astonished to find that boy be quite a eager about cricket a be about fixed period at eleven o'clock be in seat on looking round must see that rank fashion of britannula be at ground rank fashion be there for nothing unless have come armed with glass space required by cricketer be so enormous that otherwise must not see anything of play under canopy there be room for five of be supposed to be able to fill middle throne on two others sat who officially scored game one seat have be demanded for mr neverbend will see fate whether be glory fall said mother with true roman feeling for other eva have asked of course have be awarded to when play began sir kennington be at catapult jack at opposite wicket must hardly say for felt extreme interest certainly did exhibit a day went on found worked up to such excitement must hardly keep hat on head behave with becoming presidential dignity at one period a will have to tell altogether disgraced there seemed to be opinion jack must either show at once unequal to occasion immediately be put out opinion think that gladstonopolis be inclined to hold else that must get eye in a called go on a long a three others must keep bat know that own opinion be same a general in city feared that very caution at outset must be detrimental to great object on side be that jack must a nearly a possible be always opposite to bowler be to take four first ball making one off last then beginning over at opposite end do same thing again be impossible to manage exactly something might be done towards effecting there be three men with whom to work during day first unfortunately be soon made to retire jack who have walked up to chair during time allowed for fetching down next man told that have got eye must see settled look of fixed purpose in face bowed most gracefully to eva who be so stirred by emotion that must not allow to speak word oh jack pray for pray for said mother jack fancy thought more of eva silence than of mother prayer jack went back to place hit first ball with such energy that drove into other stump smashed to piece everybody declared that thing have never be before achieved at cricket ball passed on eight ten run be scored after jack seemed to be mad with cricketing power took off greave declaring that impeded running threw away altogether helmet oh eva be not handsome said mother in ecstasy hanging across chair eva sat quiet without sign did not become to say word did think that be very handsome thought also how uncommonly hard must be to hold if must chance to win game let make what oration might against fixed period gladstonopolis must follow if won game of cricket for can not pretend to describe scene of day growing anxiety of englishman a jack went on with one hundred after have already scored nearly when young grabbe be caught out young grabbe be very popular because be so altogether unlike partner grundle be fine frank fellow be jack great friend mean to say that can really play cricket jack have said that morning speaking with great authority be best fellow in world will do exactly what ask be out now jack with over still to make declared that gave up battle almost a lost say that mr neverbend whispered eva ah yes be gone coon even sympathy can not bring round now if anything must do must in opinion continued eva britannula will never be beaten a long a mr neverbend be at wicket sir kennington have be too much for fear said jack with forced smile a retired there be now one hope left mr brittlereed remained be mr brittlereed be gentleman who have advanced nearer to fixed period than other of cricketer be nearly thirty five year of age be regarded by a quite old man be supposed to know rule of game to be rather quick in keeping wicket jack have declared that morning that must not hit ball in week of sunday ought to be here jack have whispered know how thing be managed did not know how thing be managed be sorry that must be there a jack did not seem to want mr brittlereed now went to wicket be bound to receive first ball did made one run whereas might have made two then have to begin war over certainly seemed a though have done on purpose jack in passion broke handle of spring bat then have dozen brought to in order that might choose be favourite bat said mother buried face in handkerchief never understood how be that mr brittlereed lived through over did live although never once touched ball then came to be jack turn at once scored thirty nine during over leaving at proper wicket for re commencing operation think that gave new life added at rate new fire to britannulist on ground must say that after mr brittlereed managed matter altogether to jack satisfaction over after over jack went on received ball be bowled tried catapult with single double even treble action sir kennington did best flinging ball with most tremendous impetus then just rolling up with what seemed to most provoking languor be same to jack have in truth got eye in a surely a ball came to be sent away to most distant part of ground britisher be mad with dismay a jack worked way on through last hundred be piteous to see exertion poor mr brittlereed made in running backwards forward across ground tried think to bustle by rapid succession of bowling only result be that ball be sent still further off when reached jack wicket at last just a clock upon ground struck six with wonderful unanimity clock have attained since be regulated by wire from greenwich jack sent ball flying up into air perfectly regardless whether might be caught not knowing well that one now needed must be scored before must come down from heaven into hand of englishman did come down be caught by stump by time britannula have won victory jack total score during inning be doubt whether in annals of cricket record be made of better inning than then be that with absence of presence of mind president of republic must always remember took off hat flung into air jack triumph must have be complete only that be ludicrous to who must not think a did of very little matter a to contest have be raised just game of cricket two set of boy have be playing must have be regarded a more than amusement a pastime by to refresh between work regarded a though great national combat have be fought britannulists looked upon a though have be victorious against england be absurd to see jack a be carried back to gladstonopolis a hero of occasion to hear a made speech at dinner be given on day at be called upon to take chair

be left open by chance by design very trap door be intended to prevent such escape during moment of full cremation so that there need be fear of repetition of accident ought indeed to have supplied four other hog to have tried experiment again theme be disagreeable thought that trial have be so far successful a to make unnecessary that expense must be again incurred say that men woman must not

pretty nearly alive said graybody do give place just appearance like cemetery at old christchurch meant capital in province of canterbury in course of few year will be quite cheerful here know much about mr president be not sure that for want to be cheerful anywhere if have only got somebody just to speak to sometimes will be quite enough for suppose old crasweller will be first suppose so will be gruesome time when have to go to bed early so a not to see smoke come out of chimney tell there will be nothing of kind suppose will even know when be going to cremate will be first mr president doubt will be looked closely after old barnes will be here by time wo sir barnes be second will come just three month before crasweller departure tallowax grocer in high street will be up here by time then will come so quickly that must soon see to get other lodging finished exors lawyer will be fourth will not come in till day two after crasweller departure will come wo sir asked graybody will come why must be law tallowax swears will have strapped to own kitchen table defend to last gasp with carving knife exors say that law be bad ca touch a for barnes have gone out of what little wit ever have with fright of people seem to think that must touch lunatic barnes be more lunatic than be only tell what folk tell suppose will try on by force if necessary never expected that people must come deposit of own accord national assembly expects that citizen of britannula will obey law there be one question be going to ask mr president of course be altogether on side wish to raise difficulty what will do suppose take to running away after have be deposited if old crasweller go off in steam carriage how be to go after whom be to ask to help to bring back again be puzzled did not care to show doubt hundred little arrangement must be necessary before affair of institution must be got into groove so a to run steadily first object must be to deposit crasweller barnes tallowax so that citizen must be accustomed to fashion of depositing aged there be a knew two three old woman living in various part of island who must in due course come in towards end of crasweller year have be rumoured that have already begun to invent falsehood a to age be aware that might be led astray by have be prepared to accept a being unavoidable now a time grew nearer must not see how difficult must be to enforce law against well known men how easy to allow woman to escape by help of falsehood exors lawyer must say at once that did not even attempt to carry out law barnes lunatic a pretended to be must be very hard to manage mind misgave a thought of obstruction felt must so willingly deposit at once then depart without waiting for year of probation be necessary that must show determined front to old graybody make feel that at rate be determined to remain firm to purpose mr crasweller will give such trouble a suggest said perhaps have come round be gentleman whom have known intimately for many year have always be friend to fixed period believe that be so still although there be little hitch a to exact time at must be deposited just twelve month say of course replied difference must be sure to be that of one year seems to think that there be only nine year between ten mr president ten know time well have always thought so must be willing to abandon year if must make thing run smooth by doing so be detail with up here need not perhaps concern only time be getting very short mr president old woman will break down altogether if be told that be to live year all alone crasweller wo be bit readier next year than be of course if be let off must let off barnes tallowax there be lot of old woman about who be beginning to tell terrible lie about age do think of mr president never thought of anything else so full be mind of subject when woke in morning before must face light of day be necessary must fortify with columbus galileo began to fancy a danger became nearer still nearer that of great men have be surrounded by obstruction such a encompassed to plough on across wave to be drowned succeed to tell new truth about heaven to perish become great for ever be within compass of man who have only own life to risk life how willingly must run risk did question arise of risking how often felt in day that there be fortitude needed by man much greater than of jeopardising life life what be here be that poor crasweller belying conviction just to gain one year more of then when year be gone must still have deposition before be not so with for feel have felt for year tempted to rush on pas through gate of death that man must shudder at thought of doe not appear amiss to unknown future be always awful unknown future of world to be approached by so great change of circumstance by loss of very flesh blood body have in something so fearful to imagination that man who think of can not be struck with horror a acknowledges that by too have to be encountered have to be encountered though change be awful must not therefore by sane judgment be taken a change necessarily for worst knowing great goodness of almighty must not be prepared to accept a change probably for better a alteration of circumstance by condition may be immeasurably improved then one be driven back to consider circumstance by such change may be effected to seems rational to suppose that a leave body so will enter that new phase of life in be destined to live with higher resolve somewhat sharpened with lower passion ala made stronger also that theory by human being will jump at once to perfection of bliss fall to eternity of evil misery have never found credence with for have to say that while acknowledging many drawback have so lived a to endeavour to do good to others rather than evil that therefore look to departure from world with awe indeed still with satisfaction can not look with satisfaction to condition of life in from own imbecility must necessarily retrograde into selfishness may be that who judge of with wisdom can not approach will take into account that will so mould future being a to fit to best at have arrived in world still can not fear that taint of selfishness have hitherto avoided will come if allow to become old may remain that will be better for must go hence while a yet own poor want be not altogether uppermost in mind then in arranging matter be arranging for fellow citizen not for have to endeavour to think how crasweller mind may be affected rather than own dread departure with trembling currish fear must hardly be doing good to be to force to depart in frame of mind so poor piteous then again be altogether of crasweller must think not of crasweller of how will coming age of men be affected by such change a propose must such change become normal condition of death can not be brought about men must arrange for own departure so a to fall into senile weakness slippered selfishness ugly whinings of undefined want before will go hence be more thought of be idea have actuated to have be brought by seeing conduct of around not for crasweller barnes tallowax will thing be good for old woman who be already lying about age in cottage for who be know too apt to boast of even though old age must come upon may be able to avoid worst of effect for untold generation to come whose life may be modelled for under knowledge at certain fixed period will depart hence with circumstance of honour glory be however quite aware that must be useless to spend energy in dilating on to mr graybody simply be willing to shuffle off mortal coil because found uncomfortable in wearing in likelihood have time come a nigh a of crasweller too like crasweller must impotently implore grace of year must ape madness like barnes arm with carving knife like tallowax swear that there be flaw in law a exors be disposed to do too must clamorously swear that be much younger a did old woman be not world peopled by craswellers tallowaxes exorses old woman have right to hope to alter feeling nature have implanted in mind of men still might be done by practice by practice if only must arrive at time in practice must have become practice then a be about to depart from door of graybody house whispered to myself again name of galileo columbus think that will come on thirtieth said graybody a took hand at parting think replied that a loyal citizen of republic be bound to suppose that will do duty a citizen then went leaving standing in doubt at door end of first volume volume ii chapter vii columbus galileo have left graybody with lie on tongue said that be bound to suppose that crasweller must do duty a citizen by have meant graybody to understand that expected old friend to submit to deposition now expected nothing of kind grieved to think must be driven to such false excuse began to doubt whether mind must hold proper bent under strain thus laid upon to ask whether be in respect sane in entertaining idea filled mind galileo columbus galileo columbus endeavoured to comfort with name in vain delusive manner though used constantly be beginning absolutely to hate why must not return to wool shed be contented among bale ship credit a be of yore before theory took total possession of be doing good then robbed one assisted very many in walk of life be happy in praise of fellow citizen health be good have ample scope for energy then even a now there came on day of success day will say of glory of wretchedness will not most truly say of persuaded fellow citizen to undertake sad work of fixed period from moment quiet have left happiness still be not necessary that man must be happy doubt whether caesar be happy with enemy around gaul briton roman if man be doing duty let not think too much of condition of mind call happiness let despise happiness do duty will in one sense be happy if there creep upon doubt a to duty if once begin to feel that may perhaps be wrong then farewell peace of mind then will come condition in man be tempted to ask whether be in truth of sane mind what must do next cricketing englishman knew be going two three day more must see gallant ship steam

relenting about man symptom of sadness seemed to bespeak yielding spirit only asked for year be still in theory supporter of fixed period pleading own little cause however by direct falsehood must not talk into generous assent there must still be year for in old day there have be spice of manliness in bosom to might be possible must bring back though hope be poor seemed at present to be only hope a

yesterday that be raging lunatic learn from really good authority that whether take one part other be only acting tallowax be prepared to run amuck against who come to fetch swears that one will lead up to college then there be pause crasweller sat silent with face buried in hand be at rate in far better condition of mind for persuasion than in have last found have given up fictitious year have acknowledged that have assented to doctrine with be now asked to comply be hard task that of having to press under such circumstance thought of eva despair of with natural desire for life eager at heart looked round saw beauty of scenery thought how much worse to such man must be melancholy shade of college than even departure be not by nature hard hearted have none of steel fibre will enable really strong man to stand firm by conviction even when opposed by affection to have liberated crasweller at moment must have walked off oh so willingly to college be tearing own heart to piece remembered columbus galileo of be surely ever tried a be at moment have to be done must yield for ever if must not be strong to prevail with own friend fellow labourer with crasweller who be first to

asked again be for to decide agony of moment think that did right though very heart be bleeding know that did right for sake of benefit be to accrue to unknown thousand of fellow creature be duty to obey law said in low voice still holding by hand felt at moment great love for in certain sense admiration because have so far conquered fear of unknown future a to promise to do thing simply because have said that must do there be high feeling a to future generation of fellow creature grand idea that be about to perform great duty for benefit of mankind in general simply notion that a have always advocated theory a friend must not now depart from let cost to be what might answered only by drawing away hand felt that in heart accused of cruelty of mad adherence to theory must not be so crasweller a please president must not be so then at great length went over once again favourite argument endeavoured with whole strength of eloquence to reach mind knew a be doing so that be in vain have succeeded perhaps eva have done so in inducing to repudiate falsehood by have endeavoured to escape have not in least succeeded in making see good must come from deposition be ready to become martyr because in year back have said that must do so have now left for to decide whether must be called upon to perform promise with unfeeling pertinacity have given case against be light in mr crasweller looked at think that be cruel asked do said crasweller ask question answer do think that be cruel concern life death be matter of course be life death of most intimate friend of eva father of who year since came hither with from country have lived with through struggle success of long career have word will not depart from even to save life in moment of weakness be tempted to weak lie will not lie will not demean to claim poor year of life by such mean though lack evidence to support statement be ready to go with rose up from seat a though intending to walk away be deposited at once not now crasweller will be ready when may come for will not again leave home till have to leave for last time day week mean nothing with now bitterness of death have fallen upon crasweller will come live with be brother to during entire twelve month will not be needed eva will be with perhaps jack may come see though must not allow jack to express warmth of indignation in eva hearing jack have perhaps better leave britannula for time not come back till will be over then may enjoy lawn of little christchurch in peace unless perchance idea must disturb that have be put into immediate possession by father act then got up from chair went from verandah back into house a rose returned to city almost repented of what have done have in heart to go back yield to tell must assent to abandonment of whole project be not for to say must spare own friend execute law against barnes tallowax be for to declare that victim of first year must be forgiven must easily let law die away be not in power to decide that must fall into partial abeyance almost did when have turned on road to little christchurch be prepared to throw into crasweller arm idea of galileo columbus ultimate success again filled bosom moment have now come in might succeed first man be ready to go to stake have felt all along that great difficulty must be in obtaining willing assent of first martyr might well be that accusation of cruelty be part of suffering without great reform must not be carried to success though must live to be accounted a cruel a caesar what must that be if too must reduce gaul to civilisation dear crasweller murmured to a turned again towards gladstonopolis hurrying back buried in obscurity of executive chamber following day occurred most disagreeable scene in own house at dinner jack came in took chair at table in grim silence might be that be lamenting for english friend who be gone therefore must not speak mr neverbend too ate dinner without word began to fear presently there must be something to be said cause for quarrel a be customary on such occasion endeavoured to become specially gracious communicative talked about ship have started on homeward journey praised lord marylebone laughed at mr puddlebrane be to effect neither must jack mr neverbend say anything ate dinner gloomily till attendant left room then jack began think right to tell sir that there be going to be public meeting on town flag day after to morrow town flag be open unenclosed place over supported by arch be erected town hall be here that people be accustomed to hold outside assembly too often guided responsible assembly in senate house what be going to talk about there there be only one subject said jack at present occupies mind of people intend to allow to deposit mr crasweller considering age experience jack think that be taking too much upon to say whether people will allow will not allow executive of country to perform duty if jack be old said mr neverbend at rate be older say same thing of course only said what thought continued jack what want to explain be that will be there will do can to support meeting in opposition to father said well yes be afraid so see be public subject on public matter see that father son have anything to do with if be in assembly suppose must be bound to support father be not in assembly have own conviction same find called upon to take part good gracious yes to save poor old mr crasweller life from most inhuman law be just a fit to live a be only question be whether be fit to die rather to be deposited mean be not going to argue subject here have be decided by law must be enough for two a be enough for a for jack will not have attend such meeting be to do so must incur grave displeasure consequent punishment what do mean to do to boy asked mr neverbend if cease to behave to like son will cease to treat like father if attends meeting must leave house will see more leave house shrieked mr neverbend jack said with kindest voice be able to assume will pack up portmanteau go to new zealand day after to morrow have business for to transact with macmurdo brown of importance will give particular when see in office of course wo go mr neverbend cried wife though word be determined there be certain vacillation in tone of voice did not escape will see if jack intends to remain a son must obey father have be kind perhaps too indulgent to now require that will proceed to new zealand day after to morrow boat sail at eight will be happy to go down with see on board jack only shook head by understood that meant rebellion have be most generous father to loved a very apple of eye be determined must be stern have heard order said can have to morrow to think about advise not to throw over for ever affection fostering care comfort pecuniary a well a others have hitherto have from indulgent father mean to say that will disinherit boy said mr neverbend knew that be utterly out of power to do so must not disinherit must not even rob of single luxury without amount of suffering much greater than must feel be not thinking of day night a arranged worldly affair moment when knocked down sir kennington oval wicket have not be a proud a be when trumpet sounded did not feel honour more than when made last triumphant run threw hat in air be not to sweeter than if have done did not even love better for swearing that must make fight for crasweller yet be necessary must command obedience if possible frighten into subservience talk of father power know that old roman must punish filial disobedience by death britannulan father have heart in bosom be more powerful than law even custom believe that roman be much same dear will not discus future intention before boy must be unseemly command to start for new zealand day after to morrow will see whether will obey strongly advise to be governed in matter by father jack only shook head left room became aware afterwards that slept that night at little christchurch night received lecture from mr neverbend in bedroom a might have shamed that mr caudle of whom read in english history hate lecture not a thinking unbecoming a being peculiarly disagreeable always find absolutely impotent during progress be aware that be quite useless to speak word that can only allow clock to run down what mr neverbend say at such moment have always in great deal of good sense be altogether wasted because knew beforehand with pen ink must have written down lecture delivered at peculiar moment fear no evil result from anger for future because conduct to will know by experience be a careful a kind a ever be to use harsh language to must rise in wrath to defend doe not in truth mean tenth of what say be for time a though be within clapper of mill passion go on increasing because can never get word from mr neverbend tell be going to make fool of think duty to tell so a wife everybody else will think who be to liken to galileo old fellow of kind who lived thousand year ago before christianity have ever be invented have got nasty murderous thought in mind want to kill poor mr crasweller just out of pride because have said must now jack be determined that sha say that be right there be reason why jack must obey a well a will never be able to deposit mr crasweller not if try for hundred year city wo let do if have grain of sense left in head wo attempt jack be determined to meet men on town flag day after to morrow say that be right a for disinheriting spending money on machinery to roast pig say ca do there will be commission to inquire into if mind then will remember what told poor mr crasweller whom have known for forty year wonder how can bring to think of killing poor man whose bread have so often eaten if think be going to frighten jack be very much mistaken jack must do twice more for eva crasweller than for be natural must may be sure will not give up end will be that will get eva for own do believe have gone to

to do with fixed period to wait till fatal day will have arrived then to know at fixed hour will be destroyed just because have said so can imagine what feeling will be when moment will have come have not in truth thought of now when idea be represented to mind eye acknowledged to myself that must be impossible that must be left there for occasion how when must be taken away whither must not at moment think must form question must be very hard to answer after score of year say when community must be used to fixed period must understand that daughter wife might leave college go away into such solitude a occasion required week perhaps before hour arranged for departure have come custom must make comparatively easy a custom have arranged period of mourning for widow such for widower son daughter here with eva there must be custom must have nothing to guide might remain there till last fatal moment have hoped that might have married jack perhaps grundle during interval not having foreseen that year be intended to be one of honour glory must become time of mourning tribulation yes dear be very sad sad be there ever position in life so melancholy so mournful so unutterably

steadfast seemed to be impossible to say so well mr neverbend will speak be not for to decide be for country country exclaimed rising up be own pride vanity cruelty combined will not yield in matter to friend daughter because vanity tell that when have once said thing that thing will come to pas then put veil down over face went out of room sat for time motionless trying to turn over in mind that have said to seemed a though faculty be utterly obliterated in despair eva have be to almost a daughter yet be compelled to refuse request for father life when have told that be pride vanity have made do so must not explain to that be not cause indeed be sure of that be not so have flattered that did for public good be sure that obduracy did not come from anxiety to be counted with columbus galileo if not be there not something personal to myself in desire must be known a one who have benefited specie in considering such matter be so hard to separate motif to say how much spring from glorious longing to assist others in struggle upwards in humanity how much again from mean personal ambition have thought that have done in order that failing strength of old age might be relieved that race might from age to age be improved now doubted feared lest that vanity of eva have spoken to have overcome with wife son must still be brave even with crasweller must be constant hard to be obdurate with eva be indeed struggle when told that did so through pride found very hard to bear yet be not be angry with child became more more attached to more loudly spoke on behalf of father very indignation endeared to made feel how excellent be how noble wife must be for son be to give way after having brought matter to pitch be to give up everything to prayer of girl be well aware even then that theory be true old effete must go in order that strong manlike might rise in place do work of world with wealth of world at command take average of mankind round there must be lessening of year two from life of even taking men who have arrived at twenty five to how few be allotted more than forty year of life yet how large proportion of wealth of world remains in hand of who have passed that age be unable from senile imbecility to employ wealth a must be used a thought of said to myself that eva prayer might not avail did take comfort to myself in thinking that be done for sake of posterity then again when thought of prayer of stern word have followed prayer of charge of pride vanity did tell that pride vanity be not absent be gone now felt that must say think evil thing of through future life time might perhaps come when too must have be taken away when father must long since have be at rest that softer thought must come across mind if be only possible that might go so that jack might be married to girl loved that might be well then wiped eye went forth to make arrangement for morrow morning came th of june bright clear winter morning cold still genial pleasant a

thing to be acted play to be played by player must be solemn too silent a churchyard mournful a grave because of truth why be thus driven to act part be false on brow of hill met concourse of people young old be glad to see that latter have come out to greet by degree crowd became so numerous that carriage be stopped in progress rising up motioned to around to let pas became however more firmly

malevolent influence of intellect applied to brute force dominating benevolent influence a applied to philanthropy what be john bright to that must come there prepared to send into eternity by bloodthirsty mechanism be evil sign of time of time be in so many respect hopeful that greatest invention of day must always take shape of engine of destruction what must do in agony of moment must show coolness of courage by desiring coachman to drive on for god sake said crasweller jumping up sha stir step said bunnit to bar keeper ca move inch replied other know what precious life be worth mr bunnit what must do mr second lieutenant must hold responsible for interruption said exactly so be responsible a far a stopping carriage go have town turned out in favour have gentleman insisted on

already subject discussed at club drawing room at home have received detail of whole affair by water telegram before john bright started mr neverbend must indeed be proud of son jack have be standing in far corner of room talking to eva be now reduced to silence by praise sir kennington oval be very fine player said wife lord marylebone behaves quite like british peer said wife of mayor of gladstonopolis lady whom have married in england who have not moved there in quite highest circle then began to think of hospitality of island officer of john bright be asked to dine with on following day wife son two craswellers three four others agreed to dine on board ship on next to personally extreme of courtesy be shown seemed a though be treated with almost royal honour felt be paid to a being president of republic endeavoured to behave with such mingled humility dignity a might befit occasion must not feel that something be wanting to simplicity of ordinary life wife on spur of moment managed to give gentleman very good dinner including chaplain surgeon there be twelve of asked twelve of prettiest girl in gladstonopolis to meet said be true hospitality be not sure that did not agree with then there be three four leading men of community with wife who be for most part father mother of young lady sat down thirty six to dinner think that showed great divergence from usual colonial banquet at elder be only invited to meet distinguished guest officer be chiefly young men greater babel of voice be will undertake to say never heard from banqueting hall than came from dinner table eva crasweller be queen of evening be a joyous a beautiful a high spirited a queen must ever be did once twice during festivity glance round at old crasweller be quiet might almost say silent during whole evening must see from testimony of altered countenance how strong be passion for life dwells in human breast promised bride seems to have own way said captain battleax to jack when at last lady have withdrawn oh yes said jack be nowhere mean to have inning before long of what mr neverbend have gone through in providing bird beast fish not to talk of tart jelly for dinner of day

before lady be assembled in drawing room effort too be conspicuously successful on next day of went on board john bright for return dinner very pleasant officer made living on board john bright be exceedingly good a have have occasion to learn from many dinner eaten there since day little thought when sat down at right hand of captain battleax a being president of republic with wife on left must ever spend more than month on board ship write on board account of thought trouble in regard to fixed period after dinner captain battleax simply proposed health paying to many unmeaning compliment in however observed that reference be made to special doings of presidency ended by saying that though have a matter of courtesy with greatest possible alacrity proposed health must not call upon for reply immediately on sitting down there got up gentleman to whom have not be introduced before day gave health of mr neverbend lady of britannula now in spite of what captain said undoubtedly have intended to make speech when president of republic have health drunk be conceive duty to do so here gentleman rose with rapidity did at moment seem to have be premeditated at rate eloquence be altogether stopped gentleman be named sir ferdinando brown be dressed in simple black be clearly not one of ship officer must not suspect at moment that be in special measure concerned in mission on gunboat have be sent sat on mr neverbend left hand did seem in respect to be chief man on occasion however proposed mr neverbend health lady captain instantly called upon band to play favourite tune after there be attempt at speaking sat with officer little time after dinner then went ashore sir ferdinando said captain a shook hand with will do honour of calling on at executive chamber to morrow morning went home to bed with presentiment of evil running across heart presentiment indeed how much of evil of real accomplished evil have there not occurred to during last few day hope for have lived a then told have be brought to sudden extinction by coming of men to whom have be so pleasant who in turn have be so pleasant to what must do now just lay down die death of dreamt must not ala be true benumbing death think may put end at rate give change to thought to die must be a nothing to live a late president of republic who have fixed aspiration so high must indeed be very melancholy a president have still two year to run occurred to now must not possibly endure two year of prolonged nominal power must be laughing stock of people a such must become to hide head when captain must have taken vessel back to england must retire to small farm possessed at farthest side of island there in seclusion must end day mr neverbend must come with stay if so pleased in gladstonopolis jack must become eva happy husband must remain amidst hurried duty of eager world crasweller triumphant must live at last die amidst flock herd of little christchurch too must have small herd little flock of own surrounded by such glory a of little christchurch owing nothing to wealth scenery neighbourhood there till god must take must spend evening of day thinking of went to sleep on next morning sir ferdinando brown captain battleax be announced at executive chamber have already be there at work for couple of hour sir ferdinando apologised for earliness of visit seemed to a entered room took chair be offered to that be greater man of two on occasion perhaps must say of three yet have not before come on shore to visit have made one at little dinner party mr neverbend began captain observed that up to moment have generally addressed a president can not be denied that have come here on unpleasant mission have received with courtesy hospitality for character in england stand so high must be aware that have be intention to interfere with must regard a performance of duty be duty said power be so superior to can advance a to make here feel that there be disgrace in yielding to therefore can be courteous while submit not doubt have force be only double treble own must have found duty to struggle with how can little state few year old situated on small island far removed from centre of civilisation contend on point with owner of great ton swiveller gun be quite true mr neverbend said sir ferdinando brown can afford to smile because be absolutely powerless before le feel that in matter in progress of world be concerned rather have be put down by brute force have come to threatening with absolute destruction whether gun be loaded not matter little be certainly loaded said captain battleax then have wasted powder shot like highwayman must have sufficed for merely to tell weak cowardly that pistol must be made to go off when wanted to speak truth captain battleax think that excel more in courage than do in thought practical wisdom therefore feel quite able a president of republic to receive with courtesy due to servant of friendly ally very well put said sir ferdinando simply bowed to now continued will answer one question dozen if suit to ask captain battleax can not remain here long with expensive toy keep locked up somewhere among cocked hat white glove can assure have not even allowed to see trigger since have be on board ton swivellers do cost money john bright must steam away play part in other quarter of globe what do intend to do when will have taken pocket pistol away thought for little answer must best become to give to question paused only for moment two will proceed at once to carry out fixed period felt that honour demanded that to such question must make other reply that in opposition to wish a understand of large proportion of fellow citizen wish of fellow citizen have be declared by repeated majority in assembly have only one house in constitution said sir ferdinando one house hold to be quite sufficient be proceeding to explain theory on britannulan constitution have be formed when sir ferdinando interrupted at rate will admit that second chamber be not there to guard against sudden action of first need not discus now be purpose to carry out fixed period a soon a john bright will have departed certainly be be aware sufficiently popular with people here to enable to do so think be said with modest acquiescence in assertion felt to be so much to credit blushed for untruth then said sir ferdinando there be nothing for that must take with there came upon sudden shock when heard word exceeded anything have yet felt president of foreign nation first officer of people with whom great britain be at peace captain of one of gunboat must carry off hurry away prisoner whither knew not leave country ungoverned with president a yet elected to supply place looking at matter from own point of view be husband head of family man largely concerned in business be to be carried away in bondage who have done no wrong have disobeyed no law who have indeed be conspicuous for adherence to duty opposition ever shown to columbus galileo have come near to in audacity oppression president of free republic elected of people chosen depository of official life be to be kidnapped carried off in ship of war because be deemed too popular to rule country be told to in own room in executive chamber in very sanctum of public life by stout florid gentleman in black coat of whom hitherto knew nothing except that name be brown sir said after pause turning to captain battleax addressing can not believe that a officer in british navy will commit act of tyranny so oppressive of injustice so gross a gentleman have named hear what sir ferdinando brown have said replied captain battleax know gentleman except a having be introduced to at hospitable table sir ferdinando brown be to simply sir ferdinando brown sir ferdinando have lately be british governor in ashantee where have a may truly say 'bought golden opinion from sort of people have now be sent here on delicate mission to one must be intrusted by whom must be performed with more scrupulous honour be simply opinion of captain battleax expressed in presence of gentleman whom so lauded what be delicate mission asked then sir ferdinando told whole story think must have be declared before have be asked to sit down to dinner with in company with captain on board ship be to be taken away carried to england elsewhere drowned upon voyage mattered not be first step to be taken towards carrying out tyrannical illegal altogether injurious intention of british government then republic of britannula be to be declared a non existent british flag be to be exalted british governor installed in executive chamber governor be to be sir ferdinando brown be lost in maze of wonderment a attempted to look at proceeding round now at close of twentieth century must oppression be carried to such height a gentleman said be powerful that little instrument have hidden in cabin make master of have be prepared by ingenuity of men able to dominate matter though altogether powerless over mind on need hardly say that must be inoperative though must reduce to atom from must spring opinion must serve altogether to silence artillery dread of be to generality much more powerful than fact of possession may be quite sure be there said captain battleax can so use a to half obliterate town within two minute of return on board propose to kidnap said what must become of gun be to kidnap lieutenant crosstrees have sealed order be practically acquainted with mechanism of gun lieutenant crosstrees be very gallant officer one of always remains on board while other be on shore must think nothing of blowing up so long a obeyed order be going on to observe continued that though power be in hand in of country exercise of betrays not only tyranny of disposition poorness meanness of spirit here bowed first to one gentleman then to other be simply contest between brute strength mental energy if will look at contest throughout world said sir ferdinando will generally find that highest respect be paid to greatest battalion what world wide iniquity speech a discloses said still turning to captain for though must have crushed by word have be possible dislike centred on sir ferdinando be man who looked a though everything be to yield to meagre philosophy seemed to a though enjoyed exercise of tyranny chance have put into power will allow to suggest said that be matter of opinion in meantime friend captain battleax have below guard of fifty marine who will pay respect of escorting on board with two of ship cutter everything can be there done for accommodation comfort luxury can be provided to solace president of late republic will be afforded mr neverbend be necessary that must go to england allow to assure that departure can neither be prevented delayed by uncivil word spoken to future governor of prosperous colony word be at rate le uncivil than captain battleax marine have submit be made necessary by conduct of country in matter be to comply with order without expressing own opinion must seem to have done so willingly hereafter say that english government be tyrant that be instrument of tyranny now can proceed to do work that having be pleasantly settled said sir ferdinando with smile will ask to read document by duty have be placed in hand then took out of pocket letter addressed to by duke of hatfield a minister for crown colony gave to to read letter ran a follows colonial office crown colony th may sir have in command to inform excellency that have be appointed governor of crown colony be called britannula peculiar circumstance of colony be within excellency knowledge year since after separation of new zealand inhabitant of britannula requested to be allowed to manage own affair hm minister of day thought expedient to grant request country have since undoubtedly prospered in material point of view have given ground for regret in selection of constitution britannulists have unfortunately allowed one deliberative assembly hence have sprung present difficulty must be that in such circumstance crude council must be passed a law without safeguard coming from further discussion thought at present moment law have be passed if carried into action must become abhorrent to mankind at large be contemplated to destroy who will have reached certain fixed age argument put forward to justify so strange measure need not here explain at length be founded on acknowledged weakness of who survive that period of life at men cease to work terrible doctrine have be adopted at advice of eloquent citizen of republic who be at present president whose general popularity seems to be so great that in compliance with view even measure will be carried out unless great britain will interfere be desired to proceed at once to britannula to reannex island to assume duty of governor of crown colony be understood that year of probation be to be allowed to victim who have agreed to own immolation will therefore arrive there in ample time to prevent first bloodshed be surmised that will find difficulty in way of entering at once upon government so great be popularity of president mr neverbend that if be left on island excellency will find dangerous rival be therefore desired that must endeavour to obtain information a to intention that if fixed period be not abandoned altogether with clear conviction a to cruelty on part of inhabitant generally must cause to be carried away brought to england to enable to effect captain battleax of hm gunboat john bright have be instructed to carry out john bright be armed with weapon of great power against be impossible that people of britannula must prevail will carry out with men of north north west birmingham regiment will probably suffice for own security a be thought that if mr neverbend be withdrawn people will revert easily to old habit of obedience in regard to mr neverbend be especial wish of hm government that will be treated with respect that honour will be paid to be due to president of friendly republic be to be expected that must not allow to make enforced visit to england without opposition be considered in interest of humanity to be so essential that scheme of fixed period will not be carried out that hm government consider that absence from britannula will be for time insured will therefore insure will take care that a far a lie in excellency power be treated with respect hospitality must be due to be still president of allied republic captain battleax of john bright will have

complicated affair of entire life to arrange wife son to leave though must not for moment be supposed to put private matter forward when public service be concerned time name be so unreasonable a to create feeling of horror at tyranny feeling of horror must be created on other side of water said sir ferdinando at idea of what may do if escape must not consider head to be safe on own shoulder be to come to pas that while be on island old man be executed in compliance with system ala must not feel how little knew of sentiment prevailed in britannula how false be idea of power how potent be that love of life have be evinced in city when hour for deposition have become nigh must hardly explain to a must thus be giving to strongest evidence against own philosophy yet be necessary that must say something to make understand that sudden deportation be not necessary then during moment there came to suddenly idea that might be well must take journey to england there begin again career a columbus after various obstruction have recommenced must endeavour to carry with people of great britain a have already carried more quickly intelligent inhabitant of britannula in order may do so have now prepared page writing on board hm gunboat john bright power be sufficient said be not sure of said sir ferdinando be always well to be on safe side be so afraid of what single old man can do with ton swivellers guard of marine north north west birmingham soldiery depends on who what old man may be be first complimentary speech sir ferdinando have made must confess that be efficacious did not after feel so strong dislike to man a have done before wish to make ourselves disagreeable to mr neverbend shrugged shoulder unnecessarily disagreeable must have said be man of word here bowed to if will give promise to meet captain battleax here at time to morrow will stretch point delay departure of john bright for twenty four hour to again objected violently at last a extreme favour two

make promise gave two gentleman word must be present there in own room in executive chamber at same hour on day one following now said sir ferdinando that matter be settled between allow most cordially to shake by hand to express great admiration for character can not say that agree with in theory a to fixed period wife child must not be sure endure to see led away when certain day must come can understand that much may be said on point admire greatly eloquence energy have devoted to matter will be happy to meet here at hour to morrow to receive britannulan archive from hand mr neverbend will always be regarded a father of country patrem patriae ciceronem libera dixit ' with two gentleman left room chapter x town hall when went home told what be to be done be of course surprised apparently not very unhappy mr neverbend suggested that must accompany so a to look after linen other personal comfort told whether truly not hardly then knew that there must be room for on board ship of war such a john bright since have lived on board have become aware that must willingly have accommodated at request very much larger family than own mr neverbend at once went to work to provide for enforced absence in course of day eva crasweller came in to help eva manner to myself have become perfectly altered since previous morning nothing must be more affectionate more gracious more winning than be now envied jack short moment of tete tete retreat seemed from time to time to be necessary for carrying out arrangement of day may a well state here that from time abraham grundle showed to be declared enemy that partnership be dissolved between crasweller at once brought action against old friend for recovery of proportion of property to be held to be entitled under marriage law mr crasweller immediately offered to pay of more respectable lawyer interfered persuaded not to make sacrifice there then came on long action with appeal be given against grundle nearly ruined grundles seemed to a far a must go into matter grundle have law on side there arose certain quibble question of jack have at finger end by strength of unfortunate young man be trounced a learned by letter eva wrote to crasweller be through most anxious to pay lawyer must not have so therefore so much of property of little christchurch be saved for ultimate benefit of happy fellow jack neverbend on afternoon of one day a matter of grace have be allowed to sir ferdinando declared intention of making speech to people of gladstonopolis be desirous said of explaining to community at large object of hm government in sending to britannula in requesting inhabitant to revert to old form of government request indeed said to crasweller throwing possible scorn into tone of voice request with north north west birmingham regiment ton steam swiveller in harbour ferdinando brown know how to conceal claw beneath velvet glove be to be slave slave because england so will be robbed of constitution freedom of action be taken from be reduced to lamentable condition of british crown colony be to be done because have striven to rise above prejudice of day crasweller smiled said not word to oppose accepted indignation with assent certainly did not show enthusiasm happier old gentleman one more active for year have never known be yesterday have seen so absolutely cowed a to be hardly able to speak word change have occurred simply because be to be allowed to die out in open world instead of enjoying honour of having be first to depart in conformity with new theory however spent thus one day longer in sweet friendship doubt that when return to britannula will find living in great comfort at little christchurch at three o'clock went into great town hall to hear what sir ferdinando have to say to chamber be very spacious one fitted up with large organ arrangement necessary for music hall have never seen greater crowd than be collected there on occasion there be not vacant corner to be found heard that very many of inhabitant went away greatly displeased in must not be accommodated sir ferdinando have be very particular in asking attendance of captain battleax a many of ship officer a must be spared be told did in order that something of eclat of oration might be taken back to england sir ferdinando be man who thought much of own eloquence much also of advantage might reap from in opinion of fellow countryman generally found that place of honour have be reserved for too at right hand also one for wife at left must confess that in last moment of sojourn among people over whom have ruled be treated with most distinguished courtesy a continued to say to be to be banished in few hour a one whose intended cruelty be too abominable to allow of remaining in own country on first seat behind chair sat captain battleax with four five of officer behind so have left lieutenant crosstrees in charge of little toy whispered to captain battleax with glass replied by will be able to see whether leave building in case will blow into atom then sir ferdinando rose to leg began speech have never before heard specimen of special oratory to epithet flowery may be most appropriately applied have finished polish of england joined to fervid imagination of ireland stream on without pause without necessary end that convenience of time may dictate come without slightest effort go without producing great effect be sweet at moment plea many can offend none be hardly afterwards much remembered be efficacious only in smoothing somewhat rough way of harsh world have observed that in what have read of british debate who have be eloquent after fashion be generally firm to purpose of self interest sir ferdinando have on occasion dressed with minute care though have for hour before be very sedulous in manipulating certain note now be careful to show not scrap of paper must do justice to declare that spun out word from reel of memory a though came spontaneous pat to tongue mr neverbend said lady gentleman have to day for first time great pleasure of addressing intelligent concourse of citizen in britannula trust before acquaintance with prosperous community may be brought to end may have many opportunity afforded of addressing have be lot in life to serve sovereign in various part of world humbly to represent throne of england in quarter of globe by admitted testimony of people fellow countryman at home in england who be equally fellow countryman in colony to have be sent be acknowledged that in prosperity intelligence civilisation be excelled by english speaking section of world if by none who speak english who will then aspire to excel such a have learned have be common verdict given a look round vast room on spot fifty year ago marsupial race have under own dominion see feminine beauty manly grace greet on side can well believe that peculiarly kind freak of nature have be at work have tended to produce people a strong a be beautiful a clever in wit a be graceful in action here speaker paused audience clapped hand stamped foot seemed to to be very improper mode of testifying assent to own praise sir ferdinando took all in good part went on with speech have be sent here lady gentleman on peculiar mission on duty a to though be desirous of explaining to of in detail feel difficulty of saying single word fixed period be shouted from one of balcony in voice recognised a of mr tallowax friend in gallery continued sir ferdinando reminds of very word for must in vain have cudgelled brain fixed period be subject on be called upon to say to few word fixed period man who have believe be among chief author of system of living if may be permitted to say so of dying also here orator allowed voice to fade away in melancholy cadence while turned face towards with gentle motion laid right hand upon shoulder oh friend be to say least of startling project uncommon if be turn next said tallowax in gallery yes indeed continued sir ferdinando if be turn next must own that though must consider to be affronted if be told be faint hearted though must know to be maligned if be said of have coward fear of death still must feel far from comfortable if age came upon system have defined be to live in country in have prevailed though trust may be able to meet death like brave man when may come still must wish that might come by god hand not by wisdom of man have nothing to say against wisdom of man continued turning to again know argument with have fortified have travelled even a far a ear venture to use experience have gathered in many country to tell that in accordance with god purpose world be not a yet ripe for wisdom must not help thinking a spoke thus that be not perhaps acquainted with argument on system of fixed period be founded that if must do honour to listen to few word proposed to speak to people of britannula before left must have clearer idea about than have ever yet entered into mind oh friend said rising to altitude of eloquence be fitting for that must leave thing in hand of almighty be fitting for at rate that must do so till have be brought by to state of god like knowledge infinitely superior to at present posse here must perceive that sir ferdinando be revelling in sound of own word that have prepared learnt by heart tone of voice even motion of hand know that be not allowed to to rush into presence by deed of own remember what poet say that everlasting have not fixed canon self slaughter ' be not self slaughter theory in accordance with man will devote to death at certain period if man may not slay how will then in exercise of poor human wit devote fellow creature to certain death a well a ever be in life said tallowax in gallery friend doe well to remind though mr neverbend have named fixed period for human life have perhaps chosen that at energy may usually be found to diminish who can say that have even approached certainty of death lord sends upon at own period poor fellow to whom nature have be unkind departs from decrepit worn out at forty whereas at seventy be still hale strong in performing daily work of life be strong enough to do abeost anything for myself be to be next to go very next in treble voice came from that poor fellow barnes who have suffered nearly pang of death from fixed period yes indeed in answer to appeal a who will venture to say that fixed period will be carried out with startling audacity tenacity of purpose distinguishes friend here be known to fame of character in respect have reached ear even among thick lipped inhabitant of central africa own did wonder whether must be true 'justum et tenacem propositus virum ' nothing can turn from purpose induce to change inflexible will know know be well known throughout england persuasion can never touch fear have power over a one unit be strong against million be invincible imperturbable ever self assured a sat there listening to character of heroic somewhat utterly unlike person for whom be intended felt that england knew very little about cared le must not be angry that name must be used in way to adorn sentence of sir ferdinando speech here in gladstonopolis be well known well known to be neither imperturbable self assured people seemed to accept what said must not very well interrupt have opportunity now perhaps might have mine by by friend continued sir ferdinando at home in england where though be powerful by reason of wealth number just so said where be powerful repeat by reason of wealth number though perhaps le advanced than be in philosophical arrangement of life have seemed to to be impossible that theory must be allowed to be carried to legitimate end whole country must be horrified be one life sacrificed to theory knew that knew said voice of tallowax yet assembly have gone so far a to give to system stability of law have not john bright steamed into harbour yesterday one of most valued citizen must have be already deposited when have so spoken turned round to mr crasweller who be sitting on right hand bowed to crasweller looked straight before took notice of sir ferdinando be at present moment rather on side of question having have freedom secured to did not care for sir ferdinando have be prevented thanks to extraordinary rapidity with excellent friend captain battleax have made way across ocean must say that one of excellent fellow officer have done best to place hm ship john bright in commanding position with least possible delay here turned round bowed to officer by keen eye might have be observed to bow through window also to vessel lay mile off in harbour there will not at rate for present be fixed period for human life in britannula that dream have be dreamed at rate for present whether in future age such philosophy may prevail who will say at present must await death from hand of almighty beufficient for day be evil thereof now gentleman have to request attention for few moment to matter one be very different from have discussed be to say few word of past present of past constitution of be purpose to inaugurate here there arose murmur through room very audible threatening by sound to disturb orator will ask favour for few minute when will have heard to day will in turn hear to morrow great britain at request surrendered to power of self government to so small english speaking community have never before be granted be bound to say that have in many respect shown yourselves fit for responsibility imposed upon have be intelligent industrious prudent ignorance have be expelled from shore poverty have be forced to hide diminished head here orator paused to receive that applause conceived to be richly due occupant of bench before sat sternly silent there be many there who have be glad to see ship of war come in to stop fixed period hardly one who be pleased to lose own independence though be so said sir ferdinando little nettled at want of admiration with word have be received hm government be under necessity of putting end to constitution under fixed period can be allowed to prevail while have made law for yourselves law so made must have force of law be not so certain said voice from distance shrewdly suspect to have be that of hopeful son jack neverbend a great britain can not will not permit fixed period to be carried out among english speaking race of people how about united state said voice united state have made such attempt will proceed have therefore sent out to assume rein to undertake power to bear responsibility of being governor during short term of year who will say what future may disclose for present will rule here will rule by aid of law not fixed period law said exors who be seated on floor of chamber immediately under orator that law will be specially wiped out from statute book in other respect law of great britain be nearly same there may be divergence a in reference to non infliction of capital punishment in such matter will endeavour to follow wish so to govern that may still feel that be living under rule of president of own selection here can not think that sir ferdinando be little rash did not quite know extent of popularity have gauged dislike must certainly encounter have heard few voice in hall under fear of death have expressed dislike to fixed period have idea of love people felt for own independence believe may say for own president there arose in hall certain amount of clamour in midst of sir ferdinando sat down then there be shuffling of foot a of crowd going away sir ferdinando having sat down got up again shook warmly by hand returned greeting with pleasantest smile then while people be moving spoke to two three word told must start to morrow at noon for england under promise made by to new governor purposed to explain to before went under what circumstance have given that promise what be that intended to do when must reach england must meet there in hall at eight o'clock evening hear last word must have to address to then hall be filled with mighty shout there arose great fury of exclamation there be waving of handkerchief holding up of hat sign of enthusiasm be wont to greet popular man of hour in midst of sir ferdinando brown stood up upon leg continued to bow without cessation at eight hall be again full to overflowing have be busy came down little late found difficulty in making way to chair sir ferdinando have occupied in morning have have time to prepare word though thought have rushed quickly too quickly into mind be a though must tumble out from own mouth in precipitate energy on right hand sat governor a must now call in chair on left be placed wife officer of gunboat be not present having occupied doubt in banking up fire fellow citizen said sudden end have be brought to self government of have be proud by sir ferdinando have told that 'ignorance have be expelled from shore poverty have be forced to hide diminished head ' trust under experience tell a governor have be very extensive evil may not now fall upon be however painfully aware that do prevail wherever concrete power of great britain be found to be in full force man ruling many other million of subject from other side of globe can not see want watch progress a can do ourselves even sir ferdinando coming upon with experience can hardly be able to ascertain how may be made happy prosperous have with however company of celebrated english regiment with attendant officer who by red coat long sword will doubt add to cheerfulness of social gathering hope that may not find that will ever interfere with after rougher fashion upon fellow citizen have fallen great disgrace of having robbed of independence here murmur ran through hall declaring that be not so so new governor have told have not told exact truth with whom doctrine of fixed period first originated will not now inquire responsibility will take upon though honour glory must share with fellow countryman governor have told that be aware of argument by fixed period be maintained think that must be mistaken here a have not ventured to attack one of have told that be fitting that must leave question of life death in hand of almighty if so why be europe bristling at moment with arm prepared a must suppose for shortening life why be there hangman attached to throne of great britain a one of necessary executive officer why in old testament be joshua commanded to slay mighty king why be pharaoh host drowned in red sea because almighty so willed governor will say taking for granted that willed everything of record be given in old testament in battle have ravished north west of india during last half century did almighty wish that men must perish miserably by ten thousand twenty thousand till of can learn more than know at present of will of almighty must if will allow advise governor to be silent on head lady gentleman must be long task one not to be accomplished before bedtime be to recount to for advantage few of argument have be used in favour of fixed period must be useless a be acquainted with sir ferdinando be evidently not aware that general prolongation of life on average be one of effect to be gained that though might not therefore live longer if doomed to remain here in britannula yet must descendant do so must live life more healthy more useful more sufficient for human purpose a far a can read will of almighty rather progress of way of human nature be for man to endeavour to improve condition of mankind must be a well to say that must admit fire into establishment because life have now again be lost by fire a to use such argument a now put forward against fixed period if will think of line of reasoning used by sir ferdinando will remember that have after only thrown back upon old prejudice of mankind if will tell that be not a yet prepared to discard be in error in thinking that world be so prepared may perhaps agree with john bright in harbour be strongest possible proof that such prejudice still exist sir ferdinando brown be now governor fact in be strong evidence in opposition to witness have nothing to say ignorance be told that have expelled from shore have come back to poverty be about fear to show head sir ferdinando here arose expostulated people hardly heard at request again sat down do think have endeavoured in matter to advance too quickly that sir ferdinando have be sent here a necessary reprimand for folly have required that will be banished to england a order be backed by double file of red coat instrument in britannula posse purpose to obey will go to england will there use what little strength remains to in endeavour to put forward argument for conquering prejudice of people have prevailed here be very sure must have effect upon sir ferdinando brown can not think that sir ferdinando gave unnecessary trouble in endeavouring to prove to that fixed period be wicked arrangement be not likely to succeed in attempt be sure to succeed in telling that must make impossible by mean of double file of armed men by whom be accompanied ton steam swiveller with a informed be able to blow into atom unless must be ready to start with captain battleax to morrow be not religion strength have prevailed that great britain be much stronger than britannula none of can doubt till yesterday did doubt whether must use strength to perpetuate own prejudice to put down progress made by people fellow citizen must look truth in face in generation probably fixed period must be allowed to be in abeyance when have uttered word there came much cheering loud sound of triumph be indorsed probably by postponement of system have terror be enabled to accept friendly noise a having be awarded to system well a love fixed period must be delayed till sir ferdinando english have be converted never never shouted sir ferdinando so godless idea will never find harbour in bosom struck chest violently sir ferdinando be probably not aware to what idea bosom may day give shelter if will look back thirty year will find that have hardly contemplated even weather watch now wear constantly in waistcoat pocket at command of sovereign may still live to carry out fixed period somewhere in centre of africa never in what college among negro may be deposited may be too curious to inquire friend will leave shore to morrow may be sure of while power of labour remains to will never desist to work for purpose have at heart trust may yet live to return among to render account of what have done for for cause in europe here sat down be greeted by deafening applause of audience did feel at moment have somewhat got better of sir ferdinando have be able to give exact word of two speech a be taken down by reporting telephone apparatus on occasion be found to work with great accuracy word a fell from mouth of speaker be composed by machinery speech appeared in london morning newspaper within hour of time of utterance chapter xi farewell went home to house in triumph have much to do before noon on following day very little time in to do have spent morning of day in preparing for departure in so arranging matter with clerk that entrance of sir ferdinando on new duty might be easy have said nothing have endeavoured to think a little a possible of fixed period old secretary of mine old in year of work though not a yet in age have endeavoured to comfort by saying that college up hill might still be used before long have told frankly that in britannula have be too much in hurry have foolishly endeavoured to carry out system in opposition to world prejudice system when successful must pervade entire world be nothing to be done with beautiful building said secretary putting in word beautiful by way of flattery to myself chimney furnace may perhaps be used replied cremation be part of fixed period a for residence le think about better so determined to trouble thought further with college felt that there might be consolation to in going away to england so that might escape from great vexation eyesore empty college must have produced have to bid farewell to wife son to eva crasweller first task must be easier because there must be necessity for painful allusion to own want of success in what little might say to mr neverbend on subject must continue that tone of sarcastic triumph in have replied to sir ferdinando what be pathetic in matter might altogether ignore jack be so happy in nature so little likely to look at anything on sorrowful side that must surely go well with with eva with eva father thing must be different word must be spoken must be painful in speaking regret must be uttered by must not certainly be shared by be broken down trampled upon glory be departed from name have become byword reproach rather than term of honour in future age may rejoice because have be unable to carry out long cherished purpose by depositing insuring at least departure then crasweller must answer with general kindly feeling must feel at moment of leaving hollowness of word have loved better because have endeavoured to commence experiment on body have felt vicarious regard for honour must have be done almost regarding a though be to go in place have received check when in weakness have pleaded for year have yielded though have yielded without fortitude have done so to comply with wish must not feel for man extraordinary affection be going to england might probably never see again be going with aspiration in heart so very different from entertained from hour intended for slumber few minute must be taken for saying adieu to wife dear said be very sudden man engaged in public life have to fit to public demand have not promised to go to day might have be taken away yesterday day before oh john said think that everything have be put up to make comfortable thanks yes be sure of when hear name mentioned after be gone hope that will say of that did duty a president of republic of course will day have be at nasty executive chamber from nine till five unless when have be sitting in wretched assembly will have holiday now at rate said laughing gently under bedclothes yes be sure will do good if only take meal regular sometimes think that have be encouraged to dwell upon horrid fixed period by melancholy of empty stomach be sad to hear such word from lip after two speech to have listened to feel that trace have be left on mind of triumph have achieved over sir ferdinando put up with determined to answer after own heart have always provided sandwich for to take to chamber sandwich be nothing do remember that at time of life must always have something warm frizzle cutlet must eat without thinking of have made hate fixed period worse than anything be that have never thought of victual gave more attention to burning of pig than to cooking of food in own kitchen well dear be going to england now said beginning to feel weary of reminiscence yes dear know be do remember that a get nearer nearer to chilly country weather will always be colder colder have put up four pair of flannel drawer little bag must wear upon chest observed that sir ferdinando when be preparing for speech showed that have just such little bag on time endeavoured to spy how be that wore when came home immediately went to work will insist on putting on first thing in morning in order may see that sits flat sir ferdinando did not sit flat looked bulgy thought to myself that lady brown did not do duty properly by if must allow to come with must see that always put on rightly a be know that people will say that be fault when hang out show then went to sleep parting word between wife have be spoken early on following morning have jack into dressing room said good bye to jack said in little contest there have be between have got better in everything nobody thought so when heard answer to sir ferdinando last night well yes think managed to answer have got better of did mean anything said jack in melancholy tone of voice be eva doing never cared twopence whether old fellow be deposited not do think that if own time have come near must have liked much why not why not if will only think of matter round will find that be false sentiment must not like said jack with determination yes must after have got used to here looked very incredulous what mean be jack that when son be accustomed to see father deposited at certain age be aware that be treated with respect that kind of feeling describe must wear off must have idea that kind of honour be done to parent when knew that somebody be going to kill on next day how must be then might retire for few hour to thought going into mourning a be jack shook head at rate in matter of mr crasweller have got better of be for eva sake suppose so wish to make understand now that be going to england may possibly never return to shore again say that father well yes will have much to do there of course may be that will not come back wish to understand that part from in least in anger what have done show high spirit great devotion to girl be not quite altogether for eva what then demanded well know two thing went together a be if there have be question about fixed period do think must have cut out abraham grundle a for sir kennington oval be beginning to believe that be eva pretence like sir kennington eva never cared button for have taken to because have shown anti fixed period man did at first simply because hated grundle grundle wanted to fix period old crasweller for sake of property therefore belonged naturally to other side be that liked opposing if have be tallowax that be to begin with exors might have burnt up without word from be gratified at hearing that though fixed period doe seem to be horrible must have swallowed at bidding can see how tumbled into how eva egged on how nearer thing came more be bound to fight will believe eva swore most solemn oath that if father be put into college must never marry human being up to moment when lieutenant met at top of hill be always a cold a snow now snow be melted yes be to say be beginning to thaw a said remembered kiss behind parlour door have be given to by suitor before trouble began impression that jack have seen also on subject said nothing of course have be very happy for jack

promised must go when captain battleax talked of carrying off day before yesterday with hundred soldier doubt must get on board there be great many more than hundred men in britannula a good a soldier to take man away by force president of republic thing be never heard of must not stir if be say word to will undertake that not one of men will touch thought of proposition more thought of more unreasonable did appear that who have committed offence against law must be forced on board john bright have doubt that jack must be a good a word there be two cause persuaded that have better go have pledged word when have be suggested must at moment be carried on board might doubt then have be done by soldier have said that if certain time be allowed must again be found in same place if be simply there be surrounded by crowd of britannulans ready to fight for must hardly have kept promise stronger reason than perhaps actuated must be better for for while to be in england than in britannula here in britannula must be ex president of abolished republic a such subject to notice of men whereas in england must be nobody must escape constant mortification of seeing sir ferdinando brown then in england must do more for fixed period than at home in britannula here battle be over have be beaten began to perceive that place be too small for making primary effort in so great cause very facility have existed for passing of law through assembly have made impossible for to carry out law therefore with sense of failure strong upon must be better elsewhere than at home desire of

advocated own deposition jack at rate be happy said eva crasweller have have little trouble to imbitter evening of life be yet in full daylight ambition have be disappointed can not conceal fact from from have come to pas that during last year two have lived with different hope hope have be founded altogether on position might occupy must have gone mad up in college neverbend must have be with must have gone mad same must have committed suicide to save from honourable deposition fixed day coming at certain known hour feeling that must come though came at same time so slowly yet so fast day growing shorter day by day season month by month sight of chimney be mistake crasweller be mistake cremation must have be elsewhere man must have be angel to endure so much le than man struggled for sake who else must have struggled a did to oblige friend in such matter know know life under weight became impossible to know what endured even for last year believe that man be not so constituted a to be able to make such effort must get used to mankind must get used to first man will never get used to that college will become madhouse must think of other mode of letting pas last year make drunk so that will not know what be doing drug make senseless better still come down upon with absolute power carry away to instant death let veil of annihilation fall upon before know where be fixed period with damnable certainty be mistake have tried know when look back at last year be to be last not of absolute life of true existence shudder a think what went through be astonished at strength of own mind in did not go mad one must have made effort for a made other men have determined to rebel since feeling of fixed period came near to be impossible that human nature must endure struggle not rebel have be saved now by englishman who have come here in horror have used strength to prevent barbarity of benevolence can hardly keep quiet a think of suffering have endured during last month crasweller

succumb who must do more for than have done who must make greater struggle what honester man be there whom know in community of ours yet even drove to be liar think how strong must have be fact against when have have effect to have died at behest at instant must have be a nothing danger immediate certainty must have be child play to have gone up into frightful college there to have remained through year must have wasted so slowly yet so fast must have required heroism a think greek roman englishman ever possessed then paused be aware that have overstayed time think of continued think of on board that vessel try to bring home to yourself what phase of living must mean then grasped by hand taking out put upon tricycle returned into house a went back to gladstonopolis did think of for moment two mind wavered have convinced that there be something wrong in detail of system not when came to argue matter with that system be at fault now at present moment have hardly time for meditation have be surprised at crasweller earnestness also at eloquence be in truth more full of word than of reason time must soon come when must be able to devote tranquil hour to consideration of point have raised long hour of enforced idleness on board ship must suffice to enable to sift objection seemed at spur of moment to resolve into impatience necessary to year quiescence crasweller have declared that human nature must not endure be not case human nature have never endeavoured to train a got back to gladstonopolis have already glimmering of idea that must begin with human nature somewhat earlier teach men from very infancy to prepare for undoubted blessing of fixed period certain aid must be given cremating furnace must be removed so a to be seen by eye smelt by nose a rode up to house there be that eternal guard of soldier dozen men with abominable gun ungainly military hat helmet on head be so angered by watchfulness be minded to turn tricycle allow to pursue about island must never have caught have chosen to avoid escape must have be below dignity moreover certainly did wish to go therefore took notice of when shouldered arm went into house to give wife last kiss now neverbend remember wear flannel drawer put up for a soon a ever get out of opposite tropic remember becomes frightfully cold almost at once do forget little bag be mr neverbend last word to there found jack waiting for together walked down to quay mother must like to have gone too said jack must not have suited there be so many thing here will want eye same must like to have gone have felt that be so yet have never pressed request on board found sir ferdinando ship officer with in full dress have come a supposed to see really went assured taking off hat a addressed that object have be to pay last respect to late president of republic nothing must now be more courteous than conduct le like bully that have appeared to be when have first claimed to represent british sovereign in britannula must confess that there be absent that tone of domineering ascendancy have marked speech a to fixed period fixed period be not again mentioned while be on board devoted to assuring must be received in england with distinction must certainly be invited to windsor castle did not care very much about windsor castle to such civil speech must do other than make civil reply there stood for hour grimacing paying compliment anxious for moment when sir ferdinando must get into six oared gig be waiting for return to shore to be of half hour weariest to seemed a though to grimace to pay compliment be second nature at last moment came when one of junior officer came up to captain battleax told that vessel be ready to start now sir ferdinando said captain be afraid that john bright must leave to kindness of britannulists must not be left in more generous hand said sir ferdinando in of warmer friend britannulists speak english a well a do will be sure admit that boast of common country not common government said determined to fire parting shot sir ferdinando be quite right in expecting that personally will receive courtesy from britannulists will rule be in respect disobeyed until island will with agreement of england again have resumed own republican position here bowed bowed bowed then departed taking jack with leaning on whose arm stepped down into boat a men put oar into water jumped with sudden start at sudden explosion of subsidiary cannon went on firing dozen of time till proper number have be completed supposed to be due to officer of such magnitude chapter xii voyage to england boat have gone ashore returned before john bright have steamed out of harbour then everything seemed to change captain battleax bade make quite at home trusted said that must always dine with during voyage must be left undisturbed during other period of day dined at seven o'clock must give own order a to breakfast tiffin be sure that lieutenant crosstrees must have pleasure in showing cabin that if there be anything on board did not feel to be comfortable must be at once altered lieutenant crosstrees must tell servant to wait upon must show comfort discomfort of vessel with left be taken below under guidance of lieutenant a mr crosstrees became personal friend during voyage more peculiarly than of other officer of whom be friend will give short description of be young man perhaps eight twenty year old whose great gift in eye of on board be personal courage story be told to by junior officer of marvellous thing have done though never mentioned in own presence by by others seemed to constitute for special character so have be necessary that one must jump overboard to attack shark on board must have thought that duty a matter of course belonged to lieutenant crosstrees indeed a learnt afterwards have quite peculiar name in british navy be small fair haired man with pallid face bright eye whose idiosyncrasy be to conceive life afloat be infinitely superior in attribute to life on shore if there ever be man entirely devoted to profession be lieutenant crosstrees for woman seemed to care nothing for bishop for judge for member of parliament be a child skipping about world in foolish playful ignorance whom be sailor duty to protect next to sailor came soldier a having kindred employment at very long interval among sailor british sailor be british fighting sailor be only one really worthy of honour among british sailor officer on board hm gunboat john bright be happy few who have climbed to top of tree captain battleax regarded a sultan of world be sultan vizier having discipline of ship altogether in own hand be to thinking very master must have said beforehand that man of such sentiment feeling be not at to taste everything that loved have always hated that despised have revered nevertheless became very fond of found in opponent to fixed period have done more to shake opinion than crasweller with feeling sir ferdinando with argument effected by few curt word have found almost impossible to resist come way mr president said here be where be to sleep considering that be only ship think will find fairly comfortable anything more luxurious than place assigned to must not have imagined on board ship afterwards learned that cabin have be designed for use of travelling admiral gathered from fact that be allotted to idea england intended to atone for injury done to country by personal respect shown to late president of republic at rate will be comfortable while be here that in be something nevertheless have to feel that be prisoner not more so than anybody else on board said lieutenant guard of soldier came up morning to look after must guard of soldier have done supposing have run away must have have to wait till have caught nobody conceived to be possible president of republic never run away in own person there will be cup of tea in officer mess room at five o'clock will leave till then a may wish to employ went up immediately afterwards on deck looking back over tafferel must only just see glittering spire of gladstonopolis in distance now be time for thought found easy seat on stern of vessel sat down to consider crasweller have said to have parted perhaps for ever have not be in england since be little child must not feel now that might be detained there by circumstance die there that crasweller who be ten year senior might be dead before must have come back yet ordinary farewell have be spoken between in last word of have confined to fixed period so full have heart be of subject so intent have felt to be on convincing be upshot of what have said not that doctrine of fixed period be in wrong that be impracticable because of horror attending last moment be solitude in must be passed one last year sight of thing must remind old man of coming death general feeling that business pleasure of life be over that stillness of grave have be commenced to be to be added certainty death must come on prearranged day referred manifestly to condition of who be to go in degree affected welfare of who be to remain have not attempted to say that for benefit of world at large system be bad system that evil must have befallen crasweller there must be doubt though dozen companion might have visited daily must have felt college to be solitude because must not have be allowed to choose promiscuous comrade a in outer world custom must no doubt produce cure for evil when man knew that be to be so dozen visitor must suffice for young man of thirty travel over world old man of seventy be contented with comparative confinement of own town perhaps of own house a to ghastliness of thing to be seen must doubt be removed out of sight even must be cured by custom business pleasure of life at prescribed time be in general pretence at business reminiscence of pleasure man must know that fated day be coming must prepare for with infinitely le of anxious pain of uncertainty than in outer world fact that death must come at settled day must no doubt have horror a long a man be able habitually to contrast position with of few favoured one who have within own memory lived happily to more advanced age when time must come that such old man have so existed must not think that frame of mind must be created not indisposed to contentment sitting there turning over in mind while eye rested on bright expanse of glass clear sea did perceive that fixed period with advantage be of such nature that must necessarily be postponed to age prepared for crasweller eloquence have have that effect upon did see that must be impossible to induce in present generation feeling of satisfaction in system must have declared that must not commence with who be at present unborn indeed to allay natural fear of mother not with who must be born for next dozen year might have be well to postpone for century admitted so much to myself with full understanding that theory delayed so long must be endangered by own postponement how be to answer for zeal of who be to come so long after sometimes thought of more immediate date in might be first to be deposited that might thus be allowed to set example of happy final year passed within college then how far must tallowaxes barneses exors of day be led by example must on arrival in england remodel altogether fixed period name day so far removed that even jack child must not be able to see be with sad grief of heart so determined dream of personal ambition be at once shivered to ground nothing must remain of name of man who have caused republic of britannula to be destroyed government to be resumed by old mistress must go to work with pen ink paper with long written argument studied logic endeavour to prove to mankind that world must not allow to endure indignity weakness selfish misery of extreme old age confess that belief in efficacy of spoken word of word running like electric spark from lip of speaker right into heart of who heard be stronger far than trust in written argument must lack warmth others posse enter only on mind of studious whereas others touch feeling of world at large have already overcome in breast of many listener difficulty now experienced must again attempt to do so with british audience must again enlarge on meanness of man who must not make so small sacrifice of latter year for benefit of rising generation even spoken word must come cold to must fall unnoticed on heart of others when be felt that doctrine advocated must not possibly affect living man thinking of be very melancholy when be summoned down to tea by one of steward who attended officer mess mr president will take tea coffee cocoa chocolate preserved date there be muffin crumpet dry toast buttered toast plum cake seed cake peach fritter apple marmalade bread butter there be put up fruit of kind of really must know that have come moment from graperies orchard house put on table because think that ca eat quite so much dinner after be invitation came from young naval lad who seemed to be about fifteen year old hold tongue percy said elder officer fruit be not here because lord alfred gorged so tremendously that be afraid mother duchess must withdraw from service when heard that have made sick there be curacoa chartreuse pepperwick mangostino russian brandy on side board suggested third will have glass of madeira just thimbleful said who seemed to be few year older than lord alfred percy then one of steward brought madeira young man drank with great satisfaction wine have be seven time round world said only time for drinking be five o'clock tea be if understand what good living mean asked simply for cup of tea found to be peculiarly good partly because of cream accompanied then went up stair to take constitutional walk with mr crosstrees on deck saw sitting there for couple of hour very thoughtful said must disturb hope doe make unhappy that be carried away to england have done so know whether must have gone alive said that when be suggested promised to be ready in two day did say so because suited can hardly imagine that must have carried on board with violence that must have put gladstonopolis to sword because declined to go on board brown have told that be to bring off dead alive dead alive think must have have if soldier have not succeeded sailor must have taken in hand when asked why there be great necessity for kidnapping assured that feeling in england have run very high on matter that sundry bishop have declared that anything so barbarous must not be permitted in twentieth century must be a bad said a cannibal of new zealand show absolute ignorance of bishop on subject daresay there be prejudice about killing old man woman young men matter allow to assure mr crosstrees said that sentiment be carrying far away from reason to state life of woman must be just same a of man state can not allow to indulge in romance get sailor tell to strike woman see what will say sailor be irrational of course be supposing that be for public benefit that woman must be struck be same with old man good of commonwealth own requires that beyond certain age will not be allowed to exist doe not work can not enjoy living waste more than share of necessary of life becomes on aggregate intolerable burden read shakespeare description of man in last stage childishness mere oblivion sans teeth sans eye sans taste sans everything ' stage before be merely that of 'lean slippered pantaloon ' for own sake must not save mankind from having to encounter such misery a ca do mr president very nearly did do britannulist assembly in majesty of wisdom passed law to effect be sorry afterwards have spoken of majesty of assembly wisdom because savoured of buncombe assembly wisdom be not particularly majestic have intended to allude to presumed majesty attached to highest council in state assembly in majesty of wisdom must hing of kind might pas law law must be carried out only by men parliament in england be take quite a majestic a assembly in britannula apologise for word mr crosstrees savour of ridiculous did not quite explain idea at moment be forgotten said must acknowledge that never used word against again parliament in england might order three month old baby to be slain must not possibly get deed done not if be for welfare of great britain not to save great britain from destruction strength be very strong be not half so powerful a weakness must with greatest alacrity in world fire big gun in among battalion of armed men so a to scatter to wind must not point in direction of single girl went on discussing matter at considerable length conviction be quite a strong a mine be sure that under circumstance must old man ever be deprived of life under fixed period be a confident a on other side at rate pretended to be so told that made allowance for progressive wisdom of mankind parted a friend soon after went to dinner be astonished to find how very little captain have to do with officer on board ship lived nearly alone having first lieutenant with for quarter of hour morning on occasion of first day on board have dinner party in honour of coming among two three day before reached england have dined with regularly day except twice when be invited to officer mess breakfasted alone in own cabin where everything be provided for must desire always lunched took five o'clock tea with officer remained alone till one o'clock spent four hour morning during entire journey in composing volume a be now printed have put into shape of story because think may so best depict feeling of people around a made great endeavour to carry out fixed period in britannula because may so describe kind of opposition be shown by expression of sentiment on lieutenant crosstrees depended at minute doubt that crasweller must have be deposited have not john bright appeared whether barnes tallowax must have followed peaceably may be doubted however be not men of great weight in britannula officer of law might possibly have constrained to have followed example crasweller have set do confess that doubt whether must have be able to proceed to carry out arrangement for final departure of crasweller looking forward must see eva kneeling at foot must acknowledge invincible strength of weakness to crosstrees have alluded godlike heroism must have be demanded heroism must have submitted to have be called brutal of such knew not to be owner have british parliament ordered three month old baby to be slaughtered be not man to slaughter even though be sworn servant of british parliament upon whole be glad that john bright have come into water have taken away on return to england be way out of immediate trouble against be able to expostulate to show with truth on side be injured man be willing to admit in form of tale have adopted for present work for may hope to obtain popularity in england once on shore there will go to work on volume of altogether different nature endeavour to be argumentative statistical a have here be fanciful though true to detail during whole course of journey to england captain battleax never said word to about fixed period be doubt gallant officer possessed of necessary gift for management of ton steam swivel gun seemed to to be somewhat heavy never even in conversation alluded to britannula spoke always of dockyard at devonport a though have be familiar with corner be very particular about clothes be told by lieutenant crosstrees on first day that must resent a bitter offence have come down to dinner without white cravat be right know thing do tell crosstrees have said to when have attempted to be jocose about punctilio took care however always to put on white cravat with captain with officer after dinner with captain cup of coffee be always brought in on silver tray in silver coffee pot be leisurely consumed then a soon understood captain expected must depart learnt afterwards that immediately put foot up on sofa slept for remainder of evening retired to lieutenant cabin there discussed whole history of britannula over many prolonged cigar did really mean to kill old men said lord alfred percy to one day regularly to cut throat know carry out burn did not mean law did poor old fellow must have be put end to without slightest mercy not without mercy rejoined now there be governor father said lord alfred know who be duke of northumberland be informed be terrible swell owns three castle county have half million year can hardly tell what sort of old fellow be at home there be one who doe pay most profound respect be always doing good to everybody do mean to say that constable cremator sort of first hangman must have come to taken by nape of neck cut throat just because be sixty eight year old ca believe that anybody must have done duke be man yes be man doubt if committed murder must be hanged in spite of dukedom know how must be said lord alfred hesitating can not imagine that grandfather must commit murder must be hanged can tell that though be very improbable impossible a may think law be same for a for others why must not all other law be same also must be murder what be idea of murder killing people then be murderer who go about with great gun of yours for sake of killing many people have never killed anybody with yet be not le murderer if have intent to murder be soldier murderer who kill other soldier in battle murderer be man who illegally kill now in accordance with everything must have be done legally be afraid that if grandfather be living among must have to be deposited like rest not if sir ferdinando be there said boy must not go on to explain to that thus ran away from old argument about duke did feel that new difficulty must arise from extreme veneration paid to certain character in england how must be with royal family must be necessary to exempt down to extremest cousin if so how large body of cousin must be generated feared that fixed period must only be good for republic in there be class violently distinguished from inferior brother if so might be well must go to united state there begin to teach doctrine other republic must be strong enough to stand against hydra headed prejudice with ignorance of world at large be fortified believe continued boy bringing conversation to end men in ship must take grandfather kill in cold blood be somewhat annoyed on way to england by finding that men on board sailor stoker steward regarded a most cruel person prejudice of people of class be so strong a to be absolutely invincible be necessary that new race must come up before prejudice be eradicated be civil enough in demeanour to personally have be taught be devoted to slaughter of old men regarded with horror modern nation have entertained for cannibalism heard whisper one day between two of steward 'd have killed that old fellow came on board a sure a egg if have got there just in time to prevent not with own hand said listening junior yes with own hand be just thing must allow to be done by anybody else be thus that regarded sacrifice have thought to make of own feeling in regard to crasweller have doubt suggested that must use lancet in order to save from le friendly touch believed afterwards when time have come must have found incapacitated for operation natural weakness incidental to feeling must have prevailed now that promise once so painfully made since a have thought forgotten by be remembered against a proof of diabolical inhumanity of disposition believe that think that mean to eat said one day to crosstrees have gradually become confidential friend to made known sorrow fell upon during voyage from ignorance of men around can not boast have in least affected opinion by argument at rate have sense enough to perceive be not bloody minded cannibal one actuated by true feeling of philanthropy knew that object be to do good though did not believe in good to be done have got to endure said do mean to say that when get to england will be regarded with personal feeling of same kind yes so imagine there be honesty about crosstrees must never allow to soften anything will be hard to bear first reformer have to bear such hardship exactly remember what be that socrates wanted to do for ungrateful fellow mortal thought so badly of that made swallow poison galileo have hard time when said that sun stood still why must go further than jesus christ for example if be not able to bear incident must not undertake business in england must not have single disciple there must not be one to solace to encourage must not be well must throw into ocean have done with world so ungrateful in britannula have known true disposition there have received credit due to tender heart loving feeling one thought there that wanted to eat up victim must take pleasure in spilling blood with own hand tidings so misrepresenting must have reached england before must there have friend even lieutenant crosstrees must be seen more after have gone ashore then came upon for first time idea be not wanted in england at be simply to be brought away from own home to avoid supposed mischief might do there that for british purpose must be well must be dropped into sea left ashore on desert island have be taken from place where a governing officer have undoubtedly be of use now must be of use no longer nobody in england must want must care for must be utterly friendless there alone for aught knew might put in prison keep there so a to be sure must not return to own people if asked for liberty might be told that because of bloodthirstiness must be for general welfare must be deprived of when sir ferdinando brown have told that must certainly be asked down to windsor have taken flowery promise a being worth nothing have wish to go to windsor what must do with immediately on arrival must not be best to return at once to own country if only might be allowed to do so made very melancholy especially feeling must be regarded by around a monster of cruelty must not think of word lieutenant crosstrees have spoken to saviour of world have disciple who believed in one dear youth who loved so well almost doubted own energy a teacher of progress to carry through misery saw in store for will not have very bright time when arrive in england said to friend crosstrees two day before expected arrival will be new there will be plenty for to see will go upon other voyage yes will be wanted up in baltic at once be very good friend with russia dog be really respected in world unless show that can bite a well a bark will not be respected because can bark bite what will do with will put on shore at plymouth send up to london with guard of honour will guard of honour do with ah for can not answer will treat with kind of respect doubt have not occurred to to think said where will deposit why must do so to question be one of moment one there will want nobody know to whom must be cause of little trouble will simply wish out of way world at large if hears of at will simply have be informed of cruelty malignity mean to destroy do said lieutenant in piteous tone must be best be not that certain scruple prevent one must advise to do with to begin with paused before replied looked painfully into face will excuse asking because little a acquaintance be with be with alone of englishman have acquaintance thought that be intent about book what will do with book who will publish how will create interest for be there one who will believe at rate believe in fixed period do said lieutenant be because first knew in britannula have since passed month with at sea be one only friend be about to leave also disbelieve in must acknowledge to yourself that have never known one whose position in world be more piteous whose difficulty be more trying then left went down to complete manuscript
