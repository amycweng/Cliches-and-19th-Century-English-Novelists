acknowledged to few debt immediate present be made to of four thousand pound double amount be assured to at baronet death reader may be sure that baronet have heard many thing respecting cousin george did not like to personally must have be infinitely preferable that title estate must have gone together than that own daughter must be great heiress that outlook into world be fair full of promise of prosperity way be clear enough twenty thousand year must not be necessary to make happy woman then be to manifest sacred religion to man to woman be appointed high pinnacle of fortune simply that man woman might enjoy be to be held a throne be held for benefit of many in disposition of throne necessity of making have fallen upon from loss of own darling have brought to think not of daughter happiness to balance of in possessing not possessing property must venture on prophecy of welfare of who might measure weal woe from manner in duty of high place be administered must fain that there must still have be sir harry sir george hotspur of humblethwaite found that duty required to make other arrangement yet have liked cousin who indeed have many gift to win liking from men woman

have achieved certain reputation in london that have sold out of army be talked of a man who shot bird with precision pigeon must shoot with wonderful dexterity art be at humblethwaite supposed to be much against then be equally successful with partridge pheasant partly on account of such success partly probably because manner be pleasant be known to be welcome guest at house in men congregate to slaughter game in way have reputation one be not altogether cause for reproach have not previously recommended to notice of cousin just ten month after poor harry death be asked went to humblethwaite probably at moment baronet mind be still somewhat in doubt wish of lady elizabeth have be clearly expressed to husband to effect encouragement must be given to young people to fall in love with other to sir harry never assented though there be time that time have not yet passed when george hotspur reached humblethwaite in baronet be not altogether averse to idea of marriage when george left baronet have made up mind tidings have reached be afraid of cousin other tidings have reached also rather perhaps must be truer to to say that idea have come to of young men now rising in england there be young man who more approved to sir harry choice than did lord alfred second son of old friend political leader marquis of milnthorp lord alfred have scanty fortune of own be in parliament in office be doing well men said good thing of then there be word two spoken between marquis baronet just word also with lord alfred lord alfred have objection to name of hotspur be in october while george hotspur be still declaring that gilbsy knew nothing of getting up head of game then lord alfred promised to come to humblethwaite at christmas be after george owned to few debt confession on score did harm sir harry have made up mind day sir harry have at time learned good deal of cousin george mode of life in london have already decided that young man be not one whom must be well to set upon pinnacle yet have liked young man a did everybody lady elizabeth have liked much for fortnight have gone on hoping that difficulty might have solved by young man marriage with daughter need hardly be said that not word one way other be spoken to emily hotspur seemed to mother that young people though there be love making yet liked other sir harry at time be up in london for month two hearing tidings seeing lord alfred who be at office on return that solution by family marriage be ordered to be for ever banished from maternal bosom sir harry said that must not do nevertheless be good to young cousin when time be drawing nigh for young man departure spoke of further visit covert at humblethwaite such a be must always be at service be week before cousin went by coming of day on cousin took departure sir harry regretted that have made that offer of future hospitality chapter ii heroine have said nothing to asked sir harry anxiously of wife think not replied lady elizabeth have said anything meant anything must have told certainly must said lady elizabeth sir harry knew child be satisfied that harm have be done nevertheless wished that further invitation have not be given if christmas visitor be to come to humblethwaite must be successful must be right have seemed to sir harry during last week of cousin george sojourn beneath roof there have be more of cousinly friendship between cousin than have be salutary seeing a have seen that closer connection be inexpedient thought that be sure that great harm have be done have word be spoken to girl have taken a declaration of love must certainly have told mother sir harry must no more doubt daughter than must own honour there be certain point line of duty clearly laid down for girl so placed a be daughter sir harry though must not have told whence knowledge of point line have come to child never for moment doubted that knew must obey to know to obey such point of duty be part of inheritance of such one a emily hotspur nevertheless might be possible that fancy must be touched that must know nothing of nothing that must confide even to mother sir harry understanding having seen in last day something a thought of too close cousinly friendship be anxious that lord alfred must come settle everything if lord alfred must be successful danger must be at end cousin might come again do what liked with covert ala ala cousin must never have be allowed to show handsome wicked face at humblethwaite emily hotspur be girl whom father must have trusted let reader understand of that be one in whom intentional deceit be impossible neither to father to one must lie either in word action line point of duty be well known to though knew not have never asked whence lesson have come will be too much to say that have formed part of breeding have be given to with blood understood well that from a heiress of house of double obedience be due to father obedience of child added to be now required from a future transmitter of honour of house yet word have be said to of honour of house indeed have many word ever be said a to that other obedience lesson when have be well learned have ever come without direct teaching knew more than knowledge have reached in same manner though owed great duty to father there be limit to duty of unconsciously be well aware when mother told that lord alfred be coming having be instructed to do so by sir harry hinted with caress kiss soft whisper that lord alfred be one of whom sir harry approved greatly that if further approval must be bestowed sir harry must not be displeased emily a returned mother embrace felt that have possession of own with father mother might be allowed to interfere be for rather for to say that hand so weighted a be hers must not be given here there be not for not even for to say that heart be to be given here to be given there let put upon what weight might of family honour of family responsibility be own property if not perhaps to be bestowed at own pleasure because of pressure of weight still own absolutely beyond bestowal of other nevertheless declared to herself whispered to mother that must be glad to welcome lord alfred have known well when be child of twelve year old be already young man in parliament since day have met more than once in london be now turned twenty be something more than ten year senior there be nothing against at rate on score of age lord alfred be admitted on side to be still young man though have already be lord of one board of for last four year have earned reputation for working did not look like man who must be more addicted to sitting at board than spending time with young woman be handsome pleasant good humoured full of talk have nothing about of official fogy be regarded by friend a man who be just now fit to marry say that be such good son good brother said lady elizabeth anxiously quite phoenix said emily laughing then lady elizabeth began to fear that have said too much did not mention lord alfred name for two day miss hotspur have by time resolved that lord alfred must have fair chance if must teach to think that of men walking earth lord alfred be best most divine nearest of men to god how excellent thing must be great responsibility a to family burden must in case already be acquitted with credit wish of father on subject be paramount must be gratified must then be placed almost beyond hand of misfortune to hurt at rate great almost crushing difficulty of life must so be solved man must have enough in eye of godlike glory to satisfy that have found in one who must be almost divinity at rate to must speak a other man spoke must look a other one looked must there be in eye depth of colour in voice sound of music in gait so divine grace for other one though have looked into brightness of colour though have heard sweetness of music though have watched elastic spring of step cared nothing a regarded heart heart be one treasure of own be sure of of one own great treasure be much too chary to give away unasked too independent a told to give away unauthorized field be open to lord alfred a father wished lord alfred must be received with favour if must find divinity then must bow before readily ala for lord alfred may know that when thought of thus there be poor chance of success for lord alfred let have what of godlike might must find little of there when made calculation resolution after such fashion a man who becomes divine in woman eye have generally achieved claim to celestial honour by sudden assault ala quality carry through give halo to head may after be very ungodlike such achievement have already fallen in way of cousin george though have cousin george lord alfred be weighed in just scale divinity of latter such a be must have be found greatly to prevail indeed might perhaps have be difficult to lay hold of bring forward a presentable for such office a of lover for girl young man who must be le godlike than cousin george have gift of simulation be valuable poor emily hotspur have not yet learned housewife trick of passing web through finger of finding by touch whether fabric be of fine wool of shoddy made up with craft to look like wool of finest say that there be small chance for lord alfred nevertheless lady be dutifully minded to give chance that be in power to bestow did not tell that father hope be vain of preference for other man never told anything be not aware that existed knew that be handsome thought that be clever knew that have talked to a man have ever talked before be aware that be nearest relative beyond father mother that therefore might be allowed to love a cousin told that be hotspur that must be head of hotspur when father must be taken from thought that looked a man must look who must have to carry dignity there be nothing more word have be said to on subject be aware because word have be said that be not thought fitting that must be cousin bride must not know how great must be advantage must estate title be kept together even though must inherit acre of land have be told by father that such be decision cousin george must become head of house of hotspur to be head of house of hotspur be to much greater thing than to be owner of humblethwaite scarrowby gift like latter might be given to mere girl like be to be so given let man living do what might george hotspur must become head chief of old house of hotspur nevertheless be not for to join two thing together unless father must see that must be good for to do so emily hotspur be very like father having

mourning cousin be come gone baronet hoped in heart that there might be end of a far a humblethwaite be concerned at rate till child must have given to better lover tidings have be sent to sir harry during last week of young man sojourn beneath roof of have reached ear be worst have before heard of recklessness of debt of dissipation of bad comrade now heard of worse than if now heard be true there have be dishonour sir harry be man who wanted ample evidence before allowed judgment to actuate conduct in case evidence be far from ample did not stint hospitality to future baronet failed to repeat promise of future welcome have already be given have be thankfully accepted man know that offer of renewed hospitality must be repeated at moment of departure george hotspur a be taken away to

not allow of earlier absence from london be man who shirked official duty be afraid of amount of work though knew how great be prize before refused to leave board before day have come at board must necessarily dispense with service between father there have be reticence be clearly understood by that be to go down win twenty thousand year prettiest girl in cumberland if own capacity way joined to favour of girl father mother must enable to attain success to emily not word more have be said on subject than have be already narrated a having be spoken by mother to daughter with authority with love for only remaining child with consciousness of terrible importance of matter at issue sir harry must not bring to suggest to daughter that must be well for to fall in love with guest who be coming to to lady elizabeth said very much have quite made up mind that thing must be good having done so be very anxious that arrangement must be made be natural that girl of must learn to love youth how terrible be danger of loving amiss when so much depended on loving wisely whole fate of house of hotspur be in hand to do with a thought fit sir harry trembled a reflected what must be result be to come to day ask favour for suitor wholly unfitted to bear name of hotspur to sit on throne of humblethwaite scarrowby be pleased that be coming said to wife evening before arrival of guest certainly be pleased know that like remember when used to talk about often said sir harry be when be child year two ago said sir harry three four year perhaps with be long time be not likely that must talk much of now of course know what be that wish doe think about cousin at said hour afterwards yes think of be only natural know must be unnatural that must think of much see said mother keen to defend daughter from what might seem to be implied reproach george hotspur be man who will make thought of wherever go be clever very amusing there be denying then have hotspur look over wish have never set foot within house said father dear there be such danger a think said lady elizabeth emily be not girl prone to fall in love at moment notice because man be good looking amusing certainly not with conviction must have that doing so must greatly grieve sir harry believed in daughter said more thoroughly wished that lord alfred wedding day be fixed mamma said emily on following day wo lord alfred be very dull hope not dear what be to do with nobody else here to amuse crutchleys be coming on th now mr mr crutchley be a emily thought very ordinary people quite unlikely to afford amusement

to have have great grandfather great grandmother be quite a old a sir harry mr crutchley be great deal older than lady elizabeth what will lord alfred have to say to mr crutchley mamma what do people in society always have to say to other lathebys be coming here to dine to morrow will come again doubt on th mr latheby be young vicar of humblethwaite mr latheby be very pretty young bride whom have just married then lord alfred shoot continued lady elizabeth cousin george said that shooting be worth going after said emily smiling fear will be failure made lady elizabeth unhappy a thought that more be meant than be really said did not confide fear to husband chapter iii lord alfred courtship hall a great house at humblethwaite be called consisted in truth of various edifice added one to at various period result be that more picturesque mansion must be found in part of england than hall at oldest portion of be said to be of time of henry vii may perhaps be doubted whether set of room with lattice window looking out on to bowling green window from beneath own gable be so old a date assigned to be strange how little authority can usually be found in family record to verify such statement be known that humblethwaite surrounding manor have be given to in fashion purchased by certain harry hotspur who also in day have be knight when church land be changing hand under henry viii there be authority to prove that sir harry have done something towards making home for on spot whether very gable be portion of building monk of st humble have raised for in preceding reign may probably be doubted that there be fragment of masonry part of old timber remaining from monastery be probably true enough great body of old house a now stood have be built in time of charles ii there be date in brickwork still conspicuous on wall looking into court hall front door a now stood very prominent quite at end of house have be erected in reign of queen anne modern drawing room with best bedroom over projecting far out into modern garden have be added by present baronet father house be entirely of brick old window not very oldest reader will understand of caroline age be built with strong stone mullion be longer than be deep beauty of architecture having in day be more regarded than light who doe not know such window have not declared to often how sad thing be that sanitary scientific calculation must have banished like of from house two large oriel window coming almost to ground going up almost to ceiling adorned dining room library from drawing room modern window opening on to terrace led into garden entered mansion by court be enclosed on two side altogether on two others partially facing a drove in be body of building with huge porch projecting on right so a to give appearance of portion of house standing out on side on left be that old mythic tudor remnant of monastery of back wall seen from court be pierced only with small window here there be covered with ivy lattice window from emily hotspur loved to think that monk of old have looked into trim garden now looked on to bowling green be kept very trim in honour of holy personage who be supposed to have played there four century ago then at end of old building there have be erected kitchen servant office various room turned corner of court in front so that only one corner have a be be left for ingres egress court be large in middle of there stood old stone ornamental structure usually called fountain quite ignorant of water loaded with griffin satyr mermaid with ample bust overgrown with green damp growth be scraped off by joint effort of gardener mason once perhaps in five year often seems that beauty of architecture be accidental great man go to work with great mean on great pile make great failure world perceives that grace beauty have escaped that even magnificence have be hardly achieved then there grows up beneath various unknown hand complication of stone brick to arrangement of great thought seems to have be given lo there be thing so perfect in glory that who look at declares that nothing must be taken away nothing added without injury sacrilege disgrace so have be rather so be now with hall at humblethwaite rule ever made for guidance of artist have be kept part be out of proportion two part seemed to fit other put on paper be absurdity huge hall porch added on by builder of queen anne time at very extremity of house be almost monstrosity passage staircase internal arrangement be simply ridiculous there be not portion of whole interior did not charm be there corner of exterior yard of outside wall be not in eminently beautiful lord alfred gresley a be driven into court in early dusk of winter evening having passed through mile half of such park scenery a only cumberland westmoreland can show be fully alive to glory of place humblethwaite did not lie among lake be indeed full ten mile to north of keswick be so placed that enjoyed beauty luxury of mountain river without roughness of unmanageable rock sterility dampness of moorland of rocky fragment indeed peeping out through close turf here there coming forth boldly so a to break park into little depth with now again real ravine there be plenty there ran right across park passing so near hall a to require stone bridge in very flower garden caldbeck a bright swift stream a ever took away water from neighbouring mountain to south of humblethwaite there stood huge skiddaw saddleback with long gaunt ridge while to west brockleband fell seemed to encircle domain lord alfred a be driven up through old tree saw deer peering at from knoll broken fragment of stone felt that need not envy elder brother if only line might fall to in very pleasant place have known humblethwaite before irrespective of beauty of wealth of hotspur be quite willing to fall in love with emily hotspur that man with such dainty offered to must not become greedy that there must be touch of avarice when such wealth be shown to be almost more than may dare to assert lord alfred be man not specially given to covetousness have recognized a duty a man not to seek for thing unless must in truth love woman who held in hand to give a looked round through gloaming of evening thought that remembered that emily hotspur be be loveable reader must not linger long over lord alfred love few word a to father few a to daughter few also a to old house where dwelt together have be necessary to say little love story of lord alfred if ever be love story must be told very shortly remained five week at humblethwaite showed willing to receive amusement from old mr crutchley from young mr latheby shooting be quite good enough for won golden opinion from one about place made acquainted with whole history of house be prepared to prove to demonstration that henry vii monk have looked out of very window have played at bowl on very green emily became fond of after fashion failed to assume aspect of divinity in eye of thing to be done father mother said word to girl though knew so well that doing of be intended said not word to mother have lady elizabeth known how to speak have dared to be free with own child emily must soon have told that there be chance for lord alfred lady elizabeth must have believed nay lady elizabeth though must not speak have woman instinct almost assured that match must never be made sir harry on other side thought that thing went prosperously wife did not dare to undeceive saw young people together thought that saw that emily be kind did not know that frank kindness be incompatible with love in such maiden way a for emily knew that must come knew that must not prevent slight hint two did give thought gave be too fine too impalpable to be of avail lord alfred spoke nothing of love till made offer in form at last be not hopeful have found impossible to speak to girl of love have be gracious with almost intimate yet have be impossible thought of that be dull stupid lethargic miserably undemonstrative truth be that there be nothing for to demonstrate have come there to do stroke of business must not throw into business spark of fire must have be kindled by such sympathy have existed there be men who can raise such spark pretence of fire where there be heat at false fraudulent men be not such one nevertheless went on with business miss hotspur said to one morning between breakfast lunch when a usual opportunity have be given to be alone with have something to say to hope at rate will not make angry to hear be sure will say nothing to make angry replied have already spoken to father have permission may say more assures that hope may succeed paused moment remained quite tranquil watched must see that delicate pink on cheek be little heightened that streak of colour showed on fair brow there be nothing in manner to give promise of success assurance of failure will know what mean yes know said almost in whisper may hope to say that love dearly seems to be saying what must be matter of course see that at replied with spirit do love very dearly if may be allowed to think that will be wife will be happiest man in england know how great be honour seek how immense in way be gift ask to give can love said again dropping voice to whisper be that answer miss hotspur what must say how ought to answer if must say without seeming to be unkind indeed indeed must do so perhaps have be abrupt be not that when ask to to love of course know what mean must not speak truth at once must be for always for always replied then be over did not press suit further though remained at humblethwaite for three day after interview before lunch on day story have be told by emily to mother by lord alfred to sir harry lady elizabeth knew well enough that story must never have to be told in way sir harry by mean so easily gave up enterprise proposed to lord alfred that emily must be asked to reconsider verdict with wife be very round saying that answer given so curtly must go for nothing that girl must be taught duty with emily be le urgent le authoritative indeed at last somewhat suppliant explained to how excellent must be marriage how must settle terrible responsibility now lay on shoulder with so heavy weight how glorious must be position how hotspur must still live a great family must bring to be obedient said very much in praise of lord alfred pointing out how good man be how moral how diligent how safe how clever how sure with assistance of mean must give to be one of notable men of country never yielded inch said very little answered hardly word standing close to holding by arm hand there be fact that must not have man must not have man now ever certainly must not have sir harry let struggle a might talk best must not keep from giving absolute credit to assurance visit be prolonged for three day then lord alfred left humblethwaite hall with le appreciation of beauty than have felt a be first being driven up to hall door when went sir harry must only bid god bless assure must ever choose to try fortune again must have aid father must give must be useless said lord alfred know own mind too well so went way chapter iv vacillation when spring time came sir harry hotspur with wife daughter went up to london during last season house in bruton street have be empty wife be then mourning lost son there be place for gaiety of london in life sir harry be still thinking of great loss be always thinking of boy who be gone who have be apple of eye one great treasure only human being in world whose superior importance to own have be ready in heart of heart to admit be needful that outer sign of sorrow must be laid aside emily hotspur be taken up to london in order that might be suited with husband that in truth be reason of going sir harry lady elizabeth must have cared to leave cumberland have there be such cause must have be altogether content to remain at home have emily be obedient enough in winter to accept hand of suitor proposed for house be opened in bruton street lord alfred came to see so also did cousin george there be reason why cousin george must not come indeed have not done so must have be most ungracious of cousin came found lady elizabeth emily at home emily told that be always there to receive visitor on sunday after morning church then came again have made such communication to lord alfred then perhaps must have be hardly natural that must have done so lady elizabeth in note have occasion to write to lord alfred did tell of custom on sunday afternoon lord alfred took such immediate advantage of offer a did cousin george a regarded outward appearance of life hotspur be gayer may than have be heretofore when living in london there be dinner party whereas in previous time there have only be dinner at few friend might join there be to be ball there be box at opera there be horse for park there be understanding that dealing with madame milvodi milliner be to be a unlimited a occasion demanded be perceived by one miss hotspur be to be settled in life not few knew story of lord alfred one knew fact of property emily position a heiress though one probably did not know that be still in sir harry power to leave acre of property to whom pleased emily understood there lay upon terrible responsibility of doing best with hotspur interest to death of brother have at time be blackest of misfortune be not le so now a thought of own position have be steady enough a to refusal of lord alfred knowing well enough that cared nothing for there have since come upon moment almost of regret that must have be unable to accept must have be so easy way of escape from trouble without assistance of madame milvodi opera box park horse at time have own idea about man idea be not such a to make think that further work with madame milvodi opera box must be unnecessary then came question of asking cousin george to house have already be told to come on sunday on very next sunday have be there have given cause of offence at humblethwaite lady elizabeth be of opinion that must be asked to dinner if be not asked very omission must show that be afraid of lady elizabeth did not exactly explain to husband did not accurately know that such be fear sir harry understood feeling yielded let cousin george be asked to dinner sir harry at time be vacillating with more of weakness than must have be expected from man who have generally be so firm in affair of life have be quite clear about george hotspur when inquiry of be first made when mind have first accepted notion of lord alfred a chosen son in law now be again at sea be so conscious of importance of daughter case that must not bring to be at ease to allow to expect that girl must in ordinary course of nature dispose of young heart not to own injury a might reasonably be hoped from temperament character education must not protect from daily hourly thought about marriage be not a marriage of other girl house of hotspur have lived prospered for so many century be to live prosper through rather mainly through man whom must choose a husband girl be important now when must have once disposed of importance must be almost at end sir harry have in recess of mind almost conviction although thing be of such utmost moment must be better for better for better for hotspur that matter must be allowed to arrange than that there must be special judgment used in selection almost believed that girl must be left to herself a be other girl thing be of such moment that must not save from having always before eye yet knew not what to do be there aid forthcoming from lady elizabeth have tried hand at choice of proper husband daughter must have none of man so chosen so have brought up to london thrown a be upon market let madame milvodi opera box park horse do what must for of course watch must be kept on not from doubt of excellence because thing to be disposed of be so all important girl mode of disposing of might without disgrace fault on part be so vitally prejudicial to family for let be remembered curled darling of eldest son must suit exigency of case unless such eldest son be willing altogether to merge claim of own family to make by name purpose hotspur be child to present to a son in law heir to noble house future earl say even duke in embryo must be a nothing to sir harry be not ambition to see daughter duchess wanted name place dominion for hotspur greater higher more noble than hotspur claimed must maintain for to have humblethwaite scarrowby lost amidst vast appanage domain of titled family whose gorgeous glory be new paltry in comparison with mellow honour of own house must to have be ruin to hope there might indeed be arrangement a to second son proceeding from marriage a to future chance hotspur claim of hotspur be thought too high too holy for such future chance in such case for one generation at least hotspur must be in abeyance no be not that desired must not suffice for son in law that desired must be well born perfect gentleman with belonging of whom child might be proud must be one who must be content to rest claim to material prosperity personal position on name wealth that must obtain with wife lord alfred have be very man then girl must have none of lord alfred eldest son there might be in plenty ready to take bride be eldest son to come to ask for daughter hand eldest son who must do so almost with right to claim if girl consent be gained how must refuse yet to leave hotspur behind living at humblethwaite hotspur who must follow hotspur be in to might venture to think once again of cousin george cousin george be there coming to house wife be telling that be incumbent on to ask young man to dinner be incumbent on unless meant to let know that be to be regarded absolutely a stranger a one whom have taken up for while now chose to drop again very ugly story have reached sir harry ear about cousin

be forfeited altogether if fraud be brought to light commission have be sold proceeds divided between jew with certain remaining claim to on cousin george personal estate such have be story in vague way have reached sir harry ear be not easily that man a sir harry can learn detail of disreputable cousin life among old friend have none more dear to than lord milnthorp among younger friend none more intimate than lord burton eldest son of lord milnthorp lord alfred brother lord burton have told story telling at same time that must not vouch for truth upon word know said lord burton when interrogated again think if be must regard a though have never heard of course be in debt be altogether thing said sir harry altogether think that probably did pawn commission be bad be so very bad a for other charge against doubt so said lord burton sir harry determined that accusation must go for nothing own child only child transmitter of great thing fortune have given to in whose hand be to lie glory of humblethwaite scarrowby who have giving away of honour of ancient family must be trusted to one of whom must be admitted that early life have be disreputable even if world lenient judgment in such matter must fail to stigmatize a dishonourable in other respect however be so manifestly man to whom daughter ought to be given in marriage by such arrangement must title property be kept together by other sir harry must now make for word have be given to daughter that be to be heiress let make what arrangement might cousin george at death must be head of family peerage be printed must tell old story to world by certain courtesy of law of descent future heir must be hotspur be daughter married to lord alfred like child of marriage must not be hotspur in very truth by courtesy of law even by kindness of minister sovereign must child of such union become baronet sir harry of day head of family position be one sovereign minister must achieve touch bestow be beyond power of earthly potentate to deprive of must have be transmitted by to son with a absolute security ala ala sir harry gave indication that thought expedient to change mind on subject when lady elizabeth proposed that cousin george must be asked to dinner frowned looked black a acceded in truth vacillated allurement on side be so great that must not altogether force upon duty of throwing from knew that cousin george be fitting husband for girl that be man to whom must not have thought of giving have happiness be only object did not think of so bestowing now became uneasy when remembered danger be unhappy a remembered how amusing how handsome how attractive be cousin george feared that emily might like by mean hoped yet vacillated allowed cousin george to come to house only because cousin george must become on death head of hotspur cousin george came on one sunday came on sunday dined at house be of course asked to ball lady elizabeth have so arranged little affair that when cousin george left bruton street on evening of dinner party emily have never be for two minute alone together since family have come up to london lady elizabeth liked cousin george have edict to effect be pronounced by husband must have left alone together with great maternal satisfaction have be told that be not to be so therefore young people have never be allowed to have opportunity lady elizabeth in very quiet way knew how to do work of world be allotted to there have be other ball there have be riding in park chance of life young men sometimes young woman also know so well how to use hitherto cousin george have kept have be constrained to keep distance want to know mamma said emily hotspur day before ball whether cousin george be black sheep white sheep what do mean dear by asking question a like black sheep see why young men be to be allowed to be black sheep yet know be how can be helped people must not notice mamma dear be most difficult question quite beyond be sure beyond sheep need be black always because have not always be quite white then know black lamb be just a dear to mother a white dearer think quite agree with emily that in general society black sheep must be avoided then must be allowed to come in said emily lady elizabeth knew from that there be danger danger be not of kind enabled specially to consult sir harry chapter v george hotspur little must now be told to reader of cousin george way of life a lady elizabeth have said to daughter that question of admitting black sheep into society of refusing admittance be very difficult in first place whose eye be good enough to know whether in truth sheep be black not then be not fact that little amount of shade in fleece of male sheep be considered if not absolutely desirable at rate quite pardonable male sheep with fleece a white a of ewe lamb be not considered to be among mutton somewhat insipid be of taste pope be conscious when declared that woman be at heart rake so come to pas very black sheep indeed be admitted into society till at last anxious father more anxious mother begin to be aware that young one be turned out to graze among ravenous wolf however must be admitted that lamb when so treated acquire courage tends to enable to hold own even amidst wolfish danger cousin george if not ravenous wolf be at rate very black sheep indeed in anxiety to know truth of must not be said that be absolutely wolf not a yet because in career have not a yet made premeditated attempt to devour prey in process of delivering up to be devoured by others have done thing if known of sheep must prevent that sheep from being received into decent flock there have be that little trouble about commission in although have not intended to cheat jew have done that world must have called cheating have world known a for getting good from tradesman without hope thought of paying for with be so much thing of custom a indeed be also with that be almost to be excused for considering normal condition of life for man in position to gamble lose money have come to quite naturally at very early age there have now come upon idea that might turn table that in gambling transaction one must win that a have lost much so possibly might now win more have not quite yet reached that point in education at gambler learns that ready way to win much be to win unfairly not quite yet be near wolfhood be coming on unless good fortune might save there might however be such good fortune in store for a lady elizabeth have said sheep be very dark in colour might become white again if be not so what be doctrine of repentance in believe blackness in male sheep in regard to other sin be venial blackness whether teller of such tale a must say so outright may be matter of dispute unless say so teller of tale doe not know how to tell tale truly blackness such a will be condoned sheep received into almost flock on condition not of repentance humiliation confession simply of change of practice change of practice in certain circumstance at certain period becomes expedient if be made a regard tint in wool of nature sheep becomes a white a be needed to be in respect sheep have be a black a sheep at present period of life have need of much change before must be fit for decent social herding then there be shade of black come from conviviality may call table blackness a to there be opinion constantly disseminated by moral newspaper of day that there have come to be altogether end of such blackness among sheep who be gentleman to make up for indeed there have be expressed by piquant

thinking that be by lie chiefly that must make running good yet lie tell after have be told used remains a additional weight to be carried when have used lie gracefully successfully be hard to bury get well out of sight crop up here there against requiring more lie at last too often have to be admitted a lie most usually so admitted in silence still admitted to be forgiven not according to circumstance of case most perfect forgiveness be that be extended to who be known to lie in everything man have to be taken lie a man be taken with squint harelip bad temper have uphill game to fight when once well known doe not fall into difficulty of being believed george hotspur lie be believed to reader may appear to have be most gratuitous unnecessary inexpedient girl must not have quarrelled with for going to race must never have asked anything about george knew that must make running must not suffice that must not quarrel with have to win came so natural to to lie lie be efficacious be glad to know that stayed away from race for sake have not be for sake must not bid stay away be so glad that have stayed lie be very useful if only must have be buried put out of sight when used there be partridge shooting for four day not good shooting work carried men far from home enabled sir harry to look after cousin george so looked after did not dare to say that on day must shirk shooting

of perceived also that in quiet undemonstrative way be very gracious to never ignored a young lady will sometimes ignore young men thought of even in absence be solicitous for comfort be clever enough to read little sign be sure at rate that liked why did not postpone party till george be gone sir harry said to wife fitzpatricks also go on monday answered must not refuse then again occurred to sir harry that life must not be worth having if be to be afraid to allow daughter to go to picnic in company with cousin there be bridge across water at top of airey force be perhaps one of prettiest spot in whole of lake country entire party on arrival of course went up to bridge then entire party of course descended how happened that in course of afternoon george emily be there again be there

will be true to can not be otherwise than true to love be thing to give when given can not take back will be true to of course can not be married unless papa consent urged further be too wise to think possible that must do so without injuring cause then found others emily made apology to mr fitzpatrick for delay with quiet dignity struck cousin george almost with awe how have be that one a have won so great creature george a be driven home by young companion be full of joyous chatter light small talk have done good stroke of business be happy if only baronet must be brought round trouble have enveloped since beard have first begun to grow on chin must disappear a mist beneath full ray of sun even if there still might be trouble two a thought of prospect remembered that must not be made to disappear in mist fashion there must be that must gild cloud at rate have done good stroke of business loved girl too thought that of girl have seen about town about country be bonniest brightest most

excellent be fortune there be everything fortune must give love of course loved must do anything on earth for how jolly must be together when got hold of share of l year how jolly must be to owe nothing to anybody a thought of however there came upon reminiscence of certain captain stubber further reminiscence of certain mr abraham hart with of whom have dealing told that must behove to call up pluck when discussing gentleman dealing with baronet be sure that baronet must not like captain stubber mr hart that good deal of pluck must be needed on whole have done great stroke of business a consequence of success talked chatted way home till youth who be driving thought that george be about nicest fellow that have ever met emily hotspur a took place in carriage be very silent also have

spot on have told her of love must be sacred to for ever be joy to that be near to own home home that must give to so that might go there with again again have very much to consider to remember black sheep of flock must be least black might be that in energy of pleasure have exceeded other men a did exceed other men in everything that did said who be so clever who so bright who so handsome so full of poetry of manly grace how sweet be voice how fine gait how gracious smile then in brow there be that look of command have ever recognized in father face a belonging to race a hotspur only added to be godlike beauty father never must have possessed did not conceal from that there might be trouble with father yet be not sure that upon whole must be pleased after while humblethwaite family honour must still go together if must sanction marriage knew how longed in heart that might be so for time probably might be averse to prayer must be so must simply give word that must never during lifetime marry without permission then must be true to troth a to truth in respect there must be doubt have given word that for hotspur must be enough must not talk a thought of therefore have hardly spoken

g h father have thought much of at last have determined that emily must have letter in course of week there came other guest to humblethwaite so chanced that there be lady who knew altringhams who have unfortunately met altringhams at goodwood who most unfortunately stated in emily hearing that have seen george hotspur at goodwood be not there said emily quite boldly oh yes with altringhams a usual be always with at goodwood be not at last meeting said emily smiling lady said nothing till lord be present then appealed to frank did see george hotspur with altringhams at goodwood last july to be sure did lost pony to on eros lady looked at emily who said nothing further be still quite convinced that george hotspur have not be at goodwood race be so hard when have used lie commodiously to bury get well rid of chapter x mr hart captain stubber when george hotspur left humblethwaite turned out of house by angry baronet early in morning a reader will remember be at own desire driven to penrith choosing to go south rather than north have doubted for while a to immediate destination altringhams be still at castle corry might have received great comfort from ladyship advice encouragement intimate a be with altringhams did not dare to take liberty with earl certain allowance of splendid hospitality at castle corry be at disposal year lord altringham always welcomed with thorough kindness george hotspur have in fashion be made to understand that be not to overstay time be quite aware that earl must be very disagreeable upon occasion there be something in earl of george be afraid to tell truth did not dare to go back to castle corry then might not be well for to make immediate preparation in london for inquiry respecting debt character sir harry have decided to make must be very difficult for to make preparation must lead to good result if preparation be made result must be very bad indeed might perhaps be possible to do something with mr hart captain stubber have other immediate engagement in october be due to shoot pheasant with distinguished party in norfolk business have now in hand be of so much importance even pheasant shooting distinguished party be not of much moment to went to penrith thence direct to london be habit of life to give up london lodging when left town at end of season spare expense of home a long a must find friend to entertain there be certain item of cost of living for greatest proficient in art of tick must pay will come to speedy end man lodging be one of if indeed spendthrift adapts to splendour of housekeeping may provided knowledge of business be complete courage adequate house gloriously for year two with very small payment in ready money may even buy mansion with incredibly small outlay when once in will not easily allow to be extruded george hotspur however not from want of knowledge of audacity from nature of life chose to lead have abstained from such investment of credit have paid for lodging in st james street be consequently houseless at moment on arrival in london took to hotel close behind military club to belonged at moment be comparatively rich man have between three four hundred pound at bank at kept account when possessed of fund demand upon be very pressing there be certain captain stubber who be bitter against almost to blood because one mr abraham hart have received two thousand pound from proceeds of sir harry generosity captain stubber have not received shilling have already threatened cousin george with absolute exposure if something be not done to satisfy george when have ordered dinner at club wrote following letter to lady altringham have intended to write from penrith in morning when there have be out of sort unhappy have disliked to confess after note of triumph sounded on previous evening that have be turned out of humblethwaite have got over feeling during day with help of sundry glass of sherry little mixed curacoa brandy took immediately on arrival in london so supported made clean breast of a reader will see dear lady said here be back in town banished from heaven darling gentle future papa in law gave to understand when told extent of hope last night that outside of park gate at humblethwaite be place for nevertheless sent to penrith with family horse taking a whole think that interview with although very disagreeable be not unsatisfactory told everything must tell be kind enough to call blackguard because have gone to emily without speaking to first on such occasion however man take anything ventured to suggest that what have done be not unprecedented among young people hinted that while must make future master of humblethwaite must make cousin future lady hotspur that in other way must humblethwaite hotspur be kept together be wonderful how cooled down after while saying that must pay debt if found satisfactory can only say that never found so ended in that be to make inquiry about be to have cousin unless be found out to be very bad indeed how when inquiry will be made know be here to prepare for yours always most faithfully g h like to ask altringham to do anything for man ever have kinder friend than have have in know object to meddle in money matter of other people if must lend name for thousand pound till can get thing settled believe must get over other difficulty must a matter of course include amount in list of debt must give to sir harry sum at once must raise on name without trouble to must enable to satisfy only creditor who will be likely to do real harm with sir harry think will understand will perceive how very material kindness to may be if think that altringham will be unwilling to do have better not show letter be mixed curacoa brandy gave george hotspur courage to make request contained in postscript have not intended to make when sat down to write a wrote idea have struck that if ever man ought to use friend be occasion for doing so if must get thousand pound from lord altringham might be able to stop captain stubber mouth did not believe that must be successful thought probable that lord altringham might express vehement displeasure game be worth candle then knew that must trust countess london be very empty passed wretched evening at club there be not men enough to make up pool be obliged to content with game of billiards with old half pay naval captain who never left london who must bet nothing beyond shilling on game half pay navy captain won four game thereby paying for dinner then cousin george went sulkily to bed have come up to town expressly to see captain stubber mr hart perhaps also to see friend from whom advice might be have on following morning found very averse to seeking of adviser have applied to lady altringham for assistance told that must be wise to wait for answer yet knew that must not be wise to wait a sir harry must certainly be quick in making promised inquiry for four day hung about between hotel club then got lady altringham answer need only quote passage have reference to george special request gustavus say that will have nothing to do with money know feeling about say that must do good whatever debt be tell plainly to sir harry if be affair of play a gustavus supposes tell that to sir harry gustavus think that baronet must without doubt pay such debt must be settled partly settled by thousand pound d d heartless selfish fellow quite incapable of anything like true friendship said cousin george to when read lady altringham letter now must do something hitherto stubber hart other friend knew of presence in london hart though jew be much le distasteful to than captain stubber to mr abraham hart went first mr abraham hart be attorney so called by friend living in genteel street abutting on gray inn road with whose residence place of business beneath same roof george hotspur be very well acquainted mr hart be man in prime of life with black hair black beard new shining hat coat with velvet collar silk lining be always dressed in same way have never yet be seen by cousin george without hat on head be pleasant spoken very ignorant smiling jocose man with slightly jewish accent who knew business well pursued diligently considered to have clear conscience have certain limit of forbearance with customer limit be not narrow when be passed must sell bed from under dying woman with babe bread from mouth of starving child to do so be necessity of trade for own guidance in have made law breaking of law by must bring trade to end therefore declined to break mr hart be man who attended to business be found at home even in september yes mr 'oshspur be about time something be done now ai said mr hart smiling pleasantly cousin george also smiling reminded friend of two thousand pound paid to only few month since not shilling be mine of captain 'oshspur not brass fardin ' be quite neshesshary just then a know captain 'oshspur fat must have be in fire what be up now not without considerable difficulty cousin george explained to jew gentleman what be up probably assumed more inclination on part of sir harry for match than be justified in doing be very urgent in explaining to mr hart that when inquiry be made on part of sir harry a to nature of debt naked truth must not be exactly told be very bad va captain 'oshspur having to divide with fellow stubber money from 'orse guard va too clever for of there mr 'oshspur vere now captain 'oshspur have two cheque still on 'ands be marked 'no account account ' be very bad be 'no account very bad on cheque captain then have that cheque on drummond signed god know how be signed there ai such person at baldebeque be more like than nothing else when brought that thought there va lord baldebeque know live among lord captain on honour brought just a took at tattersall there be expert a showed to say be handwriting captain 'oshspur lie said cousin george fiercely when stubber must have sale money for commission wanted too lord how did curse swear be bad captain then cousin george swallowed fierceness for time proceeded to explain to mr hart that sir harry must certainly pay debt if only little detail must be kept back to mr hart have so pathetically alluded above must be necessary to preserve in obscurity little mistake have be made a to pawning of commission cousin george told great many lie told also much that be true jew did not believe one of lie then neither did believe much of truth when george have finished story then mr hart have story of own to tell to let know about captain 'oshspur old gent have begun about already what sir harry yes sir 'arry mr boltby be family lawyer suppose so captain 'oshspur vell va here yesterday va very polite if 'd just tell about everything thought a 'ow baronet must settle affair off 'and va very generous in offer va mr boltby did say nothin ' of marriage captain 'oshspur of course did be not such fool a to suppose must no ai such fool a look captain oshspur be did think likely seeing vat va nature of interrogatory mr boltby seemed to know good deal be astonishing how much fellow do know did tell anything not much captain 'oshspur not at fust starting be going to have money know captain 'oshspur if see vay to money one vay if see vay other vay vy vhat be man to do ca blame captain 'oshspur have be very indulgent with have captain 'oshspur cousin george promised threatened explained swore by god ended by assuring mr abraham hart that life death be in gentleman keeping if mr hart must only not betray money must be safe marriage must be safe everything must easily come right over above other thing cousin george must owe to mr abraham hart debt of gratitude never must be wholly paid mr hart must only say that meant to have money that did not mean to be ungenteel much in opinion must depend on what stubber must do a for stubber must speak to stubber a stubber be two a for if must get money certainly must not be ungenteel meant what said more than said must still run risk rather than split on old customer such a captain 'oshspur now that sudden way to money be opened to must not undertake to lose sight of with very heavy heart cousin george went from mr hart house to house of call of captain stubber mr boltby have be before with hart augured worst from sir harry activity in matter if mr boltby have already seen captain labour must probably be too late where captain stubber lived even so old friend of a cousin george did not know in what way captain stubber have become captain george though have be military man have never learned captain stubber have house of call in very narrow dirty little street near red lion square be close to public house did not belong to public house george hotspur who have be very often to place of call have never seen there appurtenance of captain business there be account book writing table ink even except contained in little box with screw captain stubber must take out of own pocket mr hart be so far established civilized a to keep boy whom called clerk captain stubber seemed to keep nothing dirty little girl at house of call must run fetch captain stubber if be within reach most usually appointment have to be made with captain cousin george well remembered day when brother captain first made acquaintance about two year after commencement of life in london captain stubber have have interview with in little waiting room just within club door captain stubber then have in possession trumpery note of hand with george signature a stated have done for small tradesman with whom george have be fool enough to deal for cigar from day to present captain stubber have be upon most intimate confidential term if there be one

safer for to go when entered room saw at glance that there be to be war war to knife between sir harry perceived at once that if be worth while to go on with thing at must do so in sole dependence on spirit love of emily hotspur sir harry at first greeting declined to shake hand with called captain hotspur captain hotspur said in word understand that there must be further question of marriage between daughter why not sir harry because sir then paused must sooner see girl dead at foot than entrust to such one a be true what said to at humblethwaite there must have be something very alluring to in idea of joining property title together man will pay much for such whim must not unwillingly have paid very much in money be not so infamously wicked a to sacrifice daughter utterly by giving to one so utterly unworthy of a be told be in debt sir harry wanted telling a to did want telling a to mode of life have have now have better not press have better see mr boltby will tell what be willing to do for upon receiving written assurance that will never renew offer of marriage to miss hotspur can not do said cousin george hoarsely then will leave with creditor to deal with a please have nothing further to suggest must recommend that must see mr boltby before leave chamber what doe cousin say asked be at goodwood last meeting asked sir harry of course be be answered be obliged to acknowledge so much not quite knowing what stackpoole might have said done can explain that there be need of explanation do generally borrow money from such lady a mr morton cousin george blushed when question be asked made answer to be one that must not answer make difference captain hotspur mention thing only to let feel that know must decline further speech with strongly advise to see mr boltby at once good afternoon so saying baronet withdrew quickly cousin george heard shut door of chamber after considering matter for quarter of hour cousin george made up mind that must see lawyer harm must come to from seeing lawyer be closeted with mr boltby for nearly hour before left chamber have be forced to confess to thing of have not thought possible that mr boltby must ever have heard mr boltby knew whole story of money raised on commission of liability to hart stubber have acquainted with history of lord baldebeque cheque mr boltby be not indignant a have be sir harry intimated a thing beyond dispute that man who have done such thing a must be proved against cousin george a must undoubtedly be proved against if must not give up pursuit of heiress must be disposed of with severity unless retreated at once of own accord mr boltby did indeed hint something about criminal prosecution utter ruin incarceration if george hotspur must renounce cousin utterly putting renunciation on paper sir harry must pay debt to extent of twenty thousand pound must allow four hundred year on condition that must live out of england must leave further sum of twenty thousand pound by will on condition that renewed cause of offence be given have better perhaps go home think about mr hotspur said lawyer cousin george did go away think about chapter xiii will not desert sir harry before have left humblethwaite for london in october have heard enough of cousin sin to make sure that match must be opposed with authority indeed have so felt from first moment in george have begun to tell of what have occurred at airey force have never thought that george hotspur must make fitting husband for daughter without so thinking have allowed mind to dwell upon outside advantage of connection dreaming of fitness knew did not exist till have vacillated evil thing have come upon when danger be so close upon to make see what be to force to feel what must be misery threatened to daughter to teach to realize own duty condemned bitterly for own weakness must duty owed to world be so high so holy a be due from to child almost hated name title position a thought of evil that have already done have cousin george be in close succession to title must have admitted man of whom knew so much ill of whom have never heard good within park paling then must not acknowledge to that by asking one to house man such a young cousin who be known to be heir to title have given daughter special reason to suppose that might regard a fitting suitor for hand of course have known have felt a keenly a have felt for be not hotspur that must be true to family by combining property title that by yielding to marriage must be doing family duty unless there be reason against stronger than connected with name a to other reason must not father mother know better than must know when found that man be made welcome in town country be not natural that must suppose that there be stronger reason sir harry felt blamed determined that though must oppose daughter make understand that hope of such marriage must be absolutely abandoned must be duty to be very tender with have sinned against already in that have vacillated have allowed that handsome vile worthless cousin to come near in conduct to daughter sir harry endeavoured to be just tender affectionate in conduct to wife on occasion allowed scope for ill humour not unnaturally incident to misfortune why on earth must have have in bruton street when knew very well what be can not conceive said sir harry did know said lady elizabeth fearing to remind husband that also have sanctioned coming of cousin have told be there that evil be done then to let go to picnic together what must do when mr fitzpatrick asked to be taken must have have tell emily that must not be one of party must have put off till be out of house fitzpatricks be going too pleaded poor woman must have happened at if have not asked to stay till monday said sir harry to charge lady elizabeth knew that there be answer there have clearly disobeyed husband though doubtless suffered much from dim idea of injustice be aware that a have so offended must submit to be told that evil have come from wrong doing hope will not be obstinate said sir harry to wife lady elizabeth though be not acute judge of character did know own daughter be afraid to say that emily must not be obstinate have strongest possible respect a well a affection for own child thoroughly believed in emily much more thoroughly than did in herself must not say that in such matter emily must not be obstinate lady elizabeth be very intimately connected with two obstinate person one of whom be young other old thought that perhaps younger be more obstinate of two be quite out of question that must marry said sir harry sadly still lady elizabeth made reply think that will disobey continued sir harry still lady elizabeth said nothing if give promise will keep said sir harry then mother must answer be sure will if worst come to worst must go away to scarrowby suggested lady elizabeth who hated scarrowby must do good scarrowby must be same a humblethwaite to perhaps worse mean abroad must shut up place for couple of year take to naples vienna perhaps to egypt everything must be changed to be if evil have gone deep enough be so very bad asked lady elizabeth be liar blackguard believe to be swindler said sir harry then lady elizabeth be mute husband left at time have heard whole story of pawning of commission have be told something of money raised by worthless cheque have run to ground that lie about goodwood race have not yet heard anything special of mr morton only attack on george character have a yet be made in hearing of emily have be with reference to goodwood race mr stackpoole be lady of determination one who in society liked to show that be right in assertion well informed on matter in dispute hated cousin george there have come to be good deal said about goodwood meeting so that affair reached sir harry ear perceived that cousin george have lied determined that emily must be made to know that cousin have lied be very difficult to persuade of everybody else must tell story about george goodwood meeting seemed to to be natural enough contented with thinking manner of evil of mr mr stackpoole reiterating conviction that george hotspur have not be at meeting in question know that much signifies mr stackpoole have said in anger not in least emily have replied only that happen to know that cousin be not there go to so many race meeting that there have be little mistake then mr stackpoole have written to cousin george cousin george have thought wise to make reply sir harry however from other source have convinced of truth have told daughter that there be evidence enough to prove fact in court of law emily when so informed have simply held tongue have resolved to hate mr stackpoole worse than ever have be told from first that engagement with cousin must not receive father sanction for day after there have be silence on subject at humblethwaite while correspondence with mr boltby be being continued then there came moment in sir harry felt that must call upon daughter to promise obedience conversation have be described between lady elizabeth be preparatory to doing so dear said to daughter sit down want to

so a there certainly be something withdrawn from delicate aroma of first class young woman by transfer of affection if might not be so even emily hotspur must submit to lot not uncommon among young woman in general wait wish till must acknowledge to herself that heart be susceptible of wound be mother hope at present hope when be positively told by sir harry george hotspur be quite out of

pray say so emily nothing can be not better that must know truth papa go about trying to find out naughty thing george have ever done there have be mistake about race meeting manner of people be asked to give what papa call evidence that cousin george be there doubt george have be what people call dissipated do hear such dreadful story must not have thought anything about if have not be for be not worse now than when came down here last year be always asked to bruton street what do mean by dear mean to say that young men ought to do thing be getting into debt betting living fast of course be very wrong when young man have be brought up in way do think ought not to be thrown over by nearest dearest friend that last epithet be uttered with emphasis emily must give to because fall into temptation be afraid george have be worse than others emily so much more reason for trying to save if man be in water refuse to throw rope because water be deep dearest papa be thinking of lady be not quick enough of thought to explain to daughter that if rope be of more value than man if chance of losing rope be much greater than of saving man then rope be not thrown be thinking of george said emily if must appear that have done thing wickedest thing in world might break heart in thinking of must never give up if be murderer suggested lady elizabeth with girl paused feeling to be hardly pressed then came that look upon brow lady elizabeth understood a well a did sir harry then must be murderer wife said oh emily must make understand mamma want papa to understand too consideration on

will always be world to to such daughter a lady elizabeth have very little to say might be of avail must quote sir harry entertain dim distant wish that cousin george might even yet be found to be not quite so black a have be painted chapter xv cousin george be hard pressed very sensible a one must have thought very manifest idea of buying up cousin george originated with mr boltby will have price sir harry said lawyer then sir harry eye be opened so excellent did mode of escape seem to that be ready to pay almost price for article saw at glance emily have high flown notion must not yield feared that must not yield let cousin george delinquency be shown to be a black a styx if cousin george must be made to give up then emily must yield yielding in such manner having received so rude proof of lover unworthiness must not be that heart must be changed sir harry first idea of price be very noble debt to be paid thousand year for present scarrowby to be attached to title what price must be too high to pay for extrication of daughter from so grievous misfortune mr boltby be more calm a to payment of debt yes within certain liberal limit for present income of five hundred pound thought must be almost a efficacious bait a double amount must be well to tack to necessity of residence abroad might perhaps serve to get young man out of country for time if young man bargained on of heading matter must be reconsidered by mr boltby a to settling scarrowby on title mr boltby be clearly against must raise shilling must on post obit within twelve month at last offer be made in term with reader be already acquainted george be sent off from lawyer chamber with direction to consider term mr boltby gave clerk little instruction for perpetuating irritation on young man hart stubber together be able to produce young man must be made to understand that hungry creditor who have be promised money on certain condition must become very hungry indeed george hotspur blackguard worthless a be did not at first realize fact that sir harry mr boltby be endeavouring to buy be asked to give up cousin be told that if did so certain very generous amount of pecuniary assistance must be given to yet did not at first glance perceive that one be to be price of other that if took one must meanly have sold other certainly must have be very pleasant to have debt paid for offer of five hundred pound year be very comfortable of additional sum to be given when sir harry must die did not think so much might probably be long time coming then sir harry must of course be bound to do something for title a for living abroad might promise must not make keep promise must not dislike to travel for six month on condition that must be well provided with ready money there be much that be alluring in offer began to think whether must not get without actually abandoning cousin then be to give written pledge to effect if given doubt must be shown to no must not do emily be prize though did not value at worth not understanding such worth still have idea that must be true to then at last came upon understanding of fact perceived that bribe have be offered to for day be so disgusted at idea that virtue be rampant within sell emily for money never emily rich prospect for sum so inadequate little knew man when made proposition so vile evening at club wrote letter to sir harry letter a soon a written be put into club letter box addressed to house in bruton street in with much indignant eloquence declared that baronet little understood warmth of love extent of ambition in regard to family will be quite ready to submit to settlement said so long a property be entailed upon baronet who will come after need not say that hope happy fellow may be own son on next morning on first waking idea be more vague circumstance happened tended to divert from current in have run on preceding evening when be going through sad work of dressing bethought that must not at once force marriage on sir harry must not do so perhaps within twelvemonth more let emily be ever so true to that mode of living have become so precarious a to be almost incompatible with outward decency must be necessary for a emily suitor be still very indignant at offer made to be indeed bribery of sir harry ought to be ashamed almost regretted that letter to sir harry have be sent have not be considered enough certainly must not have be written simply on after dinner consideration something might have be inserted with view of producing ready money something might have have flavour of yielding must not have be shown to emily a offer on part to abandon then have general feeling that letter have be too grandiloquent arising doubt from fall in courage incidental to sick stomach before must get out of hotel visitor be upon mr hart desired to see at moment must almost have preferred to see captain stubber remembered at moment mr hart be acquainted with mr walker that mr walker must probably have sought society of mr hart after late occurrence in cousin george have taken part be going across to breakfast at club when found almost forced to accompany mr hart into little private room at left hand of hall of hotel wanted breakfast badly be altogether out of humour have usually found mr hart to be enduring man not irascible though very pertinacious sometimes almost good natured for moment

hart left be not only sick in stomach sick at heart also sick over have gone from bad to worse have lost knowledge of flavour of vice virtue yet now when there be present to vanishing possibility of redeeming everything by great marriage seemed to that life of honourable ease life a sir harry must wish to live if permitted to marry girl dwell among friend at humblethwaite must be much sweeter much more to real taste than life have led for last ten year what have be positive delight in what moment have actually enjoyed from first to last have there not be trouble danger vexation of spirit savour of dirt about even to palate have be nauseous must not willingly reform yet when prospect of reform be brought within reach of eye of reform so pleasant in accompaniment of reform amidst wealth of humblethwaite with emily hotspur by side there came harpy down upon rendering impossible thrice in speaking of to called harpy never occurred to to think by what name mr walker must have designated thing around be becoming so serious that must do something might be that must fall to ground losing everything must not understand about bullbean bullbean have have share of plunder in regard to that have seen best part of evening entertainment have taken place after mr bullbean have retired no doubt however mr bullbean might do damage have written to sir harry refusing altogether offer made to must after writing such letter at once go to lawyer accept offer must admit to finally that be altogether beyond power to win cousin hand be there hope of life at humblethwaite when contemplated at distance have seemed to to be so green pleasant what must emily think of in midst of other misery that also be misery be able though steeped in worthlessness so to make for double identity a to imagine to personify being who must really posse fine manly aspiration with regard to woman to look upon second self a being to perceive with how withering contempt being must contemplate such man a be in truth real george hotspur whose actual sorrow trouble have now become so unendurable who must help in distress altringhams be still in scotland knew well that though lady altringham be fond of though lord altringham liked there be assistance to be have there of kind that needed dearly intimate distinguished friend in norfolk with whom have be always george must not care if heard that have be crucified seemed to that world be very hard very cruel who did care for there be two woman who cared for who really loved who must make almost sacrifice for who must even forget sin at least forgive be sure of emily hotspur loved there be mean by must reach emily hotspur loved must not so far disobey father mother depart from own word a to receive even letter from other friend who loved still must see knew well time at must find at home three four hour after interview with mr hart knocked at mr morton door well george said how doe wooing thrive have preconceived plan in coming to be possessed by desire of so often feel to be comforted by sympathy hardly knew even how to describe want of doe not thrive at said throwing gloomily into easy chair be bad news have lady turned against oh said moodily nothing of sort must be impossible must not father be stern to one a daughter be always kind be what mean eh george wish must not chaff lucy be not well did not come to be chaffed chaffing be to be on one side be george well will say nothing to add to discomfort what be ail will drink liqueur after dinner be what make so wretched believe drink before dinner too hardly ever do thing three time in month be not that thing do trouble so suppose sir harry be not well pleased be doing what ought not to do must say that quite what call ungentlemanlike lawyer must never be allowed to interfere between gentleman wonder who must stand if attorney be set to work to make manner of inquiry about everything that have ever done must not certainly must cave in at once a boy say other men have be a bad a have suppose be sending about everywhere not only sending george going do know that sir harry did honour of visiting did sat there in very chair talked to in manner that nobody ever did before certainly what fine old man be how handsome yes be good looking old fellow so like george be only know le le le what will say le good natured perhaps know what mean be not such fool a be be not fool at george sometimes be weak look to be strong be like very like then must be handsome handsome must think be too said george quite forgetting description of cousin have given day previously to mr morton smiled took notice aloud of blunder knew so well that understood yes went on came here said bitter thing said more perhaps than ought to have done about lucy think that spoke chiefly about there be little explanation then behaved very well have quarrel with be fine old gentleman having one only daughter large fortune wonder that must want to make inquiry before give to must do without attorney must tell truth fact be george that be not sort of son in law that father like suppose will be off eh george george made immediate reply be not likely that must have constancy to stick to for year be sure will not have offered money then george told almost with accuracy nature of proposition made to be very generous said see much of that certainly be very generous what ought fellow to do only fancy that must come to to ask question know will tell true do love yes with heart what be meaning of do love better than father money much better then stick to through thick thin must not advise in accordance with what say with what think will be beaten certainly will never be wife be so married must not be happy with such people will never be wife take sir harry offer write to letter explaining how be best for that must do so paused moment then asked one other question must write letter for lucy smiled again a answered yes if make up mind to do a sir harry asks will write draft of what think must say to chapter xvi sir harry return sir harry received grandly worded indignant letter have be written at club cousin george hesitated a to that other letter friend be to dictate for consequently became necessary that sir harry must leave london before matter be settled in truth old baronet liked grandly worded indignant letter be almost such letter a hotspur must write on occasion there be admission of pecuniary weakness did not quite become hotspur otherwise letter be good letter before left london took letter with to mr boltby on way thither must not refrain from counting up good thing must befall if only young man might be reclaimed recast in mould such a must fit heir of hotspur have be very bad so bad that when sir harry counted up sin seemed to be a black a night then a thought of father must declare to that must not imperil daughter by trusting to one who have shown to be so evil again mode of looking at must come upon kind of vice of george have be undoubtedly guilty be very distasteful to sir harry have be ignoble ungentlemanlike vice have be liar not only gambler professional gambler have not simply got into debt have got into debt in fashion be fraudulent so at least sir harry thought yet need be said that reprobate be beyond reach of forgiveness have not men before done a bad yet be brought back within pale of decent life in still vacillating mood of mind sir harry reached lawyer mr boltby did not vacillate at when be shown letter merely smiled think be bad letter said sir harry word mean so little sir harry said mr boltby come so cheap sir harry turned letter over in hand frowned did not quite like to be told even by confidential lawyer that be mistaken unconsciously be telling that after george hotspur have be born gentleman that therefore underlying young man vileness villany there must be substratum of noble soil of lawyer perhaps knew nothing mr boltby saw that client be doubting having given much trouble to matter not being afraid of sir harry determined to speak mind freely sir harry said in matter must tell really think certainly be sorry to have to speak ill of one bearing name be not matter urgent a be must probably repress something of opinion a be dare to do so must not in london find man le fit to be husband of miss hotspur than cousin be gentleman by birth said sir harry be unprincipled blackguard by education more blackguard because of birth there be nothing too bad for to do very little so bad what have done be gambler swindler a believe forger card sharper have lived upon wage of woman have professed to love have shown to be utterly spiritless abominable vile if clerk in next room be to slap face believe that must resent sir harry frowned moved foot rapidly on floor in thorough respect regard for sir harry continued mr boltby have undertaken work must not have done for above two three other men in world beside be bound to tell result be must sooner give own girl to sweeper at crossing than to george hotspur sir harry brow be very black perhaps have not quite known lawyer perhaps be that have le power of endurance than have thought in regard to mention of own family affair of course said be greatly indebted to mr boltby for trouble have taken only hope may be of service to have be of service what may be result in regard to unfortunate young man can not yet say have refused offer must say a think honourably mean nothing how nothing mr boltby man accepts bargain at first be playing hand against yours sir harry know that have got very good card in own be not to be supposed that must give in at once in besieging town surest way be to starve garrison wait while will give in when town have within wall such vulture a will now settle upon can not stand out very long will hear more of before many day be over think then may return to humblethwaite certainly sir harry hope sir harry that will return with settled conviction on mind that young man must not on consideration be allowed to enter family lawyer meant well overdid work sir harry got up shook hand with thanked left room with sense of offence have come to mr boltby for information have received be not quite sure that have intended that mr boltby must advise touching management of own daughter mr boltby thought have gone little beyond tether sir harry acknowledged to that have learned great deal about cousin be for to judge after whether must receive cousin at humblethwaite mr boltby must not have spoken about crossing sweeper then sir harry be not quite sure that liked that idea of setting vulture upon man sir harry remembered something of old lore a hunting man be astonishing what blood will do in bringing horse through mud at end of long day mr boltby probably did not understand how much at very last might be expected from breeding when sir harry left mr boltby chamber be almost better minded towards cousin george than have be when entered in frame of mind for against young man returned to humblethwaite must not be supposed however that a result of whole be prepared to yield knew beyond doubt that cousin be thoroughly bad subject worthless a believed irredeemable scamp yet thought of what might happen if be to yield thing be very sombre when reached humblethwaite of course wife must not refrain from question be very bad said a bad a can be have gambled gambled if be have better not ask about be disgrace to family then there can be hope for emily hope why must there not be hope life need not depend on fancy for man of whom after have not seen so very much must get over other girl have have to do same be not like other girl harry how not like think be more persistent have set heart upon loving young man will love then must will break heart said lady elizabeth will break mine know said sir harry when met daughter have embraced have kissed asked after welfare felt at once that be different from what used to be different not only a regarded herself different also in manner there came upon sad ponderous conviction that sunlight have gone out from joint life that pleasant thing be over for of that a for must be well for that must die must not be happy if there be discord between child there must be discord man have be invited with price to take off have not be sufficiently ignoble to accept offer how must avoid discord bring back warmth of sun into house then remembered terribly forcible epithet mr boltby have spoken be unprincipled blackguard worse blackguard because of birth word have made sir harry angry believed to be true if there be to be yielding must not yield a yet that living in house without sunshine be very grievous to will kill said to if go on like yet be hard to say of what be that complained day went by daughter said nothing did nothing of must complain be simply that sunshine be no longer bright within hall day went by george hotspur name have never be spoken by emily in hearing of father mother such duty a there be for to do be done active duty of girl in position be very few be custom of morning to spread butter on bit of toast for father to eat still did brought to a be wont did not bring with old manner be thing still done simply because not to do must be omission to be remarked never mind said father fourth fifth morning after return 'd sooner do for did not say word on next morning little ceremony have once be so full of pleasant affection be discontinued have certain hour of reading be prolonged rather than abandoned father mother perceived that book be changed italian be given up took to work of religion sermon treatise long commentary will kill said sir harry to wife be afraid will kill said lady elizabeth do see how colour have gone eats so little walk day yes come in so tired go to church wednesday friday at hesket be sure be not fit for such weather a have carriage walk then sir harry gave order that daughter must always have carriage on wednesday friday emily when mother told insisted that must sooner walk what did carriage carriage on wednesday signify trouble be deeper than that be so deep that father mother felt that something must be done trouble must become too heavy for back ten day passed nothing be heard either from mr boltby from cousin george sir harry hardly knew what be then expected to hear seemed that did expect something be nervous at hour of post be aware that be existing on from day to day with idea of soon doing special thing knew not what something might put end to frightful condition of estrangement between child in be now living told even upon duty among tenant told upon farm told upon almost workman in parish have heart for doing anything did not seem certain to that must continue to live in own house must not bring to order that wood must be cut that projected cottage must be built everything be at standstill be clear to that emily knew that have come from rash love for cousin george never now came stood at elbow in own room leaned upon shoulder never now asked question brought out from paper to decide question in garden rather to allow to be ruled by decision there be greeting between morning evening question be asked answered formally there be conversation what have done must be punished in way said sir harry to if be prompt to think hardly used so also be daughter in considering matter in own mind have found to be duty to obey father in outward conduct founding conviction in matter upon precedent upon general conviction of world in matter of bestowing upon suitor girl be held to be subject to parent so much knew believed that knew therefore must obey have read heard of girl who must correspond with lover clandestinely must run away with lover must marry lover a be behind father back act of kind must do have something within must make dreadful to ever to have to admit that have be personally wrong mixture of pride principle be strong enough to keep stedfast in promised obedience must hing must be thrown in teeth nothing must be called unfeminine indelicate undutiful have high idea of what be due to herself conceived that must be wronged by father must father take advantage of sense of duty to crush heart have own right own privilege with grievous cruel interference must be made must father because be father rob her of only thing be sweet to taste desirable in esteem because be heiress have right to make slave even must do so have in own hand certain security bondage of slave doubt might allot to not task work because must cling to duty keep promise have made to must be in power to prevent marriage upon have set heart be not within power within privilege a father to force upon other marriage must never help with hand in adjustment of property of thought so much unless must help in love in meantime sunshine must be banished from house such sunshine a have shone round head did not so esteem a to suppose that because be sad therefore father mother must be wretched did feel bound to contribute to house in general wretchedness might come from own want of sunlight suffered under terrible feeling of ill usage why be because be girl heiress to be debarred from own happiness if be willing to risk why must others interfere if life conduct of cousin be in truth so bad a be represented did not in least believe why have be allowed to come within reach be not only that be young clever handsome in way attractive that in addition to be hotspur must day be head of hotspur father have known well enough that family pride be equal to own be not natural that when man so endowed have come in way must learn to love when have loved be not right that must cling to love father must fain treat like beast of burden kept in stable for purpose like dog whose obedience affection might be transferred from one master to for price must obey father father must be made to understand that hers be not nature of beast of burden of dog be hotspur a thoroughly a be then brought men there to selected suitor whom despised what did think of when imagining that must take husband not of own choosing what must be idea of love of marriage duty of close intercourse of man wife to feeling woman must not marry at unless must so love man a to acknowledge to herself that be imperatively required to sacrifice belonged to for welfare good such be love for george hotspur let be what might told that be bad that must drag into mud be willing to be dragged into mud at rate to make own struggle during dragging a to whether must drag in must drag out then brought men to walking stick lord alfred young mr thoresby insulted by supposing of that must marry man simply because be brought there a fitting husband must be dutiful obedient a daughter according to idea of duty of principle must let know that have identity of own that be not to be moulded like piece of clay doubt be hard upon father doubt be in very truth disobedient disrespectful be not that must have married lord alfred be brought to that must have struggled to accommodate spirit to father spirit be hotspur though must be generous must not yield then hold of child upon father be so much stronger than of father on child eye be set in face be always turned forward glance that cast back be occasional so sunshine be banished from house of humblethwaite day be a black a night chapter xvii let try thing went on thus at humblethwaite for three week sir harry began to feel that must endure no longer have expected to have heard again from mr boltby letter have come mr boltby have suggested to something of starving out town have expected to be informed before whether town be starved out not have received indignant grandiloquent letter from cousin of a yet have taken no notice have taken notice of letter although have be written to decline proposal of very great moment made by felt that in circumstance mr boltby ought to have written to ought to have be told what be being done yet

life with daughter must bear no longer tenderness of heart be too much for pride broke down in resolution to be stern silent with till must have passed by be so much more to than be to be in whereas

post rough copy of what have better say have copied ladyship word verbatim there be matter of doubt at that on such subject average woman can write better letter than average man cousin george be therefore right to obtain assistance from female friend slept at penrith till nearly noon then breakfasted started with post horse for humblethwaite felt that everybody knew what be about be almost ashamed of being seen nevertheless obeyed instruction have driven up through lodge across park into large stable yard of hall lady altringham have quite understood that more people must see hear in

want to have anything more to do with said sir harry be very well a emily want in respect be at variance with father there be difficulty lady elizabeth pleaded that kind of civility at least mitigation of opposition must be shown for emily sake at last be commissioned to go to cousin george to send away from house if necessary to make appointment between sir harry at crown at penrith for morrow nothing on earth must induce sir harry to see cousin anywhere on own premise a for meeting between cousin george emily be of course out of question must go from humblethwaite such be

elizabeth great deal if must write be so bad at writing then sir harry will go over see to morrow at penrith will be so very troublesome to need not regard at what hour will come cousin george be profuse in declaring that must be at cousin disposal at hour sir harry might select from six in morning throughout day night might not say word to emily at proposition lady elizabeth shook head vigorously be quite out of question circumstanced a be at present sir harry must not think of thing then must do good lady elizabeth did not believe that emily must wish at rate there need be further talk about a such interview be at present quite impossible by argument refusal tone in be pronounced cousin george be taught to perceive at rate in mind of lady elizabeth process of parental yielding have already commenced on such occasion interview be bad teller of story venture to take opportunity of recommending parent in such case always to refuse interview not only between young lady lover who be to be excluded also between lover vacillating tone even when resolve to suppress vacillation have be most determined be perceived understood at once utilized by least argumentative of lover even by lover who be obtuse word never may be so pronounced a to make young lady twenty thousand pound full present value for ten in lover pocket there must be argument letter interview young lady love must be starved by absence of other mention of name by imperturbable good humour on other matter of with whom come in contact in own domestic circle if be worth anything wo be starved if starving to death be possible be way to starve lady elizabeth be bad ambassador cousin george when took leave promising to be ready to meet sir harry at twelve on morrow must almost comfort with prospect of success might be successful if only must stave off walker bullbean portion of mr hart persecution for understood that success of view at humblethwaite must postpone payment by sir harry of money for mr hart captain stubber be so unreasonably greedy must have dared to defy greed for walker bullbean portion of affair sir harry already knew that be in debt to men already knew with fair accuracy amount of debt hart stubber must not make worse in sir harry eye than be already unless walker bullbean story must be told with purpose of destroying how did hate walker bullbean memory of evening yet money now enabled to drink champagne at penrith crown be poor mr walker money a be driven back to penrith thought of for moment sadly at others almost with triumph might not letter to mr hart with perhaps word of truth in do good that evening after champagne wrote letter dear mr hart thing be going uncommon well here only hope will hing to disturb just at present must come off if little time be given then shilling will be paid few pound more le wo make difference do arrange will find will never forget how kind have be have be at humblethwaite to day thing be going quite smooth yours most sincerely george hotspur mention walker name everything will be settled just a will fix crown penrith thursday moment letter be written rang bell gave to waiter such be valour of drink operating on now a have done when wrote that other letter to sir drink made brave to write to make attempt to dare consequence even whilst brave with drink knew that morning prudence must refuse assent to such courage therefore to save from effect of morning cowardice put letter at once out of own power of control after fashion be arranged most of cousin george affair before dinner on day evening of have passed with mr walker have resolved that certain hint given to by mr bullbean must be of avail to not to have yet descended must so descend with brandy after dinner divine courage have come success have attended brave a soon a be awake on morning after writing to mr hart rang bell to inquire whether letter have given to waiter at twelve o'clock last night be still in house be too late letter in so imprudent mention have be made of mr walker name be already in post never mind said cousin george to none brave deserve fair then turned round for nap be not much past nine sir harry must not be there before twelve in mean time there have be hope also doubt also at humblethwaite sir harry be not surprised hardly disappointed when be told that be to go to penrith to see cousin offer have be made by be sure that must not escape with le when emily be told by mother of arrangement saw in way to fulfilment of prayer have made to father must say nothing to that evening leaving to opportunity of speaking to must choose to do so on following morning must repeat prayer on evening not word be said about george while sir harry lady elizabeth be together with daughter emily have made plan clung to father be very gentle with sitting close to a played piece of music to in evening caressing looking lovingly into eye a bade god bless when left for night have determined to say nothing to encourage be still minded that there must be such encouragement doubted in heart of heart doubted must still have bought off cousin george by sacrifice of property yet doubted after there must be consolation in binding together of name property what will say to lady elizabeth asked husband night tell to go away nothing more than what more be there to say if be willing to be bought will buy will pay debt give income think then there can be hope hope for whom for emily hope to preserve from scoundrel yet have thought of consolation emily be very persistent in carrying out plan prayer at humblethwaite be always read with admirable punctuality at quarter past nine so breakfast might be commenced at half past sir harry week day be in own room for three quarter of hour before prayer be like clock work at humblethwaite there must always be man men with sir harry during three quarter of hour tenant gamekeeper groom gardener bailiff emily calculated that if made appearance held ground tenant bailiff must give way that thus must ensure private interview with father be to wait till after breakfast must be difficult very few minute after half hour knocked at door be admitted village blacksmith be then suggesting new smithy papa said emily if must allow minute village blacksmith bailiff who be also present withdrew bowing to emily who gave to of smile nod be old familiar friend looked kindly at be to be future lady be not important that future lord must be hotspur sir harry have thought not improbable that daughter must come to must have preferred to avoid interview if possible here be however must not be avoided papa said kissing be going to penrith to day yes dear to see cousin george yes emily will remember what be saying other day what said will endeavour to do duty a best may said sir harry after pause be sure will papa so do do endeavour to do duty will not try to help certainly will try to help for sake rather than for own if can help with money by paying debt giving mean to live will do so papa be not what mean what else can do save from evil of way will try must if knew how even if only for name sake for sake also papa papa let do together mamma let come here be impossible let come here said a though disregarding refusal need not be afraid of know how much there be to do will be very hard in doing before other arrangement can be talked about be not afraid of child let come then must do good do think must live here quietly try must people say never mind what people must say be cousin be heir be person whom love best in world have not right to have here if wish know what be thinking of papa there can never be anybody else never emily will kill think dear papa let see if can not try oh papa pray pray let see when went away bailiff blacksmith returned sir harry power of resistance be gone so that succumbed to new smithy without word chapter xx cousin george success thought crowded quick into mind of sir harry hotspur a have driven over to penrith be dull dreary day in november took close carriage distance be about ten mile have therefore something above hour for thinking when men think much can rarely decide affair a to man have once acknowledged to that may be wise foolish prudent imprudent be seldom matter on can by amount of thought bring to purpose to own eye will be clearly correct when can decide without thinking then can decide without doubt with perfect satisfaction in matter sir harry thought much there have be various time at be quite sure that be duty to repudiate cousin utterly there have never be time at have be willing to accept nevertheless at moment with struggle of thought must not resolve be higher duty due to daughter to family through family to country a believed owed security glory to maintenance of aristocracy must be justified justified in degree in subjecting child to danger in hope that name family pride might be maintained might take own desire in direction a make weight towards compliance with girl strong wish grounded a be on quite other reason mr boltby have be very eager in telling that ought to have nothing to say to cousin have loaded cousin name with imaginable evil epithet of mr boltby truth honesty there must be doubt then mr boltby have certainly exceeded duty be of course disposed by professional view of matter to think step wisest must tend to save property from dangerous hand sir harry felt that there be thing to be saved of more value than property family title perhaps reprobate cousin then above child did believe that child must not smile for again unless must consent to make effort in favour of lover doubtless man be very bad sir harry be sick at heart a thought of evil nature of young man vice of man debauched in life extravagant with money even of gambler drunkard one fond of low men of low woman of one even such a there might be hope vicious man if will give up vice may still be loved at last respected of liar swindler one mean a well a vicious what hope must there be be essential to sir harry that husband of daughter must at rate be gentleman man blood indeed be good blood will show at last let mud be ever so deep so said sir harry to emily must consent that man must be tried by what severest fire might be kindled for trying of if there be gold there might be possible to send dross adrift to get gold without alloy must lady altringham have read sir harry mind a carriage be pulled up just at twelve o'clock at door of penrith crown must have be stronger than ever in belief that young lover if be firm can always conquer opposing parent ala ala there be gold with dross in matter of blood a to sir harry idea be so strong indeed so noble entertained muddled theory noblesse oblige high position will demand will often exact high work that rule hold a good with buonaparte a with bourbon with cromwell a with stewart succeeds a often fails a often with low born a with high good blood too will have effect physical for most part will produce bottom lasting courage capacity of carrying on through mud to sir harry be wont to allude good blood will bring man back to honesty two thing together doubt assist in producing highest order of self denying man when sir harry got out of carriage have not yet made up mind waiter have be told that be expected showed up at once into large sitting room looking out into street cousin george have bespoke for occasion have have smaller room have be smoking there at moment in room there be decanter wine glass on chiffonier in one corner have heard bustle of arrival have at once gone into saloon prepared for reception of great man be so sorry to give trouble said cousin george coming forward to greet cousin sir harry must not refuse cousin hand though must willingly have done so have be possible must not mind trouble said if be of use fear can be of none hope will not be prejudiced against sir harry trust be not prejudiced against one be that wish to do want permission to go to humblethwaite a suitor for daughter hand so far cousin george have prepared speech beforehand what have to recommend to father for such permission do not know sir that when gentleman proposes to lady be duty to show that be in condition fit for position seek that in character in mean in rank in conduct be at least equal a for rank sir harry be same for mean know that daughter be heiress do be not that have brought to of course have nothing then know though will inherit estate must inherit if please sir will not go into again said sir harry interrupting explained to before sir must have admitted future rank a counterpoise to fortune if must have trusted character can not trust know why must thrust upon necessity of saying again a believe that be in pecuniary distress made offer thought to be liberal be liberal did not suit to accept george have inkling of what must pas within sir harry bosom a to acceptance rejection of offer wrote to declining a have received answer thought must just run down what be to do do how can tell pay debt money be offered can not give up cousin have be allowed to receive letter left for yesterday now sir harry have doubted much in own mind a to letter during morning interview have still be in own possession a be preparing to leave house have made up mind that must have lady elizabeth have be commissioned to give not without instruction explanation father must not keep from because trusted implicitly be to understand that must mean nothing to that letter must not of course be answered doe not matter whether did did not said sir harry ask again whether will accept offer made by mr boltby give written promise not to renew suit can not do sir harry sir harry did not know how to proceed with interview a have come there proposition must be made by have intended to be altogether obstinate must have remained at humblethwaite kept cousin altogether out of house now daughter prayer be ringing in ear dear papa let see if can not try then again that assurance have made so solemnly papa there never can be anybody else if black sheep must be washed white good of such washing must on side be so great must have to blush let washing be ever so perfect must always blush in having son in law have be forced to acknowledge to of late that there be infinitely more of trouble shame in world than of joy honour be not in disgrace that hotspur must do such thing a cousin have done disgrace also that daughter must have loved man so unfit to be lover then from day to day from hour to hour remembered that ill be added to death of son who have lived must have be glory to more of trouble disgrace be not trouble disgrace must have wished that day might come for to go away leave be not that for one placed a be placed own life must not see end of trouble must endeavour to provide that everything must not go to utter ruin a soon a must have taken departure walked about room again trying to think perhaps thinking be over with now be resolving in own mind how best might begin to yield must obey daughter must not break heart of only child be left to have delight in world other than what came to reflected back from felt now a though be simply steward endeavouring on behalf to manage thing to best advantage still only steward a such only servant who must not at last decide on mode of management to be adopted must endeavour to persuade must decide now daughter have decided must begin task so utterly distasteful to of endeavouring to wash blackamoor white what be willing to do asked how to do sir harry have led bad life suppose have sir harry how will show willing to reform only pay debt set up with ready money will go along a slick a grease thus must cousin george have answered question have spoken mind freely knew that might not be so explicit must promise much of course in making promise must arrange about debt will do almost anything like only try of course must be so much easier if debt be paid off will give up race altogether if mean that sir harry indeed be ready to give up anything will give up london london in simple truth george did not quite understand proposition yes will leave london will go live at scarrowby learn to look after farm place george face fell face being le used to lying than tongue tongue lied at once oh yes certainly if wish must rather like life of sort for how long must be for two year said sir harry grimly cousin george in truth did not understand thought that be to take bride with when went to scarrowby perhaps emily must not like said be what desire suppose that know so little of past life a to be willing to trust into hand at once be attached to so be to on honour be be sure doubt that sir harry doubted word fell from cousin mouth still persevered must perceive though must not analyse there be hardly tone poor cousin george used did not discourage baronet still persevered must persevere now even if be only to prove to emily how much of basest clay how little of gold there be in image be attached to continued bear name will be head of family if will submit to reformed life will prove that be fit for may be possible that after year must be wife after year sir harry yes sir after year do suppose that happiness of such one a can be trusted to such keeping a yours without trial of will find that have such hope oh of course what like will pay debt on condition that mr boltby be satisfied that have entire list of george a heard at once determined that must persuade mr hart to include mr walker little account in due to be only matter of few hundred might surely be arranged when so much real money must be passing from hand to hand will pay everything will then go down to scarrowby house will be prepared for be supposed george thought that be absolutely to live in solitary confinement at scarrowby might have friend two then station be very near be fond of shooting will have plenty of there will get made magistrate for county there be much to do in looking after property sir harry became almost good humoured in tone a described kind of life intended that blackamoor must live will come to for month year then can come to for while when will begin asked cousin george a soon a baronet paused be question difficult to be answered in fact arrangement must be commenced at once sir harry knew very well that having so far yielded must take cousin back with to humblethwaite must keep cousin now in possession till debt must be paid till house at scarrowby must be prepared must trust to daughter prudence high sense of right not to treat lover with too tender acknowledgment of love till must have be made to pas through fire of reform have better get ready come back to humblethwaite with now said sir harry within five minute after there be bustling about passage hall of crown hotel everybody in house from august landlord down to humble stableboy knew that there have be reconciliation between sir harry cousin that cousin be to be made welcome to good god must give while cousin george be packing thing sir harry called for bill paid without looking at because must not examine how blackamoor have lived while be still blackamoor wonder whether observed brandy thought cousin george to chapter xxi emily be greater portion of journey back to humblethwaite be passed in silence sir harry have undertaken experiment in have faith be sad at heart cousin george be cowed half afraid yet half triumphant must be possible that must pull through after thing have gone so well with lady friend have be so true to lady altringham then mr morton how good have be dear lucy must never forget emily be such brick be going to see emily must be so jolly nevertheless did acknowledge to that emily prepared to assist father in sending lover through fire of reform must not be altogether so jolly a emily who have leaned against on bridge at airey force while arm have be tightly clasped round waist be alive to fact that romance must give place to business when have entered park gate sir harry spoke must understand george have not called george before since engagement have be made known to that can not yet be admitted here a daughter accepted suitor a might have be case have past life be different see said cousin george be right must tell so trust implicitly to emily high sense of duty propriety now that be here george trust that may be for advantage for ours then pressed cousin hand if not with affection at least with sincerity be sure be to be right now said george calculating whether must be able to escape to london for few day so that might be able to arrange little matter with mr hart must suppose that must be able to leave london for two year without day notice sir harry got out of carriage at front door desired cousin george to follow into house turned at once into small room where george have drunk sherry desired that lady elizabeth might be sent to dear said have brought george back with will do best that can mr quick will have room for have better tell emily let come to for moment before see cousin be said in george hearing then sir harry went leaving cousin in hand of lady elizabeth be glad to see back again george said with melancholy voice cousin george smiled said that must be right be sure hope so for girl sake there must be great change george end of change said cousin george who be not in least afraid of lady elizabeth many thing of moment have to be done in house day before dinner in first place there be long interview between father daughter for few minute perhaps be really happy when be kneeling with arm upon knee thanking for what have done while tear of joy be streaming down cheek must not bring to say word of caution to must not be to paint snow white to caution a to conduct have done a bade in everything said have proposed to that must go to scarrowby may be that will be home for while dear thanked kissed again again must be so good must do must to deserve kindness a for george pray papa think that suppose that can be done quite at once nevertheless be in direction that thought erred did seem to that hard part of work be already done now pleasant path of virtue be to be trod with happy persistent foot have better see in mother presence dearest before dinner then awkwardness will be le afterwards kissed again ran from room up to mother apartment taking back stair well known to herself lest must by chance meet lover after undue unprepared fashion there must sit down think of must be very discreet must be made to understand at once that purgation must be thorough reform complete must acknowledge love to great abiding love of lover tenderness there must be little almost none till fire have done work gold must have be separated from dross have have way so far must find that have deserved before dinner sir harry wrote letter to lawyer mail cart passed through village on way to penrith late in evening there be time for to save post thought incumbent on to let mr boltby know that have changed mind though writing of letter be not agreeable task did at once said nothing to mr

together by girl be left to be beginning to understand now that be already little better than wreck indeed be not everything shipwreck around be not going to piece on rock did not lesson of hour seem to tell throughout long life have thought too much of house name must have be better that must have waited till letter be in pocket before returned home because when reached last argument be wanting to to prove to emily that hope be vain even after arrival when full story be told to held out in resolve accepted truth of scene at walker room acknowledged that lover have cheated wretched man at card after other iniquity be of course a nothing there be completeness in of did not fail to accept to use benefit when have once taken a true that lover have robbed inferior by foul play at card there must be good in alluding to lie in counting up that disreputable debt in alluding to habit of brandy drinking even in soiling pure mind with word a to mr morton be granted that be a vile a sin must make have not saviour come exactly for such a one because of great love for who be vile must not human love for one enable to do great heavenly love did always for men reader will know how easily answerable be argument most reader will also know how hard be to win by attacking reason when heart be fortress be in question have accepted guilt why tell of further did not pine over guilt weep for day night pray that might yet be made white a snow guilty a be poor piece of broken vilest clay without property even be useful to potter be a dear to a when have leaned against believing to be pillar of gold set about with onyx stone jasper ruby there be one sin on part must divide if indeed must cease to love then there must be end to must have be better that sir harry must have remained in london till must have returned with george autograph letter in pocket must have letter in own handwriting mr boltby have said cunningly only must return to sir harry have understood have promised that letter must be returned when have be used for cruel purpose for be to be sent to humblethwaite for sir harry own purpose mr boltby statement must have quite sufficed be told that lover must renounce must not believe what be told of course must accept payment of debt of course must take income when offered to what else be to do how be to live decently without income evil have happened to because have be expected to live a gentleman without proper mean in fact be person who have be most injured father in complete in almost abject tenderness towards must not say rough word in answer to argument must only repeat assertion over over again that man be utterly unworthy of must be discarded be a nothing man must discard be false a hell said sir harry be to be a false a hell also will love better when have consented to be untrue even must be lie do love must love may be more wicked than be because do so do poor lady elizabeth in day be worse than useless daughter be so strong that weakness be a weakness of water be driven hither thither in way that felt to be disgraceful when husband told that cousin a matter of course must never be seen again assented when emily implored to act a mediator with father on behalf of wicked cousin again assented then when be alone with sir harry did not dare to do a have promised do think will kill said to sir harry must die need not die disgraced said be most solemn answer told thought have be dwelling in mind son have gone from now might be that daughter must go too because must not survive disappointment of young love have learned to think that might be so a looked at great grave eye pale cheek sorrow laden mouth might be so better for than that must be contaminated by touch of thing so vile a cousin be pure a snow clear a star lovely a opening rosebud a be let go to grave if need be so for must die too even live if be required of other father since jephtha agamemnon have recognised a true that heaven have demanded from daughter letter came be read re read by sir harry before showed to child took also to wife explained to in point have more craft said than gave credit for suppose ever cared for said lady elizabeth for human being that ever lived save wonder whether got boltby to write for surely mr boltby must have done know think must do anything to rid from what believed to have be danger think be in george hotspur to write letter out of own head doe signify not in least be own handwriting signature whoever formed word be same thing be needed only to prove to that have not even merit of being true to for while sir harry thought that must entrust to wife duty of showing letter to emily must so willingly have escaped task a considered matter feared that lady elizabeth might lack firmness to explain matter fully to poor girl daughter must be so much stronger than mother thus thing must be done must not be effected at last on evening of day on letter have reached sent for read to heard without word then put into hand read sentence slowly one after endeavouring a did so to find argument by might stave off conclusion to knew that father must attempt to bring must be over now said at last did not answer gazed into face with look of woe that heart be melted have found no argument there have not be in whole letter one word of love for darling will not be better that must meet blow have met along day perhaps might be different in what way dearest doe not even profess to hope so that gentleman in london papa must have paid nothing for unless wrote like have to do papa have better just leave to myself will not trouble by mentioning name emily well papa mamma can not bear that must suffer alone must suffer silence be easiest will go now think about dear papa know that have always done everything for best did not see again that evening mother be with in own room of course be talking about cousin george for hour together must not be avoided in spite of what emily have herself said of expediency of silence did not once allude to possibility of future marriage a man be so dear to a bore name a must inherit father title must not almost superhuman exertion be made for salvation surely so much a might be done if made work of life must be work of life mamma said lady elizabeth forbore from telling that there be side on must approach poor girl however must have felt that be so a thought of reminded that though be separated mile asunder still must pray for need not doubt at least to who utters prayer of intercession be of avail on following morning be at breakfast father mother remarked that something have be changed in dress father only knew that be so mother must have told of ribbon have be dropped ornament have be laid aside emily hotspur have lived while if not among gayest of gay at least among brightest of bright in outside garniture having be asked to consult question of expense have taught to dress a do gay bright rich even when george have come on last wretched visit to humblethwaite when have known that have be brought there a blackamoor perhaps just capable of being washed white have not thought necessary to lessen gaud of attire though be saddened in joy by knowledge of man fault be still rich daughter of very wealthy man engaged to marry future inheritor of wealth rich there be then reason why must lower flag one inch before world now be changed with during night have thought of apparel of what use might be during future life must never more go bright again unless miracle might prevail still might be to that have painted father mother a kissed said word a to appearance must take away from humblethwaite change scene try to interest in new pursuit be what have determined to attempt for present must let put on what clothes pleased make remark early in day went out by be now december weather be fine dry be for two hour alone rambling through park have made attempt in life have failed owned failure to herself absolutely image have gold in none a yet be not a other image a be made so must remain to end divine spirit might from first have breathed into clay particle of own worth be still efficacious to bestow gift prayer must not be wanting thing a now be saw in impurity have never loved have loved must not have written word such a have read have pretended to love in order that might have money that debt might be paid that might not be ruined hoped said in letter hoped that cousin might be made happy by splendid alliance remembered well abominable heartless word be man who have pledged to truth firmness whose own truth firmness have never doubted for moment even when acknowledging to herself necessity of pledge to have never loved though did not say so did not think so felt that of sin that sin be one must not be forgiven what must now do with how bear herself at present moment of life did not tell now that must die though a looked forward into life be so dreary to that must fain have known that death must give escape there be duty for still to do during winter ramble owned to herself for first time that father have be right in judgment respecting cousin that by pertinacity have driven father on till on account have be forced into conduct be distasteful to must own to father that have be right that man though dearly loved still be of such nature that must be quite unfit that must marry there might still be miracle prayer be still own to give of must say nothing to father must simply confess to that have be right then beg of to pardon trouble have caused papa said to following morning may come to came in on occasion sat down at right hand of course have be right papa said have be right dearest hope papa have be wrong thought knew did not thought when told that be so bad that be believing false people papa know now must not have loved a did so quickly like nobody have blamed for moment nobody have thought of blaming blame enough can tell feel a though have in way

killed for world know how girl be to get over when have said that have loved one if be married then doe not want to get over if be not if desert be unworthy what can do then just go on thinking of till dy sir harry used with old accustomed argument to drive such thought out of head told how good be god to creature specially how good in curing by soft hand of time such wound a from be suffering must retrick beam once more flame in forehead of morning sky if only must help work of time by own endeavour fight against feeling emily try to conquer will be conquered papa wish to conquer must not tell of only for one thing what thing dearest be not like other girl who can just leave alone be of trouble told that if outlived property will be yours certainly of course be hope be that will be settled by marriage before death trouble labour be more than woman must be called on to support alone just so be because be thinking of feel right to tell papa will never be married will leave for present emily very well only if must make change in will must make will have to be here papa after be gone probably if be not so must not know what to do be papa only that beg pardon for trouble have caused then knelt before kissed head blessed wept over there be nothing more heard from cousin george at humblethwaite nothing more heard of for long time mr boltby did pay debt having terribly hard struggle with mr hart captain stubber before liquidation be satisfactorily effected be very hard to make mr hart captain stubber understand that baronet be paying debt simply because have said that

said have promised whereby be alluding to promise have made to daughter everything be paid cousin george be able to walk in out of club free man at time almost happy with annuity of five hundred pound
