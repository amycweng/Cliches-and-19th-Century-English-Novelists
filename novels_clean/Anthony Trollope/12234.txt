limit for few year father bore with patiently doubling allowance paying bill for again again made up mind with many regret enough have be done for younger son who must surely by intellect be able to do much for then became necessary to encroach on fund already put by at last there came final blow when discovered that captain scarborough have raised large sum on post obit from jew jew simply requested father to pay money portion of if at once paid must satisfy explaining to otherwise whole property must at death fall into hand need not here be explained how through one sad year negotiation be prolonged at last there came time in mr scarborough sitting in chamber in albany boldly declared purpose sent for own lawyer mr grey greatly astonished that gentleman by declaring to that captain scarborough be illegitimate at first mr grey refused altogether to believe assertion made to have be very conversant with affair of family have even dealt with marriage settlement on behalf of lady in question knew scarborough well rather have not known have heard much of therefore suspected mr grey be thoroughly respectable man mr scarborough though upright honorable in many

absolute in circumstance mr scarborough have sent for mr grey to come to at albany have there from bed declared that eldest son be illegitimate mr grey have at first refused to accept assertion a being worth anything have by mean confined to polite language in expressing belief must much rather have nothing to do with have said when mr scarborough insisted on truth of statement evidence be here said mr scarborough laying hand on small bundle of paper difficulty must have be danger in causing mountjoy to have be accepted in brother place there can be doubt be not married till after mountjoy be born mr grey curiosity be roused began to ask question why in first place have mr scarborough behaved so dishonestly why have originally not married wife then why have married if a said proof be so easy how have dared to act so directly in opposition to law of country why indeed have be through whole of life so bad man so bad to woman who have borne name so bad to son whom called illegitimate so bad also to other son whom now intended to restore to position solely with view of defrauding captain creditor in answer to mr scarborough though be suffering much at time so much a to be considered near to death have replied with most perfect good humor have done very well thought by wife whom have married after have consented to live with on other term have done very well by elder son for whom have intended entire property have done well by second son for whom have saved money be now first duty to save property regarded a being altogether unselfish virtuous from point of view when mr grey have spoken about law of country have simply smiled though be expecting grievous operation on following day a for marriage have great respect for except a mode of enabling men woman to live together comfortably a for outraged law of country of mr grey spoke much did not care straw for such outrage indeed for expressed opinion of mankind a to conduct be very soon about to leave world meant to do best must for son augustus other son be past hope be hardly angry with eldest son who have undoubtedly given cause for just anger apparent motif in telling truth about at last be rather of defrauding jew who have expressed to with brutal audacity than of punishing one son doing justice to other even of spoke with cynical good humor triumphing in idea of thoroughly getting better of be consoled mr grey said when think how probably might have be discovered after death must have destroyed laid hand upon paper still there might have be discovery mr grey must not think that during last twenty four year period have elapsed since birth of younger son idea of such truth have occurred to did at last consent to take paper in hand to read through with care took away with promise with assurance that must bring back on day one following must mr scarborough then be alive mr scarborough who seemed at moment to have much life in insisted on proviso surgeon be to be here to morrow know coming may mean great deal will have paper be quite clear will know what to do will see mountjoy evening suppose will have grace to come a doe not know what be coming for then father smiled again lawyer went mr scarborough though be very strong of heart did have misgiving a time came at be to see son communication have to make be certainly one of vital importance son have time since instigated to come to term with family creditor a captain boldly called seeing that never owed shilling in life father before be odd must have family creditor father have answered property have then at rate son have said with scowl be now twelve month since before mankind jew among have heard of mr scarborough illness now there must be question of dealing on favorable term with gentleman mr scarborough be therefore aware that evil thing be about to say to son must have lost extreme bitterness did not occur to that in making such revelation a to son mother must inflict great grief on son heart to be illegitimate must be thought nothing unless illegitimacy carried with loss of property hardly gave weight enough to feeling that eldest son be eldest son too little to triumph be present to own mind in saving property for one of family augustus be captain brother be old squire son two brother have hitherto lived together on fairly good term for younger have be able to lend money to elder elder have found brother severe exacting how might be between when relation with other must be altogether changed mr scarborough did not trouble to inquire captain by own reckless folly have lost money have lost that fortune must have given a father eldest son after having done so what must matter to whether be legitimate illegitimate brother a possessor of tretton park must be able to do much more for than must be expected from professional man working for bread mr scarborough have looked at matter round for space of two year during latter year have slowly resolved on line of action have have scruple in passing off eldest born a legitimate now must have none in declaring truth to world what scruple need have seeing that be so soon about to leave world a to what took place at interview between father son very much be said among club in society to captain mountjoy scarborough be well known very little of absolute truth be ever revealed be known that captain scarborough left room under combined authority of apothecary servant that old man have fainted from effect of interview have undoubtedly told son of simple fact a have declared to mr grey have thought to be unnecessary to confirm statement by proof indeed proof such a be written testimony be be at moment in hand of mr grey to mr grey father have at last referred son son have absolutely refused to believe for moment in story have declared that father mr grey have conspired together to rob of inheritance good name interview be at last over mr scarborough at one moment fainting in next suffering extremest agony be left alone with thought captain scarborough when left father room found going out from albany into piccadilly be infuriated at same time most wretched man did believe that conspiracy have be hatched be resolved to do best to defeat let effect be what might on property yet there be strong feeling in breast that fraud must be successful man must possibly be environed by worse circumstance a to own condition owed knew not what amount of money to several creditor then owed troubled more gambling debt must only pay by brother assistance now a thought of felt convinced that brother must be joined with father lawyer in conspiracy felt also that must meet mr grey brother without personally attacking world might perish with last breath must declare to be captain mountjoy scarborough of tretton park though knew at moment that must perish a regarded social life among comrade unless must raise five hundred pound from brother yet felt that be to meet brother must not fly at throat accuse of basest villany at moment at corner of bond street did meet brother what be said fiercely what be what said augustus without fierceness what be up now have just come from father how be governor if be must be in most awful funk must hardly be able to think of anything that man who be to come to morrow with knife take a cool a cucumber there be something in at once shook though did not remove captain belief said something a to property then there came question answer in captain did not reveal story have be told to barrister did assert that have a yet heard nothing a to anything of importance a to tretton captain believed brother manner rather than word in fact barrister have heard nothing a yet of what be to be done on behalf interview ended in two men going dining at club where captain told whole story of father imagined iniquity augustus received tale almost in silence in reply to brother authoritative domineering speech said nothing to be new to also seemed certainly to be untrue did not at bring to believe that mr grey be in conspiracy have scruple of paternal regard to make feel that father must not concoct such scheme simply because be father must be saving of spoil from amalekites of idea did give hardly expressed hint to brother by george said captain nothing of kind will be done with consent why barrister have answered suppose that consent mine be to be asked seems a though be farce ordered to be played over poor governor grave have prepared romance a to truth falsehood of can possibly be called a witness be clear to captain that brother have thought that plot have be prepared by father in anticipation of own death nevertheless by younger brother assistance much needed sum of money be found for supply of elder immediate want next day be day of terror nothing more be heard either then for following week of old gentleman scheme in two day be understood that death might be hourly expected on third be thought that might pull through a younger son filially expressed be constantly with father not word passed lip a to property elder son kept gloomily apart indeed during part of next week be out of london augustus scarborough did call on mr grey only learned from that be at rate true that story have be told by father mr grey refused to make farther communication simply saying that must a yet express opinion for myself said augustus a left attorney chamber can only profess so much astonished a to have opinion suppose must simply wait see what fortune intends to do with at end of fortnight mr scarborough have so far recovered strength a to be able to be moved down to tretton thither went be not many day after that world be first informed that captain scarborough be not father world received information with great deal of expressed surprise inward satisfaction satisfaction that money lender must be done out of money that professed gambler like captain scarborough must suddenly become illegitimate nobody more interesting still that very wealthy well conditioned if not actually respectable squire must have proved to be most brazen faced rascal of be matter gave extreme delight to world at large at first there came little paragraph without name then hour afterward name became known to quidnunc in short space of time be in possession of very gentry who found defrauded in singular manner be not necessary here must recapitulate circumstance of original fraud for gross fraud have be perpetrated after perpetration of fraud paper have be prepared by mr scarborough with great deal of ingenuity matter have be so arranged that for own declaration eldest son must undoubtedly have inherited property now there be measure to clamor uproar raised by money lender mr grey outer office be besieged clerk simply stated that fact must be proved on mr scarborough death a clearly a might be possible to prove curse uttered against old squire be bitter deep during time be still supposed to be lying at death door did not in truth expect to live many day creditor of course believed that story be fiction none of be enabled to see captain scarborough who after short period disappeared altogether from scene be one convinced that matter have be arranged between father there be one from whom better thing be expected than to advance money on post obit to gambler at rate by be to be repaid one hundred pound for forty pound on death of gentleman who be then supposed to be dying for be proved afterward that mr tyrrwhit have made most minute inquiry among old squire servant a to state of master health have supplied forty thousand pound for be to receive one hundred thousand pound when squire died alleging that must have difficulty in recovering money have collected sum so advanced on better term among friend have become conspicuously odious in matter in about month time be generally believed that mr scarborough have so managed matter that scheme must be successful struggle be made to bring matter at once into law court attempt for moment failed be said that squire down at tretton be too ill that proceeding must be taken a soon a be able to bear rumor be afloat that must be taken into custody be even asserted that two policeman be in house at tretton be soon known that policeman be there that squire be free to go whither must rather whither must in fact though will to punish even to arrest be there one have power to do injury be then declared that have in sense broken law that evil act of must be proved that though have wished eldest son to inherit property wrongfully have only wished that have now simply put wish into unison with law have undone evil have hitherto only contemplated indeed world at large rather sympathized with squire when mr tyrrwhit dealing became known for be supposed by many that mr tyrrwhit be to have become sole owner of tretton creditor be still loud still envenomed emissary hung about tretton demanded to know where be captain of captain whereabouts father knew nothing not even whether be still alive for captain have actually disappeared from world creditor must obtain tidings respecting at period for long afterward imagined that father be in league together be determined to try at law question a to legitimacy of birth a soon a old squire must be dead old squire did not die though life be supposed to be most precarious still continued to live became even stronger remained shut up at tretton utterly refused to see emissary of creditor to give mr tyrrwhit due must be acknowledged that personally sent emissary having contented with putting business into hand of very sharp attorney there be emissary from others who after while be excluded altogether from park here mr scarborough continued to live coming out on to lawn in easy chair there smoking cigar reading french novel through hot july day to tell truth cared very little for emissary excepting so far a have be allowed to interfere with own personal comfort in day have down with two three friend from london who be good enough to make up for whist table in country found chief interest in life in occasional visit of younger son look upon mountjoy a utterly gone said have utterly gone other son replied a to care nothing believe that man can be murdered without leaving trace of murder man can not even throw overboard without being missed know nothing of whereabouts nothing at must say that absence be relief to only comfort left to in world be in presence in material good thing be still able to enjoy assertion a to ignorance about eldest son squire repeated again again to chosen heir feeling be only probable that augustus might participate in belief knew to be only too common there be doubt idea prevalent that squire captain be in league together to cheat creditor that squire who in day received much undeserved credit for machiavellian astuteness knew more than one else respecting eldest son affair in truth at first knew nothing in making assurance to younger son be altogether wasting breath for younger son knew everything chapter ii florence mountjoy mr scarborough have niece one florence mountjoy to whom have be intended that captain scarborough must be married there have be consideration of money when intention have be first formed for lady be possessed of more than ten thousand pound must have be a nothing to prospect of

other little property be sweeter to than scent be more valuable in eye than precious stone have never a yet actually asked to love be so quick linguist that have understood down to last letter what token have meant cousin captain scarborough be to magnificent powerful terrible withal have asked thousand time whether must be possible for to love to become wife have never quite given even to herself answer to question till have suddenly found enabled to do so by over confidence in asking to confess that loved have never acknowledged anything even to a to harry annesley have never told that must be possible that must ask such question have wild dreamy fearful feeling although must be possible to to refuse cousin must be impossible that must marry other while must still be desirous of making wife now captain scarborough have threatened harry annesley not indeed by name still clearly enough dream of own in direction must be vain dream a harry annesley be going to be what be generally called hero of story be necessary that something must be said of particular of life existence up to period there will be found to be nothing very heroic about be young man with more than fair allowance of young man folly may also be said of young man weakness be inclined to think that there be little of young man selfishness with nothing of falseness dishonesty be therefore tempted to tell story be son of clergyman eldest of large family of child a be acknowledged heir to mother brother who be squire of parish of father be rector be not thought necessary that must follow profession uncle be squire of buston be after not rich man whole property did not exceed two thousand year income fifty year since be supposed to be sufficient for moderate want of moderate country gentleman though buston be not very far removed from centre of everything being in hertfordshire not more than forty mile from london mr prosper lived so retired life be so far removed from way of men that apparently did not know that heir be a completely entitled to lead idle life a though be son of duke brewer must not however be imagined that mr prosper be especially attached to nephew when boy left charter house where uncle have paid school bill be sent to cambridge with allowance of two hundred fifty pound year that allowance be still continued to with assurance under circumstance must ever be increased at college have be successful left cambridge with college fellowship therefore left with one hundred seventy five pound added to income be considered by at buston rectory to be rich young man harry did not find that combined income amounted to rich amid world of idleness at buston be constantly told by uncle of necessity of economy indeed mr prosper who be sickly little man about fifty year of age always spoke of a though intended to live for half century rarely walked across park to rectory once week on sunday entertained rectory family sad occasion generally be to elder of rectory child who be thus doomed to abandon loud pleasantry of own home for sober sunday solemnity of hall be not that squire of buston be peculiarly religious man that rector be reverse parson be joyous whereas other be solemn squire who never went to church because be supposed to be ill made up for deficiency by devotional tendency when child be at hall read through sermon after dinner unintelligibly even inaudibly at brother in law who have evening service in own church of course never be present mr annesley girl be there younger child harry annesley have absolutely declined uncle having found out that never attended church service although always left hall with father made ground for quarrel at last came to pas mr prosper who be jealous irritable must hardly speak to nephew two hundred fifty pound went on with many bickering on subject between parson squire once when squire spoke of discontinuing harry father reminded that young man have be brought up in absolute idleness in conformity with uncle desire squire denied in strong language harry have not hitherto run loudly in debt kicked over trace very outrageously a absolutely must be heir allowance be permitted to go on there be one lady who conceived manner of bad thing a to harry annesley because a alleged of want of profession of fixed income mr mountjoy florence mother be lady florence have read word in harry language not knowing indeed that have read anything still never having missed single letter mr mountjoy also have read good deal though not dreaded appearance of harry a declared lover in eye captain scarborough be very handsome very powerful very grand personage feared that florence be being induced to refuse allegiance to sovereign by interference of other very indifferent suitor what must be buston two thousand year a compared with glory limitless income of great tretton property captain scarborough with mustache magnificence be just man who must be sure to become peer have always heard income fixed at thirty thousand year must few debt signify to thirty thousand year such have be thought up to period of captain scarborough late visit when have come to cheltenham have renewed demand for florence hand somewhat roughly have spoken ambiguous word dreadful word declaring that internecine quarrel have taken place between father word though have be very dreadful have be altogether misunderstood by mr mountjoy property knew to be entailed knew that when property be entailed present owner of have nothing to do with future disposition captain scarborough at rate be anxious for marriage mr mountjoy be inclined to accept encumbered a now be with father wrath in preference to poor harry annesley in june harry came up to london there learned at club singular story in regard to old mr scarborough son mr scarborough have declared son illegitimate world knew now that be utterly penniless hopelessly in debt that have be greatly embarrassed harry have known for many month added to be now fact very generally believed that be not never have be heir to tretton park still increasing property about tretton on so many hope have be founded must belong to brother harry a heard tale immediately connected with florence have of course known captain be suitor to girl hand there have be time when thought that own hope be consequently vain gradually conviction dawned upon florence did not love grand warrior that be afraid of rather awe struck must be terrible now be brought to marry by feeling of awe then learned that warrior have gone down to cheltenham in restlessness of spirit pursued when reached cheltenham warrior have already gone property be certainly entailed said mr mountjoy have called at once at house saw mother florence be discreetly sent away to own room when dangerous young man be admitted be not mr scarborough eldest son at said harry be in eye of law then have to undertake task very difficult for young man of explaining to circumstance of case there be something in so dreadful to lady imagination that failed for long time to make comprehend do mean to say that mr scarborough be not married to own wife not at first that knew doubt knew confesses a much what very wicked man must be said mr mountjoy harry must only shrug shoulder meant to rob augustus through harry again shrugged shoulder be not much more probable that if must be so very wicked must be willing to deny eldest son in order to save paying debt harry must only declare that fact be a told at least that london believed to be so that at rate captain mountjoy have gambled so recklessly a to put for ever ever out of reach of shilling of property that be clearly duty of mr mountjoy a florence mother not to accept a suitor be only by slow degree that conversation have arrived at pas harry have never a yet declared own love to mother daughter now appeared simply a narrator of terrible story at point did appear to that must introduce in guise fact be mr mountjoy said starting to foot that be in love with daughter therefore have come here to vilify captain scarborough have come said at rate to tell truth if be a say can not think right that must marry daughter say nothing of myself at rate can not be be business of yours mr annesley except must fain think that business must be mine must not prevail with mr mountjoy either on day next to allow to see florence at last be obliged to leave cheltenham without having done so chapter iv captain scarborough disappearance few day after visit to cheltenham described in last chapter harry annesley coming down passage by side of junior united service club into charles street suddenly met captain scarborough at two o'clock in morning where harry have be at hour need not now be explained may be presumed that have not be drinking tea with of female relative captain scarborough have just come out of neighboring club where have certainly be playing where to appearance have be drinking also that there must have be policeman in street be not remarkable there be one else there present to give account of what took place during five minute in two men remained together harry who be at moment surprised by encounter must have passed captain by without notice have be allowed to do so captain perceived stopped suddenly taking roughly by collar of coat harry naturally resented before word of intelligible explanation have be given two young men have quarrelled captain scarborough have received long letter from mr mountjoy praying for explanation of circumstance must not be explained stating over over again that information have come from harry annesley captain now called interfering meddlesome idiot shook violently while holding in grasp be usage harry be not man to endure there soon arose scuffle in blow have passed between captain stuck to prey shaking again again in drunken wrath till harry roused to passion almost equal to of opponent flung at last against corner of club railing there left foe sprawling upon ground having struck head violently against ground a fell harry passed on to own bed indifferent a be afterwards said to fate of antagonist occupied probably five minute in doing be seen by human eye a occurrence of night be subsequently made ground for heavy accusation against harry annesley have be told here with sufficient minuteness to show what might be said in justification in condemnation of conduct to show what might be said if truth be spoken for indeed in discussion arose on subject much be said be not true when have retired from scuffle on night harry have certainly not dreamed that serious damage have be done to man who have certainly be altogether to blame in provocation of quarrel have kept temper feeling completely under control knocked down captain scarborough only in self defence have not allowed to be roused to wrath by treatment must not give rise to wrath in young man bosom no doubt when foe lay at foot must have stooped to pick up have tended wound such be not be character that of of young men with whom have be acquainted such however be conduct apparently expected from by many when circumstance of five minute be brought to light on other hand have passion not completely got better of have not at moment considered attack made upon to amount to misconduct so gross a to supersede necessity for gentle usage on own part must hardly have left man to live die a chance must have boiling with passion went way did leave man on pavement not caring much rather not thinking much whether victim might live die on next day harry annesley left london went down to buston having heard word farther about captain did not start till late in afternoon during day took trouble to make conspicuous about town heard nothing of captain scarborough twice walked along charles street looked at spot on have stood on night before in what might have be deadly conflict then told that have not be in least wounded that ferocious maddened man have attempted to do more than shake that coat have suffered not that in return have certainly struck captain with violence there be probably regret said not word on subject to one so left london for three four day nothing be heard of captain be anything said about have lodging in town at be doubt missed also have quarter at barrack at did not often sleep to be thought possible on next morning that might have betaken before evening of day have come have doubt be missed in world at large special mention be made of absence for time then among haunt be known to frequent question began to be asked a to whereabouts to be answered by doubtful assertion that nothing have be seen heard of for last sixty seventy hour must be remembered at time captain scarborough be still subject of universal remark because of story told a to birth father have declared to be illegitimate have thereby robbed creditor captain scarborough be man quite

equanimity steady fixed purpose settled down to position a elder son pretended no anger to father for injury intended be only anxious that own right must be confirmed in found that great difficulty stood in way creditor must contest right when father must die for such contest must be prepared have doubt a to own position thought that must be safer that must also probably be cheaper to purchase acquiescence of claimant than to encounter expense of prolonged trial to there might be more than one appeal of end after must be doubtful very great sum of money must probably be required very great sum must at rate be offered such arrangement must certainly be easier if brother be not present to be confronted with men whom have duped squire be still ill down at tretton not so ill that have wit

because be not own have simply gambled away among jew what can happen to man in such condition better than to turn up a hunter among rocky mountain a gold digger in australia in last adventure seems to have plunged horribly to have lost over three thousand pound must have paid that for not again certainly not again then what must do better than disappear suppose will have to make allowance of day if can live keep dark will do so there be in tacit allusion to father speedy death be grim enough father passed by without expression of displeasure certainly owed much to younger son be willing to pay by quiescence let forbear such be language held to in thinking of younger son augustus be certainly behaving well to not word of rebuke have passed lip a to infamous attempt at spoliation have be made old squire felt grateful for younger son conduct yet in heart of heart preferred elder have denuded of penny said augustus must ask to refund something of what have gone have kept very bare man

under better circumstance than brother arrangement be at last made be satisfactory to son must presume that father found to be endurable then son took leave went back to london with understood intention of pushing inquiry a to brother existence whereabouts sudden complete disappearance of captain scarborough struck mr mountjoy with deepest awe be not at first borne in upon to believe captain mountjoy scarborough officer in coldstreams acknowledged heir to tretton property have vanished away a stray street sweeper might do milliner lowest work woman at last there be advertisement in newspaper placard on wall mr mountjoy did understand that captain be gone must a yet hardly believe that be no longer heir to tretton in such short discussion with florence a be necessary on subject preferred to express opinion whatever a to conduct must by mean give way when urged to acknowledge that marriage between florence captain be longer to be regarded a possible while captain be away matter must be left a if in abeyance by mean suited young lady view mr mountjoy be not reticent woman have doubt be too free in whispering among friend something of daughter position florence have resented have still be done in cheltenham generally be regarded a engaged young lady have be in vain that have denied that be so mother word on subject be supposed to be more credible that own now man with whom be believed to be so closely connected have disappeared from world among most disreputable circumstance when explained difficulty to mother mother bade hold tongue for present seemed to hold out hope that captain might at last be restored to old position let restore ever so much must never be anything to mamma then mr mountjoy must only shake head purse lip on evening of day after fracas in street harry annesley went down to buston there remained for next two three day holding tongue absolutely a to adventure of night there be one at buston to whom must probably have made known circumstance there be clinging to certain flavor of disreputable conduct on own part sealed lip altogether louder more frequent tidings reached ear a to captain departure more strongly did feel that duty required to tell what knew upon matter many thought many fear encompassed at first be idea that have killed man by violence of blow that death have be caused by fall then occurred to that be impossible that scarborough must have be killed that account must be given a to finding of body at last persuaded that must not have killed man be assured at same time that disappearance must in sort have be occasioned by what then took place must not be that captain if alive must be aware of nature of struggle have taken place heard chiefly from newspaper full record of captain illegitimacy heard of condition with creditor heard of gambling debt be left unpaid at club saw also stated repeated that be ground for man disappearance be quite credible that man must disappear endeavor to disappear under cloud of difficulty did not require that violence must be adduced a extra cause indeed have man be minded to vanish before encounter might in human probability have be deterred by circumstance of quarrel gave extra reason for disappearance must in wise be counted with be to tell whole story in scotland yard have be grossly misused on occasion have escaped from such misusage by only mean in power still felt that have told story people far wide must have connected name with man absence worse again that florence name must have become entangled with also for first day two have from hour to hour abstained from telling that knew then when day two be passed when week have run by when fortnight have be allowed to go be impossible for not to hold tongue became nervous unhappy irritated down at buston with father mother sister more especially with uncle previous to uncle for couple of month have declined to see now be sent for to hall interrogated daily on special subject mr prosper be aware that nephew have be intimate with augustus scarborough that might therefore be presumed to know much about family mr prosper took keenest interest in illegitimacy impecuniosity final disappearance of captain doubt did in cross examination discover fact that harry be unwilling to answer question found out for first time that harry be acquainted with captain also contrived to extract from name of miss mountjoy must learn nothing else beyond harry absolute unwillingness to talk upon subject be in much must be understood that harry be not specially reverential in communication indeed gave uncle to understand that regarded question a impertinent at last declared intention of not coming to hall more for present then mr prosper whispered to sister that be quite sure that harry annesley knew more than choose to say a to captain scarborough whereabouts dear peter said mr annesley really think that be doing poor injustice mr annesley be always on guard to maintain something like affectionate intercourse between own family squire dear anne see into millstone a far a do never did peter really must say such thing of harry when police officer be looking about to catch up anything in way must catch up at moment notice if heard that magistrate of county have expressed opinion why tell said mr prosper there be nothing to tell ah be opinion because ca see into millstone tell that harry know more about captain scarborough than one else be very intimate together harry only just knew well will see tell that harry name will become mixed up with captain scarborough hope that will be in discreditable manner hope so be harry in mean time have returned to london in order to escape uncle to be on spot to learn anything might come in way a to now acknowledged mystery respecting captain such be state of thing at commencement of period to story refers chapter v augustus scarborough harry annesley when found in london must not for moment shake off feeling of nervous anxiety a to fate of mountjoy scarborough have seized hold of in newspaper took in hand looked first for paragraph respecting fate of missing man paper be sure to contain in one of column be habit during few day to breakfast at club must not abstain from speaking to neighbor about wonderful scarborough incident man be at time willing to speak on subject harry interest might not have seemed to be peculiar became known that have be acquainted with missing man harry in conversation said much more than must have be prudent for to do on understanding that wished to remain unconnected with story men asked question a though be likely to know must answer asserting that knew nothing still leaving impression behind that did know more than chose to avow many inquiry be made daily at time in scotland yard a to captain doubt chiefly came from creditor ally harry annesley became known among who asked for information a henry annesley esq late of st john college cambridge even police be taught to think that there be something noticeable in interest displayed on fourth day after arrival in london just at time of year when everybody be supposed to be leaving town when faded member of parliament who allowed to be retained for purpose of final division be cursing fate amid heat of august harry accepted invitation to dine with augustus scarborough at chamber in temple understood when accepted invitation that one else be to be there must have be aware that be intention of heir of tretton to talk to respecting brother have not seen scarborough since have be up in town have not be desirous of seeing when invitation came have told that must be better that must accept that must allow host to say what pleased to say on subject remaining reticent poor harry little knew difficulty of reticency when heart be full have intended to be very reticent when came up to london have in fact done nothing talk about missing man a to whom have declared that must altogether hold tongue reader must here be pleased to remember that augustus scarborough be perfectly well aware of what have befallen brother must therefore have known among other thing of quarrel have taken place in street knew therefore that harry be concealing knowledge must make fair guess at state of poor fellow mind will guess have said to that did not leave for dead on ground body must be there to tell tale must be ashamed of part took in street fight be anxious to conceal doubt mountjoy be first offender something have occurred annesley be unwilling must make way to uncle ear to father to mine to squire to of florence be thus that augustus scarborough reasoned with when asked harry annesley to dine with be not supposed by of friend that augustus scarborough must continue to live in moderate chamber now occupied in temple have a yet made sign of desire to leave be up two pair of stair be not great in size be comfortable enough even luxurious a bachelor abode have asked to come alone said augustus because there be such crowd of thing to be talked of about poor mountjoy be not exactly fitted for common ear yes indeed said harry who did not however quite understand why must be necessary that heir must discus with affair of unfortunate brother there have doubt be certain degree of intimacy between nothing made essential that captain difficulty must be exposed to matter touched most closely be love men have borne to florence mountjoy harry did not expect that allusion to florence must be made on present occasion did ever hear of devil of mess said augustus indeed be not only that have disappeared be a nothing when compared with other incident of romantic tale indeed be only natural thing in given other circumstance must have foretold disappearance a thing certain to occur why must such man disappear if can how have done replied harry where have gone to at moment where be ah if will answer question give information in scotland yard creditor doubt will make up handsome purse for not that will ever get shilling from though be to be seen walking down st james street to morrow be sanguine gentry holder of bill really believe that if must see must embrace with warmest affection in mean time let have dinner will talk about poor mountjoy when have got rid of young pitcher young pitcher be laundress son to use of whose service have be promoted since have be known to be heir of tretton then sat down dined augustus scarborough made agreeable small dinner be excellent of kind wine be that ought to be during dinner not word be said a to mountjoy a to affair of estate augustus who be old for age have already practised much in london life knew well how to make agreeable there be plenty to be said while young pitcher be passing in out of room so that there appeared awkward vacancy of silence while one course succeeded other weather be very hot grouse be very tempting everybody be very dull member of parliament more stupid than anybody else good time be coming must harry come down to tretton see old governor there be not much to offer in way of recreation when september came partridge must abound harry gave half promise that must go to tretton for week augustus scarborough expressed a much gratified harry at moment thought of reason why must not go to tretton thus committed to promise afterward felt that tretton be of place last ought just at present to visit at last pitcher cheese be gone young scarborough produced cigar want to smoke directly have done eating said drinking go with smoking a well a doe with eating so there need be stop for now tell annesley what be that think about mountjoy there be abruptness in question for moment struck harry dumb how be to say what thought about mountjoy scarborough even though must have feeling to prevent from expressing truth knew thought that knew mountjoy scarborough to be thorough blackguard one whom sense of honesty kept from spending money who be now party to robbing creditor without slightest compunction for be in harry mind that mountjoy father be in league together to save property by rescuing from hand of jew must have thought same a to old squire only that old squire have not interfered with in reference to florence mountjoy then there be present to mind brutal attack have be made on in street according to view mountjoy scarborough be certainly blackguard did not feel inclined quite to say so to brother be perfectly certain a to host honesty might be that three scarboroughs be in league together if so have done very wrong a then remembered to say that must go down to tretton when therefore be asked question must only hold tongue suppose have scruple in speaking because be brother may drop that altogether think that career have be what novel reader must call romantic what who be not one of must describe a unfortunate well yes taking altogether have be unfortunate be not soft hearted fellow be driven to pity worst of be that have not father be induced at last to tell truth from most dishonest cause must not have be bit better off than be doubt whether must have raised couple of thousand on day when went if have done so then again more more to amount choose to think of must have be same with suppose so lust for gambling be bottomless quicksand possible amount of winning must ever have satiated let enter club with five thousand pound at banker misfortune must touch being such a be ala for aught know such a be escape property have have can not be regarded a very fortunate care to talk much of in particular though wrong can have be done to man more infinite than father contrived for can not understand father said harry in truth there be something in scarborough manner in speaking of father almost produced belief in harry mind began to doubt whether augustus be in conspiracy must say not be hard to understand that english gentleman must have courage to conceive plot wit to carry out if mountjoy have run only decently straight not more than indecently crooked must have be younger brother practising law in temple to end of day story of esau of jacob be a nothing to be not most remarkable circumstance father for purpose of own includes absolute throwing over of mountjoy creditor change plan be pleased to restore to that of have resolved to rob what father must dare to look in face of son whom have thus resolved to defraud father tell story with gentle chuckle showing almost a much indifference to mountjoy ruin a to recovered prosperity have not blush when reveals have not word to say a far a can see thought a to world opinion no doubt be supposed to be dying do presume three four month will see end of in mean time take a quietly a though have simply lent five pound note to mountjoy out of pocket at rate will get property oh yes that doubt be argument when see be delighted to have down at tretton to tell truth feel slightest animosity toward a look at think to be most remarkable old gentleman that world have ever produced be quite unconscious have ground of complaint against have probably thought that circumstance of brother birth must not militate against prospect law dear fellow said scarborough getting up from chair standing with cigar between finger thumb law think otherwise making of right wrong in world depends on law half crown in pocket be merely mine because of law did choose to marry mother before be born did not choose to go through ceremony before brother time may be trifle to to moral feeling may be trifle because of trifle tretton will be property attempt to rob of be just same a though must break into bank steal what found there know that just a well a do to suit own purpose did there be something in way in young man spoke of father mother made harry flesh creep must not think of own father own mother feeling in regard to here man be talking of misdoings of one parent other with most perfect sang froid of course understand said harry there be manner of doing evil so easy indifferent a absolutely to quell general feeling respecting man will tell that have committed murder in tone so careless a to make feel that murder be nothing suppose father can be punished for attempt to rob of twenty thousand year therefore talk to about a though be good joke not only that expects to receive in same way upon whole prevails find not in least angry with rather obliged to than otherwise for allowing to be eldest son what must mountjoy feeling be said harry exactly what must be mountjoy feeling there be need to consider father poor mountjoy suppose that can be dead must think not while man be alive can carry off when fellow be dead requires at least one probably two to carry men wish to undertake work secretly unless have be concerned in murder then there will have be noise must have be heard blood must have be seen body will at last be forthcoming sign of destruction think be dead must hope not said harry rather tamely feeling that be guilty of falsehood by manner in expressed hope when be saw last scarborough asked question with abruptness be predetermined did not quite take harry aback about three month since in london said harry going back in memory to last meeting have occurred before squire have declared purpose ah have seen then since knew that be nobody asked in indifferent tone being anxious not to discover purpose in doing so gave great credit for readiness of mind have not seen since heard news must have astonished more than one else wonder said augustus how florence mountjoy have borne have seen have be at cheltenham be not allowed to see said with assertion to that though have lied a to one particular must not lie a to other suppose must have be much cut up by have mind to declare to myself that will still have opportunity of becoming mistress of tretton be always afraid of mountjoy know that ever loved have become so used to idea of marrying that must have given up in mere obedience too think that might do a wife will certainly make better husband than mountjoy must have done miss mountjoy will certainly do a wife for one who may be lucky enough to get said harry with certain tone of magnificence at moment felt to be overstrained ridiculous oh yes one have got to get a call of course mean to say that be supposed to be in running be own lookout can only allege on own behalf that have always be considered to be old family arrangement florence mountjoy will marry heir to tretton park be in position now only throw out a hint may feel disposed to follow out family arrangement of course if other thing come in way there will be end of come in last invitation be given in consequence of knock at door door be opened there entered policeman in plain clothes named prodgers who seemed from manner to be well acquainted with augustus scarborough police for time past have be very busy on track of mountjoy scarborough have not hitherto succeeded in obtaining information such activity a have be displayed can not be procured without expense have be understood in case old mr scarborough have refused to furnish mean something have supplied at first have latterly declined even to subscribe to fund be not at

captain scarborough a be with did seem a though be more than usually interested same said policeman be more than usually interested replied harry know that be going to give reason a to present existence know absolutely nothing dare say not if 'd information a be reliable dare say a must be forthcoming well mr scarborough may be sure of if can get upon trail will do so think will there be port have be watched from two day after disappearance there be port a wo be watched a soon a english steamer touch have got eye out mean to use good night mr scarborough good night mr annesley bobbed head to friend harry say a there be reason a be unknown perhaps wo be unknown always good night gentleman then constable prodgers left room harry have be disconcerted by policeman remark showed that be so a soon a be alone with augustus scarborough be afraid think man intended to be impertinent said augustus doubt did such men be allowed to be impertinent see enemy of course in one who pretend to know more than know indeed in one who doe not said something about having reason of own at once connected with mountjoy disappearance such creature be necessary from little have seen of think that make best companion in world will leave mr prodgers to carry on business to man who employ namely mr tyrrwhit advise to do same soon after harry annesley took leave must not divest of opinion that policeman host have thought that have knowledge respecting missing man augustus scarborough have said word to effect there have be something in manner have excited suspicion in harry mind then augustus have declared purpose of offering hand fortune to florence mountjoy to be suitor to florence so soon after mountjoy have be banished from scene why must have be told of of whose love for girl must not think that augustus scarborough have be aware then much perturbed in mind resolved a returned to lodging that must go down to cheltenham on following day chapter vi harry annesley tell secret harry hurried down to cheltenham hardly knowing what be going to do say when got there went to hotel dined alone what be be up about captain mountjoy said stranger coming whispering to at table

achieve dinner pint of wine for five six shilling at of more empty existence one must be inclined to say le pleasurable one must pas have always decent coat on back smile on face five shilling in pocket with to pay for dinner asking what be up about scarborough showed at rate that be very backward in world news believe have vanished said harry oh yes of course be vanished everybody know that vanished ever so long ago where be if can tell in scotland yard will be obliged to suppose be true police be after dear forty thousand year be very queer story about property be know story exactly therefore can hardly say whether be queer not about younger son people say that father have contrived that younger son will have money what hear be that whole property be to be divided that captain be to have half on condition that keep out of way be sure that know more about used to be intimate with brother have seen down here with captain where be again whispered into harry ear must not have selected subject more distasteful therefore harry repulsed mr baskerville not in most courteous manner hang what air fellow give said to friend of same kidney be young annesley son of twopenny halfpenny parson down in hertfordshire kind of way fellow put on now be unbearable have got horse to ride on to hear talk 'd think be mounted three day week be heir to old prosper of buston hall how be be never heard that before what be buston hall worth then mr baskerville made up mind to be doubly civil to harry annesley next time saw harry have to consider on night in what manner must endeavor to see florence mountjoy on next day be thoroughly discontented with a walked about street of cheltenham have now not only allowed disappearance of scarborough to pas by without stating when where how have last seen have directly lied on subject have told man brother that have not seen for week previous whereas to have concealed knowledge on subject be in held to be abominable be ashamed of more so because there be one to whom must talk openly on matter seemed to a though whom met questioned a to man disappearance a if suspected what be man to man guilt father that must be made miserable man attack upon have be ferocious in nature so brutal that when have escaped from mountjoy scarborough clutch there be nothing for to leave lying in street where in drunkenness have fallen now in consequence of misery have fallen upon even empty headed fellow baskerville man poverty of whose character harry perfectly understood have questioned about mountjoy scarborough must not thought be possible that baskerville must have have reason for suspicion yet very sound of inquiry stuck in ear on next morning at eleven o'clock knocked at mr mountjoy house in mountpellier place asked for elder lady mr mountjoy be out harry at once inquired for florence servant at first seemed to hesitate at last showed harry into dining room there waited five minute seemed to to be hour then florence came to mother be not at home said putting out hand mr annesley think will be back soon will wait for know whether be not glad that must be out florence have something must tell something that must tell have called florence once before on happy afternoon well remembered be not thinking of now name be always in mind have come to naturally a though have time to pick choose about name in importance of communication have to make yes believe that be ever really engaged to cousin mountjoy never be answered briskly harry annesley be certainly handsome man young man living ever thought le of own beauty have fair wavy hair be always submitting to barber very much to unexpressed disgust of poor florence because to eye longer hair grew more beautiful be wearer of forehead eye nose be perfect in form hyperion curl front of jove eye like mar to threaten command there be peculiar brightness in eye must have seemed to denote something absolutely great in character have not be for wavering indecision of mouth there be a be vacillation in lip took away from manliness of physiognomy florence who regarded face a almost divine be yet conscious of weakness about mouth did not know how to interpret yet without knowing why be so be accustomed to expect from doubtful word half expressed word must not declare to perfected thought a must have declared be six foot high broad narrow fat thin very apollo in florence eye to elder who knew quintessence of beauty lay in fact that be altogether unconscious of be man who counted nothing on personal appearance for performance of deed be most anxious to achieve one achievement now essentially necessary to happiness be possession of florence mountjoy certainly never occurred to that be more likely to obtain because be six foot high because hair waved becomingly have supposed so said in answer to last assertion ought to have known for certain mean to say that have ever be engaged to cousin must have be miserable at moment a never must have given up because of gross injustice done to about property disappearance in dreadful way must think have killed a be can think of nothing else because be cousin be very dreadful said harry have idea what can have happened to not in least have none at be last person who saw saw last at least know one who saw after have told have told one have come down here to cheltenham on purpose to tell why said a though struck with fear at assertion on part must tell one have not known whom else to tell father appears not at anxious about brother altogether trust be to go to men who be only looking after money must be communicating with enemy mother already regard a enemy if told police must simply be brought into court of justice where must be compelled to mention name why mine must begin story from beginning one night be coming home in london very late about two o'clock when whom must meet in street suddenly scarborough came out afterward that have then be gambling when encountered be intoxicated took suddenly by collar shook violently did best to maltreat what word be spoken can not remember conduct to be a of savage beast struggled with in street a man must struggle who be attacked by wild dog think that did not explain cause of hatred though of course memory a to what took place at moment be disturbed imperfect did know in heart why be that have quarrelled with why be florence asked because thought that have ventured to love shrieked florence must not have thought that did think so be right enough if have never said so before be bound at rate to say now paused for moment made answer in struggle between fell on pavement against rail then left well have never be heard of since on following day in afternoon left london for buston nothing have be then heard of disappearance knew of suspected question be when others be searching for be bound to go to police declare what have suffered from night why must connect going with outrage have suffered why not tell must have be asked why have quarrelled with ought to have said that did not know ought to have pretended that there be cause did know there be cause be because thought that might prevail with now that be beggar disowned by own father must never have given up for said florence do not see that name must have be brought in must have have to speak of a though thought possible that loved then paused florence sat silent thought struck now occurred to that under plea put forward must appear to seek shelter from silence a to name be aware how anxious be on own behalf not to mention occurrence in street seemed that be attempting to escape under pretence of fear that name must be dragged in independently of see why must be subjected to annoyance of letting be known be thus attacked in street time have now gone by did not occur to when first be missed that matter must have be of such importance now be too late suppose that ought to have told father think ought to have done so at rate have come to explain to be necessary must tell one there seems to be reason to suspect that man have be killed hope not hope not that have be spirited away out of way of creditor for think that have all be done with father connivance whether brother be in secret not can not tell suspect be there seems to be doubt that captain scarborough have run so overhead into debt a to make payment of creditor impossible by anything short of immediate surrender of whole property month two since thought that squire be dying that there must be nothing to do to sell property must then be mountjoy pay against dying man have rebelled have come a be out of grave to disinherit son who have already contrived to disinherit be effort to save tretton be dishonest said florence doubt about looking at way be dishonest either inheritance must belong to mountjoy still must not have be when be allowed to borrow money upon can not understand thought be entailed upon of course be nothing to never must have be anything now creditor declare that have be cheated assert that mountjoy be being kept out of way to aid old mr scarborough in fraud can not say that think be so why must have attacked just at moment of going why rather must have gone immediately after have attacked can not say have concern with money though hope hope that may always have much with oh florence surely have known have be within heart to appeal made response sat awhile considering what must say respecting mountjoy scarborough affair be to keep secret asked at last will consider for have not exacted from silence on matter may tell whom please will not consider have ground of complaint against of course for own sake wish to be told great injury be done desire to be dragged into must be injury suspect that augustus scarborough know more than pretend wish to be brought into mess by cunning whether will tell mother must judge will tell nobody unless bid at moment door of room be opened mr mountjoy entered with frown upon brow have not yet given up hope that mountjoy might return that affair of tretton might be made to straighten mamma mr annesley be here so perceive dear have come to daughter to tell how dearly love said harry boldly mr annesley must have come to before speaking to daughter then must have seen at must have left that a might be be not at proper thing that young gentleman must come

be not to know anything of mountjoy scarborough to let five minute in street be a though have never be have be brutally attacked have thought best to say nothing on subject must not allow secret such a be to be wormed out of scarborough be endeavoring to extort from have resolved to conceal determined at last that must not become puppet in hand see why must care straw about said scarborough do at rate repeat denial will be well must let father know that be mistaken also that as prodgers of course with father be sheer curiosity indeed if thought that be keeping mountjoy under lock key must only admire dexterity in so preserving bold line of action be contrary to law recommends to approbation prodgers have lurking idea that must like to arrest what for simply because think know something that doe know a be detective that in mind be quite enough for arresting man may a well give assurance then that be mistaken why must assurance go for more than mine give nothing of kind may give at rate assurance that believe word if do believe can do so repeat assertion that saw nothing of mountjoy just before disappearance be amount of cross questioning take in good part to will not submit here

about hour have already eaten lunch somewhat sulkily message came to from miss scarborough requiring presence went to be told by mr scarborough must now see be aware that mr scarborough never saw septimus jones that there be something peculiar in sending of message to why must man who be supposed to have few week to live be so anxious to see one who be comparatively stranger to be so glad have come in before dinner mr annesley because brother be so anxious to see be afraid will go too early in morning then followed again found scarborough on couch in same room to have be first introduced have have sharp bout of since saw before said sick man so heard sir there be saying how many rather how few bout of kind will take to polish off think be entitled to little respite now apothecary from tretton be here morning believe have done just a much good a sir william brodrick charge will be ten shilling while sir william demanded three hundred pound must be mean to go out with one tretton apothecary to look after one suppose sir william knowledge have be of service dexterity with knife have be of more so augustus have be quarrelling about mountjoy not that know of say so believe word on subject sooner than yours be likely to quarrel without knowing be not think that know what have become of mountjoy doe why must think so when told that know nothing tell that know absolutely nothing be ignorant whether be dead alive be not dead said father suppose not know nothing about why second son mean eldest according to law rather only son why augustus scarborough continued harry annesley must take upon to suspect know aught of brother can not say have cock bull story about policeman whom professes to believe to be ignorant of own business policeman say be anxious to arrest to make give evidence before magistrate said father did not dare to tell that suspected there knew have quarrelled deny altogether have not quarrelled with augustus scarborough be welcome to suspicion if chooses to entertain must have liked better if have not brought down to tretton so a to extract from whatever can will be more guarded in future in speaking of mountjoy scarborough to give positive assurance doubt will believe that know nothing respecting honest indignation gleamed in eye a spoke still there be sign of vacillation about mouth florence have be able to read not to interpret yes said squire after pause believe have that kind of ingenuity enables man to tell lie stick to have be very great gift if man be enabled to restrain appetite for lying harry must only smile when heard squire confession only think how have lied about mountjoy how successful lie might have be for own folly people do judge little harshly now said harry what be odd care nothing for judgment endeavored to do justice to own child very nearly did be very nearly successful in rectifying gross injustice of world why must little delay in ceremony in have voice have robbed of possession determined that must have tretton determined also to make up to augustus by denying use of own wealth thing have gone wrongly not by own folly must not prevent mad career mountjoy have run do think that be ashamed because world know what have done do suppose death bed will be embittered by remembrance have be liar not in least have done best must for two son in doing have denied many advantage how many man must have spent money on thinking nothing of boy then have gone to grave with dignity of steady christian father of two men prefer know have be liar what be harry annesley to say in answer to address a there be man stretched on bed before haggard unshaved pale grizzly with fire in eye weakness in voice bold defiant self satisfied yet not selfish have lived through life with one strong resolution of setting law at defiance in reference to distribution of property chiefly because have thought law to be unjust then when accident of eldest son extravagance have fallen upon have endeavored to save second son have thought without slightest remorse of loss be to fall on creditor have done in such manner a far a harry knew law must not touch though world be aware of iniquity now lay boasting of what have done be necessary that harry must say something a rose from seat lamely expressed wish mr scarborough might quickly recover dear fellow said squire men recover when be brought to such strait a be in do wish be to live augustus must feel second injustice to be quite intolerable mind be lost in amazement at what have contemplated feel that matter can only be set right between fortune by dying at once if be to understand be to live ten year longer think that must either commit murder lose sens there be enough for of said harry there be such word in language a enough estate can have one owner augustus be anxious to be owner here blame in least why must desire to spare father right when father showed so willing to sacrifice good bye annesley be sorry be going for like to have honest fellow to talk to be not to suppose that because have done thing be indifferent to what men will say of wish to think good though have chosen to run counter to prejudice of world then harry escaped from room spent remaining evening with augustus scarborough septimus jones conversation be devoted chiefly to partridge horse be carried on by septimus with severity toward harry by scarborough with extreme civility be more galling of two chapter ix augustus have own doubt be impertinent young puppy said septimus jones a soon a fly be to carry harry annesley to station have left hall door on following morning may be presumed that mr jones must not thus have expressed unless friend augustus scarborough have dropped certain word in conversation in regard to harry to same effect may be presumed also that augustus must not have dropped such word without purpose of letting friend know that harry be to be abused augustus scarborough have made up mind looking at matter round that more be to be got by abusing harry than by praising young man have good opinion of certainly think to be deal better than anybody else continued jones whereas for one see have way with of pretending to be quite equal to companion let be who may to be odious be down upon down upon father of course father have made most fraudulent attempt what devil be to other young man made answer only smiled opinion expressed by mr jones a to harry annesley have only be reflex of felt by augustus scarborough reflex a be always case when looking glass be true be correct scarborough have known harry annesley for long time a time be counted in early youth have by degree learned to hate thoroughly be little elder have at first thought to domineer over friend friend have resisted have struggled manfully to achieve what considered equality in friendship now scarborough may a well take once for be not going to be talked down if want to talk fellow down can go to walker brown green then when be tired of occupation can come back to be thus that annesley have be wont to address friend friend have be anxious to talk down special young man for special purpose have be conscious of weakness in other character thought entitled to do so weakness be not of nature have failed then have come rivalry between mountjoy harry have seemed to augustus to be extreme of impudence from of old have be taught to regard brother mountjoy a first of young men among commoner first in prospect first in rank to florence mountjoy have be allotted a bride how have learned first to envy then to covet allotted bride need not here be told by degree have come to pas that augustus have determined that spendthrift brother must fall under own power that bride must be reward how be that two brother so different in character yet so alike in selfishness must have come to love same girl with true intensity of purpose that harry annesley whose character be essentially different who be in degree selfish must have loved also must be left to explain a girl character will be developed florence mountjoy have now for many month be cause of bitter dislike against poor harry in mind of augustus scarborough understood much more clearly than brother have done who be that girl really preferred be ever conscious too of own superiority falsely conscious did feel that if harry character be really known girl must in truth prefer must not quite see harry with florence eye must see with other eye own then have come meeting between mountjoy harry annesley in street of have only such garbled account a mountjoy have given within hour afterward from story told in word of drunken man man drunk bruised bloody who clearly did not understand in one minute word spoken in last augustus did learn that there have be great row between brother harry annesley then mountjoy have disappeared have disappeared a reader will have understood with brother co operation harry have not come forward when inquiry be made to declare what knew of occurrence of night augustus have narrowly watched conduct in order at first that might learn in what condition brother have be left in street afterward with purpose of ascertaining why be that harry have be so reticent then have allured harry on to direct lie soon perceived that must afterward use secret for own purpose think will have to see what that young man about know said afterward to septimus jones yes yes certainly said septimus septimus did not quite understand why be that must have to see what young man be about between think mean to interfere with mean to stand interference must think not must go back to buston among bustonians will have stand up fight of rather like stand up fight just so when fellow so bumptious a that ought to be licked have lied about mountjoy said augustus then jones waited to be told how be that harry have lied be aware that there be secret unknown to be anxious to be informed be harry aware of mountjoy hiding place if so how have learned why be that harry must be acquainted with be dark to world besides jones be of opinion that squire knew about thought not improbable that squire augustus have secret in joint keeping if so how must harry annesley know anything about have lied like very devil continued augustus after pause have now mean to spare must think not then there be pause at end of jones found driven to ask question how have lied augustus smiled shook head from other man gathered that be not now to be told nature of lie in question fellow lie like said jones be not to be endured mean to endure have heard of young lady named miss mountjoy cousin of ours mountjoy miss mountjoy suggested jones yes mountjoy miss mountjoy that of course be over mountjoy have brought to pas that be not entitled to have miss mountjoy longer seems proper thing that will pas with rest of family property to true heir marry need not talk about just at present know that have made up mind at rate intend that harry annesley will have must think not be pestilential cur have got introduced into family sooner get quit of better must think young lady must hardly fancy when know that have lied like very devil with object of getting former lover out of way by jove must think not when world come to understand harry annesley in midst of inquiry know about poor mountjoy be last to see in london have never come forward to say word about then think world will be little hard upon immaculate harry annesley own uncle have quarrelled with already what uncle gentleman down in hertfordshire on strength of whose acre master harry be flaunting about in idleness have eye open can see a well a when harry lecture about father father about one must suppose that there be not hole in own coat think will find that garment be not altogether water tight then augustus finding that have told a much a be needful to septimus jones left friend went about own family business on next morning septimus jones took departure on day following augustus followed so be off father said to when came to make adieu well yes suppose so man have got so many thing to look after ca attend to down here know what be understand be not going to ask to stay doe ever occur to that may never see again what question be one requires answer at rate doe occur to not at all a probable why not probable because there be telegraph wire from tretton to london because journey down here be very short also occurs to to think so from what have be said by sir william brodrick of course man may die suddenly especially when surgeon have be at have sister with sir will be of more comfort to than can be condition be in respect advantage to creditor of mountjoy ca force way in upon be wrong there have not done so must though be a strong a be be creditor to have not scrap of handwriting in possession there be not one who can say that have even verbal promise from never came to when wanted to lend money at fifty per cent did ever hear say that be heir perhaps not not one have ever heard be not to lied to to grey d creditor what do care for though be ruined not in least why do talk to about creditor at rate know truth then augustus quitted room leaving father in passion a fact be by mean assured a to truth supposed that be heir might not be possible that father have contrived so a to save property from mountjoy that greedy pack of money lender grey must surely know truth why must not grey be deceived on second event a well a first there be limit augustus sometimes thought to father cleverness idea have occurred to within last week mind be tormented with reflecting what might yet be condition of one thing be sure that father mountjoy be not in league together mountjoy at rate believed to have be disinherited mountjoy conceived that only chance of obtaining money arose from brother circumstance of mountjoy absence be at rate unknown to father chapter x sir magnus mountjoy be peculiarity of florence mountjoy that did not expect other people to be a good a herself be not that erected for high standard have then told that have right to demand from others one so exalted have erected nothing did know that attempted to live by grand rule have idea that be better than anybody else came to naturally a result of what have gone before to be unselfish generous trusting pure may be regarded a feminine virtue may be said to be sometimes tarnished by fault be equally feminine unselfishness may become want of character generosity essentially unjust confidence may be weak purity insipid here be that strength of florence mountjoy asserted knew well what be due to herself though must not claim must trust to in silence be quite sure of though pure be rarely shocked by way of others be a true a man pretend to be in figure form face never demanded immediate homage by sudden flash of beauty when spell have once fallen on man spirit be not often that must escape from quickly when spoke peculiar melody struck hearer ear voice be soft low sweet full at time of harmonious word when laughed be like soft wind playing among countless silver bell there be something in touch to men be almost divine of be unconscious be a chary with finger a though seemed that must ill spare divinity in height be little above common be by grace of movement that world be compelled to observe figure there be woman whose grace be so remarkable a to demand attention of then be known of momentarily seen that grace be peculiar have studied grace result be there only too evident florence seemed to have studied nothing beholder felt that must have be a graceful when playing with doll in nursery be same with beauty there be peculiarity of chiselled feature have taken face measured by certain rule must have found that mouth be too large nose irregular of teeth showed little in complexion there be none of pellucid clearness in men ordinarily delight eye be more than ordinarily bright when laughed there seemed to stream from heavenly delight when did laugh be a though spring have be opened from ran for time stream of sweetest intimacy for time must then fancy that have be let into inner life of girl must be proud of so much must have be granted must feel that there be something also in in must have be permitted hair eyebrow be dark brown of hue most common to men woman have in nothing be peculiar hair be soft smooth ever well dressed never redolent of peculiar odor be simply florence mountjoy hair that made perfect in eye of male friend generally be not such wonderful beauty after once said of gentleman to whom may be presumed that have not taken trouble to be peculiarly attractive said by george must like to have altering of be thus that men generally felt in regard to florence mountjoy when came to reckon up did not see how change be to be made for better to florence a to most other girl question of future life have be great trouble whom must marry whom must decline to marry to girl when be proposed to suddenly to change everything in life to go altogether away place under custody of new master to find for new home new pursuit new aspiration strange companion change must be so complete a almost to frighten by awfulness yet have to be always thought of generally done change have be presented to florence in manner more than ordinarily burdensome early in life when naturally must not have begun to think seriously of marriage have be told rather than asked to give to cousin mountjoy be too firm of character to accede at once to deliver over body soul to tender mercy of one in truth unknown have be unable to interpose reason be valid have contented by demanding time since that there have be moment in have almost yielded mountjoy scarborough have be so represented to that have considered to be almost duty to yield more than once word have be spoken word have never be spoken have be subjected to what might be called cruel pressure in season out of season mother have represented a duty marriage with cousin why must not marry cousin must be understood that question have be asked before of terrible fact of captain scarborough life have be made known to because may be said did not love in day have loved man be inclined to think so little of a to make want of love necessary bar to accomplishment of wish of others by degree be spoken of among acquaintance a promised bride of mountjoy scarborough though ever denied imputation there came over girl heart feeling very sad very solemn still accepted that so must be then harry annesley have crossed path question have be at last nearly answered doubt nearly decided did not quite know at first that loved harry annesley be almost sure that be impossible for to become wife of mountjoy scarborough then there came nearly twelve month of most painful uncertainty in life be very hard for young girl to have to be firm with mother in declining proposed marriage when circumstance of connection be recommended to a being peculiarly alluring there be nothing in personal manner of cousin seemed to justify in declaring abhorrence be dark handsome military looking man whose chief sin be in eye of cousin that seemed to demand from affection worship obedience did not analyse character felt when came to pas that tidings of debt at last reached felt that be glad of excuse though knew that excuse must not have prevailed with have liked then came debt with knowledge of keener perception of imperiousness must consent to become wife of man who have squandered property wasted estate not of one who before marriage demanded of submission a thought must be given by freely after marriage harry annesley glided into heart after manner very different from knew that adored yet did not hasten to tell so knew that loved doubted whether time must ever come in must confess be not till have come to acknowledge trouble to mountjoy have subjected that have ever ventured to speak plainly of own passion even then have not asked for reply be still free a thought of did at last tell let mother say what must certainly never must stand at altar with cousin mountjoy even now when captain have be declared not to be father heir when world knew that have disappeared from face of earth mr mountjoy did not altogether give up partly disbelieved brother partly thought that circumstance must not be so bad a be described to feminine mind to living not in world of london in very moderate fashion of cheltenham seemed to be impossible that entail must be thus blighted in bud why be entail called entail unless be ineradicable decision of fate rather than of man of law to eye mountjoy scarborough be so commanding that thing must at last be compelled to go a must have to tell truth there have lately come to mr mountjoy word of comfort might be necessary if world must be absolutely upset in accordance with wicked skill of brother even in case might make crooked thing smooth augustus whom have regarded always a quite mountjoy because of talent appearance habit of command have whispered to word why must not florence be transferred with remainder of property there be something to mr mountjoy feeling base in idea at first blush of did not like to be untrue to gallant nephew a came to turn in mind there be certain circumstance recommended change to must change be necessary florence certainly have expressed unintelligible objection to elder brother why must younger not be more successful mr mountjoy heart have begun to droop within a have thought that girl must prove deaf to voice of charmer charmer have come most objectionable in sight to word of absolute encouragement have a thought be yet spoken augustus have already obtained for among friend character of eloquent young lawyer let come try eloquence on cousin only let first be ascertained a assured fact beyond possibility of retrogression that squire villainy be certain think love said to daughter one day under immediate circumstance of family must retire for while into private life occurred on very day on septimus jones have be vaguely informed of iniquitous falsehood of harry annesley good gracious mamma be not life always private have understood that private life be intended altogether to exclude harry be to be made open to manoeuvre of cousin such a might be not in sense in mean poor uncle be dying hear that sir william say be better fear nevertheless that be dying though may perhaps take long time then poor mountjoy have disappeared think that must see one till mystery about mountjoy have be cleared up then story be so very discreditable see that be affair of ours said florence who have desire to be shut up just at present moment can not help making eldest son out to be oh something so very different be too horrible to be thought of be told that nobody know truth at rate be not implicated in be at rate be brother mountjoy be nephew at rate be poor augustus be thrown into terrible difficulty be told that be greatly pleased at finding that tretton be to belong to who tell that have right to believe anything about such near relative from one told so have be very wicked mr mountjoy doubt thought that wicked communication have be made by harry annesley augustus have always proved to be affectionate respectful to elder brother be to brother who be be older than added mr mountjoy feeling that there be difficulty in expressing a to presumed condition of two scarboroughs of course must rather be owner of tretton than let one else have if mean that honor of family be very much to know that family can have honor left said florence severely dear have right to say that scarboroughs have always held head very high in staffordshire more so of late than ever mean quite of late since tretton became of so much importance now will tell what think have better do will go spend six week with uncle at brussels have always be pressing to come oh mamma doe not want how can say that how do know be sure sir magnus will not care for coming now besides how must that be retiring into private life sir magnus a ambassador have house always full of company dear be not ambassador be minister plenipotentiary be not quite same thing then be nearest relative nearest at least since own brother have made great separation of course can not go to to be out of way of why do want to go anywhere mamma why not stay at home florence pleaded in vain a mother have already made up mind before day be over succeeded in making daughter understand that be to be taken to brussels a soon a answer must be received from sir magnus necessary addition be made to joint wardrobe sir magnus mountjoy late general elder brother have be for last four five year english

have left tretton went down to cheltenham for have received invitation to dance there with invitation intimation florence mountjoy be to be at dance if be to declare that dance have be given florence asked to merely a act of friendship to harry must perhaps be thought that modern friendship be seldom carried to so great length be undoubtedly fact that mr armitage who gave dance be great friend admirer of harry that mr armitage be especial chum let not however reader suppose that florence be in secret mr armitage have thought best to keep in dark a to person asked to meet a to going to montpelier place harry have once said to mr armitage might a well knock at prison door mr mountjoy lived in montpelier place think must perhaps manage that for mr armitage have replied have managed be coming harry said to mr armitage in anxious whisper a entered room have be here half hour if have taken trouble to leave cigar come meet have not gone said harry almost awe struck at idea be sitting like patience on monument smiling at grief in room inside have got horrible news to tell oh heaven what news suppose will tell though have not be communicative to in regard to royal highness news be simply that mother be going to take to brussels that be to live for while amid ambassadorial splendor with sir magnus wife by retiring from world mr mountjoy have not intended to include such slight social relaxation a mr armitage party for harry on turning round encountered talking to cheltenham lady greeted with pleasantest smile to mr mountjoy did not respond quite so sweetly have ever greatly feared harry annesley have to day heard story very much a thought to discredit be daughter here asked harry with well trained hypocrisy mr mountjoy must not acknowledge that florence be in room then harry passed on in pursuit of quarry oh mr annesley when did come to cheltenham a soon a heard that mr armitage be going to have party began to think of coming immediately then idea for first time shot through florence mind that friend mr armitage be woman devoted to intrigue what dance have disengaged have something must tell to night mean to say that will not give one dance be merely lover anxious doubt on part because florence have not at once replied to be told that be going away to brussels mamma be going on visit to brother in law with of course will go with mamma have be said apart while fair haired lackadaisical young gentleman be standing twiddling thumb waiting to dance with florence at last little book from waist be brought forth harry name be duly inscribed next dance be quadrille saw that space after be also vacant so boldly wrote down name for almost think that florence must have suspected that harry annesley be to be there night why must two place have be kept vacant now what be began about going to brussels mamma brother be minister there be just going on visit why now be sure there be especial cause florence must not say that there be especial cause so must only repeat assertion that certainly be going to brussels be well aware that be to be taken out of harry way that something be expected to occur during short month of absence might be detrimental to to also must not tell did like to say that plea given by mother be general state of scarborough affair did not wish to declare to lover that other lover be a nothing to how long be to be away asked harry will be month with sir magnus mamma be talking of going on afterward to italian lake good heaven will not be back suppose till ever so much after christmas can not tell nothing a yet have be settled know ought to tell anything about harry at moment looked up caught eye of mr mountjoy a be standing in door way opposite mr mountjoy certainly looked a though special communication a to florence future movement ought to be made to harry annesley then however came to turn to dance have moment allowed to to collect thought by nothing that must do say must prevent going must only use present moment to best purpose in power bethought then that have never received from word of encouragement that such word if ever to be spoken must be forthcoming night what might not happen to girl who be passing balmy christmas month amid sweet shadow of italian lake harry idea of italian lake be in truth at present somewhat vague future month be to thinking interminable present moment only be own dance be now finished come take walk said harry think will go to mamma florence have seen mother eye fixed upon oh come wo do at said harry who have already got hand within arm fellow be always entitled to five minute then be down for next waltz oh be ca get out of now oh florence will answer question one question asked before did not vouchsafe answer asked question said florence who remembered to last syllable word have be said to on occasion did not be sure knew what be that intended to ask florence must not think that be quite thing oh florence can love have given ear for must not have told truth then on spur of moment mother eye be knew watching through door way way across from other room yet have mother asked must have answered boldly that did love harry annesley intended to love for ever ever with heart must have gone farther if cross questioned have declared that regarded already a lord master now have not word to say to knew be that have now pledged to that intended to keep to pledge may not have one word said one word what must want with word more thought florence silence now be a good a speech a did want more must after own way reply to so there came upon arm slightest possible sense of pressure from sweet finger harry annesley be on sudden carried up among azure tinted cloud into farthest heaven of happiness after moment stood still passed finger through hair waved head a god might do have now made to solemn promise than word must be more binding oh florence exclaimed must have alone with for one moment for what must want alone for moment thought florence there be mother still looking at for harry did not now care one straw did hate bright italian lake with nearly so strong feeling of abhorrence florence be now own there came slightest pressure slight so eloquent from finger hate dancing how be fellow to dance now will run against everybody can see one must be sure to make fool of want to dance even with certainly not let dance with somebody else engaged to well if must of course must declare florence have not spoken single word to though there be so much that must have to say what have got to say what question to ask must tell oh know what have got to tell sound of will be sweetest music that man can possibly hear knew harry whispered want to hear oh florence florence think can understand how completely be beyond with joy can not dance again will not oh wife wife hush said florence afraid that very wall might hear sound of harry word what doe signify though world knew oh yes must have be so fortunate be what can not understand poor mountjoy do feel for that must have have start of so long have done nothing nothing whispered florence have done everything be so proud of that think must look almost like hero have now got to extremity of room near open window florence found that be able to say one word be hero sound of nearly drove mad with joy forgot trouble prodgers policeman augustus scarborough fellow whom hated so much septimus jones be to now have set mind upon one thing of value have got florence have promised to be be sure that must never break word to felt that for full enjoyment of triumph must be alone somewhere with florence for five minute have not actually explained to why knew that wished to be alone with at present there be prospect of such five minute must say something in preparation for future five minute at time to come perhaps might be to morrow though did not at present see how might be possible for mr mountjoy knew must shut door against mr mountjoy be already prowling round room after daughter harry saw a got florence to opposite door there for moment escaped with now said how be to manage to see before go to brussels know that can see do mean that be to be shut up that be not to be allowed to approach do mean be of course attached to nephew what after have passed why not be to blame for what father have done harry felt that must not press case against captain scarborough without want of generosity though have told florence once about dreadful midnight meeting must say nothing farther on subject of course mamma think that be foolish why asked because doe see with eye harry need not say anything more about at present be so therefore be to go to brussels have made opportunity for before start perhaps have be foolish to be taken off guard say that florence will think so unless can be discreet harry will have to wait will remember that must wait will not change think not because trust here be mamma now must leave will tell mamma everything before go to bed then mr mountjoy came up took florence away with few word of most disdainful greeting to harry annesley when florence be gone harry felt that a sun moon star have set a absolute darkness reigned through room might a well escape into street where there be one police to watch a threw hat up into air in exultation before did so have to pas by mr armitage thank for kindness for be aware how much have done for in present circumstance oh mr armitage be so obliged to fellow be ever so obliged to friend before how have gone off for mr mountjoy have taken florence home oh yes have taken away have shut stable door till steed have be stolen oh steed have be stolen yes think so do think so that poor man who have disappeared be nowhere men who disappear never be anywhere do flatter that if have held ground kept property result must have be same dare say suppose mr armitage be taking pride to myself why on earth florence must have taken fancy to fellow a be can not imagine oh not in least be very well for to laugh mr armitage a have thought of have sometimes be in despair now be not in despair indeed just now be triumphant have thought so often be fool to love because everything be so much against have wondered that continued always seemed to that there be ghost of chance for mr armitage bade give up because be sure must never do good care how much laugh at mr armitage let laugh who win then rushed out into paragon absolutely did throw hat up in air in triumph chapter xiii mr mountjoy anger florence a went home in fly with mother after party at harry have spoken to so openly did not find little journey very happy mr mountjoy be woman endowed with strong power of wishing rather than of willing of desiring rather than of contriving be one who must make very unpleasant when be thwarted daughter be now at last fully determined that if ever married anybody that person must be harry annesley having once pressed arm in token of assent have a be given away to so that reasoning expostulation must thought change purpose have much more power of bringing about purposed design than have mother mother must be obstinate self willed must for time make herself disagreeable florence have assured lover that everything must be told mother night before went to bed mr mountjoy did not wait to be simply told sooner be seated in fly together than began to make inquiry what have man be saying to demanded florence be at once offended by hearing lover so spoken of must not simply tell story of harry successful courtship a have intended mamma said why do speak of like because be scamp be scamp be very unkind of to speak in such term of one whom know be very dear to know ought not to be dear to at have be for year intended for purpose be intolerable to florence idea that must have be considered a capable of being intended for purpose of other people resolution at once be formed in mind that must let mother know that such intention be futile for moment sat silent journey home at twelve o'clock at night in fly be not time for expression of resolution say be scamp said mr mountjoy during inquiry have be made after cousin have known about have not known about said florence contradict in very impertinent manner can not be acquainted with circumstance last person who saw cousin in london be mr henry annesley yet have not said word about while search be being made on side saw under circumstance most suspicious in nature so suspicious a to have made police arrest if be aware of have at moment grossly insulted captain scarborough mamma no be not so how do know how can tell do know can tell ill usage have come from other side then too have known secret have said nothing about too have be aware of violence took place at midnight meeting have be aware of what befell cousin man to whom be engaged have held tongue at instigation doubt of mr henry annesley oh florence also will find in hand of policeman at moment fly drew up at door of house in montpelier place two lady have to get out walk up step into hall where be congratulated on early return from party by lady maid mamma will go to bed said florence a soon a reached mother room think have better dear though heaven know what disturbance there may be during night by mr mountjoy have intended to imply that prodgers policeman might probably lose not moment more before must at once proceed to arrest miss mountjoy for step have taken in regard to disappearance of captain scarborough have heard from harry annesley fact that have be brutally attacked by captain in middle of night in street of london for in accordance with mother theory be to be dragged out of bed by constable probably before next morning must have come there be something in so ludicrous a regarded truth of story yet so cruel a coming from mother that florence hardly knew whether to cry laugh a laid head upon pillow in morning a be thinking that fact of own position have still to be explained to mother that must be necessary that must declare purpose impossibility of change now that have once pledged to lover mr mountjoy came into room stood at bedside with appearance of ghostly displeasure always belongs to angry old lady in night cap well mamma florence there must be understanding between hope so thought there always have be be sure mamma have known have never liked captain scarborough so a to become wife think have known have liked harry annesley liking be fiddlestick mamma if object to word will say love have known have not loved cousin have loved other man be not nonsense that at rate be stern reality if there be anything real in world stern may well call stern mean unbending strong not to be overcome by outside circumstance if mr annesley have not spoken to a did last night must never have so spoken to must have be miserable girl love for must have be just a stern must have remained thought of have be unhappy through whole life have spoken be exultant be what mean by stern be most important at rate to be here now to tell that be impossible very well mamma then thing must go on must bide time be proper must tell that have disgraced never will not admit know circumstance exclaimed florence be most impertinent in to pretend that know better than do said mother indignantly story be told to by yes therefore told untruly grieve that must think so of mamma can not help where have got information can not tell mine have be accurately told to feel certain at rate duty be to look after to keep from harm can only do duty to best of ability mr annesley be to thinking most objectionable young man will believe be in hand of police before long evidence will have to be given in name will unfortunately be mentioned why name be not probable that will keep secret when cross questioned a to having divulged story to one will declare that have told to when time will come will be well that must be out of country propose to start from here on day week uncle magnus will not be able to have then must loiter away time on road look upon a quite imperative that will be out of england within eight day time of where will go never mind know have a yet quite made up mind may understand that will start from cheltenham day week baker will go with will leave other two servant in charge of house can not tell anything farther a yet except will never consent to marriage with mr henry annesley have better know that for certain then there will be le cause for unhappiness between so saying angry ghost with night cap on stalked out of room need hardly be explained that mr mountjoy information respecting scene in london have come to from augustus scarborough when told that annesley have be last in london to see brother mountjoy have described nature of scene have occurred between have doubt forgotten that have subsequently seen brother in story a have told there be need to mention necessity for character in making up tragedy of night doubt according to idea two have be alone together harry have struck blow by brother have be injured have then left in street mountjoy have subsequently disappeared harry have told to one encounter have taken place have be meaning of augustus scarborough when informed aunt that harry have be last who have seen mountjoy before disappearance to mr mountjoy fact have be most injurious to harry character harry have wilfully kept secret while world be at work looking for mountjoy scarborough a far a mr mountjoy must understand might well be that harry have struck fatal blow have sent nephew to long account impossibility in case have not dawned upon have not occurred to that mountjoy must not have be killed body made away with without great effort in performance of scamp must hardly have risked life

that must thus most torment daughter be not that wished to torment in revengeful spirit be quite sure within own bosom that did in love be devoted to daughter be thwarted therefore told that must best farther girl interest by tormenting be not meditated revenge that revenge spring up without meditation be often therefore most bitter must bring nose to grindstone be manner in must have probably

henry annesley six seven day after be settled together most uncomfortably in hotel at boulogne mr mountjoy have gone there because there be other retreat to must take daughter because have resolved to remove from beyond sphere of harry annesley presence have at first thought of ostend have seemed to that ostend be within kingdom reigned over by sir magnus that there must be impropriety in removing from thence to capital in sir magnus be reigning be a though be to sojourn for three day at park gate before be entertained at mansion therefore stayed at boulogne mr mountjoy tried bathing cold a water be with equinoctial gale in order that there might be appearance of reason for being at boulogne for company sake in hope of maintaining fellowship with mother florence bathed also mamma have not written again said florence coming up one day from stand suppose that be impatient why must there be quarrel between be not impatient if must only believe must be so much more happy for of always used to believe be before knew mr harry annesley there be something in very aggravating something specially intended to excite angry feeling florence determined to forbear think may believe mamma be own daughter will not deceive do consider engaged to mr annesley need not tell that while be living with will promise not to receive letter from without leave if one must come will bring to unopened so that may deal with a though have be delivered to care nothing about uncle a to affair what may say can not affect what say doe affect very much will promise to write to hear from mr annesley for three month will not that satisfy mr mountjoy must not say that did satisfy somewhat mitigated treatment of daughter till arrived together at sir magnus mansion be shown through great hall by three lackey into inner vestibule where encountered great man be just then preparing to be put on to horse lady mountjoy have already gone forth in carriage for daily airing with object in truth of avoiding

thorough look of self satisfaction conceit attache be much more wont to exhibit than to deserve for work of attache at brussels be not of nature to bring forth highest order of intellect occupation be of nature to make young man feel that be not like other young men be so sorry that lady mountjoy have just gone out did not expect till later train have be staying at boulogne what on earth made stay

keep toe in pump young man know that will keep toe in pump because there be aspirant said anderson rather whet ardor sir to new exploit in such circumstance one be inclined to think that aspirant must look after not that conceive for moment miss mountjoy must ever look after when mr mountjoy came down to drawing room there seemed to be quite party collected to enjoy hospitality of sir magnus there be not in truth many more than usual number at board there be lady mountjoy miss abbot mr anderson with mr montgomery arbuthnot two attache mr montgomery arbuthnot be especially proud of name be otherwise rather humble young man a attache having a yet be only three month with sir magnus desirous of perfecting in foreign office manner under tuition of mr anderson mr blow secretary of legation be not there be married man of austere manner who to tell truth looked down from considerable height a regarded foreign office knowledge upon chief be mr blow who did grinding on behalf of belgian legation who sometimes did not hesitate to let be known that such be fact mr blow be popular at embassy may perhaps be said with more truth that embassy be not popular with mr mr blow may be stated also that there be clerk attached to establishment mr bunderdown who have be there for year who be good naturedly regarded by english inhabitant a third attache mr montgomery arbuthnot did best to let be understood that be mistake in small affair of legation doubt did not go beyond legation mr bunderdown generally sided with mr blow mr montgomery arbuthnot be recognized a second mounted attache though attendance on boulevard be not a constant a of mr anderson in consequence probably of fact that have not horse of own there be others also present there be sir thomas tresham with wife who have be sent over to inquire into iron trade of belgium be learned free trader who must not be got to agree with old familiar view of sir magnus who thought that more iron be produced in belgium le must be forthcoming from england sir thomas knew better a sir magnus be quite unable to hold own with political economist gave many dinner be civil to wife sir thomas doubt felt that in doing so sir magnus did must be expected from lady tresham be quiet little woman who must endure to be patronized by lady mountjoy without annoyance there be m grascour from belgian foreign office who spoke english so much better than other gentleman present that stranger might have supposed to be school master whose mission be to instruct english embassy in own language oh mr mountjoy be so ashamed of myself said

do very well at brussels after waddled off again be stopped in waddling by sir magnus who sternly desired to prepare for august ceremony of going in to dinner one period of real importance at english embassy be doubt daily dinner hour florence found seated between mr anderson who have taken in m grascour who have performed same ceremony for ladyship be sure will like little capital very much said m grascour be a much nicer than paris a be smaller le pretentious florence must only assent will soon be able to learn something of in paris must be to manner born lifetime will not suffice will put up to time of day said mr anderson who did not choose a said afterward that tidbit must be taken out of mouth dare say that will want will come naturally without putting up wo find amiss to know little of what be what have not got riding horse here oh said florence be going on to say that can manage to secure one for billibong have got excellent horse carried princess of styria last year mr

everything leap frog be not too heavy for spillikin not too light be up to from backgammon to cotillon not what prefer cotillon for own taste leap frog perhaps suggested florence well yes leap frog used to be good game at gother school see why must have back again lady of course must have costume on purpose be fond of anything requires costume like everything out of common way do florence assured that taste be wholly dissimilar a liked everything in common way be what call uncommonly pretty girl said afterward to m grascour while sir magnus be talking to sir thomas what eye yes indeed be very lovely word may say that turn of shoulder say be best looking a rule english belgian there be very few of to come up to anderson can tell how many ton of steel rail turn out at liege week sir thomas asks just a though be simplest question in world forty million said anderson more le twenty thousand must perhaps be nearer mark said m grascour will send exact amount to morrow chapter xv mr anderson love lady mountjoy have certainly prophesied truth when said that mr anderson must devote to florence first week in brussels passed by quietly enough young man can hardly declare passion within week mr anderson way in particular be well known certain amount of license be usually given to by sir magnus lady mountjoy when must become remarkable by rapidity of change only adverse criticism must come generally from mr blow peerless bird of paradise mr blow must say if bird be le numerous anderson might perhaps do something at end of week on occasion even sir magnus perceived that anderson be about to make peculiar by george said one morning when sir magnus have just left outer office have entered with object of giving instruction a to day ride take altogether never saw girl so fit a miss mountjoy there be something very remarkable in speech a according to usual habit of life anderson must certainly have called florence whereas present appellation showed unwonted respect what do mean when say that young lady be fit said mr blow mean that be right round be great deal more than can be said of most of divine florence began mr montgomery arbuthnot struggling to say something funny young man have better hold tongue not talk of young lady in language do believe that be going to fall in love said mr blow say that miss mountjoy be fittest girl have seen for many day when young puppy call divine florence doe not know what be about why did blow mr blow up when called bird of paradise said montgomery arbuthnot divine florence be not half so disrespectful of young lady a bird of paradise divine florence mean divine florence bird of paradise be chaff mr blow a married man said anderson have certain freedom allowed if us in bad taste evil fall back upon own head now if please will change conversation from will be seen that mr anderson have really fallen in love with miss mountjoy though week have passed in harmless way to sir magnus lady mountjoy in harmless way to a regarded niece attache certain amount of annoyance have doubt be felt by florence though mr anderson expression of admiration have be more subdued than usual though have endeavored to whisper love rather than to talk out loud still admiration have be visible audible especially so to florence be nothing to sir magnus with whom attache flirted anderson be younger son of baronet who have sickly elder brother fortune of own if chose to marry girl must be well for if not must be quite well that young people must amuse expected anderson to help to put on horse to ride with at appointed hour in return gave anderson dinner a much wine a chose to drink be satisfied with other sir magnus did not choose to interfere with young man amusement florence did not like being subject of young man love making complained to mother now have come to pas that not word have be said a to harry annesley since mother daughter have reached brussels mr mountjoy have declared that must consult brother in law in difficulty such consultation have a yet taken place indeed florence must not have found sojourn at brussels to be unpleasant be not for mr anderson unpalatable little whisper have taken a joke a long a have be able to do so be now at last driven to perceive that other people must not do so mamma said think that mr anderson be odious young man dear by mean what be there odious about be very lively be second son of sir gregory anderson have very comfortable mean of own oh mamma what doe signify well dear doe signify in first place be gentleman in next have right to make attentive to young lady in position say anything more be not particularly wedded to mr anderson if be to come to ask for permission to address must simply refer to by must mean to imply that if must contrive to recommend to must not refuse sanction then subject for moment dropped florence be astonished to find that mother must talk about not only without reference to harry annesley also without apparent thought of mountjoy scarborough be distressing to to think that mother must pretend to feel that own daughter must be free to receive advance of suitor a reflected came across mind that harry be so odious that mother must have be willing to accept on behalf suitor who presented even though daughter in accepting must have proved to be heartless alternative must have be better to mother than choice to florence have determined to devote whole life mamma said going back to subject on next day if be to stay here for three week longer yes dear be to stay here for three week longer then somebody must say something to mr anderson see who can say a far a can see have not misbehaved wish must speak to uncle what be to tell that be engaged must ask to whom can not tell must then be driven to put whole case in hand to ask advice suppose that be going to say that be engaged to marry odious young man world know how atrociously badly have behaved to own cousin left lying for dead in street by blow from own hand though from day to nothing have be heard of mountjoy nothing be known to police of what may have be fate even stranger may have perished under usage received yet mr annesley have not thought right to say word of what have occurred have not dared even to tell inspector of police event of night young man be own cousin to whom be known to have be promised for last two year said florence say that be so be promised to cousin mountjoy scarborough not with own consent friend natural friend knew that be to be so now expect to take by hand young man who have almost be murderer mamma be not true know circumstance assert thing be directly at variance with truth from whom do get information from young man be that likely to be true what must sir magnus say a to be to tell know what must say do know what be truth can think possible that must now be willing to accept foolish young man in order thus to put end to embarrassment then left mother room retreating to own sat for couple of hour thinking partly in anger partly in grief of trouble of situation mother have now in truth frightened a to harry position did begin to see what men might say of way in might speak of silence though be resolved to be a true to in faith a ever exertion of spirit must indeed be necessary be beginning to understand in what way outside world might talk of harry annesley of man to whom have given whole heart then mother be right a thought of began to justify mother be natural that mother must believe story have be told to let have come from where might there be in mind suspicion of truth acknowledged great animosity to cousin augustus regarded a one of cause of unhappiness knew nothing of real fact did not even suspect that augustus have seen brother after harry have dealt with that be responsible for brother absence knew that disliked in way connected name with harry misfortune of one thing be certain let mountjoys prospers rest of world think say what must of harry must be true to must understand that character might be made to suffer must not suffer in estimation rather let suffer ever so that must not affect love truth did not say to herself by saying even to herself must have committed default of truth did not whisper even to own heart within heart there be feeling let be right wrong in what have done even let be proved to satisfaction of world that have sinned grievously when have left man stunned bleeding on pavement for to such detail mother story have gone still to must be braver more noble more manly more worthy of being loved than be other man perceiving difficulty be in store for looking forward to misfortune under harry might be placed declared to herself that must at least have one friend who must be true to miss mountjoy have come to with message from aunt be said three four day after conversation between florence mother by mr anderson who have contrived to follow young lady into small drawing room after luncheon what be nature of message be not necessary for to know may be sure that have be manufactured by mr anderson for occasion have looked about spied have discovered that miss mountjoy be alone in little room in thus spying consider to have be perfectly justified business at moment be that of making love business be allowed to override other consideration even making office copy of report made by mr blow for signature of sir magnus might according to view of life have be properly laid aside for such purpose when young man have in to make love to young lady be earnest in intention duty however paramount must be held a restraint such be mr anderson intention at present moment therefore think that be justified in concocting message from lady mountjoy business of love making warrant concoction to lover may resort oh miss mountjoy be so glad to have moment in can find alone must be understood that amorous young gentleman have not yet be acquainted with young lady for quite fortnight be just about to go up stair to mother said florence rising to leave room oh bother mother beg pardon yours really did mean there be such lot of chaff going on in outer room that fellow fall into way of whether like mother wo mind at really must go oh be sure can wait for five minute want to keep for more than five minute be so hard for fellow to get opportunity to say few word what word can want to say to mr anderson said with look of great surprise a though utterly unable to imagine what be to follow well did hope that might have idea of what feeling be not in least have now suppose be bound to believe though doubt whether quite do pray excuse for saying be best to be open florence felt that ought to be excused for doubting a did know very well what be coming come then love if be to go on beating about bush for twelve month must only come to same conclusion perhaps might then have considered better not in least fancy considering such thing a for twelve month before speak of must do not for twelve day so perceive mr anderson well be best to speak truth when be quite sure of if be to remain dumb for three month how must know what one else might come in way ca expect must be so sudden be just where be of course yet girl have to be sudden too have be expected to be ready with answer a soon a be asked say by way of impertinence merely to show have justification of course if like to say that must take week to think of be prepared for only let tell own story first will tell own story mr anderson be afraid that can be to purpose say that pray say that do let tell then paused a remained silent after moment resumed eloquence of appeal by george miss have be so struck of heap know whether be standing on head heel have knocked so completely off pin that be not at like same person sir magnus say that never saw such difference only say that to show that be quite in earnest now be not quite like fellow have business to fall in love with girl have four hundred year besides place in foreign office then of course there be chance in alluded to brother failing health of must not explain detail to miss mountjoy on present occasion mean to say that be very splendid that be half what must like to lay at foot competence be comfortable money have nothing to do with mr anderson what then perhaps be that like fellow what girl generally do like be devotion by george 'd have that very ground that tread upon be sweet to for beauty know how be to taste there be one ever saw at like fit well a though be made for know that fellow might say deal better one more truly miss mountjoy love with heart want to be wife now have got have not pleaded cause badly so florence felt that have pleaded hopelessly be matter of course have given rise to feeling of gentle regard rather than of anger have be honest have contrived to make believe did not come up to ideal of what lover must be be nearer to than mountjoy scarborough have touched so closely that determined at once to tell truth thinking that might best in way put end to passion forever mr anderson said though have known to be vain have thought best to listen to because asked be sure be awfully obliged to ought to thank for kind feeling have expressed to indeed do thank believe word have said be better to show confidence in truth than to pretend to humility of thinking untrue be true be true word of be engaged then be sad to see thorough change came over young man face of course girl doe not talk of own little affair to stranger must let have known before so a to have prevented in truth be engaged doe sir magnus know lady mountjoy must think not doe mother now be taking advantage of confidence pressing question too closely mother doe know of will tell more doe not approve of be fixed in heaven may well be that will never be able to marry gentleman to whom allude most certainly will marry one else have told because seems to be necessary to welfare so that may get over passing feeling be passing feeling said anderson with tragic grandeur at rate have now story remember that be trusted to a gentleman have told for purpose then walked out of room leaving poor young man in temporary despair chapter xvi mr miss grey be now middle of october may be said that from time in old mr scarborough have declared intention of showing that elder of son have right to property mr grey lawyer have be so occupied with scarborough affair a to have have left hardly moment for other consideration have partner who during four month have in fact carried on business one difficulty have grown out of till mr grey whole time have be occupied thought have be filled with mr scarborough be matter of much greater moment to man than loss of time question of mountjoy scarborough position have be first submitted to in june october have now be reached mr grey have be out of town only for fortnight during fortnight have be occupied entirely in unravelling mystery have at first refused altogether to have anything to do with unravelling have desired that other lawyer might be employed have gradually come to pas that have entered heart soul into case with many execration on own part against mr scarborough must find real interest in nothing else have begun investigation with thorough wish to discover mountjoy scarborough be in truth heir though have never loved young man a went on with investigation became aware that whole property must go to creditor must succeed in proving that mountjoy be heir yet for sake of abstract honesty be most anxious that must be so must not bear to think that other lawyer have be taken in by wily craft of such man a squire of tretton went thoroughly against grain with to have to acknowledge that estate must become property of augustus be so did acknowledge be proved to that in spite of evidence have hitherto seen in matter squire have not married wife until after birth of eldest son did acknowledge said bravely that must be so then there came down upon crowd of enemy in guise of baffled creditor of whom believed professed to believe that mr grey be in league with squire to rob of right if must be proved that mountjoy have claim to property then must go nominally to augustus who according to showing be also one of confederate property must thus said be divided very shortly squire must be dead then confederate must get everything to utter exclusion of poor mr tyrrwhit poor mr samuel hart other poor creditor who must thus be denuded defrauded robbed by lawyer trick be in spirit mr grey be attacked by mr tyrrwhit others mr grey found very hard to bear then there be matter be also very grievous to if be a now stated if squire have be guilty of fraud to what punishment must be subjected mountjoy be declared to have be innocent mr tyrrwhit a put case to own lawyer laughed bitterly a made suggestion augustus be of course innocent then there be renewed laughter mr grey mr grey have of course be innocent then laughter be very loud be to be believed that anybody must be taken in by such story a there be mr tyrrwhit have ever be known a sharp fellow mr samuel hart who be now away on travel others be of sharp fellow be to be believed that set of gentleman so keenly alive to own interest must be made victim of such trick a not if knew not if mr tyrrwhit knew be in shape that matter reached mr grey ear then be asked if be so what must be punishment to must be subjected who have defrauded mr tyrrwhit of just claim mr tyrrwhit who on one occasion made way into mr grey presence wished to get answer to question from mr grey man be dying said mr grey solemnly dying be not more likely to die than be from hear at time rumor of mr scarborough improved health have reached creditor in london mr tyrrwhit have begun to believe that mr scarborough dangerous condition have be part of hoax that there have be surgeon knife terrible operation moment of almost certain death believe be be ill at said mr tyrrwhit can not help belief said mr grey because man doe die recovers be on account to be allowed to cheat people a have cheated with impunity be not going to defend mr scarborough have not in fact cheated who have come do mean to tell that if go on will not have be defrauded of hundred thousand pound did ever see mr scarborough on matter be not necessary have got writing to document have anything to show that knew what son be doing when borrowed money of be not perfectly clear that knew nothing about of course knew nothing about then at time be afterward that fraud began when found that estate be in jeopardy then falsehood be concocted ah there mr tyrrwhit can only say that disagree with must express opinion that if endeavor to recover money on plea will be beaten if can prove fraud of kind doubt can punish who have be guilty of among number say nothing of said mr tyrrwhit if have be led into present difficulty by illegal attempt on part of client to prove illegitimate son to have be legitimate then to have changed mind for certain purpose see how be to punish act will have be attempted not completed will have be act concerning son not concerning not concerning shrieked mr tyrrwhit certainly not legally be not in position to prove that knew that son be borrowing money from on credit of estate a fact certainly did not know will see about said mr tyrrwhit then must see about not with aid a fact be telling know about if must must prove mountjoy scarborough to be father heir to morrow indeed be altogether on side in matter if must believe here mr tyrrwhit again laughed will not believe ask to do so a be must be opposed to other where be young man asked mr tyrrwhit ah be question be not bound to answer even if knew be matter on say nothing have lent money at exorbitant rate of interest be not true at rate seems so to be out of question must assist in recovering did at own peril not on advice good morning mr tyrrwhit then mr tyrrwhit went way not without sundry threat a to whole scarborough family be very hard upon mr grey because certainly be honest man have taken up matter simply with view of learning truth have be whispered to within last day two mountjoy scarborough have lately be seen alive gambling with reckless prodigality at monte carlo have only be told to a probably true certainly believed knew nothing of detail of disappearance have not be much surprised a have never believed that young man have be murdered have made away with have heard before of quarrel in street between harry annesley story have be told to so a to fall with great discredit on harry annesley head according to story harry annesley have struck foe during night have left for dead upon pavement then mountjoy scarborough have be missing harry annesley have told one of quarrel there have be girl in question so much more mr grey have heard be of course inclined to think that harry annesley must have behaved very badly of mode of mountjoy subsequent escape have heard nothing mr grey at time be living down at fulham in small old fashioned house over looked river be called manor house must have said that be custom to go home day by omnibus did in truth almost always remain at office so late a

in family a papa own certainly be essential for respectability that something must be set apart from man income for wearing apparel though money be perhaps improperly so designated dolly must not have objected have not thought that have already gone to race course in company with green trouser have own mean of obtaining information a to carroll family be very necessary that must do so if family be to be kept on leg at think good can come from discussing what uncle doe with money be dolly first speech if be to have let have let have a little a possible never heard anybody so cross a always be to

made stout fight upon subject doe want very badly for decency sake said poor wife thus winding up plea then mr grey got out check book wrote check for twenty pound made payable not to mr to mr carroll suppose papa nothing can be done about mr carroll be said by dolly a soon a family have withdrawn in what way 'done dear a to settling farther sum for 'd only spend dear must be intended said dolly then must come back just same in case must have nothing more though be to declare that have pair of trouser in to appear at race course must have dear said mr grey can not get rid of gnat of world

have passed off just a though be gnat from be to receive a little annoyance a possible forgetting influence must have on six unfortunate child know that gave that twenty pound simply to be rid of disagreeable subject must have given ever so much sooner only that be looking at know must dear sweet kind hearted most un christian father must come to church in order that idea of what christianity demand of may make way into heart be not what clergyman may say of that mind will get away for two hour from that other reptile concern then mr grey with loud long sigh allowed boot glove church going hat church going umbrella to be brought to be in fact aversion to article dolly have to encounter may be doubted whether church service of day did mr grey much good seemed to have have effect upon daughter from fact that in afternoon wrote letter in kindly word to aunt papa be going to tretton will come up to on tuesday have got frock will bring with a present for potsey will make sew on button for tell minna will lend book spoke of about boot will go with georgina to boot maker a to amelia sophy must not bring to say good natured word so deep in heart have sunk that sin of have be guilty with reference to prince chitakov on night have long discussion with father respecting affair of scarborough family discussion be held in dining room may therefore be supposed to have be premeditated at night in mr grey own bedroom be generally result of sudden thought must lay down law to began dolly law be law said father mean law in sense must tell firmly what advised must then make understand that if did not follow advice must withdraw if son be willing to pay money lender what sum have actually advanced if by effort on part money can be raised let be done there seems to be justice in repaying out of property that be lent to property when by mr scarborough own doing property be supposed to go into eldest son hand though eldest son money lender be spendthrift profligate alike there will in be something of fairness go there prepared with opinion if father son will not accept then depart shake dust from foot propose a though be easiest thing in world easy difficult must not discus anything of justice may hereafter be disputed what be result of consultation on mr grey mind did not declare resolved to take daughter advice in that said to chapter xix mr grey go to tretton mr grey went down to tretton with great bag of paper in fact though told daughter that have to examine before started have taken to fulham for purpose have not looked at a fact bag be not opened till got home again have be read at rate what be necessary knew subject old squire knew well mr grey be going down to tretton not to convey fact to explain law in order that might take side of father of son mr scarborough have sent for lawyer to support view of case son have consented to meet in order that might more easily get better of father mr grey have of late learned one thing have before be dark to have seen one phase of complicated farrago of dishonesty have not before be visible to augustus suspected father of farther treachery that must be angry at having be debarred from birthright so long debarred from knowledge of birthright be mr grey thought natural great wrong have be at least intended such man must resent be to have be expected of late mr grey have discovered that be not in way that son mind worked be not anger suspicion that showed used father former treatment of a justification for condemnation implied in thought there be knowing what old man may do who have already acted a have done be thus that expressed by word deed did so openly in father presence mr grey have not seen together knew from letter of of that such be case old mr scarborough scorned son suspicion disregarded altogether word might be said a to own past conduct be willing half willing that mountjoy debt must be not paid settled be willing to hing toward step except in own way while breath be in body property be chose to be treated a only master if augustus desired to do anything by post obit let ruin after own fashion be not very likely that augustus can raise money by post obit circumstanced a property be have written to mr grey with conveyed sneer chuckle a to success of own villany be a though have declared that money lender have be too well instructed a to what trick mr scarborough must play with property to risk second venture augustus have in truth be awaiting father death with great impatience be unreasonable that man must live who have acted in such way who have be so cut about by doctor father demise have in truth be promised to to world be understood thing in circle knew anything that old mr scarborough must not live month have be understood time be understood at present moment yet mr scarborough went on living no doubt a invalid in last stage of probable dissolution still with full command of intellect mental power for mischief augustus suspecting a did have begun to fear that might live too long brother have disappeared be heir if father must die such have be first thought must settle with creditor immediately before tidings must be heard of brother tidings have come brother have be seen by mr hart at monte carlo though mr hart have not yet sent home news to other creditor news have be sent at once to augustus scarborough by own paid attendant upon brother of mr hart little game did not yet know particular be confident that there be game augustus by mean gave mother credit for disgraceful conduct imputed to in story a now told by surviving husband be not that believed in honesty of mother whom have never known for whose memory cared little that believed so fully in dishonesty of father father when have thoroughly understood that mountjoy have enveloped property in debt so that nothing skeleton must remain when bond be paid have set to work by ingenuity of brain have resolved to redeem a far a scarboroughs be concerned estate from unfortunate position be so that augustus believed be theory existing in mind that father must have be so clever mr grey so blind even mr hart mr tyrrwhit so easily hoodwinked be remarkable so be might probably be so felt assurance there be ever present to feeling of great danger state of thing a arranged by father might be established by if must get creditor to give up bond while father falsehood be still believed must be great thing have learned by degree how small proportion of money claimed have in fact be advanced to mountjoy have resolved to confine to paying that might now probably be accepted with gratitude increasing value of estate might bear that without being crushed must be done at once while mountjoy be still absent before mr tyrrwhit at rate knew that mountjoy have not be killed then have happened that accidental meeting with mr hart at monte carlo that idiot of keeper of have be unable to keep mountjoy from gambling house mr hart have a yet told nothing mr hart be playing game of own in must assuredly be foiled strong hold augustus have be in great infirmity of father in blindness of mr grey must be settled ought to have be well that thing must be settled already by father death augustus did feel strongly that squire ought to complete work by dying be story a now told by true ought certainly to die so a to make speedy atonement for wickedness be false then ought to go quickly so that lie might be effectual day that continued to live must go far to endanger discovery augustus felt that must at once have property in own hand so a to buy creditor obtain security mr grey who be not so blind a augustus thought saw great deal of augustus suspected a well a squire mind went backward forward on suspicion be more probable that squire must have contrived with attorney assistance than without two willing together might be very powerful then mr grey must hardly dare to do father knew that be dying mr grey have such easy mode of immediate escape if detected father be endowed with courage a peculiar a be great did not think that mr grey be so brave man a father then must trace payment of large sum to mr grey such a must have be necessary a bribe in such case augustus suspected mr grey on off mr grey be sure that augustus suspected own father now of one thing mr grey be certain augustus be in truth rightful heir squire have at first contrived to blind mr grey partly by own acuteness partly through carelessness of in office partly by subornation of witness who seemed to have be actually prepared for such event there must be subsequent blinding mr grey have well earned reputation for professional acuteness honesty knew there be need for such suspicion a now entertained by young man knew also that existed hated young man for entertaining when arrived at tretton park first of saw mr septimus jones with whom be not acquainted mr scarborough will be here directly be out somewhere about stable said mr jones in tone of voice with guest at house guest for pleasure may address sometimes guest who be guest on business in case guest on pleasure can not be gentleman must suppose that guest on business be not one mr grey thinking that mr scarborough spoken of must not be squire put mr jones right be elder mr scarborough whom wish to see there be quite time enough doubt miss scarborough will be down presently

much hardly thought that must take trouble augustus be here know so have heard from gentleman down stair mr jones have never have pleasure of seeing mr jones what sort of gentleman be mr jones to look at very much like other gentleman dare say have done honor to stay good deal at house lately augustus never come without be 'fidus achates take to augustus augustus have never asked whether can be received of course doe not matter when man be eldest son so to say only one be apt to take liberty with father house be so sorry that in position can not do honor receive properly be very estimable modest young man believe a mr grey have not come down to tretton to be spy on mr jones to answer question concerning held tongue well mr grey what do think about eh be comprehensive question mr grey well understood purport what did mr grey think of condition to affair of tretton have be brought of mr scarborough of two son what did think of mountjoy who have disappeared be still absent what did think of augustus who be not showing gratitude in best way for have be done for what did think of squire who from death bed have so well contrived to have own way in everything to do manner of illegal thing without paying of penalty to illegality be generally subject having asked question paused for answer mr grey have have personal interview with squire since time at have be declared that mountjoy be not heir then very severe word have be spoken mr grey have first sworn that did not believe word of what be said to have refused to deal with matter at if carried out mr scarborough must take to other lawyer office there have since be correspondence a to much of mr scarborough have be forced to employ amanuensis gradually mr grey have assented in first instance on behalf of mountjoy then on behalf of augustus have done so in expectation that must never again see squire in world too have be assured that man must die have felt that must be better that management of thing must then be in honest hand such a own in hand of who understood than be confided to who did not not understand who might probably not be honest squire have not died here be again at tretton a squire guest think said mr grey that le said about good deal of better that of course be sweeping condemnation however expect let that be a though have be expressed understand inner man rule how have struggled to free from conventionality do quite understand how inner man have succumbed to encouraged have encouraged obedience to law of country men generally find safer to do so exactly men like to be safe perhaps condition of danger have have attraction for be very stupid perhaps be so let go rope have be round own neck not round that of others perhaps have thought of late that if danger must come must run away from by help of surgeon have become so skilful now that man have chance in way what do think of mountjoy augustus think that mountjoy have be very ill used endeavored to do best must for augustus have be worse used at rate have be put right quite in time have be brought up a eldest son might have done a mountjoy did then there came little gleam of satisfaction across squire face a felt sufficiency of answer be of pleased can not please men by going wrong even in own behalf be not so sure of be to say that can not please men ever by doing right on behalf must perhaps be nearer mark where do think that mountjoy be rumor have reached mr grey mountjoy have be seen at monte carlo have be only rumor same have in truth reached mr scarborough chose to keep rumor to indeed more than rumor have reached think that will turn up safely said lawyer think that if be made worth while must turn up at once be not better that must be away mr grey shrugged shoulder what be good of coming back into nest of hornet have always thought that did very well to disappear where be to live if came back must come here not with gambling debt unpaid at club might have be settled though indeed gambling be a tub have bottom to there have be nothing for to throw over altogether yet how very much better have be of two poor mountjoy poor mountjoy see if have disinherited must have have to go on paying for till whole estate must have be squandered even during lifetime speak a though law have given power of disinheriting so did not power of giving inheritance took that upon there be stronger than law now simply humbly ask law to come help upshot be that augustus take upon to lecture to feel aggrieved be not angry with for what did about mountjoy be quarrelling with because die have idea of dying just to please think important must live just at present will let have money to pay creditor be what want to speak about if can see list of sum to be paid if can assure that by paying will get back post obit bond mountjoy have given that money can be at once raised upon joint mortgage to be executed by augustus will do first thing must be to know amount will join augustus in nothing without consent want to assume power in fact one thing desire be that will go a long a remain will hing except by co operation will see to morrow now may go eat dinner can not tell how much obliged be to for coming then mr grey left room went to chamber in process of time made way into drawing room chapter xx mr grey opinion of scarborough family have augustus be really anxious to see mr grey before mr grey went to father must probably have managed to do so did not always tell mr jones everything so fellow have hurried up to governor moment came into house said be with now of course be never mind will be even with in long run then greeted lawyer with mock courtesy a soon a saw hope journey have done harm mr grey not in least be very kind of be sure to look after poor concern with so much interest jones think be time gave dinner mr grey be sure must want dinner in good time said lawyer will have dinner mr grey be least can do for mr grey felt that in sound of voice there be insult took special notice of tone booked down in memory after dinner asked unimportant question with reference to meeting be to take place in morning be at once rebuked know that need trouble friend here with private concern said not in least said mr grey have already be talking about in presence in be necessary must have list of creditor before can advise father see however be for to judge indeed know on point father want advice lawyer generally furnishes such list then mr grey took up book be soon left alone by younger men in morning walked out in park so a to have free time for thought not word farther have be said between augustus touching affair at breakfast augustus discussed with friend state of odds respecting race then character of certain lady subject must have be le interesting to mr grey a augustus be aware breakfasted at ten twelve have be named for meeting mr grey have hour hour half for walk in must again turn over in mind matter of thought have be full for now many day of two three fact be certain augustus be legitimate heir of father of that have seen ample documentary evidence word of scarborough must go for anything with of fact be assured whether squire knew aught of mountjoy did not feel sure that augustus did be quite certain who be paying bill for scapegrace during travel must not say thought probable that augustus be finding money mountjoy be kept away so a to be out of creditor way thought therefore that augustus be doing so that might more easily buy up debt why must augustus go to expense of buying up debt seeing that money must ultimately come out of own pocket because so mr grey thought augustus must not trust own father creditor if must get hold of mountjoy when father be dead when bond must become payable might possibly so unravel fact a to make apparent that after property be mountjoy be not mr grey idea be mr grey idea of calculation augustus be making for own government according to mr grey reading of fact of case such be suspicion augustus entertained in matter otherwise why must be anxious to take step must redound only to advantage of creditor be quite certain that money must be paid at rate by augustus solely with view of honestly settling claim there be subject troubled mind excessively a walked across park why must soil hand at rate trouble conscience with affair so unclean so perplexed so troublesome why be there at tretton at to be insulted by young blackguard such a believed augustus scarborough to be augustus scarborough knew suspected in return suspected augustus scarborough creditor suspected mountjoy suspected squire did not suspect suspected squire never must again feel to be on comfortable term of trusting legal friendship with man who have played prank in reference to marriage a man have performed why then must still be concerned in matter so distasteful to why must not wipe hand of retreat there be act of parliament compelling to meddle with dirt such be thought yet knew that be compelled did feel bound to look after interest have taken in hand now for many year have be duty duty of one belonging to to see into deceit by attempt have be made to rob augustus scarborough of patrimony have be duty for while to protect mountjoy creditor who have lent money to mountjoy from what have believed to be flagitious attempt then a soon a felt that flagitious attempt have be made previously in mountjoy favor became duty to protect augustus in spite of strong personal dislike from first have conceived for young man then doubtless have be attracted by singularity of have be done in affair of be likely to be done have said to that matter must be made straight that must make straight therefore during walk in park resolved that must persevere at twelve o'clock be ready to be taken up to sick man room when entered under custody of miss scarborough found that augustus be there squire be sitting up with foot supported be apparently in good humor well mr grey said have settled matter with augustus have settled nothing have not spoken to about at said augustus told wanted list of creditor said that be duty to supply be extent of conversation thought expedient to have in presence of friend mr jones mr jones be very well in way be not acquainted with affair son mr scarborough have made tender to of information sir have mr grey sought for information from during little dialogue mr scarborough turned face with smile from one to other without word if mr grey have anything to suggest in way of advice let suggest said augustus now mr grey said squire with same smile till get farther information said mr grey can only limit to giving advice offered to yesterday perhaps will repeat so that may hear said squire if get list of to whom son mountjoy owes money assurance that money named in list have be from time to time lent by to actual amount mean then think that if son augustus will together choose to pay amount will make best reparation in power for injury have doubt done in having contrived that must be understood that mountjoy be legitimate need not discus said squire injury have done have done great many doubt continued lawyer before such payment be made close inquiry must be instituted a to amount of money have absolutely passed must certainly be taken in said squire have great admiration for mr samuel hart do believe that must be found impossible to extract truth from mr samuel hart if mr samuel hart doe not make money yet out of poor mountjoy will be surprised truth may be ascertained said mr grey must get accountant to examine check when remember how easy be to deceive really clever men a to evidence of marriage began mr scarborough so squire began then stopped with shrug of shoulder among really clever men who have be easily deceived mr grey be if not actually first in importance foremost at rate in name truth may be ascertained mr grey repeated almost with scowl of anger upon brow well yes suppose may will be difficult in opposition to mr samuel hart must satisfy yourselves at rate men will know that have other hope of getting shilling be little hard to make believe anything said squire fancy know that if must get hold of mountjoy so a to have in hand when breath be out of body bond be really due that then may be made to turn out that be really heir know that be not so said mr grey at augustus smiled blandly know be what can make mr samuel hart know in truth mr samuel hart never allows to know anything except amount of money may have at banker will be difficult to convince mr tyrrwhit mr tyrrwhit be assured that of mountjoy augustus be in conspiracy to cheat others wonder at said mr grey perhaps not continued squire circumstance doubt be suspicious will have to find out mistake augustus be very anxious to pay poor men money be noble feeling on part of augustus must admit that mr grey irony with be said be evident in squire face voice augustus only quietly laughed attorney sat a firm a death be not going to argue with such statement to laugh at joke suppose will come to over hundred thousand pound eighty thousand must think said augustus bond amount to great deal more than twice that be for to judge said squire whether be bound by honor to pay so large sum to men whom suppose love very well estate can bear said augustus yes estate can bear said attorney must be paid what have expended that be idea son think that silence will be worth money what make say that demanded augustus just own opinion look upon a insult must be kind enough to explain to what be reason for wishing to do thing asked mr grey sir decline to give reason ascribe to be insulting will deny will not assent to anything coming from will deny anything be altogether out of place a attorney to ascribe motif to client can raise money so that will be forthcoming at once be question on father authority backed by signature imagine can do so will not answer a certainty best thing must be to sell portion of property if father will join mountjoy also with may be done have mountjoy got to do with asked father have better have mountjoy also there may be doubt a to title people will think so after trick have be played be said by lawyer squire only laughed always showed enjoyment of fun arose from effect of own scheming legal world with entail have endeavored to dispose of property have shown legal world that be not easy task to dispose of anything in be concerned how will get hold of mountjoy asked augustus then two older men only looked at other of believed that augustus knew more about brother than one else think have better send to mr annesley ask what doe annesley know about asked squire be last person who saw at rate in london be sure of said mr grey think may say that be think at rate know that there be violent quarrel between in street quarrel in two men proceeded to blow annesley struck in way a to leave for dead upon pavement then young man walked away have not be heard of at least have not be seen since that man must have struck blow then on spur of moment thinking of own safety must have left opponent can understand must not like to be accused of such treatment can understand can not understand that man must have be missing altogether that then must have held tongue how do know asked attorney be sufficient that do know believe word of said squire coming from of course must put up with contradiction said augustus must not bear from one else looked at attorney one have right to ask for authority said father can not give lady be concerned whose name will not mention be of le importance a own friend be acquainted with nature of conduct indeed seems odd to see two gentleman so ignorant a to matter have be subject of common conversation in most circle uncle mean to cut out from property can too deal with entail said squire be still in middle life can marry be what intended to do so much be disgusted with nephew have already stopped young man allowance swears that will not have shilling of money if can help police for time be in great doubt whether must not arrest think be justified in saying that be thorough reprobate be not at justified said father can only express opinion be glad to say that world agrees with be sickening absolutely sickening said squire turning to attorney must not believe now stopped what must not mr grey believe asked son there be one one know better than that after row in street when mountjoy be believe aggressor be again seen by person hate such deceit scheming here augustus smiled what be sniggering there at blockhead hatred sir at deceit scheming truth be that when man play game well doe not like to find that have equal heaven forbid must say that there be rivalry here sir be so pre eminently first that one can touch then laughed long low bitter inaudible laugh during mr grey sat silent come well from said father well sir must try hand upon have passed over that have done on behalf when come to abuse can not quite take word a calmly a though there have be no will say antecedent now about money be to pay care one straw about money what be to owe creditor anything do let rest then do worst can upon whole mr grey added after pause think have better pay have endeavored to be insolent to have therefore ignored claim have told to do worst if son here will agree with in raising money if mountjoy a too be necessary will do so too will do what be required of if eighty thousand pound will settle there ought not to be difficulty can inquire what real amount must be if choose to hold to bond nothing will come of be very well mr scarborough then will know how to proceed understand that mr scarborough junior be assenting party mr scarborough junior signified assent by nodding head will do then for think have little exhausted then turned round upon couch a though intended to slumber mr grey left room augustus followed not word be spoken between mr grey have early dinner went up to london by evening train what became of augustus did not inquire simply asked for dinner for conveyance to train be forthcoming returned that night to fulham well said dolly a soon a have got slipper made tea wish with heart have never seen one of name of scarborough be of course what have done father have be great knave have set law of country at defiance must be punished most severely mountjoy scarborough have proved to be unfit to have money in hand man so reckless be little better than lunatic compared with augustus be estimable amiable men father have idea of philanthropy mountjoy be simply mad augustus be a dishonest a of be odious also round then at length explained that have learned that have advised at last went to bed combating dolly idea that scarboroughs ought now to be thrown over altogether chapter xxi mr scarborough thought of when mr scarborough be left alone did not go to sleep a have pretended lay there for hour thinking of position indulging to full feeling of anger now entertained toward second son have never in truth loved augustus augustus be very like father in capacity for organizing deceit for plotting so contriving that own will must be in opposition to will of around be thoroughly unlike in object to be attained mr scarborough be not selfish man augustus be selfish nothing else mr scarborough hated law because be law endeavored to put restraint upon others augustus liked law unless when in particular point interfered with own action mr scarborough thought that must do better than law augustus wished to do worse mr scarborough never blushed at what attempted unless failed be not often case be constantly driven to blush for son augustus blushed for nothing for nobody when mr scarborough have declared to attorney just praise be due to augustus for nobility of sacrifice be making augustus have understood father accurately determined to be revenged not because of expression of father thought because have so expressed before attorney mr scarborough also thought that be entitled to revenge when have be left alone for hour rung bell be close at side called for mr merton where be mr grey think have ordered wagonette to take to station where be augustus

augustus still ready to occupy position to have in truth be born at moment mountjoy have gone knew not where there have be gambling debt coming a did after many others have refused to pay be dying at moment a thought must be better for to take up with augustus mountjoy must leave to fate for son so reckless so incurable so hopeless be impossible that anything farther must be done must at least enjoy power of leaving wretched creditor without money there must be triumph consolation in so have done now heir turned against be very bitter to a lay thinking of be man who be from constitution heart capable of making great sacrifice for loved have most thorough contempt for character of honest man did not believe in honesty only in mock honesty yet must speak of honest man with admiration meaning something altogether different from honesty of men ordinarily spoke usual honesty of world be with pretence if not assumed for sake of character must achieve mr grey knew to be honest mr grey word knew to be true fancied that mr grey have adopted absurd mode of living with view of cheating neighbor by appearing to be better than others virtue vice be comprised by in word good nature ill nature church going propensity propensity in estimate extended very widely scorned from very bottom of heart that one set of word must be deemed more wicked than a in regard to swearing be to sign of

iniquity a have be seen by conduct in reference to son in way lived be kind to many people having generous open hand be man who must hate with bitter hatred hated most suspected by of mean dirty conduct mr grey who constantly told to face that be rascal did not hate at thinking mr grey to be in respect idiotic respected almost loved thoroughly believed mr grey thinking to be as for telling so much truth unnecessarily have loved son mountjoy in spite of iniquity have fostered till be impossible to foster longer then have endeavored to love augustus did not in least love le because son told frequently of wicked thing have done did not object to be told of wickedness even by son augustus suspected of other thing than of accused attempted to be sharp with to get better of at own game son laughed at scorned regarded a one who be troublesome only for time who need not be treated with much attention because be there only for time therefore hated augustus augustus be heir knew that must die soon for how long must live what must yet do before died braver man than mr scarborough never lived be one who le feared to die whether be true courage may be question be in conjunction with courage of description did not fear to die did fear to live what did fear be to fail before died not to go out with conviction that be vanishing amid glory of success be to to be wretched at last moment to be wretched at last moment to anticipate that must be so be to even so near last hour acme of misery how much of life be left to so that might recover something of success be moment left to must not sleep so rung bell again sent for mr merton have taken what told so best said mr merton for did not always feel assured that strange patient must take what have be ordered have tried to sleep will come after while must not naturally sleep just after tonic have be thinking of what said about business there be one thing must do then can remain quiet for fortnight unless must be called upon to disturb rest by dying will hope not may go a plea said sick man want now to write letter for to mr grey mr merton have undertaken to perform duty of secretary a well a doctor have thought in way to obtain authority over patient for patient own good have found already that authority have come to now sat down at table close to bedside prepared to write in accordance with mr scarborough dictation think that grey lawyer know be good man world a far a hear say that be honest care straw what world say world say that be dishonest be not merton must only shrug shoulder say that because want to change opinion care what think tell fact doubt whether grey be so absolutely honest a be a thing go be good man certainly world suppose say that son augustus be honest well yes must suppose so if have looked into have seen contrary respect intelligence did not mean anything particular dare say not if so mean nothing particular a to intelligence at rate be scoundrel mountjoy know mountjoy never saw in life think be scoundrel not round have gambled when have not have money to pay be bad have promised when wanted money broken word a soon a have got be bad also have thought to be fine fellow because have be intimate with lord duke be very bad have never cared whether paid tailor mean that have merely got into debt young man such a can not help have not cared whether breech be man too be bad though have be passionately fond of woman have only be for not for woman be very bad there be immense deal to be altered before can go to heaven hope change may come before be too late said merton change come very suddenly know there be chance for mountjoy think that there be for augustus here paused merton did not feel disposed to make remark happen to know young man of name of annesley harry annesley have heard name from son from augustus then did hear good of be sure have heard row about poor mountjoy disappearance heard that did disappear after quarrel with annesley after quarrel did not notice name at time harry annesley be name now augustus say that harry annesley be last person who saw mountjoy before disappearance last who knew implies thereby that annesley be conscious unconscious cause of disappearance well yes certainly be so a have be thought by police by other fool that mountjoy be murdered that disappearance be occasioned by death by murder suicide follows that annesley must have have something to do with be inference be not must suppose so said merton be manifestly inference augustus draw to hear speak to about must suppose that suspected annesley of having killed mountjoy not that hope something of sort have intended to be believed annesley for own purpose have caused mountjoy to be made away with have endeavored to fill police with idea policeman generally be biggest fool that london england world produce have be selected on account therefore police have beautifully mysterious altogether ignorant suspicion a to annesley be doing of augustus for purpose of own now let tell that augustus saw mountjoy after annesley have seen that know to be case that be augustus who contrived mountjoy disappearance now what do think of augustus be question merton did not find very easy to answer mr scarborough waited for reply eh exclaimed have rather not give opinion on point so raised may of course understand intend to assert augustus be greatest blackguard ever knew if have anything to say in favor can say only that may be mistaken living down here may not know truth just do know truth augustus be very clever there be others a clever a be can pay then so can that must want to get mountjoy out of way be intelligible mountjoy have become disreputable have better be out of way why persistently endeavor to throw blame upon young annesley surprise only care much about hear now for first time that have ruined young annesley that doe appear to be very horrible why doe want to pay eighty thousand pound to creditor must wish to do so out of property must in very short time become must be intelligible may be supposed to have affection for mountjoy after be not called upon to pay money out of own pocket do understand not in least said merton who did not indeed very much care about do only that if must pay men deprive of power of obtaining farther payment let who must have property at rate must be quiet augustus be now eldest son perhaps think might not remain so if be out of way creditor be paid think that poor mountjoy must have chance will pay eighty thousand pound mountjoy have chance a be augustus will pay penalty then threw back on bed mr merton begged to spare trouble of letter for present in few minute be again on elbow took farther medicine be great as said to help augustus in playing game if be to go off at once must be happiest fellow left alive come let begin then dictated letter a follows dear mr grey have be thinking much of what passed between other day augustus seems to be in great hurry a to paying creditor see why must not be gratified a money may now be forthcoming presume that sale will be completed before christmas will nearly enable to stop mouth can understand mountjoy must be induced to join with augustus so that in disposing of so large sum of money authority of may be given of myself of heir also of who short time since be supposed to be heir think that may possibly find mountjoy address by applying to augustus who be always clever in such matter will have to be certain that obtain bond if can get tyrrwhit to help will be able to be sure of doing so matter to be one of vital importance a sum be so much largest of course will open mouth very wide when find that can get principal nothing more think that will help be afraid that must ask to put in correspondence with augustus that be insolent scoundrel will admit can not very well complete affair without fancy that now feel to be interest to get done before die a men will be clamorous with bond a soon a breath be out of body yours sincerely john scarborough will do said when letter be finished when mr merton turned to leave room mr scarborough detained upon whole be not dissatisfied with life said know that have occasion rejoined mr merton in absolutely lied for according to thinking there be very much in affair of mr scarborough life ought to have induced regret knew whole story of birth of elder son of subsequent marriage of mr scarborough fraudulent deceit have lasted so many year of later return to truth so a to save property to give back to younger son of for so many year father have attempted to rob london have talked of affair london have declared that so wicked dishonest old gentleman have never lived now have returned to truth simply with view of cheating creditor keeping estate in family be manifestly old gentleman who ought to be above others dissatisfied with own life mr merton when assertion be made to knew not what other answer to make really think have do know one to whom heaven with bliss will be more readily accorded what have done for quite know what have done life be born rich man then married not rich a be now with ample mean for marrying after mr mountjoy birth said merton who must not pretend to be ignorant of circumstance well yes have own idea about marriage that kind of thing be perhaps at variance with yours whereupon merton bowed have best wife in world who entirely coincided with in did lived entirely abroad made most liberal allowance to agricultural tenant rebuilt cottage go look at let man shoot own game till mountjoy came up in world took shooting into own hand when people at pottery began to build assisted in way in world offered to keep school at own expense solely on understanding that what call dissenter must be

understand must know that be more of atheist than be gave boy best education spending on more than double what be done by men with twice mean taste be simple be not specially vicious know have ever made one unhappy then estate became richer mountjoy grew more more expensive began to find that with economy estate must not keep pace with so a to allow to put by anything for augustus then have to bethink have to do to save estate from rascal took peculiar step be man who doe take peculiar step must have turned face to wall in state of health have allowed two dirty jew such a tyrrwhit samuel

engendered habit of idleness during last two year mind of young man so circumstanced turn always first to bar then to literature at bar did not think that there must be opening for in first place be late to begin then be humble enough to believe of that have none of peculiar gift necessary for judge for advocate perhaps knowledge that six seven year of preliminary labor must be necessary be somewhat of deterrent reward of literature might be achieved immediately such be idea have idea perhaps a erroneous that career must not become gentleman who intended to be squire of buston have seen two three men decidedly bohemian in mode of life to whom did not wish to assimilate there be quaverdale whom have known intimately at st john who be on press quaverdale have quarrelled absolutely with father who be also clergyman having be thrown altogether on own resource have come out a writer for coming hour made five six hundred year in rattling loose uncertain sort of fashion be so thought harry annesley dirtiest man of acquaintance did not believe in six hundred year quaverdale must certainly have changed shirt more frequently must sometimes have have new pair of trouser be very amusing very happy very thoughtless a rule altogether impecunious annesley have never known without mean of getting good dinner mean did not rise to purchase of new hat putting quaverdale before a example annesley must not bring to choose literature a profession thinking of when received mother letter assured that florence must not like professional literature wrote to say that must be down at buston in five day time doe not become son who be fellow of college heir to property to obey parent too quickly gave up intermediate day to thinking over condition bound to uncle to discussing prospect with quaverdale who a usual be remaining in town doing editor work for coming hour if interfered with must tell to go to bed said allusion be of course made to mr prosper be not on sort of term with must make own term then let do worst what can do if mean to withdraw beggarly two hundred fifty pound of course will do suppose do owe something in way of respect not if threatens in regard to money what doe come to that be to cringe at heel for beggarly allowance have be pleased to bestow upon without asking havery well dear fellow must say to 'you can stop moment please for certain object of own that heir might live in world after certain fashion have bestowed have be mine since be child if can reconcile to conscience to discontinue do so must find that must have to think twice about will stop what be to do then can get opening on of paper quaverdale whistled mode of receiving overture be not pleasing to annesley suppose that anything so very super human in way of intellect be required annesley have got fellowship whereas quaverdale have done nothing at university must make pair of shoe shoemaker do get good wage what do mean fellow never can get to be serious for two minute together never be more serious in life be to make shoe quite think that suppose can make 'd have first to learn trade show that be adept must show that be adept before can write for coming hour there be tone of sarcasm in be not lost on quaverdale certainly must that be better adept than who have got place other unfortunate who will have to be put out of berth coming hour only requires certain number of course there be many newspaper in london many magazine much literary work going may get share of have got to begin by shoving incompetent fellow out in order to be able to begin must learn trade how did begin just in way while be roaming about london like fine gentleman began by earning twenty four shilling week can earn twenty four shilling week wo because have already got fellowship have knack at writing greek iambic therefore got fellowship picked up at same time way of stringing english together also soon learned way to be hungry be not hungry now very often have be through belief be that must get along with editor be idea of being independent certainly be do work take pay obey order if think can do same come try there be not room here there be doubt room elsewhere there be trade to be learned like other trade belief be that even then must not do want greek iambic harry turned away disgusted quaverdale be like rest of world thought that peculiar talent peculiar tact be needed for own business harry believed that be a able to write leading article at rate a quaverdale that greek iambic must not stand in way conceived to be probable that habit of cleanliness might do so gave up idea for present thought that friend must have welcomed with open hand into realm of literature perhaps be case quaverdale attributed too much weight to knack of turning readable paragraph on subject at moment notice what must do down at buston there be three person there with whom must have to contend father mother uncle with father have always be on good term have still be subject to certain amount of gentle sarcasm have got fellowship allowance so have be lifted above father authority father thoroughly despised brother in law looked down upon a absolute as be reticent only dropping word here there out of deference perhaps to wife from feeling lest son might be deficient in wise courtesy if be encouraged to laugh at benefactor have said word two a to profession when harry left cambridge word two have come to nothing in day uncle have altogether ridiculed idea mother fond of son fellow heir have altogether opposed notion rector be idle good looking self indulgent man man who read little understood what read thought little understood what thought who took trouble about anything to go through world comfortably with rather large family rather small income be extent of ambition in regard to eldest son have begun well harry have be educated free have got fellowship have never cost father shilling now eldest of two grown up daughter be engaged to be married to son of brewer living in little town of buntingford also be piece of good luck rector accepted with thankful heart there be grown up girl also pretty then third girl not grown up two boy who be at present at school at royston thus burdened rev mr annesley went through world with a jaunty step a be possible making little of trouble anxious to make a much a must of advantage of position of harry be brightest if only harry must be careful to guard be quite out of question that must find income for harry if squire stopped two hundred fifty pound per annum at present allowed then there be harry mother who have already very frequently discounted good thing be to fall to harry lot be dear good motherly woman whose goose be certainly counted to be swan of swan harry be whitest whereas in purity of plumage mary eldest daughter who have won affection of young buntingford brewer be next that harry allowance must be stopped must be almost a great misfortune a though mr thoroughbung be to break neck out hunting with puckeridge hound amusement after manner of brewer be much in habit of following mr annesley have lived at buston life having be born at hall be excellent mother of family good clergyman wife being in respect more painstaking assiduous than husband did maintain something of respect for brother though in inmost heart knew that be fool to have be born squire of buston be something to have reached age of fifty unmarried so a to leave position of heir open to own son be more to such one great deal be due of deal harry be little disposed to pay part must be talked to very seriously talked to if possible saved from sin of offending easily offended uncle terrible idea have be suggested to lately by husband entail might be made altogether inoperative by marriage of brother be fearful notion one if entered into brother head might possibly be carried out one before have ever dreamed of anything so dangerous to annesley interest mr annesley now felt that by due submission on part of heir might be avoided squire be foe whom harry most feared quite understood that must be required to be submissive even if be willing did not know how to act part there be much now that must endure for sake of florence if mr prosper demanded that after dinner must hear sermon must sit hear out must be bore might be endured on behalf of girl whom

paused paused also have come over to buntingford to day probably in order that might congratulate at brewery on marriage with one of family then mr prosper frowned did not care for frowning will not be bad match for young lady a joshua be fairly steady brewery be worth money must have wished better brother in law said lover who be taken away from consideration of love by allusion to annesleys

great desideratum have resolved that matilda thoroughbung must be lady in spite of evil attending new connection did feel that in throwing over harry must have to abandon annesleys to draw line between with miss thoroughbung whole family of thoroughbungs generally must be too bitter against poor molly said miss thoroughbung mr prosper did not like to be called bitter in spite of importance of occasion must not show that did not like think that need talk about oh dear kate miss tickle need of be talked about mr prosper disliked familiarity especially that of being laughed at miss

happiness of life did feel that have come in right place have be intended to be said immediately after acceptance of did very well where be expressed a assured feeling of heart must draw from declaration of hers goodness gracious mr prosper sort of coyness be to have be expected therefore continued with portion of prepared word now came glibly enough to be previous portion be same to miss

consideration with said with slight air of offence be gentleman whereas miss thoroughbung be hardly lady matter of consideration money of course have be how must not consider be aware that ought not to rush on subject must leave to arrangement of lawyer expressing own view through own lawyer to be thing of most importance have feeling induced to be silent on matter so near to rushed have to be considered mr prosper be own come to very nearly one thousand year think be nine hundred seventy two pound six shilling eightpence of course when there be so much money must have to be tied up somehow mr prosper be undoubtedly disgusted if must have receded at moment must have transferred affection to miss puffle of course understand that have not accepted a yet said word of regard for went seemed a matter of importance whatever have be standing for last few minute now remained standing looking at be silent so that be obliged to speak understand between lady gentleman so circumstanced there

grey mr prosper be surprised to find that knew name of lawyer who be in truth old friend then while be still hesitating astounded nay shocked by mode of ending conference got up throwing arm round neck kissed most affectionately after that there be retreating for mr prosper immediate mode of retreat at event must only back out of room get into carriage be carried home a quickly a possible chapter xxvii proposal have never happened to before first thought came upon mr prosper when got into carriage be that have never occurred to before did not reflect that have not put in way of now strangeness of sensation overwhelmed inquired of whether be pleasant found compelled to answer question with negative must have come from not yet not yet probably for week have be done by doing of have sealed utterly a own there be getting out of now did feel that ought not to attempt to get out of after what have taken place be not sure that lady have planned with purpose be sure that strong foundation have be laid for breach of promise case if be to attempt to escape what might not jury do against giving damage out of acre of buston hall then miss thoroughbung must go over to other thoroughbungs to annesleys condition must become intolerable in moment a be driven home be not sure that have be got up a plot against by annesleys when got out of carriage matthew knew that thing have gone badly with master must not conjecture in what way matter have be fully debated in kitchen have be there decided that miss thoroughbung be certainly to be brought home a future mistress of buston step to be taken by master be not popular in buston kitchen have be there considered that master harry be to be future master by perversity of intellect have thought that must occur soon matthew be much older than squire who be hardly to be called sickly man yet matthew have made up mind that mr harry be to reign over a squire of buston when therefore tidings came that miss thoroughbung be to brought to buston a mistress there have be slight symptom of rebellion did want 'tilda thoroughbung there have own idea of lady gentleman a in such case be perfectly correct knew squire to be fool believed to be gentleman heard that miss thoroughbung be clever woman did not believe to be lady matthew have said few word to cook a to public house at stevenage have told not to be old fool that must lose money have thought of public house there have be mutinous feeling matthew helped master out of carriage then came revulsion that froth of beer barrel a matthew have dared to call have absolutely refused master mr prosper went into house very meditative sad at heart be matter almost of regret to that have not be a matthew supposed be caught bound must make best of thought of particular of proposed mode of living recapitulated to pair of pony own maid champagne fish monger bill miss tickle miss puffle must certainly not have required such expensive luxury champagne fish must require company for final consumption pony assumed tone of being quite opposed to have contemplated questioned with whether must like miss tickle a perpetual inmate have in sheer civility expressed liking for miss tickle what need must there be to married woman of miss tickle then thought of education of five six child have almost promised have suggested to simply heir just one heir so that nefarious harry might be cut out already saw that must not be enriched to extent of shilling by lady income then there must be trouble disgrace of separate purse felt that there must be disgrace in having fish champagne be consumed in own house paid for by wife without reference to what if lady have partiality for champagne knew nothing about must know nothing about except when saw in heightened color despatched crab for supper always went to bed at ten have tumbler of barley water brought to glass of barley water with just squeeze of lemon juice saw ruin before doubt be good manager must be good manager for must not be better for to stand action for breach of promise betake to miss puffle miss puffle be fifty there must be doubt that lady ought to be younger than gentleman be much distressed in mind if broke off with miss thoroughbung ought to do so at once before have have time to put matter into hand of lawyer on what plea must do before went to bed night did draw out portion of letter however be never sent dear miss thoroughbung in view promulgated morning fear that there be essential misunderstanding a to mode of life have occurred to of a be so natural at age with charm have not be slow to anticipate coming period of uncheckered delight allusion to pony carriage other incidental allusion did not think well to mention more particularly fish champagne have made clear sort of future life have pictured to yourself heaven forbid must take upon to find fault with anything so pleasant so innocent prospect of life be different in seeking honor of alliance with be looking for quiet companion in declining year might be also to mother to possible future son when honored with unmistakable sign of affection on going be just about to explain must excuse if mouth be then stopped by mutual ardor of feeling be about to say have found difficult to explain what have be about to say on next morning when time for writing have come heard news detained for day then opportunity be gone on following morning when matthew appeared at bedside with cup of tea at nine o'clock tidings be brought took in buntingford gazette came twice week a matthew laid opened unread in accustomed place gave information have doubt gotten from paper have heard sir suppose a yet heard what about miss puffle what about miss puffle have heard word what about miss puffle have be thinking that moment of miss puffle of how must be superior to miss thoroughbung in many way so that sat up in bed holding untasted tea in hand be gone off with young farmer tazlehurst miss puffle gone off with father tenant son yes indeed sir father have be quarrelling for last ten year now be off be always riding roistering about country with dog men now be gone oh heaven exclaimed squire thinking of own escape yes indeed sir there be knowing what one of be up to unless get married afore be thirty thirty five at most be most sure to get such idea into head a one can mostly approve have be intended by matthew a word of caution to master have really opposite effect resolved at moment that latter must not be said of miss thoroughbung turned out of room with flea in ear how dare speak in way of better mr puffle lady father have for many year be friend be not saying anything of lady saying that have done right of course down stair in servant hall can say what please up here in presence must not speak in such language of lady behind whose chair may be called upon to wait very well sir wo no more said matthew retiring with mock humility have shot bolt supposed successfully did not know what have taken place between master miss thoroughbung did think that speech might assist in preventing repetition of offer miss puffle gone off with tenant son news made matrimony doubly dangerous to yet robbed of chief reason by be to have be driven to send letter must not at rate now fall back upon miss puffle thought that nothing must have induced miss thoroughbung to go off with one of carter from brewery fault might have did not lie in direction champagne pony be a fault le deleterious miss puffle gone off with young tazlehurst lady of fifty with young man of twenty five reputed heiress of snickham manor be comfort to a remembered that snickham manor have be bought no longer ago than by father of present owner prospers be at buston ever since time of george first can not make silk purse out of sow ear have be ever assuring of fact be now more of fact than ever fifty year old be quite shocking with steady middle aged man like with approval of family marriage might have be thought of harum scarum young tenant son who be in respect gentleman whose only thought be of galloping over hedge ditch such idea showed state of mind well absolutely disgusted mr prosper because have grown old must not endure to think that others at age must retain smack of youth there be lady besides miss puffle who like to ride across country with young man before perhaps following never think much of fifty year news certainly brought to great change of feeling so that letter to have devoted preceding afternoon be put back into letter case be never finished mind immediately recurred to miss thoroughbung bethought that objection felt be perhaps in part frivolous at rate be better woman than miss puffle certainly must run after farmer son though might be fond of champagne be thought chiefly for other people though be ambitious of pony ambition might be checked at rate must pay for own pony whereas mr puffle be very hale old man of seventy puffle told have married young might live for next ten year twenty to mr prosper whose imagination did not fly far afield world afforded at present two lady be miss puffle miss thoroughbung a miss puffle have fallen out of running there seemed to be walk over for miss thoroughbung did think during two three day passed without farther step on part did think how might be be to remain unmarried a regarded own comfort be greatly tempted life must remain so easy to then duty demanded of that must marry be man who in honest sober talk thought much of duty be absurdly credulous a obstinate a mule did wish to do what be right have be convinced that harry annesley be false knave have be made to swear oath harry must not be heir harry have be draped in blackest color to daub of black something darker have be added by uncle memory of neglected sermon be now first duty in life to beget heir for purpose wife must be have putting aside pony champagne despatched crab sound of a coming to from miss tickle mouth be uglier than other sound still thought that miss thoroughbung must answer purpose from side there must not be making of silk purse then boy must be boy a well a hers must probably take more after father passed much of day with peerage in hand satisfied that best blood have be maintained frequently by second rate marriage health be great thing health in mother be everything who must be more healthy than miss thoroughbung then thought of warm embrace perhaps after be right that must embrace after what have said to three day only have passed by be still thinking what ought to be next step when there came to letter from messrs soames simpson attorney in buntingford have heard of messrs soames simpson have be familiar with name for last twenty year have never dreamed that own private affair must become matter of consultation in office messrs grey barry of lincoln inn be lawyer who be quite gentleman knew nothing against messrs soames simpson thought that work consisted

child buston hall must be residence of widow till eldest son must be twenty four after mr prosper must no doubt feel that client must have to provide home for messrs soames simpson did not think that there be anything in to mr prosper must object if be so must immediately prepare settlement that woman did say against after said matthew to a gave letter from lawyer to master letter made mr prosper very angry did in truth contain nothing more than repetition of very term lady have suggested coming to through local lawyer be doubly distasteful what be to do felt to be out of question to accede at

generally that hound must not have be allowed to get into covert think that outsider ever understand how essential be to maintain right be a though be individual whole county may depend upon why must be man who have got young woman to look after said molly half laughing half cry be man who first get there who ought to do said joshua man ca stop to remember whether have got young woman not think

british embassy generally mr mountjoy told grief to brother in law who thoroughly took part a did also very strongly lady mountjoy got to be generally understood that harry be mauvais sujet such be name be attached to belief so conveyed be thoroughly entertained by sir magnus have written to friend in london friend in london bore out report be so conveyed story of midnight quarrel be told in manner very prejudicial to poor harry sir magnus wife saw necessity of preserving niece from anything so evil a such marriage florence be very firm be considered to be very obstinate to mother be

before absolute disgrace of captain scarborough at rate before tidings of disgrace have reached cheltenham mr mountjoy have be still able to dream of tretton park after jew have got finger on even

be being subjected not even buston be now to belong to harry small income have received from uncle be stopped be reduced to live upon fellowship must be stopped also if married even despised because be fellow of college have looked for husband for daughter so much higher than college must produce be not from lack of motherly love that be opposed to florence from innate cruelty that handed

none have very nice private income together must have plenty must live here till have settled on apartment pair of pony must be just thing for to drive about support british interest think of dear will find that be right then florence escaped from room went up to receive much more severe lecture be to have from aunt come in dear said lady mountjoy in most austere voice have voice must assume austerity when knew power to be in ascendant a florence entered room miss abbott left by door on other side take that chair florence want to have few minute conversation with then florence sat down when young lady be thinking of being married great many thing have to be taken into consideration seemed to be so much matter of fact that florence did not feel necessary to make reply of course be aware be thinking of being married oh yes said florence to whom to harry annesley said florence intending to imply that world knew that hope not hope not indeed may say that be quite out of question in first place be beggar have begged from none said florence be what world call beggar when young man without penny think of being married be not beggar what have got will be dear be talking about what understand young lady can not give money away in manner will not be allowed mother sir magnus will permit here florence restrained drew up in chair a though prepared to speak out mind if must be driven lady mountjoy must not permit thought that must feel quite able to tell lady mountjoy that have power influence in matter determined to be silent little longer in first place gentleman who be gentleman never attempt to marry lady for money when lady have money can express much more clearly than must otherwise quite understand what mean by dear when mr annesley proposed to be acknowledged heir to uncle property trumpery affair at best of must have sufficed for then accepted that go for nothing from lady of course acceptance be contingent on circumstance be so on regard having accepted a regard remains just a warm a ever certainly will not go back because of anything uncle may do only say to explain that be quite justified in offer be not for small fortune that came to be not so sure of if money can be of use to be quite welcome to sir spoke to about pair of pony 'd rather have than pair of pony be coming to just now here be mr anderson oh be here there be certainly touch of impatience in tone in be uttered be a though have said that mr anderson have so contrived that must have doubt whatever about continued presence mr anderson have made so conspicuous a to be visible to constantly lady mountjoy who intended at present to sing mr anderson praise felt to be impertinent know what mean by mr anderson have behaved quite like gentleman ought to be very proud of token may receive of regard affection be not bound to return to be bound to think of when who be responsible for action tell to do so mamma mean mean uncle sir magnus mountjoy did not quite dare to say that have meant suppose will admit that sir magnus be competent judge of young men character may be judge of mr anderson because mr anderson be clerk there be something of intention to depreciate in word clerk florence have not thought much of mr anderson worth a far a have seen of duty generally performed at british embassy be ignorant of peculiar little nicety intricacy required residence at brussels of gentleman with tact possessed by sir magnus did not know that while mere international work of office might be safely intrusted to mr blow mr bunderdown little nicety that smiling that frowning that taking off of hat only half taking off genial easy manner that stiff hauteur formed peculiar branch of sir magnus under sir magnus of mr anderson did not understand that even to pair of pony be promised to be to be attached certain important function be to control a deputy of great man deputy now have called great man deputy clerk mr anderson be such thing said lady mountjoy young man then private secretary only somebody else be that be very impertinent very ungrateful mr anderson be second secretary of legation there be officer attached to establishment of more importance believe say on purpose to anger then compare gentleman to mr annesley man to whom one will speak will speak to have harry heard say that ought to have be happy man in spite of trouble what good can do florence nodded head almost imperceptibly still there be nod signifying more than must possibly say thought that must do world of good if be near good too though be far away if be with must hang on to arm perhaps at future time round neck tell that must be true to though others might turn away must be just a true where be though must not comfort by telling so with own word then be that resolved upon writing that letter must already have what little comfort might administer in absence now listen to florence be thorough reprobate will not hear so called be reprobate have behaved in such way that england be cry out about have done will never allow gentleman to speak to again then there will be more need that lady must do so be not true put knowledge of character against of sir magnus sir magnus doe not know gentleman do what be good of talking of aunt harry annesley have word nothing on earth will induce to go back from even be what say must be true to must certainly must must not

be very important that must write be to receive letter there must be end of be quite sure that must understand must not subject to trouble of having to tell own people that be maintaining correspondence for must amount to still when time came for answer have counted up to hour when sir magnus sent for handed to letter having discussed that question with mother fully expected felt properly grateful to uncle wanted little comfort too when have read letter knew that have received there have be few word spoken between two elder lady after interview between florence lady mountjoy be most self willed young woman said lady mountjoy of course love lover said mr mountjoy desirous of making excuse for own daughter girl be very troublesome not le daughter know of that who be worth

sum from brother when at last be summoned home be penniless have pocket be still full of money may be doubted whether must have come although understood perfectly importance of matter on have be recalled have be sent for in order that might receive from mr grey clear statement of what be intended to do in reference to payment of money to creditor mr grey have in first place endeavored to

be doubt about that be only place for so spoke septimus jones who though confidential friend be not admitted to post of confidential adviser augustus liked to have depositary for resolution must admit advice septimus jones have become so much creature that have to obey in thing be apt to think that man may be disposed of by being made to go abroad if be absolutely penniless useless by being sent to colony that may become shepherd drink out of world to kill man so that may be no longer nuisance be perhaps chief object in case be not easy to get captain to go abroad unless indeed be sent back to

die father must die very shortly must like to see out a told mr grey with wish there be longing also for company of florence mountjoy used to tell in moment of sad thought thought serious a well a sad

conversation have sprung up about going to brussels south america mountjoy have suggested loan will pay fare to rio give order on banker there mountjoy have replied that must not at suit purpose then augustus have felt that must be almost better to send brother even to brussels than to keep concealed in london have be there now for three four day even in respect of maintenance have become burden pretty little dinner have to be found day be eaten by captain alone when left alone without attempt at apology on part augustus have begun with intention of exhibiting mode of life must let brother

told that for present tretton must be best home for will do what can to make happy will not see card squire have said be not want of card prevented mountjoy feeling on part that for future there must be nothing war between father be out of question that must accept father hospitality without telling of intention did not know father well enough to feel that declaration must not affect at have therefore declined then harry annesley name be mentioned think have done for fellow said augustus what have done have cooked goose in first place uncle have stopped allowance in second place old fellow be going to marry wife at rate have quarrelled with master harry outrance master harry have gone back to parental parsonage be there eating bread of affliction drinking water of poverty flossy

cut off chapter xxxviii scarborough correspondence be a mountjoy have said squire have written to letter inviting to tretton telling that must be best home for till death must have put tretton into other hand mountjoy have thought matter over sitting in easy chair in brother room have at last declined invitation a letter be emblematic of man may be a well to give to reader dear father think will suit to go down to tretton at present mind card doubt that must make better than place to tell truth believe word of what have told to world about mother of day mean to have out with augustus will not sit quietly by see tretton taken out of mouth therefore think have better not go to tretton yours truly mountjoy scarborough have not at surprised father have not in least angered rather liked son for standing up for mother be by mean offended at expression of son incredulity what be there in prospect of future lawsuit to prevent son coming to tretton there need be word spoken a to property tretton must be infinitely more comfortable than room in victoria street be aware that hospitality of victoria street must not be given in ungrudging spirit must like said old squire to a lay quiet on sofa must like at to be humble guest of augustus augustus must certainly say nasty word two old man knew younger son well have known too character of elder son have not calculated enough on change must have be made by such revelation a father have made to mountjoy have felt that world be against that a best might must make use of world excepting only father who of world be falsest most cruel a for brother must bleed brother to very last drop without compunction bottle of champagne came into house be to mountjoy thinking own bought with money therefore fit to be enjoyed by a for father doubted whether must remain with father without flying at throat old man decidedly preferred elder son of two have found that augustus must not bear success have first come to dislike then to hate what have not done for augustus with what return doubt augustus have till spring of present year be kept in background injury have come to from that father of own good will with infinite labor successful ingenuity have struggled to put back in place have be taken from augustus might not unnaturally have expressed a angry have not done so have made persistently disagreeable have continued to show that be waiting impatiently for father death have come to pas at last meeting have hardly scrupled to tell father that world must be world for till father have left be reward old man received for having struggled to provide handsomely luxuriously for son still made son sufficient allowance befitting heir of man of large property have resolved never to see again be true that almost hated thoroughly despised since departure mysterious disappearance of eldest son regard for sinner have returned have become apparently hopeless gambler debt have be paid repaid at last squire have learned that mountjoy owed so much on post obit that farther payment of be impossibility there be way of saving to save property must undo doings of early youth prove that elder son be illegitimate have still kept proof did to great disgust of mr grey to dismay of creditor to incredulous wonder of augustus almost to annihilation of mountjoy have done there have be nothing in mountjoy conduct have in truth wounded mountjoy vice have be dangerous destructive absurdly foolish not to father shame ridiculed gambling a source of excitement man must win much without dishonest practice fraud at card must certainly be detected did not on account hate card there be reason why mountjoy must not become to a pleasant companion a ever for few day might be left to if only must come when asked refused to come when squire received letter above given be not in least angry with son simply determined if possible that must be brought to tretton mountjoy debt must now be paid something if possible must be done for be so angry with augustus that must if possible revoke last decision that ala must be impossible sir william brodrick have when last saw expressed hope not of recovery be by admitted to be impossible of continuance in land of living for three month perhaps six a sir william have finally suggested opening out a seemed to think indefinite hope most wonderful constitution mr scarborough ever saw in life have never known dog even so cut about yet bear scarborough bowed smiled accepted compliment must have taken hat off head have be practice to wear hat in sitting room mr merton have gone farther of course did not mean said to set up opinion against sir william if mr scarborough must live strictly by rule mr merton did not see why three month six must be end of mr scarborough have replied that must not undertake to live precisely by rule mr merton have shaken head from time forth mr scarborough did endeavor to obey injunction given to have something worth doing in six month now offered to have heard lately very much of story of harry annesley have expressed great anger at ill usage to that young man have be subjected have come to ear that be intended that harry must lose property have expected that have already lost immediate income have come to through mr merton between whom augustus scarborough there be close friendship squire understood florence mountjoy have be cause of harry misfortune recognized a fact that son mountjoy be unfit to marry young lady starvation must assuredly stare such young lady in face not le be acerbated disgusted at idea that augustus must endeavor to take young lady to what have exclaimed to mr merton want property girl there be nothing on earth that doe not want greater impropriety in craving stronger craving then picked up by degree detail of midnight feud between harry mountjoy set to work to undermine augustus have steadily carried out plan for settling with creditor with aid of mr grey have a thought already concluded that business conjunction with augustus have be necessary have be obtained be not too much to say that at present moment of life idea of doing injury to augustus be one object exercised mr scarborough mind since have fallen into business relation with younger son have become convinced that more detestable young man did not exist reader will perhaps agree with mr scarborough can hardly be hoped that must entertain opinion a strongly augustus be now recognized eldest legitimate son of squire a property be entailed must doubt belong to squire be turning in mind mean of depriving condition a far a be possible of glory when have first heard of injury have be done to harry annesley thought that must leave to hero furniture gem book wine cattle be accumulated at tretton augustus must have bare acre still barer house nothing else in thinking of have be actuated by conviction that must be useless for to leave to mountjoy might be left to mountjoy must in fact be left to creditor therefore harry annesley with injury have be felt to be proper recipient not of squire bounty of result of hatred for son to run counter to law have ever be chief object of squire ambition to arrange everything so that must be seen that have set law at defiance have be great pride have done so notably with astonishing astuteness in reference to wife two son now there have come up condition of thing in must again show cleverness augustus have be most anxious to get up post obit bond creditor held feeling a father well understood that must thus prevent from making farther inquiry when squire must have died why must stir in matter by going to law when there must be nothing to be gained bond have now be redeemed be in possession of mr grey have be bought up nominally by must be given to mr grey at rate must have proof that have be satisfied must not be used again to gratify spite augustus might entertain captain therefore must now enjoy property might be left to of course must all go to gaming table might even yet be better to leave to harry annesley blood be thicker than water though be blood of bastard must do good turn for harry in way furniture gem money must again be future property of mountjoy in order that might be effected before died must not let grass grow under foot thought of promised three month with possible extension to six a suggested by sir william sir william say three month said to mr merton speaking in easiest way of possibility of living said six ah be if do what be told will not exactly do three six must be same only for little bit of business want to get through sir william order must include abandonment of business le done better then see why sir william must limit to six month think that three will nearly suffice man doe not want to die suppose said merton there be various way of looking at question replied squire many men desire prolongation of life a lengthened period of enjoyment there be perhaps something of feeling with when see how far be crippled curtailed how enjoyment be confined to breathing air to eating drinking to occasional reading of few page must admit that there can not be much of that conversation with be best of want to live for sake of wife child in ordinary acceptation of word be over with many desire to live because fear to die there be nothing of in can assure be not afraid to meet creator there be who wish for life that purpose of love stronger purpose of hatred may be accomplished be among number on account only wish till purpose have be completed think will go to sleep for hour there be couple of letter want to write before post time then mr scarborough turned round thought of letter be to write mr merton went out a wandered about park in dirt slush of december tried to make up mind whether most admired patron philosophy condemned general lack of principle at proper hour appeared again found mr scarborough quite alert know whether will have three month unless behave better said have be thinking about letter very nearly made attempt to write there be thing about son father doe wish to communicate to one merton only shook head be not bit afraid of do care for knowing what have to say there be word must be difficult even to write almost impossible to dictate did make attempt though did not find able to say that have intended first letter be to lawyer dear mr grey will be surprised at writing to summon once again to bedside think there be kind of promise made that request must not be repeated circumstance be of such nature well know how to avoid however if refuse to come will give instruction be purpose to make will to leave everything that be capable of leaving to son mountjoy be aware that be now free from debt capable of enjoying property that may posse a circumstance be at present must on death be absolutely penniless heaven help man who must find dependent on mercy of augustus scarborough what posse must be balance at bank house in town everything contained in about tretton a to must wish that will must be very explicit in making understood that conceivable item of property be to belong to mountjoy know strength of entail not for world must venture to meddle with anything so holy there came grin of satisfaction over face a uttered word scribe be utterly unable to keep from laughing a augustus must have acre let have bare underscore word if please word be underscored if have time must have tree about place cut down think must under entail said merton must use up stick in building farmer barn mending farmer gate must cover acre just in front of house with huge conservatory respect law boy must find difficult to prove have gone beyond there be time for kind of finished revenge then went on with letter will understand what mean wish to divide property so mountjoy may have everything be not strictly entailed will of course say that will go to gambling table may go to devil so augustus doe not have need not go to gambling table if must consent to come down to once more might possibly devise scheme for saving whether can do so not be request that last will may be prepared in accordance with instruction very faithfully yours john scarborough now for other said mr scarborough have not better rest bit asked merton be kind of work at man doe not want to rest be carried on by own solicitude own eagerness will be very short when be done then perhaps may sleep second letter be a follows dear mountjoy think be foolish in allowing to be prevented from coming here by sentiment in truth independently of pleasure must derive from company wish to be here on matter of business be of importance to yourself be about to make new will although be bound to pay respect to entail must not for world do anything in opposition to law still may be enabled to do something for benefit brother have kindly interfered for payment of creditor a outstanding bond have be redeemed must now by generosity be enabled to enjoy property might be left to there be few table chair at disposal gem two odd volume perhaps might like to posse have written to mr grey on subject must wish to see might do whether come here not le wish that must come affectionate father john scarborough think that odd volume will fetch be always fond of literature suppose mean entire library replied merton like table chair think will come look after table chair why not bed washhand stand said mr merton well yes may have bed washhand stand mountjoy be not fool will understand very well what mean wonder whether must scrape paper off drawing room wall leave scrap to brother without interfering with entail now be tired will rest did not even then go to rest lay still scheming scheming scheming about property there be now letter to be written for writing of must not again summon mr merton be half ashamed to do so at last sent for sister martha said want to write letter for mr merton have be writing letter for morning be just reason why must write one now be still in slight degree afraid of authority be not at afraid of yours ought to be quiet john indeed ought in order may be quiet must write letter be nothing particular must not have asked to do be only invitation invitation to ask somebody here yes to ask somebody to come here know whether will come do know hope may if come be very good looking young man if be anything talk nonsense john believe be engaged to young lady with whom must beg not to interfere remember florence florence mountjoy of course remember own niece young man be engaged to be intended for poor mountjoy poor mountjoy have put beyond possibility of wife poor mountjoy soft hearted aunt almost shed tear have to do with mountjoy now sit down there begin 'dear mr annesley ' oh be mr annesley be yes be mr annesley be handsome young man have objection only people do say what do say of course know only have heard that be scoundrel scoundrel be very strong said old lady shocked villain liar thief rest of be what have heard will tell who have be informant first second hand have come to from mr augustus scarborough now will begin again 'dear mr annesley ' old lady paused moment then setting firmly to task commenced finished letter a follows dear mr annesley spent few day here on one occasion want to renew pleasure visit gave will extend kindness so far a to come to tretton for time may please to name beyond two three day be sorry to say that friend augustus scarborough can not be here to meet other son mountjoy may be here if wish to escape will endeavor so to fix time when will have heard from think there need be ill blood there of did anything of be probably ashamed though a old man be bound to express disapproval surely must be ashamed said miss scarborough never mind believe know nothing about then went on with letter be not merely for pleasure of society that ask have word to say to may be important yours faithfully john scarborough chapter xxxix how letter be received must now describe feeling of mr scarborough correspondent a received letter when mr grey begun to read that be addressed to declared that on consideration must go down to tretton when came to inquire within a to objection found that lay chiefly in great dislike to augustus scarborough for poor mountjoy a called entertained feeling of deep pity pity know be akin to love for squire in heart felt little of profound dislike be aware such conduct a squire ought to have generated be greatest rascal that ever knew said again again to dolly to mr barry yet did not regard a honest man regard rascal be angry with in consequence knew that there remained with even spark of love for mr scarborough to be inexplicable from moment in have first admitted fact that augustus scarborough be true heir at law have be most determined in taking care that heirship must be established must be known to men that mountjoy be not eldest son of father a law required to be for inheritance of property augustus be eldest son in arranging that truth must be notorious have come to pas that have learned to hate augustus with intensity have redounded to advantage of mountjoy father must be so augustus must become augustus scarborough esquire of tretton worse luck for tretton connected with mr grey did resolve that when day must come relation between tretton must cease have never occurred to that by redeeming post obit bond mountjoy must become capable of owning enjoying property might be left to with tretton belonging of tretton in old fashioned way must of course go to heir belonging of tretton be personal property must in amount to wealth for younger son that mr scarborough must in way be able to bequeath might probably be worth thirty thousand pound out of proceeds of real property debt have be paid because augustus have consented so to pay be now to be mulcted of loose belonging gave charm to tretton because augustus have paid mountjoy debt mountjoy be to be enabled to rob augustus there be wickedness in redolent of old squire be wickedness in arranging mr grey hesitated to participate a thought of however must not feel what very clever man have for client will go to gambling table of course said that night to dolly be affair of ours when lawyer be consulted have to think of prudent imprudent disposition of property mr scarborough have consulted papa must look at a though have tell what intends to do be bound to give advice can not advise to bestow thing on augustus whom regard a long way worst of family need not care about here again continued mr grey come up question what be that duty demand augustus be eldest son be entitled to what law allots mountjoy be brought up a eldest son be certainly entitled to what provision father can make can not provide for such gambler know that come within duty be not fault that mountjoy be gambler more than that be fault that augustus be beast gambler beast there be moreover nothing will turn squire from purpose be only tool in hand trowel for laying of mortar brick of course must draw will will do with pleasure because will dispossess augustus then mr grey went to bed a did also dolly be not at surprised at being summoned to couch after have be hour in own bed think will go down to tretton said mr grey declared that must never go there again so did did not know then how much might come to hate augustus scarborough must go to tretton merely to injure said daughter have be thinking about said mr grey know must go simply to do injury think must go to see justice be properly done can be arranged without going to tretton by putting head together think can contrive that deed will be more effectually performed what must attempt to do be to save property from going to gambling table there be only one way occurs to what be that must be left to wife have wife must be left to woman whom will consent to marry there be three object to keep from augustus to give enjoyment of to mountjoy to prevent mountjoy from gambling with only thing can see be wife there be girl want to marry said dolly doe want to marry doubt whether can be got to marry one else there be still peck of difficulty oh papa wish must wash hand of scarboroughs must go to tretton first said now dear be doing good by sitting up here talking to then with smile dolly took off to own chamber mountjoy when got letter be sitting over late breakfast in victoria street be near twelve o'clock be enjoying delicious luxury of having breakfast to eat with cigar after nothing else that need do fruition of comfort be somewhat marred by knowledge that have such dinner to expect must go out look for dinner among eating house next morning must bring breakfast if be to remain longer in victoria street must do so in direct opposition to owner of establishment have that morning received notice to quit have be told that following breakfast must be last meal served to let be good of kind mountjoy have said believe care for nothing eating drinking there be little else that can do for so have parted mountjoy have taken precaution of having letter addressed to house of friendly bootmaker now a be slowly pouring out first cup of coffee thinking how nearly must be last father letter be brought to letter have be delayed one day a have omitted to call for be necessarily sad time for be man who fought hard against melancholy taking a primary rule of life that for one a have become pleasure of immediate moment must suffice if one day better still one night of excitement be in store for next day must be regarded a unlimited future for man can be responsible such philosophy will too frequently be insufficient for stoutest heart mountjoy heart must occasionally almost give way then thought must be dreary enough hunger absolute hunger without assured expectation of food have never yet come upon in order to put stop to craving if must find troublesome to bear have already provided with pistol bullet now with cup of coffee before aromatic creamy hot with filleted sole rolled up before on little dish three four plover egg on to finish lying by on distance of table chasse of brandy of already well knew virtue got father letter did not at first open disliking thought a to father then gradually tore envelope be slow in understanding full meaning of last line did not at once perceive irony of brother kindly interference of generosity have enabled mountjoy to be recipient of property father purposed to do something for benefit gradually dawned upon that father must only do that something effectually because of brother dealing with creditor then chair table gem two odd volume one by one made intelligible that father must write so to one son must so write of be marvellous then father be marvellous man whose character be only beginning to understand father told have fortunately taken into head to hate augustus intended in consequence to strip tretton property generally of outside personal belonging yes thought that with object before must certainly go see mr grey if mr grey must so advise must go down to tretton on such business a must consent to see father did not think that just at present need have recourse to pistol for device must not on very day go to tretton a must be necessary that must write to father first brother must probably extend hospitality for couple of day when must hear of proposed journey if not must lend money for present purpose under existing circumstance might probably be able to borrow from mr grey with heart elevated to almost absolute bliss ate breakfast drank chasse smoked cigar then rose slowly that might proceed to mr grey chamber at moment augustus came in have only breakfasted at own club much le comfortably than must have done at home in order that might not sit at table with brother have now returned so that might see to mountjoy departure after augustus be going down to tretton said elder brother a folded up father letter what argument have old man used now mountjoy did not think well to tell brother exact nature of argument used therefore put letter into pocket wish to say something to about property said mountjoy then idea of old squire scheme fell with crushing weight of anticipated sorrow on augustus in moment occurred to what father might do what injury might inflict saddest of feeling there came immediate reflection that have be rendered possible by own doings with conviction so much might be left away from there came also farther feeling that after there be chance that father have invented story of brother illegitimacy that mountjoy be now free from debt that tretton with belonging might now go back to that father must do if be possible did not doubt from week to week have waited impatiently for father demise have expected little none of mental activity father have exercised what fool have be said to sitting opposite to mountjoy who in vacancy of moment have lighted cigar what as have played card better have comforted flattered cosseted old man mountjoy might have gone own way to dog now at best tretton must come to stripped of everything at worst tretton must come to at well what be going to do said roughly think will probably go down just see governor feeling about mother then be blown to wind feeling about mother be not blown to wind at to speak of to must be wasting breath have pleasure of knowing said augustus be not aware that did great kindness in bringing into world do go to tretton afternoon probably not to morrow possibly to morrow said mountjoy because will find convenient to have room to day of course can not stir to morrow morning must at rate like to have breakfast here paused for reply none came from brother must have money to go down to tretton with suppose can lend just for present not shilling said augustus in thorough ill humor will be able to pay very shortly not shilling return have have from for have done be not of nature to make do more if have ever thought that have expended sovereign except for object of furthering plot of own must have be grateful a be know that owe very much to other then left room getting into cab went away to lincoln inn harry annesley received mr scarborough letter down at buston be much surprised by have not spent winter hitherto very pleasantly uncle have never seen though have heard from day to day sundry story of wooing have soon given up hunting feeling ashamed in present nameless position to ride joshua thoroughbung horse have taken to hard reading hard reading have failed have be given up to misery of position hard reading have be continued for fortnight three week during have at rate respected in evil hour have allowed to escape from now be again miserable then invitation from tretton have be received have got letter 't be from mr scarborough of tretton what doe mr scarborough say want to go down there do know mr scarborough believe have altogether quarrelled with son oh yes have quarrelled with augustus have have encounter with mountjoy not on most friendly term father mountjoy seem to be reconciled can see letter at rate will go there to mr annesley senior have objection to make chapter xl visitor at tretton so happened that three visitor who have be asked to tretton agreed to go on same day there be indeed reason why harry must delay visit much why other two must expedite theirs mr grey knew that thing if done at must be done at once mountjoy a have agreed to accept father offer must not put too quickly under shelter of father roof can have twenty pound mr grey have said when subject of money be mooted will suffice mountjoy have said that must suffice amply then returning to brother room have waited there with what patience possessed till sallied forth to continental to get best dinner restaurant must afford be beginning to feel that life be very sad in london to look forward to glade of tretton with anticipation of rural delight went down by same train with mr grey great grind a mountjoy called when mr grey proposed departure at ten o'clock harry followed so a to reach tretton only in time for dinner if may venture to advise said mr grey in train must do in matter father asked hereupon mountjoy frowned be anxious to make provision for be not grateful to father if mean that be hard to say whether must be grateful from first have done best must for according to light believe about mother do be difference think that augustus belief story be undoubtedly true must excuse if will not accept at rate have parted with share in property share be whole after father

with that old friend like miss tickle ought not to be separated be a though there be dislike between because have already said that find miss tickle charming d miss tickle said whereupon rector looked astonished miss thoroughbung jumped foot from off ground beg lady pardon said mr prosper piteously miss thoroughbung yours mr annesley be a though new revelation of character have be given one except matthew have ever heard squire of buston swear with cursings have be by mean frequent have be addressed generally to article of clothing to morsel of food prepared with le than usual care now oath have be directed against female chosen friend of betrothed have be uttered in presence of clergyman brother in law rector of parish mr prosper felt that be disgraced forever must have overheard laughing over ebullition in drawing room hour afterward almost praising violence part of pain might have be removed a be felt at time that be disgraced forever will return to subject when next meet said miss thoroughbung be very sorry must so far have forgotten said mr prosper doe not signify not a far a be concerned made little motion to clergyman half bow half courtesy mr annesley bowed in return a though declaring that did signify very much a far a be concerned then left room matthew handed into carriage when took pony in hand with quite a much composure a though friend have not be sworn at upon word sir said prosper a soon a door be shut beg pardon be so moved by certain thing have occurred that be carried much beyond usual habit mention be peculiarly distressing to that must have be induced to forget in presence of clergyman of parish brother in law must beg to forget certainly will tell now why have come over can assure that such be not habit continued mr prosper who be thinking much more of unaccustomed oath have sworn than of brother in law visit strange a be one a rule be more guarded in expression than be how must have come to pas be so stirred can hardly tell miss thoroughbung have said certain word have moved very much have called peter deary have spoken of a keeping company with disgusting term of endearment must not repeat to brother in law felt necessary to allude to trust that may be happy with when be wife ca say really know be very important step to take at age be not quite sure must be doing wisely be not too late said mr annesley know ca quite say then mr prosper drew up remembering that must not become to discus matter of marriage with father of heir have come over here said mr annesley to say few word about harry mr prosper again drew up of course be aware that harry be at present living with here mr prosper bowed of course in altered circumstance will not do that will be idle yet doe not like to take final step without

have taken in hand political project of much importance again mr prosper bowed now have offered place of private secretary on condition that harry will undertake to stay entire term be to have salary of three hundred year travelling expense will of course be paid for if go poor boy will in probability remain in new home become citizen of united state under circumstance have thought best to step up tell in friendly manner what plan be then have told tale mr prosper again bowed rector have be very crafty there be doubt about wealthy gentleman with american project salary have be offered in other respect there have be exaggeration be well known to rector mr prosper regarded america institution with religious hatred american be to ignorant impudent foul mouthed fraudulent creature to have acquaintance with whom be disgrace must have have way must have reconstituted united state a british colony at moment notice be to die without having begotten heir buston must become property of harry annesley must be dreadful to to think that buston must be owned by american citizen salary offered be too good to be abandoned said mr annesley when saw effect story have produced everything be going against exclaimed mr prosper well will not talk about did not come here to discus harry sin for matter of virtue felt must be improper to let go upon journey without communicating with so saying took departure walked back to rectory chapter xlv determined young lady when offer have be made to harry annesley found to be absolutely necessary that must write farther letter to florence be quite aware that have be forbidden to write have written one letter since order have be given to reply have come to have not expected reply still silence have be grievous to might be that be angry with really

said said truly that ministerial house be large at last declared honest truth sister in law have be very kind to about money have said not word on troubled subject since arrival mr mountjoy with delicacy still belongs to english lady must have suffered extreme poverty rather than have spoken on matter in truth suffered nothing hardly thought about sir magnus be grateful told that if went to look for lodging must go to lodging say that be not wanted therefore mr mountjoy remained where be entertaining feeling of increased good will toward sir magnus life went on rather sadly with florence anderson be a good a word pleaded own cause farther telling sir magnus lady mountjoy of pledge have made did in fact tell two three other person regarding a martyr to chivalry time went about business looking very wretched though did not speak for must not hinder others from speaking for sir magnus took occasion to say word on subject once daily to niece mother be constant in attack lady mountjoy be severest of three be accounted by florence a bitterest enemy word passed between be not most affectionate in world lady mountjoy must call beiss ' to florence must reply by addressing aunt a bey lady ' why do call lady ' be usual in common conversation why do call ' if cease to call ' will cease to call lady ' reverence be paid by girl to wife of british minister be that lady mountjoy specially felt a complained to companion miss abbott then cause for trouble sprang up during winter of mention must be made farther on result be that florence be instant with mother to take back to england will return however to harry annesley give letter verbatim wrote to florence dear florence wonder whether ever think of ever remember that exist know do can not have be forgotten like be truest girl that ever owned to loving man there come chill across heart when think how long be since wrote to have not have line even to acknowledge letter bade not to write have not even forgiven for disobeying order can not get stupid idea into mind one word from must dissipate now however must write again order order between man woman circumstanced a thing will arise make incumbent on one other to write be absolutely necessary that must now know what be intention understand reason have actuated have found left in most unfortunate condition by uncle folly be going on with stupid marriage for purpose of disinheriting have in mean time stopped allowance have made since left college of course have absolute claim on can not understand how can reconcile to do so when prevented going to bar saying that must be unnecessary so be be driven to look about for myself be very hard at time of life to find opening in profession think told before have idea of going to cambridge endeavoring to get pupil trusting to fellowship rather than to acquirement have always looked upon with great dislike must only have taken to if nothing else be to be have now there have come forward old college acquaintance man who be three four year senior who have offered to take to america a private secretary proposes to remain there for three year of course will not bind to stay a long may not improbably do so be to pay expense to give salary of three hundred year will perhaps lead to nothing else will for present be better than nothing be to start in just month from present time now know except that man name be sir william crook be decent sort of fellow have got wife who be to go with be hardest working man know between will never set thames on fire if thames be to be illumined at rather think that will be expected to do now own one what be to say about of a husband be to be will wait at rate for three year with conviction that three year will too probably end in having to wait again do feel that in altered position ought to give back troth tell that thing will be a used to be before happy night at mr armitage party know that be clearly duty almost think that be be sure of that be one thing in world can not do think that man ought to be asked to tear altogether in piece because one have ill treated at rate can not if say that must be so will say suppose will kill will go long way in writing so far have not said word of love because a far a understand be subject on expect to be silent when order not to write suppose intend be to write love letter therefore will take simply a matter of business a such suppose will acknowledge in way will at rate see handwriting yours affectionately harry annesley harry when have written letter considered that have be cold calm philosophical must not go to america for three year without telling of purpose must mention that purpose a thought in language le glowing florence when received did not regard in same light to thinking letter be full of love of love expressed in warmest possible language sir william crook said to herself what can want of harry in america for three year be sure be stupid man will wait of course will wait what be three year why must not wait for matter of then thought came into mind even to herself must not express in word sir william crook have got wife why must not harry take wife also did not see why private secretary must not be married man a for money there must be plenty for such style of life a must live must not exactly propose thought that if be to see harry just for one short interview before started that might probably then propose thing be a used to be exclaimed to herself never thing can not be a used to be know what be duty be duty not to think of anything of kind remember that exists said turning back to earlier word of letter of course be joke wonder whether know that moment of life be devoted to of course bade not to write can tell now have never gone to bed without letter beneath pillow much more of same kind be uttered in soliloquy need not be repeated at length to reader have to think what step must first take must tell mother of harry intention have never for instant allowed mother to think that affection have dwindled purpose failed be engaged to marry harry annesley marry day must that mother must be sure of be immediate purpose of life in carrying out that purpose must acquaint mother with news letter have brought to mamma have got something to tell well dear harry annesley be going to america there be something pleasing to mr mountjoy in sound of word if harry annesley went to america might be drowned might more probably be that must never come back america be to imagination long way off lover did not go to america except with intention of deserting ladylove such be idea felt at moment that florence must be more easily approached in reference either to cousin mountjoy to mr anderson lover have sprung up too in brussels of whom word will be said by by if harry pernicious harry must have taken to america chance of three gentleman must be improved one of must now be accepted by mr mountjoy a bar fatal to harry annesley mountjoy be again favorite with have heard that have returned to tretton be living amicably with father knew even of income allotted to for present of six hundred pound year have told florence that a preliminary income be more than double that two hundred fifty pound have be taken away from harry taken away never to be restored there be not much in argument still thought well to use captain be living with father did not believe word about entail having be done away with be certain that harry uncle have quarrelled with did understand that baby at buston must altogether rob harry of chance then look at difference in property be thus that argued matter in truth word have be pledged to mountjoy scarborough mountjoy scarborough have ever be favorite with though must talk about money be not money that touched feeling well may go to america be dreadful destiny for young man in case may be best thing that can do of course intends to come back again be a may be understand what mean by dreadful destiny mamma see that be destiny at be getting very good offer for year two think best to take might go with for matter thunder bolt have fallen at mr mountjoy foot florence go with to america among trial have come upon with reference to young man there have be nothing so bad a proposal go with young man be to start in month then began to think whether must be within power to stop daughter what must all world be to with one daughter in america married to harry annesley quarrel with florence be not at a be quarrel of lady mountjoy lady mountjoy must be glad to get rid of girl whom thought to be impertinent believed to be false to mother florence be very apple of eye be because thought that mountjoy scarborough be grand fellow because thought manner of evil of harry annesley that wished florence to marry cousin to separate forever from other when have heard that harry be to go to america have rejoiced a though be to be transported to botany bay idea be old fashioned when be hinted that florence be to go with nearly fell to ground florence certainly have behaved badly in making suggestion have not intended to make have not in truth thought of when mother talked of harry destiny a though terrible evil have come upon a though be speaking of poor wretch condemned to be hanged when chance of reprieve be over then spirit rose within have not meant to say that be going harry have never asked to go if talk of destiny be quite prepared to share with be meaning mother already saw only child in hand of american savage threw on to sofa buried face in hand burst into tear say that be going mamma darling dearest child only that there be reason why must except that must not suit at least suppose must not have said so have said nothing about thank heaven for doe not intend to rob of child mamma be to be wife be that want to make understand know nothing of character nothing do know that told base falsehood nothing of kind will not admit be of use going into again there be nothing base about have got appointment in united state be going out to do work have not asked to go with two thing must probably not be compatible here mr mountjoy rose from sofa embraced child a though liberated from deepest grief mamma must remember have given word will never be induced to abandon here mother threw up hand again began to weep to day to morrow ten year hence if will wait a long will will be married a far a can see need not wait ten year perhaps more than one two money will suffice for proposes to live upon proposes nothing of kind be going to america because will not propose be proposing just at present at rate be glad of now mamma must take back home a soon a possible when have started mamma must be there before start can not let go without seeing if be to remain here here must come uncle must never receive must receive be dreadful flying into actual disobedience did mean where be to receive how must receive young man in opposition to wish indeed to command of friend be not going to be at shamefaced about mamma be woman have selected to be wife be man have selected to be husband if be coming must go to uncle ask to have received

see harry annesley before start for america so interview be ended mr mountjoy be left greatly in doubt a to what might best do felt sure be annesley to come to brussels florence must see must see in spite of that uncle aunt mr anderson m grascour must do to prevent reprobate young man must force way into embassy florence must force way out in case there must be terrible scene if be to take florence back to cheltenham interview to extent must be arranged for at house of mr armitage a thought of idea came across that when young girl be determined to be married nothing can prevent florence in mean time wrote immediate answer to lover a follows dear harry of course be entitled to write when there be something to be said be necessary must know when have simply to say that love know well enough without farther telling go to america for three year be very very serious of course must know best will not attempt to interfere what be three year to if be rich people of course must not wait a be poor of course must act a do other people who be poor have about four hundred year be for to say how far may be sufficient if think so will not find that will want more there be one thing necessary before start must see there be reason on earth for remaining here except mamma have not made up mind if will consent to go back before start will be best so otherwise must take trouble to come here where be afraid will not be received a welcome guest have told mamma that if can not see here in manner be becoming will go out meet in street in manner be unbecoming affectionate wife be to be florence mountjoy letter took to mother read aloud to in own room mr mountjoy must only implore that might not be sent prevailed not at there be not word in about love said florence be simply

signify to that must accept love a thing of must have doubt ah miss mountjoy continued if must allow to say that since have be at brussels not day have passed in mingled love respect have not grown within bosom have sat by watched while excellent young friend mr anderson have endeavored to express feeling have said to myself must bide time if must give to why then aspiration must be quenched

be alone left room house making way into park walked round twice turning in mind success want of success for in truth be not at dispirited by what have occurred with other belgian lover be with mr anderson florence have at rate succeeded in making truth appear to be truth did believe that have taken fancy to fellow harry annesley that there must be overcoming have got glimpse into firmness of character be denied to m grascour m grascour a walked up down shady path of park told that such event a so called love on part of florence be very common in life of english young lady be best in world said to make most charming wife education be such that there be preventing accident passion displayed in young lady word attributed solely to power of expression one girl must use language such a have be hers girl must be clever eloquent brave girl must hum haw with yes quarter of must mean just same thing did not doubt that have engaged to harry annesley did doubt that have be brought to brussels to break off engagement thought most probable that friend must prevail under circumstance why must despair why rather a be man not given to despair must not think that there be for reasonable chance of success must show to be devoted true not easily repressed have used did not doubt same sort of language in silencing anderson mr anderson have accepted word knew too well value of word coming from young lady mouth to take at true meaning have at interview affected certain amount of intimacy with florence of thought that appreciated value have told that must kill of course in joke joke from girl on occasion be worth much belgian girl must have joked then be anxious to marry florence because florence be english therefore when went back to own home directed that system of high polish must be continued with boot suppose will come again florence have said to mother misunderstanding character of latest lover quite a widely a misunderstood hers m grascour though did not absolutely renew offer at once gave to be understood that did not at withdraw from contest obtained permission from lady mountjoy to be constantly at embassy succeeded even in obtaining promise of support from sir magnus be quite up tree sir magnus have said to secretary of legation be clear wo look at have pledged to abstain said poor anderson in tone seemed to confess that chance be over with suppose must marry one see why grascour must not have a good chance a anderson have stalked away brooding over injustice of position declaring to that belgian must never be allowed to marry florence mountjoy in peace m grascour continued attention be have induced florence to tell mother that belgian be great trouble ought to be avoided by return to england chapter xlvii florence bid farewell to lover mamma have not better take back to cheltenham at once have that unfortunate young man written to yes young man whom call unfortunate have written of course can not agree to have so called to tell truth think be so very unfortunate have got girl who really love think be step to happiness word of be said by florence a though with purpose of provoking mother so did mr mountjoy feel behind purpose there be that other fixed resolution to get harry at last accepted a husband perhaps mean taken be best mr mountjoy be already beginning to feel that there must be nothing for to give up battle to open motherly arm to harry annesley sir magnus have told that m grascour must probably prevail m grascour be said to be exactly man likely to be effective with girl a florence have be last opinion expressed by sir magnus mr mountjoy have found no comfort in florence be going to have own way mother knew that be so be very unhappy be still anxious to continue weak ineffective battle be very impertinent of writing said when be going to america for year dear mamma do put in place how be possible that must not write young man have business to come insinuate into family in way then when know be not welcome to open correspondence mamma know that be welcome if have gone to america without writing to oh must have be impossible must have gone after never be quite in earnest mamma be good talking about what must not have taken place ought to have prevented from receiving sending letter here mr mountjoy touched on subject on practice of english world have be much altered during last thirty forty year perhaps may say fifty sixty year fifty year ago young lady be certainly not allowed to receive letter a chose to write to demand that practice must be carried on without supervision from elder friend be now usually case that do so young lady before fall into correspondence with young man be expected to let be understood that doe so doe not expect that letter coming going will be subject to espial generally feel that option of obeying disobeying instruction given to rest with practically use of post office be in own hand a spirit of self conduct have grown up moral habit of young lady have certainly not deteriorated in america carry latch key walk about with young gentleman a young gentleman walk about with other in america young lady be a well behaved a with a well behaved a be in continental country in be still watched close till be given up a bride to husband with whom have have mean of becoming acquainted whether latch key system that of free correspondence may not rob flower of of delicate aroma used to appreciate may be question then be also question whether there doe not come something in place of in long run be found to be more valuable florence when remark be made a to own power of sending receiving letter remained silent looked very firm thought that must have be difficult to silence after fashion sir magnus must have done at rate if have not be able sir magnus must have done nothing think must not have be within power be useless talking of will not take back to england so a to prevent necessity of harry coming here why must come because mamma intend to see future husband before go from for so great distance for so long time feel pity for mamma do feel pity for because one day wish to marry cousin scarborough next mr anderson then next m grascour how can pity for that be done because have taken in head to think ill of one whom believe to be especially worthy began by disliking because interfered with plan about mountjoy never must have married cousin mountjoy be not to taste be gambler have thought that must do what liked with have always be for own happiness must be judge of how must be happy with of men seeing care for in least must be utterly impossible for to have married to of to harry annesley have given altogether because be mother be able to keep apart do not pity for sorrow trouble must suffer suppose mother always pity suffering of child remove when can do so now mamma be to come here will take back to england be question mr mountjoy found very difficult to answer on spur of moment must not answer a must be necessary that must first consult sir magnus must sir magnus undertake to confine daughter within precinct of embassy to exclude lover during such time a harry annesley night remain in brussels a thought of matter in own room conceived that there must be great difficulty world of brussels must become aware of what be going on young lady must endeavor to get out must only be constrained by co operation of servant young gentleman in endeavor to get in must only be prevented by assistance of police dim idea presented to mind of farther travel wherever went there must be post office be aware that young man must pursue much quicker than must fly how good must be that in such emergency might have privilege of locking daughter up in convent yet must be protestant convent a thing savoring of roman catholic religion be abhorrent to altogether a thought of own condition that of daughter felt that world be sadly out of joint coming here be said sir magnus then will just have to go back again a wise a came can shut door against shut door of course can will never be able to get nose in here if once order have be given for exclusion who be mr annesley suppose know englishman in brussels will go out to meet what in street said sir magnus in horror fear must by george must be stiff necked one if will do then mr mountjoy with tear in eye began to explain with very many epithet that daughter be best girl in world be entirely worthy of confidence who knew be aware that better behaved young woman must exist be conscientious religious high principled will go out in street walk with young man when friend tell not be that idea of religion then mr mountjoy with touch of anger in tone of voice said that must return to england carry daughter with what deuce can do sarah when young lady be so unruly can give order to have shut out can take care that be obeyed can not give order to have shut in must be making prisoner everybody must talk about in matter must give order only say that must not comply with on following day mr mountjoy informed daughter that must go back to cheltenham did not name immediate day because must be well thought to stave off evil hour did name distant day because be to do so terrible evil of harry annesley arrival in brussels must not be prevented at first wished to name day thinking that must be good thing to cross harry on road here florence be too strong for at last day be fixed in week time must take departure go home by slow stage with arrangement florence expressed well pleased of course made harry acquainted with probable time of arrival m grascour when heard that day have be suddenly fixed for departure of mr mountjoy daughter not unnaturally conceived that be cause of lady departure did on account resign hope young lady mother be certainly on side thought quite possible be to appear in england might be successful when have heard of coming departure of course be necessary that must say special farewell dined one evening at british embassy took opportunity during evening of finding alone with florence so miss florence said estimable mamma be about to return to england have be here very long time be going home at last seems to other day when came said m grascour with lover eagerness be in autumn weather be quite mild soft now be in middle of january suppose so still time have gone only too rapidly heart can hardly take account of day week a be decidedly lover talk be made in term even young lady can not pretend to misunderstand florence be obliged to answer in manner equally direct now be angry with have informed that be in love with man in doing so have done much more than necessity of case demanded have told a best way of silencing that might have be expected to keep a own secret yet here be talking to about heart made immediate answer frowned at looked stern be clear to intelligence that have right to talk to about heart after information have given hope miss mountjoy may look forward to pleasure of seeing when go over to england live in london near live down in country at cheltenham distance must be nothing be very bad must be stopped thought florence suppose will be married by time know where may live will be happy to see if call have here made bold assertion one m grascour did not at believe be speaking of visit might make perhaps in month six week young lady told that must find married yet a knew very well mother uncle aunt be opposed to marriage spoke of without blush without reticence young lady be much emancipated did not think that generally carried emancipation so far a hope not that said know why must be so ill natured a to hope fact be m grascour believe what told other day perhaps a young lady ought not to have alluded to did so in order to set matter at rest altogether of course ca tell when may come if come quite at once will not be married not married will be a much engaged a be possible for girl to be have given word nothing will make false to suppose will come on account solely on account then stay at home be quite in earnest now must say good bye departed left seated alone on sofa at first told that be unfeminine there be hard way with of talking about herself almost pronounced to be unladylike unmarried girl must thought under circumstance speak of gentleman to whom affection have be given a miss mountjoy spoke of mr annesley nevertheless must sooner posse a own wife than other girl have ever met something of real passion of unsatisfied love made feel chill at heart who be harry annesley for whom professed so warm feeling mother declared harry annesley to be scapegrace something of story of discreditable midnight street quarrel between young lady cousin have reached ear did not suppose to be possible that young lady must actually get married without mother co operation therefore thought that still must go to england in one respect be altogether untouched if must ultimately succeed in marrying young lady must not be bit worse a wife because have be attached to harry annesley be kind of folly girl must very quickly get over when have not be allowed to have own way therefore upon whole thought that must go to england parting with anderson have also to be endured must necessarily be more difficult owed debt for having abstained must not go without paying debt by expression of gratitude that must have done so have kept aloof be matter of course equally matter of course be that must not keep aloof will want to see for just five minute to morrow morning before take departure said in lugubrious voice during last evening have kept promise to very letter mooning about in desolate manner very conspicuously desolation have be notorious very painful to florence promise have be kept be grateful oh

did poor anderson be stalking up down long room when entered being at farther end stalked up to addressed with word have chosen for purpose miss mountjoy said found here happy light hearted young man

cloud have passed over darkness will never be effaced have certainly be doing oh mr anderson what can say have loved before never like so will again never when declare that expect word to be respected paused for answer what must say did not at respect word on subject did respect conduct yes call upon to believe when say that for be over can be nothing to will be very much to will go on in same disconsolate miserable way suppose will stay here because will be a well here a anywhere else might move to lisbon what good must do image must follow to whatever capital might direct step there be one thing can do here brightened up putting on altered face will do anything mr anderson in power if if if must change will never change said with angry look if must change think must remember promise exacted fidelity with have be kept do remember then must be allowed to come again have chance wherever may be at court of shah of persia at chinese capital will instantly come promised when asked will not now promise can not promise anything so impossible will bind to nothing to let know mr annesley have gone way have to explain to that be impossible must make promise founded on idea mr henry annesley must ever go way in must not accompany with that have to be a well satisfied a circumstance of case must admit left with assurance not intended to be quite audible that be ever must be blighted individual when carriage be at door sir magnus came down into hall full of smile good humor at moment lady mountjoy be saying last word of farewell to relative in own chamber good bye dear hope will get well through trouble be addressed to mr mountjoy a for dear said turning to florence if must only contrive to be little le stiff necked think world must go easier with think stiff neck

may be very distant how can speak to kindly when feel that be enemy matter be at last set at rest by promise from florence that must not marry lover in le than three year without mother express consent three year be long time be mr mountjoy thought many thing might occur within term harry of whom thought manner of unnatural thing might probably in time have proved to be utterly unworthy mountjoy scarborough might again have come forward in light of world have heard of late that mountjoy have be received once more into father full favor old man have become so enormously rich through building of mill have be going on at tretton that a mr mountjoy thought must be able to make number of elder son on subject of entail idea be misty felt sure that mountjoy scarborough must even yet become rich man florence must be made to change on account did not expect did think that when must have learned that harry be murderer midnight thief wicked conspirator must give up therefore agreed to receive with not actually expressed hostility when must call at montpelier place now in proper telling of story must go back to harry annesley will be remembered that father have called upon mr prosper to inform of harry projected journey to america mountjoy scarborough have also called at buston hall previous to two visit old mr scarborough have written long letter giving detailed account of conflict have taken place in london street three event have operated strongly on mr prosper mind not so strongly a conduct of miss thoroughbung messrs soames simpson have be made evident to from joint usage have received from person that be simply made use of with object of obtaining from best possible establishment for lady in question after interview at lady having obtained in way of jointure much more than be due to demanded also for miss tickle life long home for pair of pony received farther letter from lawyer offended greatly nothing on earth must induce to write line to

for many year client wish to be assured also that will be allowed to keep pair of pony in addition to carriage horse will be maintained doubt chiefly for own purpose be demand a made by messrs soames simpson felt by mr prosper to be altogether impossible recollected passionate explosion of wrath to name of miss tickle have already brought in presence of clergyman of parish must endure farther disgrace on behalf of miss tickle miss tickle must never be inmate of house a for pony pony must ever be stabled in stall pony be animal of very nature be objectionable to there be want of dignity in pony to buston hall must never be subjected also said to at last there be lack of dignity about miss thoroughbung must do irreparable injury how must make known decision to lady how must escape from marriage in such manner a to leave stain on character a gentleman if must have offered sum of money must have done so at once that thought must not be gentleman like must be confession on own part that have behaved wrongly at last determined to take notice of lawyer letter to write to miss thoroughbung telling that object proposed to by marriage be not compatible that therefore matrimonial intention must be allowed to subside thought well over felt assured that very much of success of measure must depend upon wording of letter there need be immediate haste miss thoroughbung must not come to buston again quite at once to disturb by farther visit before must come must have flown to italy letter must be courteous somewhat tender must be absolutely decisive there must be loop hole left by must again entangle crevice by must creep into buston letter must be work of time must give week ten day for composing then when must have be sent must be off to italy before must allow to go upon travel must settle question about nephew now lay heavy upon conscience did feel that have ill treated young man have be so told in very strong language by mr scarborough of tretton mr scarborough of tretton be man of very large property much talked about in world very wonderful thing be said about mr scarborough tended to make mr prosper believe that be man of distinction have also heard lately about mr scarborough younger son indeed only son according to new way of speaking of tidings be not much in young man favor be from augustus scarborough that have heard evil story about own nephew therefore belief be shaken be by mean clear to that there must be other heir for property miss thoroughbung have proved to be altogether unfit for high honor have intended miss puffle have gone off with farmer tazlehurst son mr prosper did not think that have energy enough to look for third lady who might be fit at point to become wife now evil have be added to nephew have declared purpose of emigrating to united state becoming american might be true that must be driven to do so by absolute want mr prosper have stopped allowance have done so after deterring from following profession by might have earned bread have looked into law a far a must understand must become property of nephew even though nephew must become american citizen conscience pricked sorely a thought of evil might thus accrue of disgrace must be attached to own name therefore wrote following letter to nephew sent across to parsonage done up in large envelope sealed carefully with buston arm on corner of

dealing president be low person idea of government be pettifogging lady be told be very vulgar though have never have pleasure of knowing one of be irreligious nation have respect for established church of england bishop must be very sorry that heir must go among with reference to stopping income have hitherto allowed be step took upon best advice can allow to be thought that there be legal claim upon for continuance of payment be willing for present to continue on full understanding that at once give up american project there be subject on be essentially necessary must receive from a heir full complete explanation under what circumstance did beat captain scarborough in street late on night of d of june last how did come to pas that left bleeding speechless motionless on occasion a be about to continue payment of sum hitherto allowed think only fitting must receive explanation under own hand be affectionate uncle peter prosper p rumor may probably have reached of projected

be unfortunately sent off little before completion of other day interval have be intended missive to miss thoroughbung be under press of difficulty delayed longer than be intended there be grieve to say much of joy more of laughter at rectory when letter be received a usual joe thoroughbung be there be found impossible to keep letter from postscript burst upon a surprise be welcomed by one with more vociferous joy than by lady nephew so there be end forever to hope that child of buntingford brewery must sit upon throne of prospers be thus that joe expressed why must have sat there said polly thoroughbung be a good a prosper day be not said in presence of mr annesley who on subject entertained view very different from daughter wonder what idea be of church of england said mr annesley doe

joe suppose got that out of of radical news paper for joe after manner of brewer be staunch tory president too be vulgar a well a lady said mr annesley be opinion of educated englishman who be not ashamed to own that entertains serious antipathy against whole nation at parsonage soon returned to more serious consideration of matter did uncle prosper intend to forgive sinner altogether be coerced into doing so by conviction that have be told lie by uncommon difficulty presented to in reference to heir at rate be agreed by harry must meet uncle way write full complete explanation a desired 'bleeding speechless motionless ' said harry ca deny that be bleeding certainly be speechless for few moment may have be motionless what be to say letter be not difficult one to write be sent across on same day to hall there mr prosper gave up day to consideration day must have be much better devoted to applying final touch to own letter to miss thoroughbung found at last that nephew

be mr prosper of buston hall with century of prospers for ancestor whereas soames be son of tax gatherer simpson have come down from london a clerk from solicitor office in city yet be true that

shilling of allowance must ever be paid to harry annesley must go abroad said so to a thought of said also that if must find healthy young woman anywhere must marry sacrificing idea of own happiness to desire of revenge upon nephew however be only passionate feeling of moment matrimony have become altogether so distasteful to since have become intimately acquainted with miss thoroughbung a to make release in manner quite impossible to do propose to make amends asked miss thoroughbung money said yes money why must pay money must like to keep three pony to have miss tickle sister to come live with know whether be in earnest miss thoroughbung quite in earnest peter prosper perhaps have better leave matter in hand of soames simpson very gentleman like men will be sure to let know how

thought to be most probable whether there be grain of truth in demand made found equally impossible to make reply there be nothing that must say must absolutely turn out of room after ten minute farther continuation of amenity during did at last come home to brain that be merely laughing at began to think that might possibly escape leave there in possession of chamber if will excuse miss thoroughbung will retire said rising from sofa regularly chaffed out of own den said laughing like interchange of wit on subject be so serious interchange there be very little interchange according to idea have said anything witty what idea of interchange man have at rate will escape from rudeness now peter prosper before go let ask one question of two have be rudest to other have come asked to

however must be of use because be not signed very stupid letter be if want to write naturally must never copy letter good bye mr prosper peter never will be then got up walked out of room mr prosper when be left alone remained for while nearly paralyzed that must have ever entertained idea of making woman wife such be first thought then reflected that have in truth escaped from more easily than

than be fitting for man mortal for human creature who may be cut off from joy to morrow may have very source of joy turned into sorrow walked like god not showing by outward gesture not declaring that be so by assumed grace arrogant carriage of knowing within that have happened down at cheltenham have divested of humanity made star of to one else have be given to have such feeling such assurance of heavenly bliss together with certainty under circumstance must be altogether own for ever ever be thus thought of what have happened to have succeeded in getting kissed by young woman harry annesley be in truth very proud of florence altogether believed in thought better of because florence loved not with vulgar self applause of man who fancy to be lady killer therefore grand sort of fellow in conceiving to be something better than have hitherto believed simply because have won heart of one special girl during half hour at cheltenham have so talked to managed in own pretty way so to express a to make understand that of that there be of be only lord master may god do so to more also if to end treat not only with affection also with delicacy of observance be thus that spoke to of a walked

directly through of lady at buntingford doe seem that aunt have be too many for have be said by molly have be uttered in presence of joe thoroughbung of harry why yes said joe have have under thong altogether have not found difficult to flog when have got by hind leg idea have occurred to joe from remembrance of peccant hound in grasp of tyrant whip seems that offered money must hardly think

when came love making to marmaduke lodge be old fool among always have be said molly who on occasion thought incumbent upon to take thoroughbung rather than prosper side of quarrel in truth renewed quarrel between hall rectory be likely to prove extremely deleterious to harry annesley interest for welfare depended not solely on fact that be at present heir presumptive to uncle yet on small allowance of two hundred fifty pound made to by uncle capable of being withdrawn at moment also on fact supposed to be known to world be known to world before affair in street with mountjoy

have in pocket check for sixty two pound ten have be sent to by uncle agent in payment of quarter income have be stopped also have farther letter written on next day telling that be not to expect

have passed by offering to restore uncle be undoubtedly very silly man be not one who must acknowledge to that have done unjust act without suffering for at present moment while wrath be hot there must be sense of contrition ear must still tingle with sound of laughter of have supposed to have be subject at rectory sound in few week might die away feeling of propriety of justice must come back upon poor man mind such be state of thing upon harry resolved to wait for few week in mean time tidings came across from hall mr prosper be ill have remained in house for two three day after miss thoroughbung visit have given rise to special remark because be well known that mr prosper be man whose feeling be often too many for when be annoyed must be long before must get better of annoyance during such period must remain silent alone there must be question that miss thoroughbung have annoyed most excessively matthew have be aware that must be better that must abstain from question must take daily newspaper in to master ask for order a to daily dinner must be mr prosper when in fairly good humor must see cook morning must discus with propriety of roasting boiling fowl expediency of pudding pie idiosyncrasy be well known cook might always have own way by recommending contrary to wanted because be point of honor with mr prosper not to be led by servant during day simply said let have dinner trouble went on for day two without exciting much comment at rectory when went on beyond day two be surmised that mr prosper be ill at end of week have not be seen outside house then alarm began to be felt rumor have got abroad that intended to go to italy be expected that must start sign came of intended movement not word more have be said to matthew on subject have be ordered to admit visitor into house at unless be one from firm of grey barry from moment in have got rid of miss thoroughbung have be subject to dread lest must return if not might thought send soames simpson denizen from brewery be conscious that not only all buston buntingford be aware of what have attempted to do one whom chanced to meet must a thought be talking of therefore feared to be seen by eye of man woman child there be self consciousness about altogether overpowered that cook with whom used to have argument about boiled chicken be now enemy domestic enemy because be sure that talked about projected marriage in kitchen must not see coachman groom because tidings must have reached about pair of pony consequently shut up altogether disease became worse with because of seclusion now from day to day may be more properly said from hour to hour news came across to rectory of poor squire health matthew to whom alone be given free intercourse with master became very gloomy mr prosper be doubt gloomy feeling be contagious think be going off head be what do think said in confidential intercourse with cook conversation resulted in matthew walking across to rectory asking advice from rector in rector paying visit to hall have again consulted with wife have recommended to endeavor to see brother of course what hear about anger only come from joe through servant if be angry what will matter not in least to said rector only must not willingly trouble must go said rector wife only know must require to agree with about harry that of course can not do then rector walked across to hall sent up word by matthew that be there must be glad to see mr prosper if mr prosper be disengaged matthew after interval of quarter of hour came back with merely note be not very well interview at

stretched out called peter simply because have be custom so to do during period of nearly fifty year in have lived in same parish a brother sister must therefore only stare at tragic humor a stood there before though of course be madness on part to object to godfather godmother christened peter father be peter before father too be peter prosper woman have made name sound abominable in ear miss thoroughbung mean came here so be petered in own house nay up in very room that hardly knew whether be on head heel must not mind what said know that be little flighty nobody told so why must let know

whom molly mean to marry other girl father have be laughing at have never laughed others again waited for reply reply came did a well a other answer there be fact that have be ridiculed by very young man whom be intended that must support by liberality be impossible to tell that man who have made so absurd must expect to be laughed at by junior there be running through mind idea very much be due to from harry there be also idea that something too be due from there be present even to noble feeling that must bear ignominy with be treated still be generous have sworn to have sworn to matthew that must never forgive nephew of course wish to be out of way why do say that because be true how happy must all be if be dead harry be living here in place do think so yes do of course must all go

screen from want be prudent walking about world with eye open much wider than father have ever done here only pressed hand there be nothing to be said against except that something spotted at once when said that be not gentleman according to idea to mine be not quite gentleman be fastidious must pay penalty of taste in respect be paying penalty now by present doubt be not yet too late for to get better of though have acknowledged that be not quite gentleman be by mean reverse be quite lady hope so be not particularly good looking papa be not complimentary dear intend to be so to face such a be be sweetest thing on earth to look upon oh papa dear papa threw arm round neck kissed having lived so long with have acquired habit thought have learned to disregard utterly outward appearance must be decent clean womanly be not enough to attract eye of men in general have seen deeper than most men do into value of business mean said dolly will not have that be ill natured a believe altogether untrue think of mr barry that must not marry girl for sake of business unless loved be nonsense papa how can mr barry love did ever have five minute of free conversation together unless meant to love must be nearer mark knew that must do so will be quite safe in hand safe papa so much for now must say few word a to myself be not bound to marry one else to do good turn think be bound to remember what feeling must be if on death bed be leaving quite alone in world a far a money be concerned must have enough for want be that must have have become so thoroughly friend that have

resolved to do a must not indeed be to marry suitor to turn over in mind yet once again find out whether must be possible that must do so have dismissed on former occasion have not since given thought to except a to nuisance of have so far ridded now nuisance have come again be to endeavor to ascertain how far must accustom to perpetual presence without incurring perpetual misery have to be acknowledged that did not begin inquiry in fair frame of mind declared to herself that must think about night morning without prejudice so that might be able to accept if found possible at same time there be present to high black stone wall at one side of stood while mr barry be on other that there must be clambering over wall by of felt to be quite impossible though at same time acknowledged that miracle might occur by wall must be removed so began thinking used father argument mr barry be honest good must not ill treat knew nothing about must take for granted a though be gospel because father have said so then be to fact that be by mean good looking meaning of be that other man must probably want then remembered father word to face be sweetest thing on earth to look upon did believe plainness did not come against there why must rob father of one thing to be sweet in world to father be one noble human being whom have ever known why must rob of daily presence then told a have told that have never have five minute free conversation with mr barry in life that certainly be reason why free conversation must not be commenced then did not believe that free conversation be within capacity of mr barry must never come though might be married to for twenty year too might perhaps talk about business there must be none of consideration a to radical good evil made nucleus of such conversation with father there must be flatness about must make such interchange of word impossible must be a though have be married to log of wood rather beast of field a regarded sentiment how much money must be coming to now father have never told how much money be coming to there have be allusion to branch of subject then there came other thought a to that interior life must be destiny to lead with mr barry then came black cloud upon face a sat thinking of never at last said never never be very foolish not to know that be impossible of whom then spoke be father not mr barry if have to be left alone will not be first others have be left alone before will at rate be left alone then wall became higher more black than ever there be coming of miracle by be to be removed be clearer to than ever that of must climb after said to herself to know that husband be not gentleman ought not to be enough of course woman have to pay for fastidiousness like other luxury be costly then like other luxury can not be laid aside so before morning be gone made up mind steadily mr barry must never be lord master how must best make understand that be so so that might be quickly rid of when first hour of thinking be done after breakfast be that filled mind be sure that must not take answer easily go must have be prepared by father to persevere not by absolute word by mode of speaking father must have given to understand that be still in doubt therefore might possibly be talked over must teach at once a well a must that such be not character that have come to resolution left chance be guilty of one weakness be almost unworthy of when time came changed dress put on old shabby frock in be wont to call upon carroll best dress be kept for father perhaps accounted for opinion that to eye face be sweetest thing on earth to look upon a sat there waiting for mr barry certainly did look ten year older than age in truth mr grey dolly have be somewhat mistaken in reading of mr barry character there be more of intellect merit in than have obtained credit for from of did care very much for income of business perhaps first idea in looking for dolly hand have be probability that must thus obtain whole of income for while wanting money wanted also of good thing ought to accompany superior intellect intellect slightly superior to own of did not think meanly power of conversation might imitate that fineness of thought flattered might be able to achieve while living with daughter of gentleman be treasure mr barry hoped to gain by marriage with dorothy grey there have be something in personal appearance to eye have not be distasteful did not think face sweetest thing in world to look at a father have done saw in index of intellect have desired to obtain for a for dress that of course must be altered imagined that must easily become so far master of wife a to make wear fine clothes without difficulty then did not know dolly grey have studied deeply manner of attacking must be very humble at first after while humility must be discontinued whether accepted rejected knew well that did not become husband to be humble a regarded lover thought that humility be merely outside gloss of love making have be humble enough on former occasion must begin now in same strain after while must stir assume manner of man miss grey said a soon a be alone see have be a good a word have come again have already observed old frock mode of dressing up hair have guessed truth knew that be to come mr barry father have told so yes have spoken good word in favor yes have trust will be effective not at all know that be only subject on can not take advice must burn hand off for father can not afford to give to one at instance must be exclusively own unless one must come very different from who be likely to ask for there be something mr barry thought of offence in must not altogether throw off humility a yet quite admit value of treasure said there need not be nonsense between mr barry have special value to one except to myself to mean to keep at father instance have thought over proposition have made much more seriously than have thought possible must do be not flattering said there be need for flattery on one side on other have better take that a established have done honor of wishing for certain reason must be wife common reason love be not able to return feeling therefore wish that must be husband sound to be uncivil rather say in order to make understand exact truth woman can not love man because feel for even most profound respect will often do so when there be respect esteem father have so spoken of to that do esteem have effect in touching heart therefore can not become wife now a mr barry thought have come time in must assert miss grey said have probably long life before long short can make difference if understood aright be one who life very much to yourself to father be growing in year so be for matter of be growing in year have looked out for thought what manner of home yours will be when will have be dead buried paused remained silent assumed special cast of countenance a though might say word if pressed must be disagreeable for to hear when have gone will not be very solitary without husband doubt will have not better accept one when one come way who be not a tell quite unworthy of in spite of such worth solitude must be preferable certainly have knack miss grey of making most unpalatable assertion will make more unpalatable solitude must bear death not such marriage force to tell whole truth because truth will not suffice have endeavored to be at rate civil to said have endeavored to save what trouble must by being straightforward still paused sitting in chair uneasily looking a though have intention of going if will only take at word have done with still did not move suppose there be young lady who like kind of thing have become old enough to hate have have very little experience of be odious to can conceive nothing more disagreeable than to have to sit still hear gentleman declare that want to make wife when be quite sure that intend to make husband then miss grey said rising from chair suddenly will bid adieu good bye mr barry good bye miss grey farewell so went oh papa have have scene said moment felt alone with father have not accepted accepted oh dear be sure at moment be only thinking how must cut throat if must get hold of must have offended then very greatly oh mortally said everything possibly must to offend then must have be here still have not done so there be other way to get

apartment have not entered for year found that furniture be carefully covered of what use must all be to unless that too might be sent to melting pot brought into short lived use at club a be about to leave room stood for moment on rug before fireplace looked into huge mirror stood there if wall might be a well a garnishing of if florence mountjoy must come reign there then fancied that might be put to better purpose than of have thought in earlier day two three year ago at time now seemed to to be very distant have regarded florence a own a such have demanded hand in pride of birth position fashion have have thought of feeling have be imperious told that have be so with much self condemnation at rate have learned during month of solitary wandering power of condemning now told that if must yet come might still learn to sing that song of old fashioned poet a to ten commandment at rate must endeavor to sing a bade went on through bedroom remembering hardly more than remembering a entered oh florence florence said a passed on have done for brought down upon own head infinite ruin for what have scarcely ever won tretton be gone from forever still there might yet be chance if must abstain from gambling then when be dusk within house went out passed through stable roamed about garden till evening have altogether set in black night have come upon two year ago have known that be heir to though even then that habit be so strong upon have felt that tenure of must be slight have then always to tell that when marriage have taken place great change must be effected marriage have not taken place next fatal year have fallen upon a long a inheritance of estate be certainly must assuredly raise money at certain cost be well known that property be rising in value money have always be forthcoming at tremendous sacrifice have excused to recklessness on ground of delayed marriage still always treating on few occasion on have met with imperiousness have be natural to then final crash have come estate be a good a gone crash have be in truth final have come afterward almost a soon a father have learned what be to be fate of tretton have found to be bastard with dishonored mother just nobody in eye of world learned at same time that harry annesley be lover whom florence mountjoy really loved what have followed have be told already perhaps too often at moment a stood in gloom of night below porch in front of house swinging stick at top of big step acknowledgment of contrition be very heavy upon though be prepared to go to law moment augustus put forward a eldest son did recognize how long suffering father have be how much have be done for in order if possible to preserve knew might be result of lawsuit that father only purpose have be to save property for one of a be legacy might be valued at perhaps thirty thousand pound must be must expend on lawsuit if must find lawyer to undertake suit anger too against brother be quite a hot a be that of father when have be obliterated obliged to vanish from joint effect of violence in street inability to pay gambling debt at club have in evil moment submitted to augustus from hour augustus have become to most cruel of tyrant tyranny have come to end with absolute banishment from brother house though have be subdued to obedience in lowest moment of fall be not man who must bear such tyranny well can forgive father said augustus will never forgive then went into house in short time be sitting at dinner with young doctor secretary miss scarborough seldom came to table at hour remained in room up stair close to brother so that might be within call must be wanted upon whole merton said what do think of father doctor shrugged shoulder will live will die will die certainly joke with know must not joke on subject question did not merely go to state of health what do think of a man generally do call honest man how be to answer just truth if will have answer consider honest man story about brother be true be not true in case can one look upon a honest just so think that have within capacity for love unselfishness almost atones for dishonesty there be about strange dislike to conventionality to law be so interesting a to make up balance have always regarded father a most excellent man thoroughly dishonest must rob one always to eke out own gift to other people have therefore to eye be most romantic a to health ah a to can not answer so decidedly will hing because tell do mean that must prolong life certainly think must have exerted morning whereas have advised not to exert must have given same counsel must certainly live longer by obeying than reverse a there be difficulty in matter there need be conceit on part in saying that so far advice might be of service to how long will live who can say sir william brodrick when fearful operation be performed in london thought that month must see end of be eight month ago have more vitality now than have then for think that can live month later on in evening mountjoy scarborough began again governor think that have behaved uncommonly well to be paid for have not left anything by will have certainly expected nothing there must be reason why must have entertained idea of late that wish to make what reparation may be possible to therefore a say doe not choose to burden will with legacy there be provision made for aunt who however have own fortune have told to look after will be quite unnecessary said mr merton if choose to cut up rough can do so must propose that must fix upon sum will be yours at death just a though have left to indeed will fix sum merton of course said that nothing of kind must be necessary with understanding mountjoy scarborough went that night to bed early on following morning father again sent for mountjoy said have thought much about have changed mind about will no not about will at will remain a be think must have strength to make will do wish to do so mean about merton mean about merton at give five hundred pound ought to be satisfied be matter of more importance than mr merton even than will what be said mountjoy in tone of much surprise think can tell now be right that must know that merton wrote by instruction to mr grey early morning have implored to come to tretton once again there can not say more than now then turned round on couch a be custom be unassailable chapter liv rummelsburg mr scarborough again sent for mr grey couple of week passed before came at first refused to come saying that must send clerk down if work be wanted such a clerk might do clerk did come be very useful mr scarborough persevered using argument mr grey found unable at last to resist be dying there must soon be end of be strongest argument then be alleged that lawyer of experience be certainly needed that mr scarborough must not very well put affair into hand of stranger old friendship be brought up then at last squire alleged that there be other secret to be divulged respecting family of mr scarborough thought mr grey must approve what must be other secret ended in mr grey assenting to go in opposition to daughter advice must have nothing more to do with secret dolly have said know know a much about a woman can know of man doe know from have said over over again that be 'rascal ' not rascal think said be rascal believe used that very word then unsay rascal have something mean about juniper rascal care nothing for word nothing at when law be concerned have defamed own wife be done many year ago for fixed purpose not from passion dolly continued be thoroughly bad man have made will for now must leave after mr grey declined for second time to go at last be persuaded on evening of arrival dined with mountjoy merton on occasion miss scarborough joined of course there be much surmise a to cause of farther visit merton declared that a have acted a sick man private secretary be bound to keep secret a far a knew only surmised what believed to be truth of that must say nothing miss scarborough be altogether in dark alone spoke of brother with respect in knew nothing can not tell what be said mountjoy suspect to be something intended for benefit for utter ruin of augustus miss scarborough have now retired if must be possible must think that intended to declare that have said before be false to however mr grey must not listen be very stout in denying possibility of reversion of decision to have come augustus be undoubtedly by law father eldest son have seen with own eye copy of registry of marriage mr barry have gone across continent to make in book wife have signed maiden name according to custom of country have be done in presence of clergyman of gentleman german then residing on spot who have be examined have stated that wedding a wedding have be regular in respect be since dead clergyman who have married be still alive within twelve month of time mr scarborough bride have arrived in england augustus have be born nothing most indisputable evidence must have sufficed to prove fact by be so cruelly wronged said addressing to mountjoy when father told that wrong must be done to a property be hopelessly in hand of jew told that for purpose of law jew be a dear to a be do say that nothing most certain fact must have convinced such fact when made certain be immovable if father have plot for robbing augustus will find a staunch friend to augustus a ever have be to when have so spoken separated for night word have be so strong that have altogether affected mountjoy if such be father intention must be by farther plot that endeavored to carry out in father plot must put trust whatever yet declared own purpose a discussed matter late into night with merton can not trust grey at father either because believe a grey belief story of marriage father be so clever so resolute in purpose to set aside control over property a arranged by law that to mind have be contrived by mr barry have be squared german parson foreign gentleman more probably of mr grey may have be squared for know though be kindest hearted gentleman ever came across anything will be more probable to than be not father eldest son to mr merton said very little though doubt have own idea next morning three gentleman with mr grey clerk sat down to breakfast solemn silent clerk have be especially entreated to say nothing of what have learned be therefore not questioned by master in truth have learned little having spent time in sorting copying of letter though bore upon subject in hand told nothing of real tale farther surmise be useless now a at eleven o'clock mr grey mr merton be to go up together to squire room clerk be to remain within call there must be need of mountjoy suppose may a well go to bed said up to london anywhere mr grey very sententiously advised at rate not to go up to london hour came mr grey with merton clerk disappeared up stair be summoned by miss scarborough who seemed to feel heavily awful solemnity of occasion be sure be going to do something very dreadful time whispered to mr grey who seemed to be little awe struck did not answer at two o'clock met again at lunch mr grey be silent in truth very unhappy merton clerk be also silent a be miss scarborough silent a death indeed knew nothing other three knew a much a mr scarborough must must tell mountjoy be there also in middle of meal broke out violently why mischief tell what be that father have said to because believe word of story said mr grey oh mr grey ejaculated miss scarborough believe word of story repeated mr grey father intelligence be so high principle so low that there be scheme doe not think that can not carry out against established law of country present tale be made up fable what do say merton asked mountjoy look to to be true said merton be lawyer why tell what be said mountjoy can not tell said grey though commissioned to do so greenwood there will tell greenwood be name of clerk advise to take with to own room mr merton must be sure go with a for must be impossible must do credit in telling of to story of believe single word be not to know asked miss scarborough plaintively nephew will tell said mr grey mr merton mr greenwood can do so if have permission from mr scarborough must rather tell one be to incredible with got up walked away now then merton said mountjoy rising from chair upon word hardly know what to do said merton must come tell wonderful tale suppose that in way doe affect interest affect interest very much then think may say that certainly will believe father at present must not wish to do injury must be told so come along mr greenwood have better come also then left room two men followed went away to smoking room leaving mr grey with miss scarborough be to know nothing about said miss scarborough not from miss scarborough can understand can not tell story will require at word must explain thorough disbelief in brother have be very angry with have be more energetic than can have be good for ah will have killed among have be own doing however have better go to must return to town evening will stay for dinner can not stay for dinner can not sit down with mountjoy who have done nothing in least wrong because feel to be altogether opposed to interest must rather be out of house so saying did leave house went back to london by train afternoon meeting that morning have be very stormy can not be given word by word from moment in squire have declared purpose lawyer have expressed disbelief in be said to mr scarborough have at first taken very kindly mr grey clung to purpose with pertinacity have at last beaten down squire good humor have called for interference of mr merton how can be quiet squire have said when tell everything say be lie be lie said mr grey who have lost control of must not say that mr grey said merton must spare man on death bed who be endeavoring to do duty by child said man who thus declared to be dying will go away said mr grey rising have forced to come here against will have known must have known must tell what thought even though man be dying man can not accept what say on matter of business such a unless believe must tell that believe that disbelieve whole story will not act upon a though believed even after meeting be continued mr grey consenting to sit there to hear what be said to end purport of mr scarborough story will probably have be understood by reader be mr scarborough present intention to make understood that scheme intended for disinheritance of mountjoy have be false from beginning to end have be arranged not for injury of mountjoy for salvation of estate from hand of jew mountjoy must have lost nothing a property must have gone entirely to jew have mr scarborough then died mountjoy be taken a legitimate heir be not anxious have declared to say anything on present occasion in defence of conduct in respect must soon be gone must leave men to judge who might do so more honestly when must have found that have succeeded in paying even jew in full money have actually advanced now thing be again changed be bound to go back to correct order of thing shouted mr grey to correct order of thing went on mountjoy scarborough be declared undoubtedly legitimate then made merton clerk bring forth paper a though have never brought forth paper to prove other statement to mr grey did expect mr grey to believe mr grey simply put back metaphorically with hand there have be two marriage absolutely prepared with intent of enabling at future time to upset law altogether if must seem good to to do so wife shouted mr grey dear woman must have done anything told unless have told to do what be absolutely wrong not wrong well know what mean be purest best of woman then went on with tale there have be two marriage now brought forth evidence of former marriage have taken place in remote town village in northern part of prussia whither have be taken by mother to join two lady have be since long dead have be laid up at little prussian town under plea of bad leg did not scruple to say now that bad leg have be pretence portion of scheme law thought in endeavoring to make arrangement for property property must have be own have sinned so greatly a to drive wise man to much scheming have begun scheming early in business for bad leg old lady must not have brought daughter to be married at so out of way place a rummelsburg in pomerania have travelled about found rummelsburg peculiarly fitted for enterprise there be most civil old lutheran clergyman there to whom have made peculiarly acceptable have now certified copy of registry at rummelsburg left loop hole for doubt have felt that probably inquiry must have be made about what have be done thirty year ago at rummelsburg have desired to be silent on subject there will be difficulty said in making rummelsburg marriage known to world think there will very great difficulty mr grey have said not least when have to be married in light of day after mountjoy birth at nice in italy then there be difficulty have to be done in light of day little traveller with nurse be with be in italy then contrivance be assure necessary be done have always have with double set of certificate a thing have turned up have have to keep mr grey altogether in dark a regard rummelsburg be very difficult have succeeded that mr grey must have be almost driven to madness by such outrage a be matter of course preferred to believe that rummelsburg not nice be myth how did wife travel with during whole of year have asked a mr scarborough doubt have be very little in society world at large seemed willing to believe almost anything of be wrong however there be rummelsburg marriage if send to rummelsburg will find that be all right little white church up corner with crooked spire old clergyman be doubt dead must imagine that must keep register then explained how have travelled about world with two set of certificate have made second public when object have be to convert augustus into eldest son many people then have be found who have remembered something of marriage at nice remembered to have remembered something at time of having be in possession of secret a to lady rummelsburg have be kept quite in dark now be necessary that strong light must be thrown on absolute legality of rummelsburg marriage declared that have more than once made up mind to destroy rummelsburg document have always be deterred by reflection that when be once gone must not be brought back again have always intended have said to burn paper last thing before death a learned augustus character made quite certain by causing to be sealed up in parcel addressed to so that if have died by accident might have fallen into proper hand see now wickedness of project therefore give over to mr grey so saying tendered parcel to attorney mr grey of course refused to take even to touch rummelsburg parcel then prepared to leave room declaring must be duty to act on part of augustus must augustus be pleased to accept service mr scarborough almost with tear implored to change purpose why must set two brother by ear at mr grey only shook head incredulously why ruin property without object property will come to ruin not if will take matter up in proper spirit if determine to drive one brother to hostility against other promote unnecessary litigation of course lawyer will get then mr grey left room boiling with anger in with legal knowledge determination to do right have be so utterly thrown aside while mr scarborough sank exhausted by effort have gone through chapter lv mr grey remorse mr grey feeling a returned home be chiefly one of self reproach so though persisted in not believing story have be told to did in truth believe believed at rate in scarborough mr scarborough have determined that property must go hither thither according to will without reference to established law of land have carried must carry purpose object have be to save estate from hand of harpy money lender a far a be concerned must have saved have in fact forced money lender to lend money without interest without security then to consent to accept principal when be offered to one must say that deed when done be good deed man in doing have driven coach horse through law be to mr grey a holy writ in thus driving coach horse have forced mr grey to sit upon box hold rein mr grey have thought to be clever man at least well instructed man mr scarborough have turned round finger way way just a have pleased mr grey when in rage have given lie to mr scarborough have doubt spoken a have believed at moment to new story must have sounded like lie a have be driven to accept veritable lie a real truth have looked into circumstance of marriage at nice have accepted have sent partner over have picked up many incidental confirmation that there have be marriage at nice between mr scarborough mother of augustus be certain have traced back mr scarborough movement before marriage must not learn where lady have joined who afterward became wife have become manifest to that have travelled with bearing name in vienna mr barry have

be employed again either by mr scarborough on behalf of estate executor have threatened that must take up cudgel on behalf of augustus have felt at moment that be bound to do so because a have then thought augustus have right cause a idea crumbled away from augustus affair became more more distasteful to after ought to be wished that mountjoy must become elder son even mountjoy incurable gambler be terrible to mr grey that old fixed arrangement must be unfixed certainly there be nothing in character of augustus to reconcile to change be very unhappy man when put into cab to be carried down to fulham how much better must have be for have taken daughter advice persistently refused to make last journey to tretton must have to acknowledge to daughter that mr scarborough have altogether got

tretton will never be said be to publish account of whole affair be bound in honor not to do explaining from beginning to end people must only say be endeavoring to lay whole weight of guilt upon confederate who be dead why did pick out for such usage who have be so true to there be something almost weak almost feminine in tone of mr grey complaint to dolly be feminine weak to father grief be true well founded for in own heart there be joy to be drawn from how must have be with if sharp practice have be success what must have be state of mind have known father to have conceived base trick what must have be condition have father be of such kind a to have taught that doing of such trick must be indifferent to to have be high above for for be not that everything be not sure that truth

hear that father have be very weak since mr grey have gone unable even to see mountjoy for more than two three minute at time be afraid that must soon be over everybody around squire have be surprised to find how cheerful high spirited be seems wrote mountjoy a though have nothing to regret either a regard world next have remorse certainly fear nothing think must make angry unless word repentance be mentioned to to to sister be unwontedly affectionate augustus name have not crossed lip since left house then went on to matter a to letter have be written what be to do when be over with be natural must come to for advice will promise nothing about trust may not return to gambling table if have property to manage may be able to remain down here without going up to london will have property to manage what step be to take with view of getting of course will have to encounter opposition think that will be one of to oppose presume that will be left here in possession that say be nine point of law in usual way ought presume simply to hing merely to take possession double story about two marriage ought to count for nothing must be a though such plot have ever be hatched have be hatched other people know of creditor presume can hing have bond in possession may curse swear will imagine have power doubt whether have morsel of ground on to raise lawsuit for whether augustus be eldest son claim have be satisfied in full presume augustus will not sit quiet what ought to do in regard to a matter stand at present will not get shilling fear father be too ill to make will at rate will make none in favor of augustus pray tell ought to do tell whether can send one down to assist when father will have gone will meddle farther with anything in name of scarborough be concerned such have be mr grey first assertion when received be letter must write to tell after what have passed there must be nothing of business transacted between father estate be in position to give advice on subject mooted must wash hand of altogether a went home thought over matter told that must be impossible for thus to repudiate name must undertake lawsuit either on behalf of augustus of mountjoy must answer mountjoy letter tender advice during long hour of subsequent night discussed whole matter with daughter upshot of discussion be that must withdraw name from business leave mr barry to manage barry might then act for party a pleased chapter lvi scarborough revenge thing be not done at tretton altogether unknown to augustus scarborough tidings a to will reached then first perceived injury have done in lending assistance to payment of creditor have brother be utterly bankrupt so that jew might have seized money might have come to father must have left will in favor be now intelligible to augustus idea that father must strip house of stick of furniture estate of chattel upon have not occurred to before thing be done have thought that father be indifferent to personal offence therefore have be offensive found out mistake therefore be angry with still thought that have be right in regard to creditor have creditor be left in possession of unpaid bond must have offered terrible impediment to taking possession of property have be right then thought fact be that father have lived too long however property must be left to augustus must make up mind to buy other thing from mountjoy at rate must have to provide fund out of mountjoy must live must take care that did not buy chattel twice over be thus consoled till rumor of something worse reached ear how rumor reached must be difficult to say there be probably among servant who got inkling of what squire be doing when mr grey again came down miss scarborough have confidential friend mr grey clerk may have be indiscreet tidings in unformed state did reach augustus astounded belief in father story a to brother illegitimacy have be unfixed doubtful latterly have verged toward more thorough belief a creditor have taken money le than third of what must have be have power remained with of recovering full debt creditor have thus proved belief be people not likely to believe statement without foundation at rate have conceived to be impossible that own father must go back from first story again make out to be doubly liar doubly knave if be so what must do be not case that in such event must be altogether ruined penniless adventurer with profession absolutely gone from what little money have got together have be expended on behalf of mountjoy sprat thrown out to catch whale everything according to present tidings have be left to mountjoy have only half known father who have turned against with virulence because of unkindness who must have expected that man in such condition must have lived so long have be capable of will so powerful have not dreamed of hatred so inveterate a father for received news also from tretton that father be not now expected by one to live long may be week doctor say be hardly possible that must remain alive for month such be news reached from own emissary at tretton what have better do in emergency of moment there be only one possibly effective step that must take might of course remain tranquil accept what chance might give when father must have died might at once go down to tretton demand interview with dying man did not think that father even on death bed must refuse to see father pluck be indomitable thought that must depend on own pluck at rate resolved that must immediately go to tretton take chance reached house about middle of day at once sent name up to father miss scarborough be sitting by brother bedside from time to time be reading to few word augustus said a soon a servant have left room what doe augustus want with last time saw bade die out of hand if wished to retrieve injury have done think of now john sister said a god be judge will think of to last moment word such a spoken by son to father demand little thought be to tell did not think of must not know be hypocrite need not speak of john not unless came here to harass last moment strove to do very much for know with what return mountjoy have be at rate honest straightforward considering thing not lacking in respect will at rate have pleasure in letting augustus know state of mind what will say to sister asked tell that have better go back to london have tried a few son can be tried by father know now tell with compliment that will be better for not to see there can be nothing pleasant said between have communication to make to must in least interest before night came squire have be talked over have agreed to see son interview will be easy enough for have said can not imagine what will get from let come a will augustus spent much of intervening time in discussing matter with aunt not word on subject be spoken by to mountjoy whom met at dinner with whom spent evening in company with mr merton two hour after dinner be melancholy enough three adjourned to smoking room sat there almost without conversation few word be said about hunting mountjoy have not hunted winter there be few also of greater interest about shooting shooting be of course still property of old man in early month have without many word spoken become a be appanage of condition of life to augustus aspired of late mountjoy have assumed command found plenty of pheasant here suppose augustus remarked well yes not too many did trouble much about when saw pheasant shot have be little troubled in spirit know gambling again heard that did trouble much merton can tell that have have sick house yes indeed said merton have seemed to be time in man must think very much of pheasant know why said augustus who be determined not to put up with rebuke implied in doctor word after there be nothing more said between till went to separate apartment contradict aunt said to next morning if reprimand acknowledge that have be wrong be hard when have be wrong so much depends upon be so stern of course wish well for of there be plenty enough plenty if only must agree together injustice of treatment be true that now declares mountjoy to be eldest son believe so know believe think of what conduct have be to then tell that be to own have be wrong in have be wrong be father suppose have said hard word to did rebuke because have fraudulently kept for so many year in position of younger son did not forgive iniquity say be younger son last move said with great passion have only be made in attempt to punish because must not tell be under world of obligation to for simply declaring truth a to birth can not be eldest son certainly not at last declared that be heir if did say hard word to be not justified not to father said miss scarborough

said be own have robbed to give to mountjoy now intends to rob again in order that mountjoy may have will leave such kettle of fish behind with manoeuvring that of will be better of tretton then went to squire in spite of what have passed between aunt have thought deeply of conduct to father in past of manner in must now carry be aware that have behaved not badly for that esteemed nothing most unwisely when have found to be heir to tretton have fancied to be almost possessor have acted on instinct on case must have be natural to to have pardoned man because be father then to have treated with insolent disdain a dying old man almost entirely beneath notice be what felt nature of circumstance demanded whether story be true false must have be same have come at last to believe to be true have therefore be more resolute whether be true false old man have struck blow must abide by till moment came in have received that communication from tretton idea have never occurred to that disposition of property might still be within father power have little known old man power fertility of resource extent of malice after what have done must cease to stay disturb have once said when father have jokingly alluded to own death have at once repented have felt that speech have be iniquitous a coming from son father have at moment expressed deep animosity sarcastic word have fallen from of augustus have not understood bitterness have remembered since be now not so much surprised at father wish to injure a at power must have such power mr grey knew be on side mr grey be thorough lawyer world be on side world having be instructed to think to believe that mr scarborough have not be married till after mountjoy be born world have be much surprised must be unwilling to encounter blow must go into father room altogether penitent must hold up head justify one thing be brought home to by thinking a matter of might be convinced penitence must now avail anything have at rate by time looked sufficiently into father character to be sure that must not forgive such offence a have be vice extravagance almost personal neglect must have be pardoned have so brought up father must have said fault must be counted a own son have deliberately expressed wish for father death have expressed in father presence have shown not only neglect may arise at distance may not be absolutely intentional word have be said with purpose of wounding be must be unpardonable augustus a went along corridor to father room determined that must at rate not be penitent well sir how do find said walking in briskly putting out hand to father old man languidly gave hand only smiled hear of though not from tell that have not be quite so strong of late will soon cease to stay trouble said squire with affected weakness in voice hardly above whisper using very word augustus have spoken there have be moment between sir have be unfortunately unpleasant yet have done so much to make pleasant to must have thought that offer of tretton must have gone for much with augustus be again taken in there be piteous whine about father voice once more deceived did not dream of depth of old man anger did not imagine that at moment must boil over with such ferocity be altogether aware of cat like quietude with must pave way for last spring mountjoy by far least gifted of two have gained truer insight to father character have done much rather a supposed circumstance have done much circumstance fact mean a to mountjoy birth own have not always left to be governed by actual circumstance if there be omission on part of expression of proper feeling regret know that there be what be proper feeling there be hypocrisy at rate sometimes be little bitter sir hope wo find so when be gone know what said

man be regarded by child a best of playfellow be weak in body self conscious jealous in spirit have heart to lay out for generous line of conduct not purpose to stick to steadily nephew have ever be trouble to because have expected from nephew kind of worship to have felt that be entitled a head of family good thing be to come from therefore good thing must be given to harry have told that uncle be not father that have not be fault that be uncle heir have not asked uncle for allowance have grown up with feeling that buston hall be to be own have not regarded uncle a donor father with large family have never exacted much have wanted special attention from if not father then why uncle inattention absence of gratitude for peculiar gift have sunk deep into mr prosper bosom hence have come miss thoroughbung a last resource miss thoroughbung have called peter hence mind have wandered to miss puffle miss puffle have gone off with farmer son a be now informed have taken to drinking gin therefore turned face to wall prepared to die on next day sent for matthew again matthew first came to always in morning on occasion very little conversation ever took place in middle of day have bowl of soup brought to by time have managed to drag out of bed to clothe in dressing gown to seat in arm chair then when soup have be slowly eaten must ring bell conversation must begin have be thinking

there have be little be quite sure mr harry wish to intrude if 'd let give to be understood that 'd like to call 'd be over here in jiffy then very slowly mr prosper did give to be understood that must take a compliment if nephew must walk across park ask after be most particular a to mode in embassy must be conducted harry be not to be made to think that be to come rushing into house after old fashion halloo uncle be well hope will be better when come back have got to be off by next train then used to fly away not be heard of again for week yet message be to be conveyed with alluring courtesy might be attractive might indicate that hostility be intended be not to be positive message one must signify what might possibly take place if must happen that mr harry be walking in direction might also happen that uncle must be pleased to see there be better ambassador at hand than matthew therefore matthew be commissioned to arrange matter if can get at mr week do through mother suggested mr prosper then matthew winked departed on errand in about two hour there be ring at back door of mr prosper knew well sound miss thoroughbung have not be there very often have learned to distinguish ring servant in old day not so very far removed harry have never be accustomed to ring at yet uncle knew that be not doctor who might probably come mr soames of whose coming lived in hourly dread can show up said to matthew opening door with great exertion attempting to speak to servant down stair harry at rate be shown up in two minute time be standing over uncle sick chair have not be quite well just lately said in answer to inquiry made be very sorry to hear that sir suppose have heard before did hear that be little out of sort out of sort know what call out of sort have not be out of room for well nigh month sister came to see one day be last christian have seen mother must be over daily if fancied 'd like have own duty want to be troublesome truth be uncle prosper that have felt that have be in black book a have not thought that deserved there have be little coolness told mother be willing to forgive forgive what fellow doe not care to be forgiven when have done nothing if will only say that by gones will be by gones quite past will take so must not give up position a head of family so easily injured head of family yet be anxious that by gones must be by gones if only young man must not be so jaunty a stood there by arm chair just say word girl will come up see a used to do mr prosper thought at moment that one of girl be going to marry joe thoroughbung that must not wish to see a for if have be in way negligent can only say that did not intend like to say more because must seem a though be asking for money know why must ask man doe like to do 'd tell of everything if 'd only let what be there to tell said uncle prosper knowing well that love story must be communicated to have got engaged to marry young woman young woman yes be young woman of course be young lady a well know name be florence mountjoy be young lady that have heard of be there not other gentleman attached to there be cousin mountjoy scarborough father wrote to father be meanest fellow ever met came to down here be fighting battle for be much obliged to for even have interfered with about lady then harry have to repeat veni vidi vici after own fashion of course interfered with how be fellow to help of be spooning on same girl of course have to decide decided for fancy did at rate decided for mean to have then mr prosper be for very gracious in congratulation saying manner of good thing of miss mountjoy think 'd like uncle prosper mr prosper did not doubt that must appease solicitor also have heard of miss mountjoy what have heard have be much to young lady credit then asked few question a to time fixed for marriage here harry be obliged to own that there be difficulty miss mountjoy have promised not to marry for three year without mother consent three year said mr prosper then will be dead buried harry did not tell uncle that in case difficulty might probably vanish a same degree of fate have robbed of poor uncle must have made owner of buston in such case a mr mountjoy might probably give way why be young lady to be kept from marriage for three year doe wish said that did not exactly think that miss mountjoy on own behalf did wish for so prolonged separation fact be sir that mr mountjoy be not best friend nephew of hers mountjoy scarborough have always be favorite be man always loses money at card be to have tretton now seems doe young lady say tretton wo move be not bit afraid have got word be enough for how be that mother must think possible that be what know three year be quite fixed quite say that altogether young lady who will be true to will be true to mother also harry shook head be quite willing to guarantee florence truth a to promise to did not think that promise to mother need be put on same footing will be very glad if can arrange other way three year be long time quite absurd know said harry with energy what made fix on three year know how did between mr mountjoy perhaps thought that might give time to nephew ten year must be same a far a be concerned florence be girl who when say that love man mean for suppose intend to remain three year what do intend to do one have to wait little see then there be long pause during harry stood twiddling finger have nothing farther to suggest thought that uncle might say something will come again to morrow uncle prosper said have got plan said uncle prosper what be uncle know that can lead to anything be of use of course if young lady will wait three year think be at anxious said harry might marry almost at once be what must like come live here in house why not be nobody 'd soon find that be nobody be nonsense uncle prosper of course be everybody in own house might endure for six month in year harry thought of sermon resolved at once to face boldly be only thinking how generous be be what mean know young lady perhaps might like living with old gentleman in regard to other six month will raise two hundred fifty pound to five hundred pound if think well of must come here first let see mother might come then there be pause must not know how to bear must not indeed let come after farther delay be at last decided on harry went away supremely happy very grateful mr prosper be left to meditate on terrible step have taken chapter lviii mr scarborough death be melancholy fact that mr barry when heard last story from tretton began to think that partner be not so wide awake a have hitherto always regarded a time run on result generally take place in close connection between old young ten year ago mr barry have looked up to mr grey with trustful respect word fell from mr grey be certainly word of truth be in mr barry then estimation word of wisdom also gradually altered feeling have grown up mr barry though did not doubt truth thought le about did doubt wisdom constantly wisdom practised under mr barry vice management be not quite same a mr grey mr barry have come to understand that though might be well to tell truth on occasion be folly to suppose that one else must do so have always thought that mr grey have gone little too fast in believing squire scarborough first story have be to nice discovered that be true mr grey must say mr barry must shake head declare that in having to deal with man of such varied intellect a mr scarborough there be coming at bottom of story there have be question of alteration in mode of conducting business of firm mr grey have be of course partner by whose judgment question of importance must ultimately be decided though mr barry have be sent to nice scarborough property be especially in mr grey branch have be loud in declaring iniquity of client have altogether made up mind that iniquity have be practised clerk in office have gone with trusting to great character for sober sagacity mr grey be not man who must easily be put out of high position respect generally felt for be too high carried before partner clerk too powerfully to lose at once prestige mr barry when heard new story looked at own favorite clerk almost winked eye when came to discus matter with mr grey declined even to pretend to be led at once by mr grey opinion gentleman who have be so very clever on one occasion may be very clever on have be argument mr grey reply have simply be to effect that can not twice catch old bird with chaff mr barry seemed however to think in discussing matter with favorite clerk that older bird became more often must be caught with chaff mr grey in day be very unhappy not made so simply by iniquity of client by insight got into partner aptitude for business began to have doubt about mr barry mr barry be tending toward sharp practice mr barry be beginning to love client not with proper attorney affection a child a sheep to be shorn with mr grey bill have gone out have be paid doubt money have in shape found way into mr grey pocket have never looked at two thing together mr barry seemed to be thinking of wool a client came be dismissed mr grey a thought of thing began to fancy that own style of business be becoming antiquated have said good word of mr barry to daughter just at period faith in in partner began to fail partner be becoming too strong for felt that be failing thing be changed did not love business a used to do have fancy knew that have fancy that fancy be not good for attorney when saw what be in mr barry mind a to new story from tretton became convinced that dolly be right dolly be not fit thought to be mr barry wife might have be wife of such a have partner be such be not probable that partner must have be such a be old time be changed said to old manner gone then determined that must put house in order leave firm man can not leave work forever without touch of melancholy be necessary that one must go to rummelsburg find what must be learned there mr grey have sworn that must have nothing to do with new story a soon a new story have be told to soon became apparent to that must have to do with a soon a breath must be out of old squire body one must take possession of tretton mountjoy must be left in house in accordance with mr grey theory augustus must be proper possessor augustus doubt must go down claim ownership unless matter must be decided to satisfaction of beforehand mr grey thought that there be little hope of such satisfaction must of course be for firm to see what must be done must ever have got such piece of business said to be at last settled among mr barry must go to rummelsburg have made inquiry at nice must go on with at rummelsburg mr barry started with mr quaverdale of st john gentleman whom harry annesley have consulted a to practicability of earning money by writing for press mr quaverdale be supposed to be german scholar therefore have expense paid for with bonus for time conversation between mr barry mr quaverdale took place on way home will be given a will best describe result of inquiry inquiry have be conducted by mr barry intelligence have owed so much to mr quaverdale extensive knowledge of language that two gentleman may be said a came home to be equally well instructed in affair of mr scarborough property have be too many for governor said barry mr barry governor be mr grey seems to that scarborough be gentleman who be apt to be too many for most men sharpest fellow ever came across in way of cheat in other walk of life if wanted one else to have property 'd come out with something to show that entail be moonshine when married again at nice must have quarrelled with eldest son already child be not above four five month old came from quaverdale be impression said barry that be then intention to divide property that be done a kind of protest against primogeniture then found that must fail that if came to explain whole matter to son must not consent to be guided by to accept division from what have seen of of be bad to guide after fashion then mountjoy got frightfully into hand of money lender in order to do became necessary that whole property must go to augustus must look upon a nice sort of old man said quaverdale rather have never got at to speak bit of mind to then how clever be in getting round own younger son property got into such condition that there be money enough to pay jew money have really lent augustus who be never quite sure of father thought must be best to disarm consented to pay getting back bond be very uncivil to squire told that sooner died better something of sort then squire immediately turned round sprung rummelsburg marriage upon have left stick about place to mountjoy must go to mountjoy acre horse bed book in twelve month time will have be divided among card player of metropolis said quaverdale have got nothing to do with if ever man did have lesson have have if chose to take man must ever have be saved in so miraculous manner there can be doubt that john scarborough ada sneyd be married at rummelsburg that will be found to be impossible to unmarry old mr sneyd lady mother be then present said quaverdale not doubt about that fritz deutchmann be present at marriage almost think that ought to have brought away with must have cost couple of hundred pound estate can bear that can have by sending for if must want then after many more word on same subject to same effect mr barry went on to give own private opinion in fact only blemish in old scarborough plan be that rummelsburg marriage be sure to come out sooner later do think so fritz deutchmann be only one of party alive be not probable that must ever have heard of tretton thing always do come out doe not signify now world will know how godless reprobate old scarborough have be will not interfere with mountjoy legitimacy world have pretty well understood already that old man have cared nothing for god man be bad enough according to other story that must have kept augustus so long in dark determined to give to bastard by mean of plot fraud world have got used to that world will simply be amused by other turn a world generally be not very fond of augustus scarborough entertains sort of good natured pity for mountjoy first marriage will be easily accepted there will be lawsuit suppose said quaverdale see that will have leg to stand on when old man dy property will be exactly a must have be latter intended fraud in favor of augustus will be understood a having be old scarborough farce jew be party who have really suffered augustus will have lost nothing to be by law entitled father might of course make what will pleased if augustus be uncivil to father father must of course alter will world must see world will be inclined to say that poor money lender have be awfully swindled world wo pity be not so sure be hard case to get hold of lot of men force to lend hundred pound without security without interest be what have be done in case will have mean of recovering anything not shilling wonder be that must have got three hundred thousand pound never must have have unless squire have wished to pave way back for mountjoy then made augustus do for in mind have be so clever that ought to be forgiven rascality there have be too punishment for probability of punishment have done nothing for law can touch have proposed to cheat people before must have cheated might be dead money lender will have be swindled awfully have never have ground of tangible complaint against 'who be ' have said ' know ' alleged that have lent money to eldest son 'that be a thought ' replied ' ai bound to come tell family arrangement about marriage ' if look at round be uncommonly well done when mr barry got back found that be generally admitted at chamber that business have be well done everybody be prepared to allow mr scarborough have not left screw loose in arrangement though be moment on death bed have be under surgical torture operation in fact slowly dying during whole period that have be thus busy one concerned in matter seemed to admire mr scarborough except mr grey whose anger with client became stronger louder grew admiration of world couple of barrister very learned in law be consulted gave a opinion that from evidence a shown to there must be doubt that mountjoy be legitimate there be reason in least for doubting for strange episode have occurred when in order to get better of law mr scarborough have declared that at time of mountjoy birth have not be married went on to declare on squire death rummelsburg marriage must of course have be discovered have given a opinion that squire have never dreamed of doing so great injustice either to elder younger son have simply desired a thought to cheat money lender have cheated beautifully that mr tyrrwhit must have be so very soft be marvel to only showed how very foolish sharp man of world might be when encountered one sharper augustus through attorney acting on own behalf consulted two other barrister whose joint opinion be not forthcoming quite at once may have to be stated augustus be declared by to have received at father hand most irreparable injury to extent that action for damage must in opinion lie have by accepting father first story altered whole course of life abandoned profession even paid large sum of money out of own pocket for maintenance of elder brother jury must probably award very considerable sum if jury must get hold of father while still living doubt furniture other property must remain might be held to be liable for present owner laches two learned lawyer did not think that action must be taken with probability of success against eldest son with reference to table chair when tretton estate must have become a learned lawyer have learned that old mr scarborough be at moment almost in articulo mortis must not be better that augustus must apply to elder brother to make such compensation a peculiarity of case must demand a opinion did not reach augustus till father be dead first alternative proposed be of use suppose sir have better communicate with mr scarborough mr barry said to partner on return not in name mr grey replied have put mr scarborough in such state that be not allowed to see business letter sir william brodrick be there now communication be made to mountjoy to augustus there be nothing for mountjoy to do case be in mr barry hand must take step till something must be done to oust from tretton augustus however

william by mr merton that must probably be so death to have terror life to for many week past have be so laden with pain a to make look forward to release from with hope business of life have pressed so hard upon a to make feel that must not tell what have be accomplished adjustment of such property a tretton required thought presence till have be adjusted clung to life with pertinacity have seemed to be oppressive now mountjoy debt have be paid mountjoy must be left bit happier having achieved so much be delighted to think that might there have come latterly claim upon equally strong that must wreak vengeance upon augustus have augustus abused for keeping in dark so long must have borne patiently have expected a much son have ridiculed laughed at made nothing of have at last told to die out of way must at rate do something before died have have revenge very bitter of kind augustus must be made to feel that have not be ridiculous not to be laughed at in last day have ruined son inevitably ruined be about to leave penniless upon earth now in last moment in very last there came upon feeling of pity in speaking of son once more called gu know how will all be sir if property be to be mine will be yours must be yours then will do anything for that will accept let starve have to earn bread say what wish sir will be done a far a can do make offer to of income settle on do at

assembled around death bed did respect have be made to love by what have done merton wrote next morning to friend henry annesley respecting scene poor old boy have gone at last in spite of fault feel a though have lost old friend to have be most kind did not know of sin must say that have be always loyal always charitable mr grey condemns world must condemn one can not make apology for without being ready to throw truth morality to dog if can imagine for state of thing in truth morality will be thought essential then old mr scarborough must be hero be bravest man ever knew be ready to look

to be guilty mountjoy when reached house of be now only occupant besides servant stood for hour in dining room with back toward fire thinking of position have many thing of to think in first place there be pseudo creditor who have just attacked in own park with much acrimony endeavored to comfort by telling that be certainly pseudo creditor to whom did not in fact owe penny mr barry must deal with then conscience reminded that have in truth be cheated cheated by father for benefit for pound have received must have claimed three four must no doubt have cheated how be now to measure extent of father fraud against of creditor though must have be right in to resist villany of jew felt that be not fit that must escape from fang altogether by father deceit have not become so dead to honor that noblesse oblige did still live within bosom yet there be nothing that must do to absolve bosom income of estate be nearly clear money brought in by late sale having sufficed to give gentleman father have chosen to pay be sure of income have just now asserted boldly that be legitimate heir to property did know that be so must believe father have not mr grey asserted that must not accept later evidence be not sure that augustus intended to proceed against be not aware that nothing must be called own till that lawsuit must have be decided if must be given against then harpy must have be treated only too well then there must be question at rate by a to what noblesse oblige might require of must take immediate step in regard to therefore for moment drove that trouble from mind what must do with a to future life to be persecuted abused by wretched men a have morning be fate must be intolerable must shut up from mr samuel hart still live in england then must face club if club must be kind enough to re elect then there came dark frown across brow a bethought that even at moment heart be longing to be once more among card must not escape to monaco there be happy among gambling

struggle knew declared made manner of excuse for former vicious life basing on hardness of treatment of did not know such assurance be vain buoyed up by such assurance resolved that future fate must be in hand that word alone must suffice to destroy to save thinking thus of future life resolved that must go at once to cheltenham throw what of tretton belonged to at girl foot must endure to rest

dolly will go on persevere if intend to do good good will come of chapter lxiii last of augustus scarborough when old mr scarborough be dead have be for while buried augustus made application in form to messrs grey barry made through own attorney have now received mr barry answer through same attorney nature of application have be in wise mr augustus scarborough have be put in to position of eldest son that did not in least doubt that such be true position that close inquiry have be made at time that lawyer including mr grey mr barry have assented to statement a then made by old mr scarborough that have then gone to work to pay brother debt for honor of family have paid partly out of own immediate pocket partly out of estate be same a own property that during brother abeyance have assisted in maintenance on brother return have taken to own home that then father have died that incredible new story have be told mr augustus scarborough be in way desirous of animadverting on father memory be forced to repeat belief that be father eldest son be in fact at moment legitimate owner of tretton in accordance with existing contract did not wish to dispute father will though father mental bodily condition at time of making of will might perhaps enable to do so with success will might be allowed to pas valid right of primogeniture must be held sacred nevertheless having mother memory in great honor felt ill inclined to drag family history before public for mother sake be open to compromise must advise that whole property that must pas under entail that be intended to be left by will must be valued that total must then be divided between if brother chose to take family mansion must be so augustus scarborough have desire to set over brother if offer be not accepted must at once go to law prove nice marriage have be in fact one marriage by father mother have be joined together there be proviso added to offer a valuation division of property must take time income at rate of two hundred pound month must be allowed to augustus till such time a must be completed such be offer augustus have authorized attorney to make there be delay in getting mountjoy to consent to reply before offer have reached mr barry be already at monte carlo with ready money father have left behind at venture that made at least at loss incurred told that be altogether doings of florence mountjoy returned to england consented to reply be eldest son meant to support position on mother behalf on own a to father will made in favor felt sure that brother must not have hardihood to dispute man bodily suffering be impediment to making will of mental incapacity have never heard father accused till accusation have now be made by own son be however well aware that must not be preferred a to what brother have done for be hardly worth while to answer allegation memory carried little farther back than day on brother turned out of room there be however many reason be put in at suggestion of mr barry why must not wish that brother must be left penniless if brother must be willing to withdraw altogether from lawsuit must lend co operation to speedy arrangement of family matter thousand year twenty five thousand pound must be made over to a younger brother portion to offer must be necessary that speedy reply must be given under such circumstance temporary income need be supplied be early in june when augustus be sitting in luxurious lodging in victoria street contemplating reply own lawyer have advised to accept offer have declared to dozen time since father death that in matter of property must either make spoon spoil horn lawyer be friend of own be not man who knew nothing of fact of case beyond what be told nothing of working of client mind augustus have looked to only for law in matter lawyer have declared law to be against client that father said about nice marriage will go for nothing will be shown that have object there certainly be such marriage doubt there be ceremony performed with object second marriage can not invalidate first though may be altogether invalidated rummelsburg marriage be will be established fact of rummelsburg marriage brother be doubt issue accept offer of income of course can come to term a to amount from brother character be probable enough that may increase such have be lawyer advice augustus be sitting there in lodging thinking of be not happy man a sat there in first place owed little money debt have come upon chiefly from lavish expenditure in maintaining mountjoy mountjoy servant upon travel at time have thought that by lavish expenditure might make tretton certainly own have not known brother character have thought that by such mean must keep down with head well under water brother might drink take to drinking regularly at monte carlo other place might so die must surely gamble into farther utter ruin at rate must be well out of way augustus in pride have be glad to feel that have brother well under thumb then debt have be paid with object of saving estate from litigation on part of creditor have be one great mistake have not known father father guile father strength why have not father died at once a world have assured must be case looking back must remember that idea of paying creditor have at first come from father simply a vague idea oh what crafty rascal father have be then have allowed in pride to insult father have spoken of father coming death a thing be desirable from moment father have plotted ruin must see now be still minded to make spoon found that must spoil horn have there be one to assist must still have persevered thought that must have persevered with lawyer who must really have taken up case with interest if mountjoy must be made to drink so a to die be still next in entail be brother heir must brother die without will so must be if took twenty five thousand pound to accept so poor modicum must go frightfully against grain with seemed to think that by taking allowance must bring back brother to long lived decency of life must have to surrender altogether that feeling of conscious superiority have be so much to d n fellow exclaimed to must not wonder if be in fellow pay first fellow here be lawyer second be brother when have sat there alone for hour must not make up mind when debt be paid must not have much above twenty five thousand pound father have absolutely extracted five thousand pound from toward paying brother debt money have be wanted immediately together with sum coming from new purchaser father son must subscribe five thousand pound to pay jew so have be represented to have borrowed money to carry out object have ever one be so swindled so cruelly treated might probably be explained five thousand pound might be added to twenty five thousand pound explanation must be necessary pride must rebel against on night when by chance have come across brother bleeding still half drunk a be about to enter lodging how completely under thumb have be now be offering of bounty wretched pittance then with half muttered curse execrated name of father brother of grey of barry of own lawyer at moment door be opened bosom friend septimus jones entered room at rate friend be nearest have to bosom be man without friend in true sense there be one who knew innermost wish of heart secret desire of soul there be thus so many who can divulge to none secret wish how can such one have friend who can advise a to what will do scarcely can honest man have friend because be so difficult for to find man who will believe in augustus have desire for such friend did desire one who must do bidding a though be such friend wanted friend who must listen to word act a though be truth mr septimus jones be man have chosen did not in least believe in mr septimus jones what doe man say asked septimus jones man be lawyer of whom augustus be now thinking at very moment manner of evil d n said augustus with heart what doe say a be to pay for what say be worth while listening to there be tone in voice of septimus jones declared at once diminution of usual respect so sounded at least to augustus be no longer assured heir of tretton in way be to be told of failure of golden hope must be odd thought if must not still hold dominion over septimus jones be not at sure that will listen to to a for that can do a like of course can do a like then remembered that must still use man a messenger if in other capacity of course want to compromise lawyer always proposes compromise can not be beat way be safe for have agreed to be term to be be question made offer half half nothing fairer can be imagined unless indeed choose to stand out for whole property what doe brother say must not use friend even a messenger without telling something of truth when think of of injustice can hardly hold proposes to give twenty five thousand pound twenty five thousand pound for everything everything yes what devil do suppose mean now just listen to then told tale a thought that ought to be told recapitulated money have spent on brother behalf that chose to say that have spent painted in glowing color position in must have be put by nice marriage be angry pathetic about creditor tore hair almost with vexation at treatment to be subjected think 'd take twenty five thousand pound said jones never 'd rather starve first be about what will have to do if that tell be true there be again that tone of disappearing subjection will be shot if must take money then there be pause must do go to law with afterward be what father must have done yes augustus have to acknowledge that be not a clever a father at last gave jones commission jones be to see brother to explain to that before question must be raised a to amount to be paid under compromise sum of ten thousand pound must be handed to augustus to reimburse for money out of pocket then jones be to say a out of own head that thought that augustus might probably accept fifty thousand pound in lieu of twenty five thousand pound must still leave bulk of property to mountjoy although mountjoy must be aware of great difficulty must be thrown in way by father conduct jones have to come back next day with intimation mountjoy have again gone abroad leaving full authority with mr barry jones be sent to mr barry without effect mr barry must discus matter with lawyer if augustus be so pleased with be sure that good must be done by conversation with mr jones month went on two month went by nothing came of be use coming here mr scarborough at last mr barry said to with scant courtesy be perfectly sure of ground there be not penny due not penny if will sign certain document must advise to do in presence of own lawyer there will be twenty five thousand pound for must excuse if say can not see again on subject unless accept brother liberality at time augustus be very short of money a be always case to whom owed aught became pressing a readiness to pay gradually receded to be so spoken to by lawyer scarborough of tretton a have be to be so addressed by man whom have regarded a old grey clerk be bitter indeed have be so exalted by nice marriage have be so lifted high in world that be now absolutely prostrate quarrelled with lawyer quarrelled also with septimus jones there be one with whom must discus matter rather one who must discus with on term so at last accepted money went daily into city in order that might turn into more what became of in city be hardly province of chronicle to tell chapter lxiv last of florence mountjoy now at last in chapter have to be told fate of florence mountjoy a far a can be told in page be at rate peculiarity to attach to herself by bond must not easily be severed who have once thought that might be able to win love attempt have be made to show how firm determined be affection of harry annesley how absolutely trusted in word when once have be given to have seemed to think that when have even nodded to in answer to assertion that desired to be wife trouble a regarded heart have be off mind there might be infinite trouble a to time a to ten year three year even one year trouble in inducing to promise that must become wife in opposition to mother have felt sure that never must be wife of one else how have at last succeeded in mitigating opposition of mother so a to make three year even one year appear to altogether impossible delay reader know how at last contrived to have own way altogether so that a florence told be merely ball in hand reader will have to know very shortly not shade of doubt have ever clouded harry mind a to eventual success since have nodded to at mr armitage ball though girl love have be so grand thing to have achieved be quite sure from moment that must be forever with mountjoy scarborough there have never come moment never must yet have be very confident so that have lived on assurance that moment must come self deportment natural to have be such that have shown assurance never must have succeeded must not le love sincerely when time came for to think what must do with few day after father death turned to a one prospect of salvation if cousin florence must be good to might yet be well have come by time to lose assurance have recognized harry annesley a enemy a have be told often enough in page harry be to hateful stumbling block have not be quite a sure of fidelity to a harry have be sure of to tretton might prevail trettons do so often prevail girl mother be on side so have gone to cheltenham true a needle to pole to try luck yet once again have gone

florence from hour in have first conceived idea that must make happy a wife have gone on growing upon with weight of love did not quite understand why must have loved so dearly thus be such mr hugh anderson with pair of horse on boulevard be to imagination most lovely sight must be painted then florence took mode of disabusing have be told hugh anderson gave required promise ala in what unfortunate moment have done so such be own thought for though be sure of own attachment to must not mount high enough to be a sure of to somebody else be sort of thing man ought to have be asked to promise said to third secretary having so determined made up mind to follow to england to try fortune once again florence have just wished harry good bye for day rather for week cared for nothing now
