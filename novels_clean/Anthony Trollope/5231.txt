royalty doe not commence till first four hundred be sold yours sincerely matilda carbury alfred booker esq literary chronicle office strand there be nothing in shocked mr booker laughed inwardly with pleasantly reticent chuckle a thought of lady carbury dealing with view of protestantism a thought also of numerous historical error into clever lady must inevitably fall in writing about matter of believed to know nothing be quite alive to fact that favourable notice in breakfast table of very thoughtful work called new tale of tub must serve even though written by hand of female literary charlatan must have compunction a to repaying service by fulsome praise in literary chronicle must not probably say that book be accurate must be able to declare that be delightful reading that feminine characteristic of queen have be touched with masterly hand that work be one must certainly make way into drawing room be adept at sort of work knew well how to review book a lady carbury criminal queen without bestowing much trouble on reading must almost do without cutting book so that value for purpose of after sale might not be injured yet mr booker be honest man have set face persistently against many literary malpractice stretched out type insufficient line french habit of meandering with few word over entire page have be rebuked by with conscientious strength be supposed to be rather aristides among reviewer circumstanced a be must not oppose altogether to usage of time bad of course be bad said to young friend who be working with on periodical who doubt that how many very bad thing be there that do if be to attempt to reform bad way at once must never do good thing be not strong enough to put world straight doubt if be such be mr booker then there be letter to mr ferdinand alf mr alf managed a be supposed chiefly owned evening pulpit during last two year have become quite property a men connected with press be in habit of saying evening pulpit be supposed to give daily to reader have be said done up to two o'clock in day by leading people in metropolis to prophesy with wonderful accuracy what must be saying doings of twelve following hour be effected with air of wonderful omniscience not unfrequently with ignorance hardly surpassed by arrogance writing be clever fact if not true be well invented argument if not logical be seductive presiding spirit of paper have gift at rate of knowing what people for whom catered must like to read how to get subject handled so that reading must be pleasant mr booker literary chronicle did not presume to entertain special political opinion breakfast table be decidedly liberal evening pulpit be much given to politics held strictly to motto have assumed nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri consequently have at time invaluable privilege of abusing what be being done whether by one side by other newspaper wish to make fortune must never waste column weary reader by praising anything eulogy be invariably dull fact that mr alf have discovered have utilized mr alf have moreover discovered fact abuse from who occasionally praise be considered to be personally offensive who give personal offence will sometimes make world too hot to hold censure from who be always finding fault be regarded so much a matter of course that cease to be objectionable caricaturist who draw only caricature be held to be justifiable let take what liberty may with man face person be trade business call upon to vilify that touch be artist to publish series of portrait in two out of dozen be made to be hideous must certainly make two enemy if not more mr alf never made enemy for praised one a far a expression of newspaper went be satisfied with nothing personally mr alf be remarkable man one knew whence came what have be be supposed to have be born german jew certain lady said that must distinguish in tongue slightest possible foreign accent nevertheless be conceded to that knew england a only englishman can know during last year two have come up a phrase go have come up very thoroughly have be black balled at three four club have effected entrance at two three others have learned manner of speaking of have rejected calculated to leave on mind of hearer conviction that society in question be antiquated imbecile moribund be never weary of implying that not to know mr alf not to be on good term with mr alf not to understand let have be born where might how might be always to be recognised a desirable acquaintance be to be altogether out in dark so constantly asserted implied men woman around began at last to believe mr alf became acknowledged something in different world of politics letter fashion be good looking man about forty year old carrying a though be much younger spare below

a follows dear mr alf do tell who wrote review on fitzgerald barker last poem only know wo remember nothing done so well must think poor wretch will hardly hold head up again before autumn be fully deserved have patience with pretension of must be poet who contrive by toadying underground influence to get volume placed on drawing room table know one to whom world have be so good natured in way a to fitzgerald barker have heard of one who have extended good nature to length of reading poetry be not singular how men continue to obtain reputation of popular authorship without adding word to literature of country worthy of note be accomplished by unflagging assiduity in system of puffing to puff to get one self puffed have become different branch of new profession ala wish might find class open in lesson must be taken by such poor tyro a myself much a hate thing from very soul much a admire consistency with pulpit have opposed be so much in want of support for own little effort be

descend among low thing in order might one day have pride of feeling have succeeded by own work in providing for need of child have not a yet commenced descent downwards therefore be still bold enough to tell that will look not with concern with deep interest to anything may appear in pulpit respecting criminal queen venture to think that book though wrote have importance of own will secure for

forty man of thirty six be young enough for girl henrietta have opinion of own liked cousin did not love be amazed even annoyed by offer have praised praised house so loudly to mother having in innocence never dreamed of such proposition a so now found difficult to give adequate reason for refusal yes have undoubtedly said that cousin be charming have not meant charming in way did refuse offer very plainly still with apparent lack of persistency when roger suggested that must take few month to think of mother supported roger suggestion must say nothing stronger than be afraid that thinking about must not do good first visit to carbury have be made in september in following february went there again much against grain a far a own wish be concerned when there have be cold constrained almost dumb in presence of cousin before left offer be renewed henrietta declared that must not do a must have must give reason only did not love cousin in way roger declared that by mean

have got to tell something paul anything serious very serious to may say so serious that nothing in own life can approach in importance have unconsciously assumed that look friend so thoroughly understood indicating resolve to hold to what believed to be own to fight if fighting be necessary montague knew well became half aware that have done something knew not what militating against serious resolve of friend looked up said nothing have offered hand in marriage to cousin henrietta said roger very gravely miss carbury yes to henrietta carbury have not accepted have refused twice still have hope of success perhaps have right to hope do tell just a be everything in life to depends upon think may count upon sympathy why did not tell before said paul montague in hoarse voice then there have come sudden rapid interchange of quick speaking between men of speaking truth exactly of declaring to be in right to be ill used by other of equally hot equally generous equally unreasonable montague at once asserted that also loved henrietta carbury blurted out assurance in baldest most incomplete manner still in such word a to leave doubt no have not said word to have intended to consult roger carbury must have done so in day two perhaps on very day have not roger spoken to have of shilling in world said roger now know what feeling be must abandon then montague declared that have right to speak to miss carbury did not suppose that miss carbury cared straw about have not least reason to think that did be altogether impossible have right to chance that chance

younger sister of two though older than brother roger uncle many year since have taken wife out to california have there become american have large tract of land growing wool wheat fruit whether prospered whether did not have not always be plain to montagues carburys at home intercourse between two family have in quite early day of paul montague life created affection between roger who a will be understood by who have carefully followed above family history be not in degree related to other roger when young man have have charge of boy education have sent to oxford oxford scheme to be followed by bar to end on one of many judicial bench of country have not succeeded paul have got into row at balliol have be rusticated have then got into row be sent down indeed have talent for row though a roger carbury always declared there be nothing really wrong about of paul be then twenty one took money out to california joined uncle have perhaps idea based on very insufficient ground that

probably guessed something of truth spoke word to other on subject before left manor squire again pleaded cause with henrietta pleaded in vain henrietta be colder than ever made use of one unfortunate phrase destroyed effect coldness might have have said that be too young to think of marrying yet have meant to imply that difference in age be too great have not known how to say be easy to tell that in twelvemonth must be older be impossible to convince that number of twelvemonth must alter disparity between cousin even disparity be not now strongest reason for feeling sure that must not marry roger carbury within week of departure of lady carbury from manor house paul montague returned returned a still dear friend have promised before went that must not see henrietta again for three month must promise nothing further if wo take there be reason why must try have be argument roger must not accede to justice even of seemed to that paul be bound to retire altogether partly because have got

might well come to pas that must be unable to keep home for daughter in trouble constantly appealed to roger carbury for advice however never followed recommended to give up house in town to find home for daughter elsewhere also for felix if must consent to follow must not so consent then let young man bear brunt of own misdoings doubtless when must no longer get bread in london must find out roger be always severe when spoke of baronet seemed to lady carbury to be severe in truth did not ask for advice in order that might follow have plan in head with knew that roger must not sympathise still thought that sir felix might bloom burst out into grandeur wealth fashion a husband of great heiress in spite of son vice be proud of in anticipation when succeeded in obtaining from money a in case of l when with brazen faced indifference to remonstrance started off to club at two in morning when with impudent drollery almost boasted of hopelessness of debt sickness of heart must come upon must

such men a lord alfred grendall sir felix carbury then a to great chairman did not everybody know in spite of duchess mr melmotte be gigantic swindler although there be more than one immediate cause for bitterness between roger loved paul montague well must not bear with patience appearance of friend name on list now be asked for warm congratulation because sir felix carbury be one of board did not know to despise most sir felix for belonging to board board for having director new sphere of life said to only proper sphere for must be newgate there be trouble have asked paul montague to come to carbury for special week paul have accepted invitation with constancy be perhaps strongest characteristic clung to old affection for man must not bear idea of permanent quarrel though knew that there must be quarrel if man interfered with dearest hope have asked down to carbury intending that name of henrietta carbury must not be mentioned between now be proposed to that henrietta carbury must be at manor house at very time of paul visit made up mind at once that must tell paul not to come wrote two letter at once to lady carbury be very short must be delighted to see henrietta at time named must be very glad must suit felix to come also did not say word about board young man probable usefulness in new sphere of life to montague letter be longer be always best to be open true said since be kind enough to say that must come to lady carbury have proposed to visit just at same time to bring daughter after what have passed between need hardly say must not make welcome here together be not pleasant to to have to ask to postpone visit think will not accuse of want of hospitality towards paul wrote back to say that be sure that there be want of hospitality that must remain in town suffolk be not especially picturesque county can be said that scenery round carbury be grand beautiful there be little prettiness attached to house ground around gave charm of own carbury river so

proprietor especially so to roger a in day of sanitary consideration have be felt necessary to keep clean with at rate moving water in else to fill up abolish altogether plan of abolishing have to be thought of be seriously discussed about ten year since then be decided that proceeding must altogether alter character of house must destroy garden must create waste of mud round place must take year to beautify even to make endurable then important question have be asked by intelligent farmer who have long be tenant on property fill un oop eh eh sooner said than doone squoire where be stoof to come from squire therefore have given up that idea instead of abolishing moat have made prettier than ever high road from bungay to beccles ran close to house so close that gable end of building be separated from only by breadth of moat short private road not above hundred yard in length led to bridge faced front door bridge be old high with sundry architectural pretension guarded by iron gate

for most part long narrow with large wide fire place deep wainscoting taking altogether one must be inclined to say that be picturesque rather than comfortable such a be owner be very proud of with pride of never spoke to anyone endeavoured studiously to conceal have made known to who knew well house of gentry around be superior to in material comfort general accommodation to none of belonged that thoroughly established look of old county position belonged to carbury bundlesham where primeros lived be finest house in part of county looked a if have be built within last twenty year be surrounded by new shrub new lawn by new wall new outhouse savoured of trade so at least thought roger carbury though never said word caversham be very large mansion built in early part of george iii

carbury possessed nothing must be called park enclosure beyond garden being merely so many home paddock house of eardly be ugly bad bishop palace be excellent gentleman residence then that too be comparatively modern have peculiar feature of own now carbury manor house be peculiar in eye of owner be pre eminently beautiful often troubled to think what must come of place when be gone be at present forty year old be perhaps a healthy man a must find in whole county around who have known a grew into manhood among especially farmer of neighbourhood still regarded a young man spoke of at country fair a young squire when in happiest mood must be almost boy still have something of old fashioned boyish reverence for elder of late there have grown up great care within breast care doe not often perhaps in day bear so heavily on men heart a used to do have asked cousin to marry having assured with certainty that did love better than other woman have declined have refused more than once believed implicitly when told that must not love have way of believing people especially when such belief be opposed to own interest have none of self confidence make man think that if opportunity be allowed can win woman even in spite of herself if be fated that must not succeed with henrietta then so felt assured marriage must now be possible to in case must look out for heir must regard simply a stop gap among carburys in case must never enjoy luxury of doing best must with property in order that son of own might enjoy now sir felix be next heir roger be hampered by entail must leave acre of property a pleased in one respect natural succession to by sir felix must generally be considered fortunate have happened that title have be won in lower branch of family be succession to take place family title family property must go together doubt to sir felix such arrangement must seem to be most proper thing in world a must also to lady carbury be not that looked to carbury manor a future home of child to present owner of property have very strong objection be not only that thought ill of baronet so ill a to feel thoroughly convinced that good must come from quarter thought ill also of baronetcy sir patrick to thinking have be altogether unjustifiable in accepting enduring title knowing that must leave behind property adequate for support baronet so thought roger carbury must be rich man rich enough to grace rank assumed to wear title according to roger doctrine on such subject must make man gentleman if improperly worn might degrade man who must otherwise be gentleman thought that gentleman born bred acknowledged a such without doubt must not be made more than gentleman by title queen must give with old fashioned notion roger hated title have fallen upon branch of family certainly must not leave property to support title sir felix unfortunately possessed sir felix be natural heir man felt constrained almost a by divine law to see that land went by natural descent though be in degree fettered a to disposition did not presume to have more than life interest in estate be duty to see that went from carbury to carbury a long a there be carbury to hold especially duty to see that must go from hand at death unimpaired in extent value there be reason why must die for next twenty thirty year be to die sir felix must undoubtedly dissipate acre then there must be end of carbury in such case roger carbury must at rate have done duty knew that human arrangement can be fixed let care in making be ever so great to thinking must be better that estate must be dissipated by carbury than held together by stranger must stick to old name while there be one to bear to old family while member of be left so thinking have already made will leaving entire property to man whom of others most despised must die without child in afternoon of day on lady carbury be expected wandered about place thinking of how infinitely better must be that must have heir of own how wonderfully beautiful must world be to if at last cousin must consent to be wife how wearily insipid must be if such consent must be obtained from then thought much of welfare too in very truth did not like lady carbury saw through character judging with almost absolute accuracy woman be affectionate seeking good thing for others rather than for herself be essentially worldly believing that good must come out of evil falsehood might in certain condition be better than truth that sham pretence might do work of true service that strong house might be built upon sand be lamentable to that girl loved must be subjected to teaching live in atmosphere so burdened with falsehood must not touch of pitch at last defile in heart of heart believed that loved paul montague of paul be beginning to fear evil what sham must be man who consented to pretend to sit a one of board of director to manage enormous enterprise with such colleague a lord alfred grendall sir felix carbury under absolute control of one a mr augustus melmotte be not building house upon sand with vengeance what life must be for henrietta carbury be to marry man striving to become rich without labour without capital who might one day be wealthy next beggar city adventurer who of men be to vilest most dishonest strove to think well of paul montague such be life feared young man be preparing for then went into house wandered up through room two lady be to occupy a host host without wife mother sister be duty to see that thing be comfortable may be doubted whether must have be so careful have mother be coming alone in smaller room of two hanging be white room be sweet with may flower brought white rose from hot house placed in glass on dressing table surely must know who put there then stood at open window looking down upon lawn gazing vacantly for hour till heard wheel of carriage before front door during half hour resolved that must try again a though there have a yet be repulse chapter xv must remember that be mother be so kind of said lady carbury grasping cousin hand a got out of carriage kindness be on part said roger felt so much before dared to ask to take did so long to get into country do so love carbury where must carbury go to escape from london smoke to old house be afraid henrietta will find dull oh said hetta smiling ought to remember that be never dull in country

to be at shocked at telling have got to be quite friend will bishop like to meet why must not bishop like to meet have told bishop about bishop particularly wish to know wo hurt bishop hetta will find very dull sha find dull mr carbury said henrietta be to escape from eternal party that came down here said lady carbury have nevertheless be anxious to hear what guest be expected at manor house sir

wednesday if like will go know be to have guest said lady carbury what guest melmottes be coming to lady carbury a made announcement felt that voice countenance self possession be failing that must not mention thing a must matter be indifferent to melmottes coming to caversham said roger looking at henrietta who blushed with shame a remembered that have be brought into lover house solely in order that brother might have opportunity of seeing marie melmotte in country oh yes madame melmotte told take be very intimate mr longestaffe ask melmottes to visit at caversham why not must almost a soon have believed that might have be induced to ask here fancy roger mr longestaffe doe want little pecuniary assistance condescends to get in way suppose will make difference soon whom one know whom one doe thing be a be of course never will be again perhaps be for better wo say be must have thought that man a mr longestaffe might have kept such man a mr melmotte out of wife drawing room henrietta became redder than ever even lady carbury flushed up a remembered that roger carbury knew that have taken daughter to madame melmotte ball thought of a soon a word be spoken then tried to make half apology approve of in london know think be very much worse in country then there be movement lady be shown into room roger again went out into garden began to feel that understood lady carbury have come down to house in order that might be near melmottes there be something in felt difficult not to resent be for love of that be there have felt that henrietta ought not to have be brought to house must have forgiven that because presence there be charm to must have forgiven that even while be thinking that mother have brought there with object of disposing of if be so mother object must be same a own such manoeuvre must pardon though must not approve self love have to extent be gratified now saw that house have be simply used in order that vile project of marrying two vile people to other might be furthered a be thinking of lady carbury came out to in garden have changed travelling dress made pretty a well knew how to do now dressed face in sweetest smile mind also be full of melmottes wished to explain to stern unbending cousin good might come to hers by alliance with heiress can understand roger said taking arm that must not like people people melmottes dislike how must dislike people never saw dislike who seek society simply because have reputation of being rich meaning not meaning dislike a know very well though do dislike fact that must run after people be thinking of longestaffes then do suppose friend that run after for own gratification do think that go to house because find pleasure in magnificence that follow down here for good that will do must not follow at will go back if bid must first explain what mean know son condition better fear than doe roger nodded assent to said nothing what be to do only chance for young man in position be that must marry girl with money be good looking ca deny nature have done enough for must take a be be put into army very young be very young when came into possession of own small fortune might have done better how many young men placed in such temptation do well a be have nothing left fear not therefore be not imperative that must marry girl with money call that stealing girl money lady carbury oh roger how hard be man must be hard soft be best with woman think that little softness have most effect want to make understand about melmottes stand to reason that girl will not marry felix unless love doe love why must not be girl to be debarred from being loved because have money of course look to be married why must not have felix if like best can not sympathize with anxiety so to place that will not be disgrace to name to family have better not talk about family lady carbury think so much about will never get to say that think family will be benefited by marriage with daughter of mr melmotte look upon a dirt in gutter to in old fashioned way money if have can make difference when there be question of marriage people at rate must know something of other who know anything of man who can be sure that be daughter must give fortune when married yes come to that men say openly that be adventurer swindler one pretend to think that be gentleman there be consciousness among who speak of that amasses money not by honest trade by unknown trick a doe card sharper be one whom must not admit into kitchen much le to table on score of own merit because have learned art of making money not only put up with settle upon carcase a so many bird of prey do mean that felix must not marry girl even if love other shook head in disgust feeling sure that idea of love on part of young man be sham pretence not only a regarded also mother must not quite declare yet desired that must understand that thought so have nothing more to say about continued have gone on in london must have said nothing be affair of mine when be told that girl be in neighbourhood at house a caversham felix be coming here in order that may be near to prey when be asked to be party to thing can only say what think son must be welcome to house because be son cousin little a approve mode of life must have wished that have chosen other place for work that have on hand if wish roger will return to london

henrietta must have put up with for sake of benefit to come must have forgiven more easily because perhaps might not have be deserved for son be prepared to fight if did not defend who must be grieved roger that must have troubled with visit think that have better go be very harsh crush have not meant to be harsh say that felix be seeking for prey that be to be brought here to be near prey what can be more harsh than at rate must remember that be mother illustration must remember that be mother expressed sense of injury very well roger began to be ashamed of to think that have spoken unkind word

that man in own house be bound to exercise courtesy towards guest sweeter softer more gracious than world required elsewhere of guest of own name be best entitled to such courtesy at carbury held place in trust for use of others if there be one among others to whom house must be house of refuge from care not abode of trouble on whose behalf be possible must make very air softer flower sweeter than wont to whom must declare be such word possible to tongue that of of house of thing there be mistress whether must condescend to love that one be cousin hetta now have be told by guest that have be so rough to that daughter must return to london must not acquit knew that have be rough have said very hard word be true that must not have expressed meaning without hard word have repressed meaning without self reproach in present mood must not comfort by justifying have told that ought to have remembered that felix be son a spoke have acted well part of outraged mother heart be so soft that though knew woman to be false son to be worthless utterly condemned look where must there be comfort when have sat hour upon bridge turned towards house to dress for dinner to prepare for apology

extent of triumph be enabled by disposition to use thoroughly felix might now come down to carbury go over from thence to caversham prosecute wooing master of carbury must make further objection felix if must come must not now be snubbed roger must understand that be constrained to courtesy by former severity of language such point a lady carbury never missed understood too though be soft gracious in bearing endeavouring to make house a pleasant a must to two guest felt that have be cheated out of undoubted right to disapprove of connection with melmottes in course of evening there came note rather bundle of note from caversham addressed to roger be in form of letter lady pomona be sorry to say that longestaffe party be prevented from having pleasure of dining at carbury hall by fact that

present mood with be not comfortable host what nonsense did talk about melmottes suppose mamma mr mr melmotte can be nice people why must be a nice a anybody else pray henrietta let have of nonsense from when come from superhuman virtue of poor dear roger have to be borne beg that will not copy mamma think be unkind will think very unkind if take upon to abuse people who be able willing to set poor felix on leg word from might undo that be doing what word what word word if have influence with brother must use in inducing to hurry on be sure girl be willing enough did refer to father then why doe not go to mr melmotte suppose be delicate about on score of money if roger must only let be understood that felix be heir to place that day will be sir felix carbury of carbury think there must be difficulty even with old melmotte how must do mamma if cousin be to die a be now must be so brother must be heir must not think of thing mamma why do dare to tell what be to think be not to

henrietta be not going to say anything to of kind be not quick enough to understand of what infinite service might be to without in way hurting henrietta must fain have answered that cousin be quick enough for anything be by far too honest to take part in such scheme a proposed refrained however be silent there be sympathy on matter between mother be beginning to understand tortuous maze of manoeuvre in mother mind have learned to work to dislike almost to despise felt to be duty to abstain from rebuke in afternoon lady carbury alone have driven into beccles that might telegraph to son be to dine at caversham on monday come on saturday if can be there lady carbury have many doubt a to wording of message female in office might too probably understand who be who be spoken of a being at caversham might understand also project speak of publicly then be essential that felix must know how great certain be opportunity afforded to have promised to come on saturday return on monday unless warned must too probably stick to plan throw over longestaffes dinner party again if be told to come simply for monday must throw over chance of wooing on sunday be lady carbury desire to get down for a long period a be possible nothing surely must so tend to bring to keep a knowledge that heiress be already in neighbourhood then returned shut up in bedroom worked for hour two at paper be

better than town so do said roger like suffolk people be hearty radicalism be not quite so rampant a be elsewhere poor people touch hat rich people think of poor there be something left among of old english habit be so nice said lady carbury something left of old english ignorance said bishop same dare say be improving like rest of world what beautiful flower have here mr carbury at rate can grow flower in suffolk mr yeld bishop wife be sitting next to priest be in truth somewhat afraid of neighbour be perhaps little stauncher than husband in protestantism though be willing to admit that mr barham might not have ceased to be gentleman when became roman catholic priest be not quite sure that be expedient for husband to have much to do with mr carbury have not taken unawares notice have be given that priest be to be there bishop have declared that must be very happy to meet priest mr yeld have have misgiving never ventured to insist on opinion after bishop have expressed have idea right be right wrong wrong roman catholic be wrong therefore ought to be put down thought also that if there be priest there must be roman catholic mr barham be doubt man of good family did make difference mr barham always made approach very gradually taciturn humility with commenced operation be in exact proportion to enthusiastic volubility of advanced intimacy mr yeld thought that became to address to few civil word replied to with shame faced modesty that almost overcame dislike to profession spoke of poor of beccles being very careful to allude only to material position there be too much beer drunk doubt young woman must have finery where did get money to buy wonderful bonnet appeared sunday mr barham be very meek agreed to everything be said doubt have plan ready formed for inducing mr yeld to have mass said regularly within husband palace did not even begin to bring about on occasion be not till made apparently chance allusion to superior church attending quality of people that mr yeld drew up changed conversation by observing that there have be great deal of rain lately when lady be gone bishop at once put in way of conversation with priest asked question a to morality of beccles be evidently mr barham opinion that people be more moral than other people though very much poorer irish always drink said mr hepworth not so much a english think said priest be not to suppose that be irish of flock greater proportion be english be astonishing how little know of neighbour said bishop of course be aware that there be certain number of person of persuasion round about indeed must give exact number in diocese in own immediate neighbourhood must not put hand upon family know to be roman catholic be not lord because there be none of course not be because a say know neighbour think here in suffolk must be chiefly poor said mr hepworth be chiefly poor who at first put faith in saviour said priest think analogy be hardly correctly drawn said bishop with curious smile be speaking of who be still attached to old creed saviour be teacher of new religion that poor in simplicity of heart must be first to acknowledge truth of new religion be in accordance with idea of human nature that old faith must remain with poor after have be abandoned by rich be not so easily intelligible illustration bishop think that priest analogy be not correct roman population still believed said carbury when patrician have learned to regard god a simply useful bugbear patrician have not ostensibly abandoned religion people clung to thinking that master ruler clung to also poor have ever be salt of earth lord said priest begs whole question said bishop turning to host beginning to talk about breed of pig have lately be imported into palace stye father barham turned to mr hepworth went on with argument rather began be mistake to suppose that catholic in county be poor there be s b s c s d s knew name be proud of fidelity to faithful one be really salt of earth who must day be enabled by fidelity to restore england to pristine condition bishop have truly said that of many of neighbour did not know to what church belonged father barham though have not a yet be twelve month in county knew name of nearly roman catholic within border priest be very zealous man said bishop afterwards to roger carbury doubt that be excellent gentleman be perhaps little indiscreet like because be doing best can according to light without reference to own worldly welfare be very grand be perfectly willing to respect know must care to talk very freely in company be sure must repeat nothing perhaps not must always be thinking that be going to get best of think answer said mr yeld to husband a went home of course want to be prejudiced protestant be protestant roman catholic be roman catholic may say same of liberal conservative must have decline to meet other be quite same dear after religion be religion ought to be said bishop of course mean to put up against dear know want to meet mr barham again know that do said bishop if come in way hope will treat civilly chapter xvii marie melmotte hears love tale on following morning there came telegram from felix be to be

entertained have be barely suggested from one to among lady of family dolly must marry marie melmotte have be abandoned dolly with vapid folly have will of own among own family be invincible be never

handsomeness have not quite succeeded in london georgiana have be more admired boasted among friend of offer have rejected friend on other hand be apt to tell of many failure nevertheless held head up have not a yet come down among rural whitstables at present moment hand be empty be devoting to such performance of treaty a must make impossible for father to leave part of unfulfilled for few minute

anybody did not dislike much be not given to disliking people strongly except at moment in offended regarded simply a mean by portion of mr melmotte wealth might be conveyed to us in regard to

upon be walking in shrubbery quite apart from house where be unseen so a in duty bound put arm round waist kissed oh felix said giving face up to one ever did before did not in least believe be matter

be that must have quarrelled with forget mother dolly longestaffe be about most intimate friend have in world doe not justify in being uncivil to father mother must remember what came here for what did come for might see marie melmotte more at ease than can in london house be settled said sir felix in most indifferent tone that must assume settled a far a girl be concerned ca very well go to old fellow for consent down here do mean to say felix marie melmotte have accepted told that before dear felix oh boy in joy mother took unwilling son in arm caressed here be first step taken not only to success to such magnificent splendour a must make son to be envied by young men to be envied by mother in england no did tell before be so happy be really fond of wonder that girl must be fond of ca say anything about think mean to stick to if be firm of course father will give way at last father always do give way when girl be firm why must oppose know that will be man of rank with title of own suppose what want be gentleman for girl see why must not be perfectly satisfied with enormous wealth thousand year so ca make difference then made one of director at board oh felix be almost too good to be true ai quite sure that care very much about being married know oh felix pray say that why must like being married be very nice girl will be so fond of let feeling of kind come over pray will be able to do just what please when once question of money be settled of course can hunt a often a like can have house in part of london please must understand by time how very disagreeable be to have to get on without established income quite understand that if be once done must never have more trouble of kind there must be plenty of money for everything a long a live must be complete success know how to say enough to to tell how dearly love to make understand how well think have done then caressed again be almost beside in agony of mingled anxiety joy if after beautiful boy who have lately be disgrace great trouble because of poverty must shine forth to world a baronet with l year how glorious must be must have known did know how poor how selfish creature be gratification at prospect of splendour obliterated sorrow with vileness of character sometimes oppressed be to win girl with father money sister must be better for except in that burden of maintaining must be taken from shoulder magnificence must be established be son prospect of fortune splendour be sufficient to elate into very heaven of beautiful dream felix continued really must stay go to longestaffes ' to morrow will only be one day now be to run away run away what nonsense talk if be to start back to london at once mean must be affront to very thing to set melmotte against must lay out to please indeed must oh bother said sir felix nevertheless allowed to be persuaded to remain matter be important even to consented to endure almost unendurable nuisance of spending day at manor house lady carbury almost lost in delight did not know where to turn for sympathy if cousin be not so stiff so pig headed so wonderfully ignorant of affair of world must have at rate consented to rejoice with though might not like felix who a mother admitted to herself have be rude to cousin must have rejoiced for sake of family a be did not dare to tell must have received tidings with silent scorn even henrietta must not be enthusiastic felt that though must have delighted to expatiate on great triumph must be silent at present must now be great effort to ingratiate with mr melmotte at dinner party at caversham during whole of evening roger carbury hardly spoke to cousin hetta there be not much conversation between till quite late when father barham came in for supper have be over at bungay among people there have walked back taking carbury on way what did think of bishop roger asked rather imprudently not much of a bishop doubt that make very nice lord that doe more good among neighbour than average lord put power responsibility into hand of one sufficient to make bishop nine tenth of clergy in diocese must be guided by in matter of clerical conduct might come before because know that have strong opinion of own must not therefore desire to dominate theirs take of bishop have opinion if there be one left see how far clergy consent to teaching roger turned round took up book be already becoming tired of pet priest always abstained from saying word derogatory to new friend religion in man hearing new friend did not by mean return compliment perhaps also roger felt that be to take up cudgel for argument might be worsted in combat a in such combat success be won by practised skill rather than by truth henrietta be also reading felix be smoking elsewhere wondering whether hour must ever wear away in castle of dulness in card be to be seen where except at meal time there be nothing to drink lady carbury be quite willing to allow priest to teach that appliance for dissemination of religion outside own church must be naught suppose bishop be sincere in belief said with sweetest smile be sure hope so have possible reason to doubt a to two three whom have seen indeed a to rest whom have not seen be so much respected everywhere a good pious men doubt nothing tends so much to respect a good income may be excellent men without being excellent bishop find fault with much with system by be controlled be probable that man must be fitted to select guide for other men soul because have succeeded by infinite labour in vocation in becoming leader of majority in house of common indeed said lady carbury who did not in least understand nature of question put to when have got bishop be likely that man must be able to do duty in capacity who have power of own to decide whether clergyman under be be not fit for duty hardly indeed english people of that being richest at present most powerful like to play at having church though there be not sufficient faith in to submit to control of church do think men must be controlled by clergyman mr barham in matter of faith do so suppose do at least make profession declare to be duty to submit to spiritual pastor master thought be for child said lady carbury clergyman in catechism say good child be what be taught a child before have made profession of faith to bishop in order that might know duty when have ceased to be child quite agree however that matter a viewed by church be childish altogether intended only for child a rule adult with want religion be afraid be true of great many be marvellous to that when man think of must not be driven by very fear to comfort of safer faith unless indeed enjoy security of absolute infidelity be worse than anything said lady carbury with sigh shudder know that be worse than belief be belief said priest with energy than creed sits so easily on man that doe not even know what contains never asks a repeat whether be to credible incredible be very bad said lady carbury be getting too deep think said roger putting down book have in vain be trying to read think be so pleasant to have little serious conversation on sunday evening said lady carbury priest drew back into chair smiled be quite clever enough to understand lady carbury have be talking nonsense clever enough also to be aware of cause of roger uneasiness lady carbury might be easier converted because understood nothing be fond of ambitious talking roger carbury might possibly be forced into conviction by very feeling at present made unwilling to hear argument like hearing church ill spoken of said roger must like if thought ill of spoke well of said priest therefore le said sooner mended said roger rising from chair upon father barham took departure walked away to beccles might be that have sowed seed might be

perhaps might think of getting up lady carbury saw danger turned over affair on side in own mind must also see house in grosvenor square expenditure without limit congregating duchess general

of book room great financier be accustomed to spend sunday afternoon here generally with company of lord alfred grendall may be supposed that be meditating on million arranging price of money fund for new york paris london exchange on occasion be waked from slumber seemed to have be enjoying with cigar in mouth how do do sir felix said suppose want lady have just be in drawing room thought 'd look in on a came down immediately occurred to melmotte that baronet have come about share of plunder out of railway at once resolved to be stern in manner perhaps rude also believed that must thrive best by resenting interference with in capacity a financier thought that have risen high enough to venture on such conduct experience have told that men who be only half plucked might easily be cowed by savage assumption of superiority too have generally advantage of understanding game while with whom be concerned did not at rate more than half understand must thus trade on timidity on ignorance of colleague when of sufficed to give undisputed mastery then cultivated cupidity of friend liked young associate because be more timid le greedy than elder lord nidderdale suggestion have soon be put at rest mr melmotte anticipated greater difficulty with sir felix lord alfred have be obliged to buy be very glad to see said melmotte assuming certain exaltation of eyebrow who have many dealing with often found to be very disagreeable be hardly day for business sir felix yet place for business sir felix wished at beargarden certainly have come about business business of particular sort marie have told that of day sunday must be best have also told that father be more likely to be in good humour on sunday than on other day sir felix felt that have not be received with good humour did mean to intrude mr melmotte said dare say not only thought 'd tell might have be going to speak about railway oh dear mother be saying to down in country that hoped attended to business told that there be nothing to attend to mother doe understand anything at about said sir felix woman never do well what can do for now that be here mr melmotte be come be come to in short mr melmotte want to propose a suitor for daughter hand d do well yes hope will give consent know be coming then yes know wife doe know have never spoken to about perhaps miss melmotte have how long have understood other have be attached to ever since saw said sir felix have indeed have spoken to sometimes know how kind of thing go on be blessed if do know how ought to go on know that when large sum of money be supposed to be concerned young man must speak to father before speaks to girl be fool if if want to get father money so have given promise know about promise do consider that be engaged to not if be disposed to get out of said sir felix hoping that might thus ingratiate with father of course must be awfully disappointed have consented to coming to well yes in sort of way of course know that depends on not at be of age if chooses to marry can marry if be want consent be enough be baronet believe oh yes be baronet therefore have come to own property have to wait for father to die dare say be indifferent about money be view of thing sir felix felt that be bound to dispel even at risk of offending father not exactly that said suppose will give daughter fortune of course then wonder did come to before went to if daughter marries to please will give money doubt how much be neither here there if marries to please without considering sha give farthing have hoped that might consent mr melmotte have said nothing about that be possible be man of fashion have title of own doubt property if will show that have income fit to maintain will think about at rate what be property sir felix what must three four thousand year even five six matter to man like melmotte be thus that sir felix looked at when man can hardly count million ought not to ask question about trifling sum of money question have be asked asking of such question be doubt within prerogative of proposed father in law at rate must be answered for moment occurred to sir felix that might conveniently tell truth must be nasty for moment there must be nothing to come after be to do so must not be dragged down lower lower into mire by cross examinings there might be end of hope there must at same time be end of misery lacked necessary courage be large property know said not like marquis of westminster suppose said horrid big rich scoundrel not quite like said sir felix with sickly laugh have got enough to support baronet title depends on how want to support said sir felix putting off evil day where family seat carbury manor down in suffolk near longestaffes be old family place doe belong to said melmotte very sharply not yet be heir perhaps if there be one thing in england more difficult than to be understood by men born bred out of england be system under title property descend together in various line jurisdiction of court of law be complex so be business of parliament rule regulating though anomalous be easy to memory compared with mixed anomaly of peerage primogeniture who be brought up among learn a child do language stranger who begin study in advanced life seldom make perfect in be everything to melmotte that must understand way of country have adopted when did not understand be clever at hiding ignorance now be puzzled knew that sir felix be baronet therefore presumed to be head of family knew that carbury manor belonged to roger carbury judged by name must be old family property now baronet declared that be heir to man who be simply esquire oh heir be how did get before be head of family yes be head of family of course said sir felix lying directly place wo be mine till dy must take long time to explain be young man be no not what 'd call young man be very old if be to marry have child how must be then sir felix be beginning to think that might have told truth with discretion quite know how must be have always understood that be heir be not very likely that will marry in meantime what be own property illustration in meantime what be own property father left money in fund in railway stock then be mother heir have done honour of telling that wish to marry daughter certainly must then object to inform amount nature of income on intend to support establishment a married man fancy that position assume justifies question on part bloated swindler vile city ruffian be certainly taking most ungenerous advantage of young aspirant for wealth be then that sir felix felt own position be not baronet gentleman very handsome fellow man of world who have be in crack regiment if surfeited sponge of speculation crammed commercial cormorant wanted more than for daughter why must not say so without asking disgusting question such a question be quite impossible that gentleman must answer be not sufficiently plain that gentleman proposing to marry daughter of such man a melmotte must do so under stress of pecuniary embarrassment must not be understood bargain that a provided rank position must provide money yet vulgar wretch took advantage of assumed authority to ask dreadful question sir felix stood silent trying to look man in face failing wishing that be well out of house at beargarden seem to be very clear about own circumstance sir felix perhaps will get lawyer to write to perhaps will be best said lover to give up daughter doubt will have money money expects money at moment lord alfred entered room be very late to day alfred why did come a said must be here more than hour ago said be out have be out of room day except to lunch good morning sir felix ring bell alfred will have little soda brandy sir felix have gone through greeting with fellow director

marie melmotte father have told so much perfectly believed truth of oath marie have sworn did not doubt that 'd stick to close enough be in love with be natural be fool be perhaps also natural romance be not game be playing people told that when girl succeeded in marrying without parent consent father be always constrained to forgive at last might be case with ordinary father melmotte be decidedly not ordinary father be so sir felix declared to perhaps greatest brute ever created sir felix must not remember elevation of eyebrow brazen forehead hard mouth have found quite unable to stand up against melmotte now cursed swore at man a be carried down to beargarden in cab what must do must abandon marie melmotte altogether never go to grosvenor square again drop whole family including great

into city take up share to morrow still have ready money at command if must do must not such conduct on part be best refutation of charge of not having fortune melmotte have brought against must endeavour to work money out of dolly longestaffe entertained idea though must be impossible to get cash from mile grendall might use claim against mile in city mile be secretary to board might perhaps contrive that money required for share must not be ready money sir felix be not very clear about thought that might possibly in way use indebtedness of mile grendall how do hate fellow who doe not pay up said to a sat alone in club waiting for friend to come in formed in head draconic law must fain have executed upon men who lost money at play did not pay how deuce fellow can look one in face be

grendall also dined there after dinner in smoking room sir felix tried to do little business with secretary began operation with unusual courtesy believing that man must have influence with great distributor of share be going to take up share in company said sir felix ah indeed mile enveloped from head to foot in smoke did quite understand about nidderdale saw melmotte have explained think will go in for couple of thousand on wednesday oh ah will be proper thing to do wo very good thing to do mile grendall smoked harder harder a suggestion be made to be always ready money always ready

be little short in own payment to sir felix said thinking to be delicate mode of introducing claim upon secretary be private said mile frowning of course be private if must pay money must buy share with though be public think must mix two thing together carbury ca help not in way then when deuce will pay what owe sir felix be driven to plain expression of demand by impassibility of debtor here be man who did not pay debt of honour who did not even propose arrangement for paying who yet have impudence to talk of not mixing up private matter with affair of business made young baronet very sick mile grendall smoked on in silence there be difficulty in answering question therefore made answer do know how much owe continued baronet determined to persist now that have commenced attack there be little crowd of other men in room conversation about share have be commenced in under tone two last question sir felix have asked in whisper countenance showed plainly that be speaking in anger of course know said mile well be not going to talk about here not going to talk about here be public room be going to talk about said sir felix raising voice will fellow come up stair play game of billiards said mile grendall rising from chair then walked slowly out of room leaving sir felix to take what revenge pleased for moment sir felix thought that must expose transaction to whole room be afraid thinking mile grendall be more popular man than be sunday night not le be gambler assembled in card room at about eleven dolly longestaffe be there with two lord sir felix mile grendall of course regret to say much better man than of paul montague sir felix have doubted much a to propriety of joining party be use of playing with man who seemed by general consent to be liberated from obligation to pay then if did not play with where must find gambling table began with whist soon laid that aside devoted to loo least respected man in confraternity be grendall yet be in compliance with persistency of suggestion that gave up nobler game let stick to whist like cutting out said grasslough be much more jolly having nothing to do now then one can always bet said dolly shortly afterwards hate loo said sir felix in answer to third application like whist best said nidderdale will play anything anybody like pitch toss if please mile grendall have way loo be game at about two o'clock grendall be only winner play have not be very high nevertheless have won largely whenever large pool have collected swept into garner men opposed to hardly grudged stroke of luck have hitherto be unlucky be able to pay with own paper be so valueless that parted with without pang even dolly longestaffe seemed to have supply of only man there not so furnished be montague while sum won be quite small be allowed to pay with cash to sir felix be frightful to see ready money going over to mile grendall a under circumstance must be got back from montague said just change for time will take back if still have when have done handed lot of mile paper across table result of course must be that felix must receive so much real money that mile must get back more of own worthless paper to montague must make difference did a be asked rather be preparing to do so when mile interfered on what principle of justice must sir felix come between man understand kind of thing said when win from carbury will take o u a long a have by george be kind wo have handed about table to be changed pay then said sir felix laying handful down on table let have row said lord nidderdale carbury be always making row said grasslough of course be said mile grendall make more row than anybody else do say that a have such lot of thing a know that get cash for a want grendall must take money walk off with who be walking off said mile why must be entitled to montague money more than of asked grasslough matter be debated be thus decided be not to be allowed that mile paper must be negotiated at table in manner that sir felix have attempted to adopt mr grendall pledged honour that when broke up party must apply money that might have won to redemption of o u paying regular percentage to holder of decision made sir felix very cross knew that condition at six seven in morning must not be favourable to such commercial accuracy indeed must require accountant to effect felt sure that mile if still winner must in truth walk off with ready money for considerable time did not speak became very moderate in play tossing card about almost always losing losing minimum watching board be sitting next to grendall thought that observed that neighbour moved chair farther farther away from nearer to dolly longestaffe who be next to on other side went on for hour during grendall still won won heavily from paul montague never saw fellow have run of luck in life said grasslough have have two trump dealt to hand almost since began ever so many hand have played at said mile have always won when have played said dolly have be looed time ought to begrudge one run of luck when have lost so much said mile who since began have destroyed paper counter of own making supposed to represent considerably above l have also be of infinitely greater concern to received amount of ready money be quite godsend to what be good of talking about said nidderdale hate row about winning losing let go on go to bed idea of going to bed be absurd so went on sir felix however hardly spoke at played very little watched mile grendall without seeming to watch at last felt certain that saw card go into man sleeve remembered at moment that winner have owed success to continued run of ace be tempted to rush at once upon player catch card on person feared grendall be big man where must be if there must be card there then in scramble there must certainly be at rate doubt knew that men around must be most unwilling to believe accusation grasslough be grendall friend nidderdale dolly longestaffe must infinitely rather be cheated than suspect one of own set of cheating feared violence of man must accuse also impassive good humour of others let that opportunity pas by again watched again saw card abstracted thrice saw till be wonderful to that others also must not see a often a deal came round man did felix watched more closely be certain that in round man have ace at least once seemed to that nothing must be easier at last pleaded headache got up went away leaving others playing have lost nearly thousand pound have be all in paper there be something matter with fellow said grasslough there be always something matter with think said mile be so awfully greedy about money mile have become somewhat triumphant in success le said about grendall better said nidderdale have put up with good deal know have put up with a much a anybody mile be cowed at once went on dealing without manoeuvring card on hand chapter xxv in grosvenor square marie melmotte be hardly satisfied with note received from didon early on monday morning with volubility of french eloquence didon declared that must be turned out of house if monsieur madame be to know what be doing marie told that madame must certainly

hear much of one who perhaps be loved once knew that position be perfectly indefensible must have be better for not to have alluded to reason to have remained firm to assertion that loved woman must have acknowledged to be false perjured inconstant very base fault may be venial to who suffer be damnable deserving of eternity of torture in eye of sufferer must have submitted to be told that be fiend might have have to endure of punishment lady in wrath must inflict upon must have be called upon for further mental effort position must have be plain now be at sea wish to hear nothing said then why tell that know so little of other that surely be poor excuse to make to woman after have be false to why did not say that when be in new york together think of paul be not that mean think

uncertainty about husband if mr hurtle be alive certainly then must not be liar because did not marry mr hurtle did not think to be liar be not at once ready with defence oh paul said changing at once into softness be pleading to for life oh must make feel that be pleading for life have given promise to lady also said have given promise love have never said so have told of love never there be nothing then between must put against woman who have nothing to suffer cause of complaint who for aught know care nothing for be that so suppose be said paul then may still be mine oh paul come back

who be joined with mr melmotte in managing new great american railway that mr paul montague must be with morning be too far seeing to doubt have doubted must have shown letter now go tell that what have said be false if dare woman be not there did not seem to be immediate duty to leave room in order that might denounce lady whom certainly have ill used position be one required thought after while took up hat to go do mean to tell that statement be untrue no said not to day will come back to yes will come back have friend here paul remember that remember promise remember love be good to then let go without word chapter xxvii mr hurtle go to play on day after visit just recorded paul montague received following letter from mr hurtle dear paul think that perhaps hardly made understood to other yesterday be sure that understand how absolutely whole life be now at stake need only refer to journey from san francisco to london to make conscious that really love to woman such love be important can not throw from a man may do amidst affair of world if have to be thrown from can bear loss a man bear thought have dwelt on with more constancy than then too devotion have separated from other thing devotion to have separated from everything scorn to come to a suppliant if choose to say after hearing that will put away from because have seen one fairer than be course may take in indignation will not throw at foot to tell of wrong wish however that must hear say that there be one love better than love that have not committed to ala know too much of world to be surprised that man constancy must not stand out two year in absence of mistress man can not wrap up keep warm with absent love a woman doe think that remembrance of past must come back upon now that have seen again think that must have owned to yourself that did love that must love again sin against to utter destruction if leave have given up friend have to follow a regard other nameless lady there can be fault for a tell know nothing of passion hinted that there be other reason that know too little of other meant doubt that knew too little of be not case that be content when knew only what be to be learned in day of sweet intimacy that have be made discontented by story told by partner at san francisco if be so trouble at rate to find out truth before allow to treat woman a propose to treat think be too good man to cast aside woman have loved like soiled glove because ill natured word have be spoken of by men perhaps by woman who know nothing of life late husband caradoc hurtle be attorney general in state of kansa when married being then in possession of considerable fortune left to by mother there life be infamously bad spent what money must get of mine then left state took to texas where drank

forced to fight battle about property have won have two reason for carrying through by personal effort before saw have begun have determined that must not be beaten by fraud be also determined must not plead to a pauper have talked too freely together in past day of mutual money matter for to feel delicacy in alluding to when man woman have agreed to be husband wife there must be delicacy of kind when came here together be embarrassed have property of must enjoy since have made way through difficulty from what have heard at san francisco suppose that have done same at rate will be

to take out with let dine together take to one of theatre if wish will promise not to allude to revelation made to just now though of course be nearer to heart than other matter perhaps woman vanity make think that if must only see again talk to a used to talk must think of a used to think need not fear will find at home have whither to go will hardly stir from house till come to send line however may have hat on if be minded to do a ask yours with heart winifrid hurtle letter took much time to write though be very careful so to write a to make seem that have flown easily from pen copied from first draught copied rapidly with one two premeditated erasure so that must look to have be done hurriedly there have be much art in have at rate suppressed show of anger in calling to have so written a to make feel that if must come need not fear claw of offended lioness yet be angry a lioness who have lost cub have almost ignored that other lady whose name have not yet heard have spoken of lover entanglement with other lady a light thing might easily be put aside have said much of own wrong have not said much of wickedness of wrong doer invited a have invited surely must not come to then in reference to money not descending to detail of dollar cent have studied how to make feel that might marry without imprudence a read over to herself thought that there be tone through of natural feminine uncautious eagerness put letter up in envelope stuck stamp on addressed then threw back in chair to think of position must marry there must be something done must make name of winifrid hurtle known to world have plan of revenge yet formed must not talk of revenge told that must not even think of revenge till be quite sure that revenge must be necessary did think of must not

herself have promised to marry must marry world must hear story of perjury paul montague felt that be surrounded by difficulty a soon a read letter that heart be other way be quite sure did seem to that there be escape from trouble open to there be not single word in woman letter that must contradict have loved have promised to make wife have determined to break word to because found that be enveloped in dangerous mystery have so resolved before have ever seen hetta carbury having be made to believe by roger carbury that marriage with unknown american woman of whom only did know that be handsome clever must be step to ruin woman a roger said be adventuress might never have have husband might at moment have two three might be overwhelmed with debt might be anything bad dangerous abominable that have heard at san francisco have substantiated roger view scrape be better than scrape roger have said to paul have believed mentor have believed with double faith a soon a have seen hetta carbury what must do now be impossible after what have passed between that must leave mr hurtle at lodging at islington without notice be clear enough to that must not consent to be so left then present proposal though seemed to be absurd almost comical in tragical condition of present circumstance have in immediate comfort to take out give dinner then go with to theatre must be easy perhaps pleasant must be easier certainly much pleasanter because have pledged to abstain from talking of grievance then remembered happy evening delicious hour have so passed with when be first together at new york there must be better companion for festival must talk must listen a well a talk must sit silent conveying to sense of feminine charm by simple proximity have be very happy when so placed have be possible must have escaped danger now reminiscence of past delight in sort reconciled to performance of perilous duty when evening must be over how must part with when pleasant hour must have passed away have brought back to door what must say to then must make arrangement a to future meeting knew that be in great peril did not know how might best escape must not now go to roger carbury for advice for be not roger carbury rival must be for friend interest that must marry widow roger carbury a knew well be too honest man to allow to be guided in advice might give by feeling still on matter must no longer tell everything to roger carbury must not say that must have to say without speaking of hetta of love for hetta must not speak to rival have other friend in whom must confide there be other human being must trust unless be hetta thought for moment that must write stern true letter to woman telling that a be impossible that there must ever be marriage between felt bound to

have now thrown into chair be sighing sir felix stood on rug with arm round marie waist listening to protestation saying little in answer to when suddenly heavy step be heard ascending stair c'est lui screamed madame melmotte bustling up from seat hurrying out of room by side door two lover be alone for one moment during marie lifted up face sir felix kissed lip now be brave said escaping from arm will be brave mr melmotte looked round room a entered where be others asked mamma have gone away miss longestaffe went before mamma sir felix be well must tell that daughter be engaged to marry lord

anything if marry without leave be sure can not take away tell because think ought to tell everything m sir felix a read must not think that have become engaged to very enterprising young lady be evident that did not care to what extent braved father on behalf of lover now coolly proposed to rob sir felix saw reason why must not take advantage of money made over to girl name if must lay hand on did not know much of such transaction knew more than marie melmotte must understand that man in melmotte position must want to secure portion of fortune against accident by settling on daughter whether having so settled must again resume without daughter assent sir felix did not know marie who have doubt be regarded a absolutely passive instrument when thing be done be now quite alive to benefit might possibly derive from proposition put into plain english amounted to take marry without father consent then together can rob father of money for own purpose have settled upon have looked upon lady of choice a poor weak thing without special character of own who be made worthy of consideration only by fact that be rich man daughter now began to loom before eye a something bigger than that have have will of own when mother have none have not be afraid of brutal father when sir felix have trembled before have offered to be beaten killed chopped to piece on behalf of lover there must be doubt about running away if be asked seemed to that within last month have gained great deal of experience that thing heretofore have be troublesome to difficult perhaps impossible be now coming easily within reach have won two three thousand pound at card whereas invariable loss have be result of small play in have before indulged have be set to marry heiress having at first great liking for attempt because of difficulty small amount of hope offered girl be already willing anxious to jump into arm then have detected man cheating at card extent of iniquity be awful to before have seen be already beginning to think that there be not very much in if there be not much in if man a mile grendall must cheat at card be brought to punishment why must not try be rapid way of winning doubt remembered that on one two occasion have asked adversary to cut card second time at whist because have observed that there be honour at bottom feeling of honesty have interfered with little trick have hardly be premeditated when successful without detection have not troubled conscience now seemed to that much more than might be done without detection nothing have opened eye to way of world so widely a sweet little lover like proposition made by miss melmotte for robbing father certainly recommended girl to have be able at early age amidst circumstance of very secluded life to throw off from altogether scruple of honesty bugbear of world be apt to prevent great enterprise in mind of men what must do next sum of money of marie wrote so easily be probably large must not have be worth while of such man a mr melmotte to make trifling provision of nature must hardly be le than l might probably be very much more be certain to that if marie be to claim money a man wife there must then be hope of further liberality be not probable that man a mr melmotte must forgive even only child offence a even if be obtained l must not be very much melmotte might probably have mean even if robbery be duly perpetrated of making possession of money very uncomfortable be deep water into sir felix be preparing to plunge did not feel to be altogether comfortable although liked deep water chapter xxx mr melmotte promise on following saturday there appeared in mr alf paper evening pulpit very remarkable article on south central pacific mexican railway be article attracted great deal of attention be therefore remarkable be in nothing more remarkable than in that left on mind of reader impression of decided opinion about railway editor must at future time be able to refer to article with equal pride whether railway must become great cosmopolitan fact whether must collapse amidst foul struggle of horde of swindler in utrumque paratus article be mysterious suggestive amusing well informed that in evening pulpit be matter of course above thing ironical next to omniscience irony be strongest weapon belonging to evening pulpit there be little praise given doubt in irony to duchess who served mr melmotte there be little praise given of course in irony to mr melmotte board of english director there be good deal of praise still alloyed by dash of irony bestowed on idea of civilising mexico by joining to california praise be bestowed upon england for taking up matter accompanied by ironical touch at incapacity to believe thoroughly in enterprise not originated by then there be something said of universality of mr melmotte commercial genius whether said in spirit prophetic of ultimate failure disgrace of heavenborn success unequalled commercial splendour one must tell be generally said at club mr alf have written article old splinter who be one of body of men possessing excellent cellar of wine calling paides pallados who have written for heavy quarterly time last forty year professed that saw through article evening pulpit have be explained desirous of going a far a must in denouncing mr melmotte without incurring danger of action for libel mr splinter thought that thing be clever mean new publication generally be mean mr splinter be constant in opinion putting meanness aside thought that article be well done according to view be intended to expose mr melmotte railway paides pallados generally did not agree with under interpretation what have be meaning of paragraph in writer have declared that work of joining one ocean to be worthy of nearest approach to divinity have be granted to men old splinter chuckled gabbled a heard declared that there be not wit enough left now even among paides pallados to understand shaft of irony there must be doubt however at time that world did not go with old splinter that article served to enhance value of share in great railway enterprise lady carbury be sure that article be intended to write up railway took great joy in entertained in brain somewhat confused notion that if must only bestir in right direction must induce son to open eye to own advantage very great thing might be achieved so that wealth might become handmaid luxury habit right of life be beloved accepted suitor of marie melmotte be director of great company sitting at same board with great commercial hero be handsomest young man in london be baronet very wild idea occurred to must take mr alf into entire confidence if melmotte alf must be brought together what might not do alf must write up melmotte melmotte must shower share upon alf if melmotte must come be smiled upon by be flattered a thought that must flatter be told that be god have that passage about divinity of joining ocean to ocean construed to a must construe must not great man become plastic under hand if while be doing felix must run away with marie must not forgiveness be made easy creative mind ranged still farther mr broune might help even mr booker to one a melmotte man doing great thing through force of confidence placed in by world at large freely spoken support of press must be everything who must not buy share in railway a to mr broune mr alf must combine in saying that be managed by divinity thought be rather hazy from day to day worked hard to make clear to herself on sunday afternoon mr booker called on talked to about article did not say much to mr booker a to own connection with mr melmotte telling that prudence be essential in present emergency listened with ear be mr booker idea that man be going to make spoon spoil horn think honest asked lady carbury mr booker smiled hesitated of course mean honest a men can be in such very large transaction perhaps be best way of putting said mr booker if thing can be made great beneficent boon to humanity simply by creating belief in doe not man become benefactor to race by creating belief at expense of veracity suggested mr booker at expense of anything rejoined lady carbury with energy one can not measure such men by ordinary rule must do evil to produce good asked mr booker call doing evil have to destroy thousand living creature time drink glass of water think of when be athirst can not send ship to sea without endangering life do send ship to sea though men perish yearly tell man may perhaps ruin hundred then again may create new world in million will be rich happy be excellent casuist lady carbury be enthusiastic lover of beneficent audacity said lady carbury picking word slowly showing to be quite satisfied with a picked did hold place mr booker in literature of country hold place lady carbury yes very distinguished place be circumstanced a be must have hesitation in lending whole weight of periodical let be what might to assistance of so great man so great object a must be dismissed to morrow said mr booker getting up laughing a took departure lady carbury felt that a regarded mr booker have only thrown out chance word must not do harm have not expected to effect much through mr booker instrumentality on tuesday evening regular tuesday a called three editor came to drawing room there came also greater man than of have taken bull by horn without saying anything to anybody have written to mr melmotte asking to honour poor house with presence have written very pretty note to reminding of meeting at caversham telling that on former occasion madame melmotte daughter have be so kind a to come to giving to understand that of potentate now on earth be one to whom must bow knee with purest satisfaction wrote back mile grendall did for very plain note accepting honour of lady carbury invitation great man came lady carbury took under immediate wing with grace be own said word about dear friend at caversham expressed sorrow that son engagement did not admit of being there then with utmost audacity rushed off to article in pulpit friend mr alf editor have thoroughly appreciated greatness of mr melmotte character magnificence of mr melmotte undertaking mr melmotte bowed muttered something be inaudible now must introduce to mr alf said lady introduction be effected mr alf explained that be hardly necessary a have already be entertained a one of mr melmotte guest there be great many there never saw probably never will see said mr melmotte be one of unfortunate said mr alf be sorry be unfortunate if have come into whist room must have found ah if have known said mr editor a be proper carried about with sample of irony paper used so effectively be altogether thrown away upon melmotte lady carbury finding that immediate good result must be expected from last introduction tried mr melmotte said whispering to do so want to make known to mr broune mr broune know have never met before morning paper be much heavier burden to editor than one published in afternoon mr broune a of course know manages 'breakfast table there be hardly more influential man in london than mr broune declare know said lowering tone of whisper a communicated fact that commercial article be gospel absolutely gospel then two men be named to other lady carbury retreated not out of hearing getting very hot said mr melmotte very hot indeed said mr broune be over in city to day call very hot for june very hot indeed said mr broune again then conversation be over mr broune sidled away mr melmotte be left standing in middle of room lady carbury told at moment that rome be not built in day must have be better satisfied certainly if must have laid few more brick on day perseverance however be thing wanted mr melmotte have word to say before left house said be very good of to ask lady carbury very good lady carbury intimated opinion that goodness be on other side came continued mr melmotte because have something particular to say otherwise go out much to evening party son have proposed to daughter lady carbury looked up into face with eye clasped hand together then having unclasped put one upon sleeve daughter ma'be be engaged to man must not enslave affection mr melmotte wo give shilling if marries one else be reminded down at caversham that son be director at board did did have great respect for son ma'be want to hurt in way if will signify to daughter that withdraws from offer of because be against will see that doe uncommon well in city will be making of good night ma'be then mr melmotte took departure without word here at rate be undertaking on part of great man that must be making of felix if felix must only obey accompanied rather preceded by most positive assurance that if felix be to succeed in marrying daughter must not give son in law shilling there be very much to be considered in did not doubt that felix might be made by mr melmotte city influence then perpetuity of such making must depend on qualification in son feared that did not posse wife without money must be terrible must be absolute ruin there must be escape then hope there be appreciation of real tragedy in heart while contemplated position of sir felix married to such girl a supposed marie melmotte to be without mean of support for of what must supply must kill for young people there must be nothing before beggary workhouse a thought of trembled with true maternal instinct beautiful boy so glorious with outward gift so fit a thought for grace of grand world though ambition be vilely ignoble mother love be noble disinterested girl be only child future honour of house of melmotte must be made to settle on other head doubt father must prefer lord for son in law having preference must of course do a be now doing that must threaten to disinherit daughter if married contrary to wish be to be expected must not be equally matter of course that must make best of marriage if be once effected daughter must return to with title though with one of lower degree than ambition desired to herself personally lady carbury felt that great financier have be very rude have taken advantage of invitation that might come to house threaten must forgive that must pas that over altogether if only anything be to be gained by passing over looked round room longing for friend whom might consult with true feeling of genuine womanly dependence most natural friend be roger carbury even have be there must not have consulted on matter touching melmottes advice must have be very clear must have told to have nothing at to do with such adventurer then dear roger be old fashioned knew nothing of people a be now lived in world though slow have be good in way whether bad good have now passed away then eye settled on mr broune be afraid of mr alf have almost begun to think that mr alf be too difficult of management to be of use to mr broune be softer mr booker be serviceable for article must not be sympathetic a friend mr broune have be very courteous to lately so much so that on one occasion have almost feared that susceptible old goose be going to be goose again must be bore still might make use of friendly condition of mind such susceptibility must produce when guest began to leave spoke word aside to wanted advice must stay for few minute after rest of company did stay when others be gone asked daughter to leave hetta said have something of business to communicate to mr broune so be left alone be afraid did make much of mr melmotte said smiling have seated on end of sofa close to arm chair occupied in reply only shook head laughed saw how be be sorry for for certainly be wonderful man suppose be be one of men whose power lie must say chiefly in conversation though indeed there be reason why must not say same of for if said little said le did just come off lady carbury suggested with sweetest smile now want to tell something think be justified in regarding a real friend certainly said putting out hand for hers gave to for moment then took back again finding that did not relinquish of own accord stupid old goose said to herself now to story know boy felix editor nodded head be engaged to marry man daughter engaged to marry miss melmotte then lady carbury nodded head why be said to be greatest heiress that world have ever produced thought be to marry lord nidderdale have engaged to felix be desperately in love with a be with tried to tell story truly knowing that advice can be worth anything be not based on true story lying have become nature melmotte naturally want to marry lord came here to tell that if daughter married felix must not have penny do mean that volunteered that a threat just so told that have come here simply with object of saying so be more candid than civil must take a get must be sure to make such threat exactly be just what feel in day young people be not often kept from marrying simply by father fantasy must tell something else told that if felix must desist must enable to make fortune in city be bosh said broune with decision do think must be so certainly yes do undertaking if intended by melmotte must give worse opinion of than have ever held did make then did very wrong must have spoken with purpose of deceiving know son be one of director of great american railway be not just a though promise be made to young man who be altogether unconnected with sir felix name be put there in hurry merely because have title because melmotte thought a young man must not be likely to interfere with may be that will be able to sell few share at profit if understand matter rightly have capital to go into such business no have capital dear lady carbury must place dependence at on promise a that think must marry girl then in spite of father mr broune hesitated before replied to question be to question that lady carbury especially wished for reply wanted one to support under circumstance of elopement rose from chair rose at same time perhaps must have begun by saying that felix be prepared to take off be quite ready to go be devoted to do think must be wrong be question

pleasantly must ride cob in park with a free air a man of forty must afterwards work through four five hour of night with easy steadiness nothing sound health must produce mr broune thinking of own circumstance must see reason why must not be in love hope know other intimately at rate said somewhat lamely oh yes be for reason have come to for advice have be young woman must not have dared to ask

smiling must have be only that intended something further mr broune have got into difficulty hardly knew how to get out of be going on to say that hoped be not too old to love foolish old darling what did mean by making such as of be worse even than kiss a being more troublesome le easily pushed on one side forgotten may serve to explain condition of lady carbury mind at time if be stated that did not even at moment suppose that editor of morning breakfast table intended to make offer of marriage knew thought knew that middle aged men be fond of prating about love getting up sensational scene falseness of thing injury may come of did not shock at have known that editor professed to be in love with lady in next street must have be quite ready to enlist lady in next street among friend that might thus strengthen own influence with mr broune for herself such make belief of improper passion must be inconvenient therefore to be avoided that man placed a mr broune be in world blessed with power with large income with influence throughout world around courted feted feared almost worshipped that must desire to share fortune misfortune struggle poverty obscurity be not within scope of imagination there be homage in of did not believe man to be capable to must be more wonderful a being paid to herself thought so badly of men woman generally of mr broune a man woman individually that be unable to conceive possibility of such sacrifice mr broune said did not think that must take advantage of confidence have placed in to annoy in way to annoy lady carbury phrase at rate be singular after much thought have determined to ask to be wife must be annoyed more than annoyed by refusal be matter of course ought to expect such annoyance be perhaps too true can extricate from dilemma only too easily word wife came upon like thunder clap at once changed feeling towards did not dream of loving felt sure that never must love have be on card with to love man a lover must have be handsome spendthrift who must have hung from neck like nether millstone man be friend to be used to be used because knew world now gave clear testimony that knew a little of world a other man mr broune of daily breakfast table asking to be wife mixed with other feeling there be tenderness brought back memory of distant youth almost made weep that man man must offer to take half burden to confer upon blessing what idiot what god have looked upon man a intellect alloyed perhaps by passionless remnant of vice of youth now found that not only have human heart in bosom heart that must touch how wonderfully sweet how infinitely small be necessary that must answer to be only natural that must at first think what answer must best assist own view without reference to did not occur to that must love did occur to that might lift out of difficulty what benefit must be to to have father father for felix how easy must be literary career to wife of editor of morning breakfast table then passed through mind that somebody have told that man be paid l year for work must not world part of be desirable come to drawing room if be wife of mr broune passed through brain at once during minute of

young heart have come to love speak with absolute frankness risking anger have doubted much before resolved upon be so hard to know nature of person think understand yours if can confide happiness with be prepared to intrust mine to keeping poor mr broune though endowed with gift peculiarly adapted for editing of daily newspaper must have have little capacity for reading woman character when talked of freshness of lady carbury young mind must have surely be much blinded by love before convincing that must trust happiness to such keeping do infinite honour pay great compliment ejaculated lady carbury well how be to answer at moment expected nothing of a god be to be judge have come upon like dream look upon position a almost highest in england on prosperity a uttermost can be achieved prosperity such a be desire most anxiously to share with tell so can hardly yet believe then how be to know own feeling so suddenly marriage a have found mr broune have not be happy have suffered much

on table beyond reach of bed curtain mr broune a walked to newspaper office experienced pang of doubt man feel when have just done for day week past have almost resolved that have better leave undone that last apparition have encountered at lady love door certainly have not tended to reassure what curse can be much greater than inflicted by drunken reprobate son evil when in course of thing come upon man have to be borne why must man in middle life unnecessarily afflict with so terrible misfortune woman too be devoted to cub then thousand of other thought crowded upon how must new life suit must have new house new way must live under new dominion fit to new pleasure what be to gain by lady carbury be handsome woman liked beauty regarded too a clever woman because have flattered have liked conversation have be long enough about town to have known better a now walked along street almost felt that ought to have known better now again warmed little with remembrance of beauty told that new home must be pleasanter though might perhaps be le free than old one tried to make best of a did so be always repressed by memory of appearance of drunken young baronet whether for good for

laughing at illusion telling that passion preference be simply weapon to be used love for son mastered knew a be so must be fit that must marry man then liberty even though felix must bring to utter ruin nevertheless must be might remain free woman must worse come to worst thought that must endure bohemian life in must mean have be taken from must live on what earned though felix be tyrant after

make statement lord nidderdale sir felix have conceived that be to be done a be out of great man own heart of own wish so that something of condition of company might be made known to director of company be not perhaps exactly truth paul montague have insisted on giving vent to certain doubt at last meeting one having made very disagreeable indeed have forced trouble on great chairman on intermediate friday chairman have made very unpleasant to paul have seemed to be effort on part to frighten inimical director out of opposition so that promise of statement need not be fulfilled what nuisance can be so great to man busied with immense affair a to have to explain to attempt to explain small detail to men incapable of understanding montague have stood to gun have not intended said to dispute commercial success of company felt very strongly thought that brother director must feel a strongly that be necessary that must know more than did know lord alfred have declared that did

written by satellite of melmotte from abchurch lane who be never present at meeting adverse director have spoken to secretary will be remembered that be member of beargarden mile have given somewhat evasive reply cussed deal of trouble that know be used to be what be meant for be not going to flurry about stuff of kind montague after have spoken on subject to nidderdale felix carbury must do if

back into habit of playing at club loo however have given way to whist sir felix have satisfied with change still meditated dreadful punishment for mile grendall in meantime felt unable to oppose at board since day at ace have be manipulated at club have not spoken to mile grendall except in reference to affair of whist table board be now commenced a usual mile read short record out of book stumbling over other word going through performance so badly that have there be anything to understand one must have understood gentleman said mr melmotte in usual hurried way be pleasure that will sign record paul montague rose to say that be not pleasure that record must be signed melmotte have made scrawl be deep in conversation with mr cohenlupe before paul must get upon leg melmotte however have watched little struggle melmotte might be fault have eye to see ear to hear perceived that montague have made little struggle have be cowed knew how hard be for one man to persevere against five six for young man to persevere against elder nidderdale be filliping bit of paper across table at carbury mile be poring over book be in charge lord alfred sat back in chair picture of model director with right hand within waistcoat looked aristocratic respectable almost commercial in room never by chance opened mouth except when called on to say that mr melmotte be right be considered by chairman really to earn money melmotte for minute two went on conversing with cohenlupe having perceived that montague for moment be cowed then paul put hand upon table intending to rise ask perplexing question melmotte saw also be upon leg before montague have risen from chair gentleman said mr melmotte may perhaps be a well if take occasion of saying few word to about affair of company then instead of going on with statement sat down again began to turn over sundry voluminous paper very slowly whispering word two now then to mr cohenlupe lord alfred never changed posture never took hand from breast nidderdale carbury filliped paper pellet backwards forward montague sat profoundly listening ready to listen when anything must be said a chairman have risen from chair to commence statement paul felt that be bound to be silent when speaker be in possession of floor be in possession even though be somewhat dilatory in looking to reference whispering to neighbour when speaker be chairman of course additional latitude must be allowed to montague understood sat silent seemed that melmotte have much to say to cohenlupe cohenlupe much to say to melmotte since cohenlupe have sat at board have never before developed such power of conversation nidderdale did quite understand have be there twenty minute be tired of present amusement having be unable to hit carbury on nose suddenly remembered that beargarden must now be open be respecter of person have got over little feeling of awe with big table solemnity of room may have first inspired suppose be about said looking up at melmotte well perhaps a lordship be in hurry a lord here be engaged elsewhere turning round to lord alfred who have not uttered syllable made sign since have be in seat have better adjourn meeting for week can not allow said paul montague suppose then must take sense of board said chairman have be discussing certain circumstance with friend chairman said cohenlupe must say that be not expedient just at present to go into matter too freely lord gentleman said melmotte hope that trust lord alfred bowed down to table muttered something be intended to convey most absolute confidence hear hear said mr cohenlupe right said lord nidderdale go on fired pellet with improved success trust said chairman that young friend sir felix doubt discretion ability oh dear not at said baronet much flattered at being addressed in kindly tone have come there with object of own be quite prepared to support chairman on matter lord gentleman continued melmotte be delighted to receive expression of confidence if know anything in world know something of commercial matter be able to tell that be prospering know that greater prosperity have ever be achieved in shorter time by commercial company think friend here mr montague must be a feelingly aware of a gentleman what do mean by mr melmotte asked paul what do mean certainly nothing adverse to character sir firm in san francisco sir know very well how affair of company be being transacted on side of water doubt be in correspondence with mr fisker ask telegraph wire be open to sir lord gentleman be able to inform that in affair of nature great discretion be necessary on behalf of shareholder at large whose interest be in hand think expedient that general statement must be postponed for short time flatter that in opinion will carry majority of board with mr melmotte did not make speech very fluently being accustomed to place occupied did manage to get word spoken in such way a to make intelligible to company now move that meeting be adjourned to day week added second that motion said lord alfred without moving hand from breast understood that be to have statement said montague have have statement said mr cohenlupe will put motion to vote said chairman will move amendment said paul determined that must not be altogether silenced there be nobody to second said mr cohenlupe how do know till have made asked rebel will ask lord nidderdale to second when have heard think that will not refuse oh gracious why ask have got to go away have indeed at rate claim right of saying few word say whether affair of company must must not be published to world 'd break up everything if did said cohenlupe perhaps everything ought to be broken up say nothing about what do say be that a sit here a director will be held to be responsible a such by public ought to know what be being done ought to know where share really be for one even know what scrip have be issued have bought sold enough to know something about said melmotte paul montague became very red in face at rate began said by putting what be to large sum of money into affair be more than know said melmotte share have be issued at san francisco not here have taken nothing have paid for said montague have yet have allotted to anything like number of share capital must represent did not intend to speak of own concern look very like said cohenlupe so far from that be prepared to risk not improbable loss of everything have in world be determined to know what be being done with share to make public to world at large that one of director of company in truth know anything about can not suppose absolve from further responsibility can at rate do what be right from time forward that course intend to take gentleman have better resign seat at board said melmotte there will be difficulty about bound up a be with fisker montague in california fear that there will be difficulty not in least continued chairman need only gazette resignation thing be done have intended gentleman to propose addition to number when name to gentleman personally known to many of generally esteemed throughout england a man of business a man of probity a man of fortune man standing deservedly high in british circle mean mr longestaffe of caversham young dolly old asked lord nidderdale mean mr adolphus longestaffe senior of caversham be sure that will all be glad to welcome among have thought to strengthen number by addition if mr montague be determined to leave one will regret loss of service so much a will will be pleasing duty to move that adolphus longestaffe senior esquire of caversham be requested to take place if on reconsideration mr montague will determine to remain with for one most sincerely hope that such reconsideration may lead to such determination then will move that additional director be added to number that mr longestaffe be requested to take chair of additional director latter speech mr melmotte got through very glibly then immediately left chair so a to show that business of board be closed for day without possibility of reopening paul went up to took by sleeve signifying that wished to speak to before parted certainly said great man bowing carbury said looking round on young baronet with blandest smile if be not in hurry wait moment for have word two to say before go now mr montague what can do for paul began story expressing again opinion have already very plainly expressed at table melmotte stopped very shortly with much le courtesy than have shown in speech have made from chair thing be about way take montague think know more of matter than at mr melmotte think know more of than do of may be right a intend to give way to perhaps le speak together about better ca be in earnest in threat made because

gentleman indifferent a be to feeling of others still felt ashamed of be treating girl very badly even knew that be behaving badly be so conscious of that tried to console by reflecting that writing letter a must not prevent running away with girl must on consideration find to be worth while to do so that night be again playing at beargarden lost great part of mr melmotte money did in fact lose much more than l when found ready money going from issued paper chapter xxxviii paul montague trouble paul montague have other trouble on mind beyond trouble of mexican railway be now more than fortnight since have taken mr hurtle to play be still living in lodging at islington have seen twice once on following day when be allowed to come go without special reference to engagement again three four day afterwards when meeting be by mean so pleasant have wept after weeping have stormed have stood upon what called right have dared to be false to did mean to deny that have promised to marry be not conduct to ever since have now be in london repetition of promise then again became soft pleaded with for storm might have given way at moment have felt that fate in life must be better than marriage on compulsion tear pleading nevertheless touched very nearly have promised most distinctly have loved have won love be lovely very violence of storm made sunshine more sweet must sit down on stool at foot be impossible to drive away from must look up in face must not embrace then there have come passionate flood of tear be in arm how have escaped hardly knew did know that have promised to be with again before two day must have passed on day named wrote to letter excusing be at rate true in word have be summoned said to liverpool on business must postpone seeing till return explained that business on be called be connected with great american railway being important demanded attention in word be true have be corresponding with gentleman at liverpool with whom have become acquainted on return home after having involuntarily become partner in house of fisker montague montague man trusted have consulted gentleman mr ramsbottom by name have suggested that must come to at liverpool have gone conduct at board have be result of advice have received may be doubted whether dread of coming interview with mr hurtle have not added strength to mr ramsbottom invitation in liverpool have heard tidings of mr hurtle though can hardly be said that obtained trustworthy information lady after landing from american steamer have be at mr ramsbottom office inquiring for paul mr ramsbottom have thought that inquiry be made in manner indicating danger therefore have spoken to fellow traveller with mr hurtle fellow traveller have opined that mr hurtle be queer card on board ship gave up to that be about handsomest woman have ever seen said that there be bit of wild cat in breeding then mr ramsbottom have asked whether lady be widow there be man on board from kansa said fellow traveller who knew man named hurtle at leavenworth who be separated from wife be still alive there be according to queer story about man wife having fought duel with pistol then having separated mr ramsbottom who in earlier stage of affair have heard something of paul mr hurtle together managed to communicate to young man advice about railway company be very clear general such a honest man must certainly give might have be conveyed by letter information such a be respecting mr hurtle must only be given viva voce perhaps invitation to liverpool have originated in mr ramsbottom appreciation of fact a be asking after here perhaps be a well that must know friend said to paul have only thanked not daring on spur of moment to speak of own difficulty in there have be increased dismay there have also be comfort have only be at moment in have be subject to softer influence paul have doubted a to adherence to letter have written to breaking off engagement when told of wrong of love of promise former devotion to when assured that have given up everything in life for threw arm round looking into eye then must almost yield when what traveller called breeding of wild cat showed when having escaped from thought of hetta carbury of breeding be fully determined that let fate be what might must not be that of being husband of mr hurtle that be in mass of trouble from must be very difficult for to extricate be well aware if be true that mr hurtle be alive that fact might help certainly have declared to be not separated even divorced dead if be true also that have fought duel with one husband also ought to be reason why gentleman must object to become second husband fact must at rate justify to must enable to break from engagement without thinking to be false traitor must make up mind a to line of conduct must be made to know truth if meant to reject lady finally on score of being wild cat must tell so felt very strongly that must not flinch from wild cat claw that must have to undergo severe handling amount of clawing might perhaps go near life must perceive having done what have done must have right to shrink from such usage must tell to face that be not satisfied with past life that therefore must not marry of course might write to when summoned to presence must be unable to excuse even to for not going be misfortune also fault that have submitted to be loved by wild cat might be well that before saw must get hold of information might have appearance of real evidence returned from liverpool to london on morning of friday on board be held thought even more of than did of attack be prepared to make on mr melmotte if must come across traveller might learn something husband name have be caradoc carson hurtle if caradoc carson hurtle have be seen in state of kansa within last two year that certainly must be sufficient evidence a to duel felt that might be very hard to prove that if proved might be hard to found upon fact absolute right on part to withdraw from engagement there be rumour also though not corroborated during last visit to liverpool that have shot gentleman in oregon must get at truth of story if be true surely must justify to detective work be very distasteful to after having have woman in arm how must undertake such inquiry a must be almost necessary that must take in arm again while be making unless indeed made with knowledge be not duty a man to tell everything to herself to speak to thus be told that life with last husband be to say least of eccentric that even fought duel with must not marry woman who have fought duel certainly not woman who have fought with own husband be told also that shot gentleman in oregon may well be that gentleman deserved to be shot there be something in deed so repulsive to doubt irrationally on score also must decline to marry be told also that mr hurtle have be seen alive quite lately have understood from that be dead doubt may have be deceived a must not have engaged to have known truth so now consider justified in absolving from engagement be based on misconception must doubt be difficult to get through detail might be accomplished gradually unless in process of doing so must incur fate of gentleman in oregon at rate must declare to a well a must ground on claimed right to consider free must bear consequence such be resolve made on journey up from liverpool that trouble be also on mind when rose up to attack mr melmotte single handed at board when board be over also went down to beargarden perhaps with reference to board feeling hurt most be conviction that be spending money must never have have to spend have there be board have be twitted with at board meeting have justified by referring to money have be invested in company of fisker montague montague money be now supposed to have be made over to railway money be spending have come to after loose fashion knew that if called upon for account must hardly make out one must be square intelligible to party nevertheless spent much of time at beargarden dining there when engagement carried elsewhere on evening joined table with nidderdale at young lord instigation what made so savage at old melmotte to day said young lord did mean to be savage think that a call director ought to know something about suppose ought know know will tell have be thinking ca make out why mischief made director because be lord said paul bluntly suppose there be something in what good can do nobody think that know anything about business of course be in parliament often go there unless want to vote everybody know that be hard up ca understand governor said be to do so have done say know there be something between melmotte daughter if there be what have to do with railway in city why must carbury be there heaven earth why must old grendall be director be impecunious if be to pick out two most hopeless men in london in regard to money must be old grendall young carbury have be thinking good deal about ca make out have be thinking about too said paul suppose old melmotte be right asked nidderdale be question montague found difficult to answer how must be justified in whispering suspicion to man who be known to be at rate one of competitor for marie melmotte hand can speak out to know said nidderdale nodding head have got nothing to speak people say that be about richest man alive life a though be see why must be true nobody take know very much about when companion have left nidderdale sat down thinking of occurred to that must be coming cropper rather be to marry melmotte daughter for money then find that have got none little later in evening invited montague to go up to card room carbury grasslough dolly longestaffe be there waiting said paul declined be too full of trouble for play poor mile be there if be afraid of said nidderdale mile grendall must hinder said montague of course be confounded shame know that a well a body god bless owe fellow down in leicestershire

far a be concerned be just same like to live whether have got money not fear have many scruple about paying then like to let live too there be carbury always saying nasty thing about poor mile be playing without rap to back if be to lose vossner must stand l note because have won go on a though be old melmotte 'd better come up montague must go up without fixed purpose left club slowly sauntered northward through street till found in welbeck street hardly knew why went there certainly have not determined to call on lady carbury when left beargarden mind be full of mr hurtle a long a be present in london a long at rate a be unable to tell that have finally broken away from knew to be unfit companion for henrietta carbury indeed be still under promise made to roger carbury not that must avoid hetta company that for certain period a yet unexpired must not ask to be wife have be foolish promise made then repented without much attention to word still be existing paul knew well that roger trusted that must be kept nevertheless paul made way up to welbeck street almost unconsciously knocked at door lady carbury be not at home be out somewhere with mr roger carbury up to moment paul have not heard that roger be in town reader may remember that have come up in search of ruby ruggles miss carbury be at home page went on to say must mr montague go up see miss carbury without much consideration mr montague said that must go up see miss carbury mamma be out with roger said hetta endeavouring to save from confusion there be soiree of learned people somewhere made poor roger take ticket be only for friend therefore must not go be so glad to see what age be since met hardly since melmottes ball said hardly indeed have be here once since have brought roger up to town know what be mystery think whenever there be mystery be always afraid that there be something wrong about felix do get so unhappy about felix mr montague saw to day in city at railway board roger say railway board be sham paul must not keep from blushing a heard that felix must not be there then there be something going on about horrid man daughter be to marry lord nidderdale think be be talking

friend when wanted to see mr melmotte bolted into inner room took brother with must not have done that if have not be friend when saw almost thought that have consented to marriage roger have greatest dislike to mr melmotte know have said paul roger be always right be always safe to trust think so mr montague paul did think so be by mean disposed to deny to rival praise rightly belonged to still found subject difficult of course will never go against mamma continued hetta always feel that cousin roger be rock of strength so that if one did said one must never get wrong never found one else thought that of do think of one have more reason to praise than have think everybody have reason to praise have to do with will tell why think be whenever think anything say at least never say anything that doe think if spent thousand pound everybody must know that 'd got to spend other people be not like that be thinking of melmotte be thinking of everybody mr montague of everybody except

be planned in mother absence reader know that be not so roger certainly be man not liable to suspicion circumstance in case be suspicious there must have be nothing to suspect reason why paul must not have be there from promise have be given there be indeed breach of promise proved by paul presence in welbeck street roger felt rather than thought that two must hardly have spent evening together without such breach whether paul have broken promise by what have already said reader must be left to decide lady carbury be first to speak be quite unexpected pleasure mr montague whether roger suspected anything not did moment saw paul idea occurred to that meeting between hetta have be preconcerted yes said making lame excuse where excuse must have be made have nothing to do be lonely

carbury there thought that have be caught in trap have be very cross morning though in rage have be able on previous evening to dismiss titled lover to imply that never meant to see again now when remembrance of loss came upon amidst daily work when must no longer console in drudgery by thinking of beautiful thing be in store for by flattering that though at moment be little better than maid of work in lodging house time be soon coming in must bloom forth a baronet bride now in solitude almost regretted precipitancy of own conduct must be that must never see again that must dance more in gilded bright saloon might not be possible that have pressed too hard baronet of course must not like to be brought to book a must bring to book one a john crumb yet that must have said never that

away from home by such usage have not done amiss in coming to aunt roger have already heard few word from mr pipkin a to ruby late hour have heard also that there be lover knew very well who that lover be also be quite familiar with john crumb state of mind john crumb be gallant loving fellow who might be induced to forgive everything if ruby must only go back to must certainly persevere after

fine coat care about man coat said ruby john have ever word to say be ever so illustration care about man coat word to say what do word matter love love after fashion that want to make happy

sir felix carbury more then took leave if have failed to impress with admiration for john crumb have certainly be efficacious in lessening that have entertained for sir felix chapter xliv coming election very greatness of mr melmotte popularity extent of admiration be accorded by public at large to commercial enterprise financial sagacity created peculiar bitterness in opposition be organised

summer musquitoes so be keenness of hostility displayed on occasion in proportion to warmth of support be manifested a great man be praised so also be abused a be demi god to so be fiend to others indeed there be hardly other way in be possible to carry on contest against from moment in mr melmotte have declared purpose of standing for westminster in conservative interest attempt be made to drive down throat of elector by clamorous assertion of unprecedented commercial greatness seemed that there be one virtue in world commercial enterprise that melmotte be prophet seemed too that orator writer of day intended westminster to believe that melmotte treated great affair in spirit very different from animates bosom of merchant in general have risen above feeling of personal profit wealth

about four time a big a great britain in lately annexed country on great african lake may have be case that of thing be a yet only matter of conversation speculation a to mr melmotte mind imagination have be at work rather than pocket even credit be sufficiently matured to find way into public press to be used a strong argument why melmotte must become member of parliament for westminster praise be of course gall to who found called upon by demand of political position to oppose mr melmotte can run down demi god only by making out to be demi devil very person leading liberal of leading borough in england a called must perhaps have cared little about melmotte antecedent have not become duty to fight a conservative have great man found at last moment that own british politics have be liberal in nature very enemy must have be on committee be business to secure seat a melmotte supporter began battle with attempt at what liberal called bounce to carry borough with rush by overwhelming assertion of candidate virtue other party be driven to make enquiry a to candidate antecedent quickly warmed to work be not le loud in exposing satan of speculation than have be conservative in declaring commercial jove emissary be sent to paris francfort wire be used to vienna new york be not difficult to collect story true false quiet men who merely looked on at game expressed opinion that melmotte might have wisely abstained from glory of parliament nevertheless there be at first difficulty in finding proper liberal candidate to run against nobleman who have be elevated out of seat by death of father have be great whig magnate whose family be possessed of immense wealth of popularity equal to possession one of family might have contested borough at much le expense than other person to expense must have mattered little there be such member of forthcoming lord lord honourable honourable that son of other cognate lord already have seat be unwilling to

yacht four in hand at last candidate be selected whose nomination whose consent to occupy position created very great surprise in london world press have of course taken up matter very strongly morning breakfast table supported mr melmotte with weight there be people who said that support be given by mr broune under influence of lady carbury that lady carbury in way endeavoured to reconcile great man to marriage between daughter sir felix be more probable that mr broune saw thought that saw way wind sat that supported commercial hero because felt that hero must be supported by country at large in praising book putting foremost merit of official military claimant writing up charity in small matter of merely personal interest editor of morning breakfast table might perhaps allow to listen to lady whom loved knew work too well to jeopardize paper by such influence in matter might probably become interesting to world of reader there be strong belief in melmotte club thought that must be returned for westminster duke duchess feted city even city be showing wavering disposition to come round bishop begged for name on list of promoter of pet scheme royalty without stint be to dine at table melmotte be to sit at right hand of brother of sun of uncle of moon british royalty be to be arranged opposite so that one might seem to have place of most honour how must conscientious editor of morning breakfast table seeing how thing be going do other than support mr melmotte in fair justice may be well doubted whether lady carbury have exercised influence in matter evening pulpit took other side now be more remarkable more sure to attract attention inasmuch a evening pulpit have never supported liberal interest a be said in first chapter of work motto of newspaper implied that be to be conducted on principle of absolute independence have evening pulpit like of contemporary lived by declaring from day to day that liberal element be godlike opposite satanic a matter of course same line of argument must have prevailed a to westminster election a have not be so vigour of evening pulpit on occasion be more alarming more noticeable so that short article appeared almost daily in reference to mr melmotte be read by everybody now who be concerned in manufacture of newspaper be well aware that censure be infinitely more attractive than eulogy be quite a well aware that be more dangerous proprietor editor be ever brought before court at cost of ever so many hundred pound if thing go badly may rise to thousand because have attributed divinity to very poor specimen of mortality man be ever called upon for damage because have attributed grand motif might be well for politics literature art for truth in general if be possible to do so new law of libel must be enacted before such salutary proceeding can take place censure on other hand be open to very grave peril let editor have be ever so conscientious ever so beneficent even ever so true let be ever so clear that what have written have be written on behalf of virtue that have misstated fact exaggerated fault never for moment be allured from public to private matter may still be in danger of ruin very long purse else very high courage be needed for exposure of such conduct a evening pulpit attributed to mr paper took up line suddenly after second article mr alf sent back to mr mile grendall who in matter be acting a mr melmotte secretary ticket of invitation for dinner with note from mr alf stating that circumstance connected with forthcoming election for westminster must not permit to have great honour of dining at mr melmotte table in presence of emperor of china mile grendall showed note to dinner committee without consultation with mr melmotte be decided that ticket must be sent to editor of thorough going conservative journal conduct on part of evening pulpit astonished world considerably world be more astonished when be declared that mr ferdinand alf be going to stand for westminster on liberal interest various suggestion be made said that a mr alf have large share in newspaper a success be now established fact intended to retire from laborious position filled be therefore free to go into parliament others be of opinion that be beginning of new era in literature of new order of thing that from time forward editor must frequently be found in parliament if editor be employed of sufficient influence in world to find constituency mr broune whispered confidentially to lady carbury that man be fool for pain that be carried away by pride very clever dashing said mr broune never have ballast lady carbury shook head did not want to give up mr alf if must help have never said civil word of in paper still have idea that be well to be on good term with so great power entertained mysterious awe for mr alf much in excess of similar feeling excited by mr broune in regard to whom awe have be much diminished since have made offer of marriage sympathy a to election of course be with mr melmotte believed in thoroughly still thought that nod might be mean of making felix if not nod then money without nod suppose be very rich said speaking to mr broune respecting mr alf dare say have put by something election will cost l if go on a be doing now have better allow l for action for libel have already declared that will indict paper do believe about austrian insurance company be matter a to mr melmotte be supposed to have retired from paris not with clean hand believe 'evening pulpit ' can prove be sure that ca attempt to prove without expense of three four thousand pound be game in nobody win lawyer wonder at alf must have thought that must have known how to get said that wanted to have said without running with head into lion mouth have be so clever up to god know have be bitter enough have always sailed within wind mr alf have powerful committee by time animus in regard to election have be created strong enough to bring out men on side to produce heat when otherwise there might only have be warmth possibly frigidity whig marquis whig baron came forward with liberal professional men tradesman who have found that party to answer best democratical mechanic if melmotte money did not at last utterly demoralise lower class of voter there must still be good fight there be strong hope that under ballot melmotte money might be taken

three whole day to poor young lady who have disgraced by staying with melmottes be a follows miss longestaffe have disposal of two evening ticket for madame melmotte grand reception so greatly have melmottes risen in general appreciation that lady monogram have found that be bound on behalf of own position in society to be present on occasion must not do that name must not be in printed list of guest therefore have made serviceable bargain with old friend miss longestaffe be to have two ticket for reception miss longestaffe be to be received for three day a guest by lady monogram have also be conceded that at rate on one of night lady monogram must take miss longestaffe out with that must herself receive company on there be perhaps something slightly painful at commencement of

regular turn a soon a must occupy seat in house of common mr melmotte who be becoming somewhat arrogant be heard to declare that if club did not take when be willing to be taken might do without if not elected at once must withdraw name so great be prestige at moment with own party that there be mr longestaffe among number who pressed thing on committee mr melmotte be not like other men be great thing to have mr melmotte in party mr melmotte financial capability must in be tower of strength rule be not made to control club in matter of such importance a noble lord one among seven who have be named a fit leader of upper house on conservative side in next session be asked to take matter up men thought that thing might have be done have complied be old fashioned perhaps pig headed club for time lost honour of entertaining mr melmotte may be remembered that mr longestaffe have be anxious to become one of director of mexican railway that be rather snubbed than encouraged when expressed wish to mr melmotte like other great men mr melmotte liked to choose own time for bestowing favour since request be made proper time have come have now intimated to mr longestaffe that in somewhat altered condition of thing there must be place for at board that brother director must be delighted to avail of assistance alliance between mr melmotte mr longestaffe have become very close melmottes

better qualify for seat at board by taking share in company to amount of perhaps two three thousand pound mr longestaffe have of course consented there must be need of transaction in absolute cash share must of course be paid for out of mr longestaffe half of purchase money for pickering park must remain for present in mr melmotte hand to also mr longestaffe have consented not quite understanding why scrip must not be made over to at once be part of charm of dealing with great man that ready money seemed ever to be necessary for anything great purchase be made great transaction apparently completed without signing even of cheque mr longestaffe found to be afraid even to give hint to mr melmotte about ready money in speaking of such matter melmotte seemed to imply that everything necessary have be done when have said that be done pickering have be purchased title deed made over to mr melmotte l have not be paid have not be absolutely paid though of course mr melmotte note assenting to term be security sufficient for reasonable man property have be mortgaged though not heavily mr melmotte have doubt satisfied mortgagee there be still sum of l to come of dolly be to have one half other be to be employed in paying off mr longestaffe debt to tradesman debt to bank must have be very pleasant to have have at once mr longestaffe felt absurdity of pressing such man a mr melmotte be partly conscious of gradual consummation of new aera in money matter if banker be pressing refer to mr melmotte have said a for many year past have exchanged paper instead of

calculate value of time when come to about affair a 'd like to have money share said sir felix who be not specially averse to quarrelling with mr melmotte now that have resolved upon taking gentleman

thought of now be simply money best mean of getting out of melmotte hand be spendthrift said melmotte apparently relenting be afraid gambler suppose must give l more on account sir felix must not resist touch of ready money consented to take sum offered a pocketed cheque asked for name of broker who be employed to buy share here melmotte demurred friend said melmotte be only entitled to share

strand have made lowestoft what be be now just end of june weather be delightful people be not a yet flocking to sea shore shopkeeper in little town through country now follows fashion set by parliament abstains from annual holiday till august september place therefore be by mean full here there few of townspeople who at bathing place be generally indifferent to sea be strolling about few indifferent to fashion have come out from lodging house from hotel have be described a being small insignificant making up only hundred bed roger carbury whose house be not many mile distant from lowestoft be fond of sea shore always came to loiter there for while when cause brought into town now be walking close down upon marge of tide so that last little roll of rising water must touch foot with hand joined behind back face turned down towards shore when came upon couple who be standing with back to land looking forth together upon wave be close to before saw before have seen then perceived that man be friend paul montague leaning on paul arm lady stood dressed very simply in black with dark straw hat on head very simple in attire yet woman whom must be impossible to pas without notice lady of course be mr hurtle paul montague have be fool to suggest lowestoft folly have be natural be not first place have named when fault have be found with others have fallen back upon sea sand be best known to lowestoft be just spot mr hurtle required when have be shown room taken down out of hotel on to strand have declared to be charmed acknowledged with many smile that of course have have no right to expect mr pipkin must understand what sort of place needed paul must understand have understood think hotel charming said know what mean by fun about american hotel think quite gorgeous people so civil hotel people always be civil before crowd come of course be impossible that paul must return to london by mail train started about hour after arrival must have reached london at four five in morning have be very uncomfortable following day be sunday of course promised to stay till monday of course have said nothing in train of stern thing have resolved to say of course be not saying when roger carbury came upon be indulging in poetical nonsense probably very trite rapture a to expanse of ocean endless ripple connected shore with shore mr hurtle too a leaned with friendly weight upon arm indulged also in moonshine romance though at back of heart of of there be devouring care still enjoyed hour know that man who be to be hung like to have breakfast well cooked so did paul like companionship of mr hurtle because attire though simple be becoming because colour glowed in dark face because of brightness of eye happy sharpness of word dangerous smile played upon lip liked warmth of close vicinity softness of arm perfume from hair though must have given that possessed that have be removed from by impassable gulf a have to be hanged woman continued presence must be a bad a death to liked to have meal well dressed certainly have be foolish to bring to lowestoft close neighbourhood of carbury manor now felt folly a soon a saw roger carbury blushed up to forehead then leaving mr hurtle arm came forward shook hand with friend be mr hurtle said must introduce introduction be made roger took off hat bowed did so with coldest ceremony mr hurtle who be quick enough at gathering mind of people from look be just a cold in acknowledgment of courtesy in former day have heard much of roger carbury surmised that be friend to did not know that be thinking of coming to lowestoft said roger in voice be needlessly severe mind at present moment be severe must not hide mind illustration sand at lowestoft be not thinking of mr hurtle wished to get to sea a knew one else here in england brought mr montague have travelled so many mile together before now said that few additional will not make much difference do stay long asked roger in same voice

thank madam have dined then mr montague will leave with friend toilet though will be very slight will take longer than yours dine know in twenty minute wish must get friend to join so saying mr hurtle tripped back across sand towards hotel be wise demanded roger in voice be almost sepulchral a soon a lady be out of hearing may well ask carbury nobody know folly of so thoroughly a do then why do do do mean to marry certainly not be honest then like gentleman that must be with in way doe think that intend to marry have told must not have told then stopped be going on to declare that have told that loved woman felt that must hardly touch that matter in speaking to roger carbury what doe mean then have regard for own character must explain to carbury if must must never have patience to hear be not naturally impatient must drive mad wrote to assuring that must be over then came here sent for be not bound to go to yes to go to repeat what have said in letter did do so went with very purpose did repeat then must have left ah understand begged must not desert in loneliness have be so much together must not desert certainly understand that paul have allowed to be entrapped into promise of marriage then for reason will not go into now thought to be adequate resolved to break promise thinking that must be justified in doing so nothing can justify in living with lady afterwards on such term a to induce to suppose that old promise hold good doe not think so can not think so then what must be to be here with what must be to be here in public with one a be know why must trouble about people live now in way comprehend if be way of living have right to complain for god sake carbury speak in way sound a though meant to throw over must have said that have thrown over come down here to hotel where be known with lady whom be not going to marry meet just by chance have known of course must have turned other way coming on by accident a did how be not to speak to if speak what be to say of course think that lady will succeed in marrying never that marriage will be destruction doubtless be good looking yes clever must remember that manner of country be not a manner of country then if marry at said roger with prejudice expressed strongly in voice trust may not marry lady of country doe not think that be to marry yet come down here stay with paul believe believe believe be here with in order that may marry be cunning strong be foolish weak believing a do that marriage with must be destruction must tell mind leave paul at moment thought of gentleman in oregon of certain difficulty in leaving be what must do must go in now suppose eat dinner may come to hall a go back home certainly may come if please said roger then bethought that welcome have not be cordial mean that will be delighted to see added marching away along strand paul did go into hotel did eat dinner in meantime roger carbury marched far away along strand in that have said to montague have spoken truth that appeared to to be truth have not be influenced for moment by reference to own affair yet feared almost knew that man who have promised to marry strange american woman who be at very moment living in close intercourse with woman after have told that must not keep promise be chief barrier between girl that loved a have listened to john crumb while john spoke of ruby ruggles have told that john crumb be alike with honest true heart felt desire panted for companionship of fellow creature whom have chosen be to be thwarted by make believe regard of unworthy youth fatuous good look crumb by dogged perseverance indifference to many thing must probably be successful at last what chance be there of success for ruby a soon a want hardship told upon must return to strong arm must be trusted to provide with plenty comparative ease hetta carbury if once heart have passed from own dominion into possession of must never change love be possible doubt nay how probable that heart be still vacillating roger thought that knew that at rate have not a yet declared love if be now to know if must now learn of what nature be love of other man if must be instructed that be living alone with lady whom not long since have promised to marry if must be made to understand whole story of mr hurtle must not that open eye must not then see where must trust happiness where by so trusting must certainly be shipwrecked never said roger to hitting at stone on beach with stick never then got horse rode back to carbury manor chapter xlvii mr hurtle at lowestoft when paul got down into dining room mr hurtle be already there waiter be standing by side of table ready to take cover off soup be radiant with smile made especially pleasant during dinner paul felt sure that everything be not well with though smiled talked laughed there be something forced in manner almost knew that be only waiting till man must have left room to speak in different strain so be a soon a last lingering dish have be removed when door be finally shut behind retreating waiter asked question doubt have be on mind since have walked across strand to hotel friend be hardly civil be paul do mean that must have come in have doubt be true that have dined be quite indifferent about dinner there be two way of declining a there be of accepting suppose be on very intimate term with oh yes then want of courtesy be more evidently intended for in point of fact disapproves of be not that to question montague did not feel called upon to make immediate answer can well understand that must be so intimate friend may like dislike friend of friend without offence unless there be strong reason be bound to be civil to friend friend when accident brings together have told that mr carbury be beau ideal of english gentleman so be then why did behave a such mr hurtle again smiled did not feel that be rebuked for coming here with when expressed surprise at journey have authority over of course have not what authority must have nay know may be guardian in safe going country young men perhaps be not own master till be past thirty must have said that be guardian that intended to rebuke for being in bad company dare say did after have gone be so true that montague did not know how to deny be sure that must be well that must deny time must come why not now a well a at future moment have to make understand that must not join lot with chiefly indeed because heart be elsewhere reason on must hardly insist because must allege that have prior right to heart also because antecedent have be such a to cause friend to warn against marriage so plucked up courage for battle be nearly that said there be many probably greater portion of reader will be among number who will declare to that paul montague be poor creature in felt so great repugnance to face woman with truth folly in falling at first under battery of charm will be forgiven engagement unwise a be subsequent determination to break engagement will be pardoned woman perhaps men also will feel that be natural that must have be charmed natural that must have expressed admiration in form unmarried lady expect from unmarried men when such expression be to be made at natural also that must endeavour to escape from dilemma when found manifold danger of step have proposed to take woman think will be hard upon because of breach of faith to mr hurtle will be very hard on on score of cowardice a think unjustly in social life hardly stop to consider how much of daring spirit give mastery come from hardness of heart rather than from high purpose true courage man who succumbs to wife mother who succumbs to daughter master who succumbs to servant be a often brought to servility by continual aversion to giving of pain by softness cause fretfulness of others to be agony to a by actual fear firmness of imperious one may have produced there be inner softness thinness of mind skin incapability of seeing even thinking of trouble of others with equanimity produce feeling akin to fear be compatible not only with courage with absolute firmness of purpose when demand for firmness arises so strongly a to assert with man be not really that feared woman at least such fear did not prevail upon to be silent shrank from subjecting to blank misery of utter desertion after what have passed between must hardly bring

there must be considerable difficulty in operation chapter liv india office conservative party at particular period be putting shoulder to wheel not to push coach up hill to prevent being hurried along at pace be not only dangerous manifestly destructive conservative party now then doe put shoulder to wheel ostensibly with great national object above named also actuated by natural desire to keep own head well above water be generally doing something so that other party may not suppose that be moribund there be doubt member of who really think that when object have be achieved when for instance good old tory have be squeezed into parliament for borough of porcorum for last three parliament have be represented by liberal coach have be really stopped to in delightful faith there come at triumphant moment conviction that after people a people have not be really in earnest in effort to take something from greatness of great to add something to lowliness of lowly handle of windlass have be broken wheel be turning fast reverse way rope of radical progress be running back who know what may not be regained if conservative party will only put shoulder to wheel take care that handle of windlass be not mended sticinthemud have ever be doubtful little borough have just be carried by majority of fifteen long pull strong pull pull altogether old day will come back again venerable patriarch think of lord liverpool other hero dream dream of conservative bishop conservative lord lieutenant of conservative ministry will remain in for generation time be now present porcorum sticinthemud have done duty valiantly with much management westminster if special seat for westminster must be carried country then must hardly longer have doubt on matter if only mr melmotte must be got in for westminster must be manifest that people be sound at heart that great change have be effected during last forty year from first reform in parliament down to ballot have be managed by cunning treachery of few ambitious men not however that ballot be just now regarded by party a unmitigated evil though be last triumph of radical wickedness ballot be on whole popular with party short time since doubt be regarded by party a being one same a national ruin national disgrace have answered well at porcorum with due manipulation have be found to be favourable at ballot might perhaps help long pull strong pull in spite of ruin disgrace be thought by just now to be highly conservative measure be considered that ballot might assist melmotte at westminster very materially one reading conservative paper of time hearing conservative speech in borough one at least who lived so remote a not to have learned what thing really mean must have thought that england welfare depended on melmotte return in enthusiasm of moment attack made on character be answered by eulogy a loud a censure be bitter chief crime laid to charge be connected with ruin of great continental assurance company a to be said that have so managed a to leave utterly stranded with enormous fortune of own be declared that shilling have brought to england with have consisted of plunder stolen from shareholder in company now evening pulpit in endeavour to make fact of transaction known have placed what called domicile of company in paris whereas be ascertained that official head quarter have in truth be placed at vienna be not such blunder a sufficient to show that merchant of higher honour than mr melmotte have ever adorned exchange of modern capital then two different newspaper of time of antagonistic to melmotte failed to be in accord on material point one declared that mr melmotte be not in truth possessed of wealth other said that have derived wealth from unfortunate shareholder must anything betray so bad cause a contradiction such a must anything be so false so weak so malignant so useless so wicked so self condemned in fact so liberal a course of action such a belief naturally to be deduced from such statement nay unavoidable conviction on mind of at rate conservative newspaper be that mr melmotte have accumulated immense fortune that have never robbed shareholder of shilling friend of melmotte have basis of hope be enabled to sound premonitory note of triumph arising from cause quite external to party breakfast table supported melmotte breakfast table be not conservative organ support be given not to great man political opinion a to well known writer in paper suggested that great man have probably not a yet given very much attention to party question divided country to commercial position be generally acknowledged that few men living perhaps man alive have so acute insight into great commercial question of age a mr augustus melmotte in part of world might have acquired commercial experience for have be said repeatedly that melmotte be not englishman now made london home great britain country must be for welfare of country man must sit in british parliament such be argument used by breakfast table in supporting mr melmotte be of course assistance not le so because be asserted in other paper that country must be absolutely disgraced by presence in parliament hotter opposition keener will be support honest good men men who really loved country fine gentleman who have received unsullied name from great ancestor shed money right left grew hot in personally energetic struggle to have man returned to parliament a head of great conservative mercantile interest of great britain there be one man who thoroughly believed that thing at present moment most essentially necessary to england glory be return of mr melmotte for westminster man be undoubtedly very ignorant man knew nothing of one political question have vexed england for last half century nothing of political history have made england what be at beginning of half century of such name a hampden somers pitt have hardly ever heard have probably never read book in life knew nothing of working of parliament nothing of nationality have preference whatever for one form of government over never having given mind moment trouble on subject have not even reflected how despotic monarch federal republic might affect possibly did not comprehend meaning of term yet be fully confident that england did demand ought to demand that mr melmotte must be returned for westminster man be mr melmotte in conjunction of affair mr melmotte certainly lost head have audacity almost sufficient for very dangerous game be playing a crisis heaped upon crisis became deficient in prudence did not hesitate to speak of a man who ought to represent westminster of who opposed a little malignant being who have mean interest of own to serve went about in open carriage with lord alfred at left hand with look on face seemed to imply westminster be not good enough for even hinted to certain political friend at next general election must try city six month since have be humble man to lord now scolded earl snubbed duke yet did in manner showed how proud be of connecting with social pre eminence how ignorant of manner in such pre eminence affect english gentleman generally more arrogant became more vulgar be till even lord alfred must almost be tempted to rush away to impecuniosity freedom perhaps there be with whom conduct have salutary effect doubt arrogance will produce submission there be men who take other men at price other men put upon such person must not refrain from thinking melmotte to be mighty because swaggered gave hinder part to be kicked merely because put up toe know men of calibre how seem to grow in number net result of personal demeanour be injurious be debated among of warmest of supporter whether hint must not be given must lord alfred say word to said honourable beauchamp beauclerk who in parliament leading man in party thoroughly well acquainted with borough wealthy connected by blood with great conservative family in kingdom have be moving heaven earth on behalf of great financial king working like slave for success alfred more than half afraid of said lionel lupton young aristocrat also in parliament who have be inoculated with idea that interest of party demanded melmotte in parliament who must have given up scotch shooting rather than have undergone melmotte company for day something really must be done mr beauclerk said mr jones who be leading member of very wealthy firm of builder in borough who have become conservative politician who have thought of house for who never forgot own position be making great many personal enemy be finest old turkey cock out said lionel lupton then be decided that mr beauclerk must speak word to lord alfred rich man poor man be cousin have always be intimate alfred said chosen mentor at club one afternoon wonder whether must say something to melmotte about manner lord alfred turned sharp round looked into companion face tell be giving offence of course doe mean must draw little milder lord alfred made reply almost in whisper if ask think must if got down trampled on might make mild think there be other way must speak to then not unless did with horsewhip coming from lord alfred who be absolutely dependent on man be very strong lord alfred have be much afflicted that morning have spent hour with friend going about borough in open carriage standing just behind at meeting sitting close to in committee room have be nauseated with melmotte when spoken to about friend must not restrain lord alfred have be born bred gentleman found position in be now earning bread to be almost insupportable have gone against grain with at first when be called alfred now that be told just to open door just to give message almost meditated revenge lord nidderdale who be quick at observation have seen something of in grosvenor square declared that lord alfred have invested part of recent saving in cutting whip mr beauclerk when have got answer whistled withdrew be true to party melmotte be not first vulgar man whom conservative have taken by hand patted on back told that be god emperor of china be now in england be to be entertained one night at india office secretary of state for second great asiatic empire be to entertain ruler of first be on saturday th of july melmotte dinner be to take place on following monday very great interest be made by london world

secretary secretary of department chief clerk to head messenger wife if petitioner must not be admitted a guest into splendour of reception room might not be allowed to stand in passage whence emperor back might perhaps be seen so that if possible petitioner name might be printed in list of guest must be published on next morning now mr melmotte with family be of course supplied with ticket who be to spend fortune in giving emperor dinner be of course entitled to be present at other place to emperor must be brought to be shown melmotte have already seen emperor at breakfast in windsor park at ball in royal hall hitherto have not be presented to emperor presentation have to be restricted if only on score of time have be thought that a mr melmotte must of course have communication with hardworked emperor at own house must suffice have felt to be ill used be offended spoke with bitterness to of supporter of royal family generally because have not be brought to front rank at breakfast at ball now at india office be determined to have due be not on list of whom secretary of state intended on occasion to present to brother of sun have dined freely at period of career have taken to dining freely be in imprudent a have need at hour of best intelligence let not be understood that be tipsy be man whom wine did not often affect after fashion made who be arrogant before tower in arrogance till be almost sure to totter be probably at moment after dinner that lord alfred decided upon buying cutting whip of have spoken melmotte went with wife daughter to india office soon left far in background with request may say order to lord alfred to take care of may be observed here that marie melmotte be almost a great curiosity a emperor be much noticed a girl who have attempted to run away to new york have gone without lover melmotte entertained foolish idea a india office be in westminster have peculiar right to demand introduction on occasion because of candidature did succeed in getting hold of unfortunate under secretary of state studious invaluable young peer known a earl de griffin be shy man of enormous wealth of mediocre intellect great physical ability who never amused worked hard night day read everything that anybody must write more than other person must read about india have mr melmotte wanted to know exact dietary of peasant in orissa revenue of punjaub amount of crime in bombay lord de griffin must have informed without pause in matter of managing emperor under secretary have nothing to do must have be last man to be engaged in such service

in obstinacy lord alfred said to mr lupton who be there doubt might have be wise to have allowed merchant prince to return home with resolution that dinner must be abandoned must have repented probably before next morning have continued obdurate must not have be difficult to explain to celestial majesty that something preferable have be found for particular evening even to banquet at house of british commerce government must probably have gained seat for westminster a melmotte must at once have become very unpopular with great body of supporter lord de griffin be not man to see did make way up to mr wilson explained to amphytrion of night demand be made on hospitality thoroughly well established experienced political minister of state always feel that if can make friend appease enemy

consideration be to be shown to anybody intend to be considered prince treated very scurvily alfred will take opportunity of telling so on monday suppose man may be allowed to speak to own guest might turn election against if said anything prince did like d election sir stand before elector of westminster a man of business not a courtier a man who understands commercial enterprise not a one of prince toady of fellow in england realise matter yet can tell that think quite a great man a prince lord alfred looked at with strong reminiscence of old ducal home shuddered will teach lesson before long did teach lesson to night eh tell that lord de griffin have sixty thousand year to spend what be sixty thousand year did make go on business did make 'em do a chose want to tell that can tell know more of men woman than of fellow do who think know great deal went on through whole of long cigar afterwards a lord alfred slowly paced way back to lodging in mount street thought deeply whether

dishonesty of be no longer odious to then there come jealousy that others must be growing rich with approval of world natural aptitude to do what world approves seems to that existence of melmotte be not compatible with wholesome state of thing in general roger dined with bishop of elmham that evening same hero be discussed under different heading have given l said bishop to curate aid society

great man will perhaps be one of greatest known on face of globe melmotte convert to romanism will make present of thank to take believe that have such good riddance then father barham read paragraph out of surplice mr augustus melmotte great financier capitalist have presented hundred guinea towards erection of altar for new church of st fabricius in tothill field donation be accompanied by letter from mr melmotte secretary leaf little doubt that new member for westminster will be member inconsiderable member of catholic party in house during next session be dodge be said carbury what do mean by dodge mr carbury because money be given for pious object of happen to approve must be dodge dear father barham day before same great man gave l to protestant curate aid society have just left bishop exulting in great act of charity believe word of may be parting gift to church to belonged in darkness must be really proud of mr melmotte a convert must be proud of lowest human being have soul said priest of course be glad to welcome wealthy great great oh dear man be great who have made for position a of mr melmotte when such one leaf church join own be great sign to that truth be prevailing roger carbury without word took candle went to bed chapter lvi father barham visit london be considered to be great thing to catch roman catholic vote in westminster for many year have be considered great thing in house out of house to catch roman catholic vote there be two mode of catching vote that individual roman catholic may be promoted to place so that personally may be made secure right hand of fellowship may be extended to people of pope generally so that people of pope may be taught to think that general step be being made towards reconversion of nation first measure be easier effect be slight soon pass away promoted one though a far a prayer go may remain a good catholic a ever soon cease to be one of party to be conciliated be apt after while to be regarded by a enemy other mode if step be well taken may be very efficacious have now then occurred that roman catholic in ireland england have be brought to believe that nation be coming round to in that borough same conviction have be made to grow to catch protestant be peculiarly protestant vote roman catholic vote at same instant be feat difficult of accomplishment have be attempted before be attempted now by mr melmotte friend be perhaps thought by friend that protestant must not notice l given for altar to st fabricius mr alf be wide awake took care that mr melmotte religious opinion must be matter of interest to world at large during period of newspaper excitement there be perhaps article created so much general interest a appeared in evening pulpit with special question asked at head of for priest parson in article be more than usually delightful a being pungent from beginning to end a being unalloyed with dry didactic wisdom mr alf man who did that business declared that be really important that nation at large especially elector of westminster must know what be nature of mr melmotte faith that be man of highly religious temperament be most certain by munificent charity on behalf of religion two noble donation by chance have be made just at crisis be doubtless no more than regular continuation of ordinary flow of christian benevolence evening pulpit by mean insinuated that gift be intended to have reference to approaching election far be from evening pulpit to imagine so great man a mr melmotte looked for return in world from charitable generosity still a protestant naturally desired to be represented in parliament by protestant member a roman catholic a naturally desired to be represented by roman catholic perhaps mr melmotte must not object to declare creed be biting of course did mischief mr melmotte manager be not foolish enough to allow to actuate in way have thrown bread upon water assisting st fabricius with one hand protestant curate with other must leave result to take care of if protestant chose to believe that be hyper protestant catholic that be tending towards papacy so much better for enthusiastic religionist wishing to enjoy such conviction must not allow to be enlightened by manifestly interested malignity of mr alf newspaper may be doubted whether donation to curate aid society did have much effect may perhaps have induced resolution in few to go to poll whose mind be active in regard to religion torpid a to politics donation to st fabricius certainly have result be taken up made much of by roman catholic party generally till report got spread abroad almost believed that mr melmotte be going to join church of rome manoeuvre require most delicate handling evil may follow instead of good on second afternoon after question have be asked in evening pulpit answer to appeared for priest not for parson therein various assertion made by roman catholic organ repeated in roman catholic speech be brought together so a to show that mr melmotte really have at last made up mind on important question world knew now said mr alf writer that with keen sense of honesty be great financier peculiar characteristic great financier be name mr alf have specially invented for mr melmotte have doubted till truth be absolutely borne in upon whether must serve nation best a liberal a conservative have solved that doubt with wisdom now other doubt have passed through crucible by aid of fire golden certainty have be produced world of westminster at last knew that mr melmotte be roman catholic now nothing be clearer than though catching catholic vote must greatly help candidate real roman catholic must hope to be returned last article vexed mr melmotte proposed to friend to send letter to breakfast table asserting that adhered to protestant faith of ancestor a be suspected by many be now being whispered to world at large that melmotte have be born jew assurance must perhaps have be too strong hing of kind said mr beauchamp beauclerk if one asks question at meeting say that be protestant be likely a have none own people go writing letter unfortunately gift of altar to st fabricius be such godsend sundry priest about country be determined to cling to good man who have bestowed money so well think that many of did believe that be great sign of beauteous stirring of people mind in

in quarter of globe believed because be so told by surplice that man be at heart catholic that man must be at heart catholic live in world professing protestant religion be not to father barham

squercum be inclined to think that bideawhile must not have done that melmotte must have have opportunity that father must have be practitioner be not trick of pompous old fool said mr squercum in soliloquy went to work however making detestably odious among very respectable clerk in mr bideawhile office men who considered to be altogether superior to squercum in professional standing illustration mr squercum in office now there came rumour be so far particular in detail that inferred forgery of accused mr melmotte to mode of acquiring pickering property nature of forgery be of course described in various way a be also signature said to have be forged there be many who believed almost believed that something wrong have be done that great fraud have be committed in connection with be ascertained by a matter of certainty that pickering estate have be already mortgaged by melmotte to full value at assurance office in such transaction there must be nothing dishonest a place have be bought for great man own family use not a speculation even report of mortgage tended to injure credit then a day went on other tidings be told a to other property house in east end of london

have be asked to sign that have said in own usually pompous style that mr longestaffe junior be still prone to create unsubstantial difficulty mr bideawhile be obliged to confess that there have be want of caution among own people allusion to creation of difficulty by dolly accompanied a be supposed to have be by dolly letter doing away with difficulty must have attracted notice dolly letter must have come in separate envelope such envelope must not be found circumstance be not remembered by clerk clerk who have prepared letter for dolly signature represented a having be quite satisfied when letter came again beneath notice with dolly well known signature such be fact a far a be known at messrs slow bideawhile office from whom slightest rumour emanated a have be in part collected by squercum who be probably le prudent bideawhiles be still perfectly sure that dolly have signed letter believing young man to be quite incapable of knowing on day what have done on day before squercum be quite sure that client have not signed must be owned on dolly behalf that manner on occasion be qualified to convince yes said to squercum be easy saying that be lack daisical know when be lack daisical when be not awake asleep drunk sober never signed that letter mr squercum believed must be hard to say how rumour first got into city on monday morning though elder longestaffe have first heard of matter only on previous saturday mr squercum have be at work for above week mr squercum little matter alone might hardly have attracted attention certainly be given on day to mr melmotte private affair other fact coming to light assisted squercum view great many share of south central pacific mexican railway have be thrown upon market of have passed through hand of mr cohenlupe mr cohenlupe in city have be to mr melmotte a lord alfred have be at west end then there be mortgage of pickering property for money certainly have not be paid there be traffic with street of house near commercial road by large sum of money have come into mr melmotte hand might no doubt be right there be many who thought that must all be right there be not few who expressed most thorough contempt for rumour be felt to be pity mr melmotte be not in city be day of dinner lord mayor have even made up mind that must not go to dinner what one of brother alderman said to about leaving others in lurch might be quite true a lordship remarked melmotte be commercial man a be commercial transaction behoved lord mayor of london to be more careful than other men have always have doubt must not go others of chosen few of city who have be honoured with command to meet emperor resolved upon absenting unless lord mayor went affair be very much discussed there be le than six declared city defaulter at last moment seventh be taken ill sent note to mile grendall excusing be thrust into secretary hand just a emperor arrived reverse worse than took place defalcation more injurious to melmotte interest generally even than be caused either by prudence by cowardice of city magnate house of common at meeting have heard tidings in exaggerated form be whispered about melmotte have be detected in forging deed of conveyance of large property that have already be visited by policeman by be believed that great financier must lie in hand of philistine while emperor of china be being fed at house in third edition of evening pulpit came out mysterious paragraph nobody must understand who have known about before rumour be prevalent that fraud to enormous extent have be committed by gentleman whose name be particularly unwilling to mention if be so be indeed remarkable that must have come to light at present moment can not trust ourselves to say more than one wish to dine with swindler one like even to have dined with swindler especially to have dined with at time when swindling be known suspected emperor of china doubt be going to dine with man motion of emperor be managed with such ponderous care that be held to be impossible now to save country from what must doubtless be felt to be disgrace if must hereafter turn out that forger have be solicited to entertain imperial guest of country be thing a yet so far certain a to justify such charge be possible many men be unhappy in mind how must story be told hereafter if melmotte must be allowed to play out game of host to emperor be arrested for forgery a soon a eastern monarch must have left house how must brother of sun like remembrance of banquet have be instructed to honour with presence how must tell in foreign newspaper in new york in paris vienna that man who have be cast forth from united state from france from austria have be selected a great honourable type of british commerce there be in house who thought that absolute consummation of disgrace might yet be avoided who be of opinion that dinner must be postponed leader of opposition have few word on subject with prime minister be merest rumour said prime minister have inquired there be nothing to justify in thinking that charge can be substantiated say that story be believed in city must not feel justified in acting upon report prince might probably find impossible not to go where must be if mr melmotte to morrow be able to prove whole to be calumny to show that thing have be got up with view of influencing election at westminster dinner must certainly go on will go most assuredly said prime minister hope that will keep in countenance political antagonist declared with smile at crisis must not desert honourable friend must not answer for follower there be admitted strong feeling among leader of conservative party of distrust in melmotte considered probable that among friend who have be invited there must be who must be unwilling to meet even emperor of china on existing term must remember said prime minister that be also to meet own prince that empty seat on occasion will be dishonour to just at present can only answer for said leader of opposition at moment even prime minister be much disturbed in mind in such emergency prime minister can only choose least of two evil to have taken emperor to dine with swindler must be very bad to desert to stop coming of emperor prince on false rumour must be worse chapter lix dinner doe sometimes occur in life that unambitious man who be in degree given to enterprise who must fain be safe be driven by cruelty of circumstance into position in must choose side in though have certain guide a to side must choose be aware that will be disgraced if must take wrong side be felt a hardship by many who be quite suddenly forced to make up mind whether must go to melmotte dinner join to faction of who have determined to stay away although have accepted invitation there be not without suspicion that story against melmotte have be got up simply a electioneering trick so that mr alf might carry borough on next day a dodge for election might be very well who might be deterred by such manoeuvre from meeting emperor supporting prince must surely be marked men none of wife when be consulted seemed to care straw whether melmotte be swindler not must emperor prince princess be there be only question concerned did not care whether melmotte be arrested at dinner after dinner so long a with others must show diamond in presence of eastern western royalty yet what fiasco must be if at very instant of time host must be apprehended for common forgery great thing be to ascertain whether others be going if hundred more out of two be to be absent how dreadful must be position of who be present how must thing go if at last moment emperor must be kept away prime minister have decided that emperor prince must remain altogether in ignorance of charge be preferred against man of

pleasure in believing reasonable hesitation at moment be dull phlegmatic if accused one be near enough to ourselves to make accusation matter of personal pain of course disbelieve if distance be beyond be almost ready to think that anything may be true of anybody in case nobody really loved melmotte everybody did believe be so probable that man must have done something horrible be only hoped that fraud might be great horrible enough melmotte during part of evening be passed up stair kept in close vicinity of royalty behaved certainly very much better than must have done have have weight

defection of lord mayor have hit hardest what coward be men went on with work not noticing probably not knowing dinner have be done by contract contractor foreman be there care of house alteration

in german croll touched hat bade good night melmotte listened anxiously to tone of man voice trying to catch from indication of mind within did croll know of rumour if so what did think of croll have known in perilous circumstance before have helped through paused moment a though must ask question resolved at last that silence must be safest will see everything safe eh croll croll said that must see everything safe melmotte passed out into square have not far to go round through berkeley square into bruton street stood for few moment looking up at bright star if must be there in one of unknown distant world with present intellect none of present burden must thought do better than have done here on earth if must even now put down nameless fameless without possession in distant corner of world must thought do better be augustus melmotte must bear burden whatever be to end must reach place so distant that must be known traced illustration mr melmotte speculates chapter lxiii mr melmotte on day of election election of member of parliament by ballot in borough so large a of westminster have a yet be achieved in england since ballot have be established by law men who heretofore have known thought that knew how election must go who counted up promise told off professed enemy weighed doubtful one now confessed to be in dark three day since odds have be considerably in melmotte favour have come from reputation attached to name rather than from calculation a to politics of voter then sunday have intervened on monday melmotte name have continued to go down in betting from morning to evening early in day supporter have thought little of attributing fall to vacillation be customary in such matter towards latter part of afternoon tidings from city have be in everybody mouth melmotte committee room have be almost deserted at six o'clock there be who suggested that name must be withdrawn such suggestion however be made to perhaps because one dared to make on monday evening work strategy for election a regarded melmotte party died away interest of hour be turned to dinner mr alf supporter be very busy there have be close consultation among few of a to what must be done by committee a to charge against opposite candidate in pulpit of evening allusion have be made to affair be of course sufficiently intelligible to who be immediately concerned in matter have given name mentioned detail mr alf explained that have be put in by sub editor that only afforded such news a paper be bound to give to public pointed out fact that note of triumph have be sounded that rumour have not be connected with election one old gentleman be of opinion that be bound to make most of be more than have believed along said old gentleman why be to let fellow like get seat if can keep out be of opinion that everything must be done to make rumour with exaggeration a public a possible so that there must be opening for indictment for libel clever old gentleman be full of device by might be effected committee generally be averse to fight in manner public opinion have bar a well a law court if after melmotte have committed no fraud a be much more probable must not be convicted of fraud then must be said that accusation have be forged for purely electioneering purpose there might be rebound must pretty well crush who have be concerned individual gentleman must of course say what pleased to individual voter be agreed at last that overt use must be made of rumour by mr alf committee in regard to other matter who worked under committee be busy enough dinner to emperor be turned into ridicule elector be asked whether felt bound to return gentleman out of city to parliament because have offered to spend fortune on entertaining royalty then assembled in london there be very much said on placard published in newspaper to discredit of melmotte nothing be so printed must not have appeared with equal venom have recent rumour never be sent out from city at twelve o'clock at night when mr alf committee room be being closed when melmotte be walking home to bed general opinion at club be very much in favour of mr alf on next morning melmotte be up before eight a yet policeman have called for have official intimation reached that accusation be to be brought against on coming down from bedroom at once went into back parlour on ground floor mr

two heavy desk table in room furnished with drawer down to ground one of owner of house have kept locked for own purpose when bargain for temporary letting of house have be made mr melmotte mr longestaffe be close friend term for purchase of pickering have just be made cause for suspicion have a yet arisen everything between two gentleman have be managed with greatest ease oh dear yes mr longestaffe must come whenever pleased melmotte always left house at ten never returned till six lady must never enter that room servant be to regard mr longestaffe quite a master of house a far a room be concerned if mr longestaffe must spare mr melmotte must take key of one of table matter be arranged very pleasantly mr melmotte on entering room bolted door then sitting at own table took certain paper out of drawer bundle of letter of small document from with very little examination took three four two three perhaps from tore into very small fragment burned bit holding over gas burner letting ash fall into large china plate then blew ash into yard through open window did to all document one one put bit by bit into mouth chewing paper into pulp till swallowed when have done have re locked own drawer walked across to other table mr longestaffe table pulled handle of one of drawer opened then without touching content again closed then knelt down examined lock hole above into bolt of lock ran having done again closed drawer drew back bolt of door seating at own desk rang bell be close to hand servant found writing letter after usual hurried fashion be told that be ready for breakfast always breakfasted alone with heap of newspaper around so did on day soon found paragraph alluding to in pulpit read without quiver in face slightest change in colour there be one to see now be acting under resolve at moment either when alone in crowd when suddenly called upon for word not even when policeman with first hint of arrest must come upon must betray by working of single muscle loss of drop of blood from heart must go through always armed without sign of shrinking have to be done must do at ten walked down to central committee room at whitehall place thought that must face world better by walking than if be taken in own brougham gave order that carriage must be at committee room at eleven wait hour for if be not there went along bond street piccadilly regent street through pall mall to charing cross with blandly triumphant smile of man who have successfully entertained great guest of day a got near club met two three men whom knew bowed to returned bow graciously enough not one of stopped to speak to of one knew that must have stopped have not be for rumour even after man have passed on be careful to show displeasure on face must take a must come still be blandly triumphant merchant prince a long a police must allow probably be not aware how very different be part be now playing from have assumed at india office at committee room only found few understrappers be informed that everything be going on regularly elector be balloting with ballot so said leader of understrappers there never be excitement men looked half frightened a though did not quite know whether ought to seize candidate hold till constable came certainly have not expected to see there have lord alfred be here melmotte asked standing in inner room with back to empty grate lord alfred have not be there mr grendall senior understrapper knew that melmotte must have asked for secretary not for mr grendall for rumour be so hard not to tumble into scylla when be avoiding charybdis mr grendall have not be there indeed nobody have be there in fact there be nothing more to be done suppose said mr melmotte senior understrapper thought that there be nothing more to be done left word that brougham must be sent away strolled out again on foot went up into covent garden where there be polling place seemed to a one of chief centre for contested election to be wonderfully quiet be determined to face everybody everything went close up to booth here be recognised by various men mechanic chiefly who came forward shook hand with remained there for hour conversing with people at last made speech to little knot around did not allude to rumour of yesterday to paragraph in pulpit to name have not be attached spoke freely enough of general accusation have be brought against previously wished elector to understand that nothing have be said against made ashamed to meet here elsewhere be proud of position proud that elector of westminster must recognise did not be glad to say know much of law be told that law must protect from such aspersion a have be unfairly thrown upon flattered that be too good englishman to regard ordinary political attack to candidate be a matter of course subject at election must stretch back to bear perhaps little more than particularly a looked forward to triumphant return thing have be said published excitement of election must not justify a to thing must have recourse to law then made allusion to prince emperor concluded by observing that be proudest boast of life to be englishman londoner be asserted afterwards that be only good speech have ever be known to make be certainly successful a be applauded throughout covent garden reporter for breakfast table who be on duty at place looking for paragraph a to conduct of elector gave account of speech in paper made more of perhaps than deserved be asserted afterwards given a great proof of melmotte cleverness that have planned thing gone to covent garden alone having considered that in way must best regain step in reputation in truth affair have not be preconcerted be while in whitehall place that have first thought of going to covent garden have have idea of making speech till people have gathered round be then noon have to determine what must do next be half inclined to go round to booth make speech success at covent garden have be very pleasant to feared that might not be so successful elsewhere have shown that be not afraid of elector then idea struck that must go boldly into city to own office in abchurch lane have determined to be absent on day must not be expected appearance there must not on account be taken amiss enmity there might be peril must face got cab therefore have driven to abchurch clerk be hanging about doing nothing a though be holiday dinner election rumour together have altogether demoralized of at least be there showed sign of absolute insubordination mr grendall have not be here asked mr grendall have not be there mr cohenlupe be in mr grendall room at moment hardly desired to see mr cohenlupe that gentleman be privy to many of transaction be by mean privy to mr cohenlupe knew that estate at pickering have be purchased knew that have be mortgaged knew also what have become of money have so be raised knew nothing of circumstance of purchase although probably surmised that melmotte have succeeded in getting title deed on credit without paying money be afraid that must hardly see cohenlupe hold tongue that must not speak to without danger cohenlupe might have to stand in dock together cohenlupe have none of spirit clerk must think must talk be to leave office without seeing old friend went therefore into own room called to cohenlupe a did so ve did expect here to day said member for staines did expect to come there be much to do at westminster while ballot be going on so came up just to look at letter dinner went off pretty well yesterday eh uncommon nothing better vy did lord mayor stay away melmotte because be as cur said mr melmotte with assumed air of indignation alf people have got hold of there be ever so much fuss about at first whether must accept invitation say be insult to city to take not to come will be even with of day thing will go on just same a usual melmotte go on of course will go what be to hinder there be ever so much be said

fashion to room behind bank in sat manager manager one clerk stood upon rug before fire place just a though nothing have happened a nearly a though nothing have happened a be within compass of power must not quite do in keeping up appearance intended to be natural be obliged to be somewhat milder than wont manager did not behave nearly a well a did clerk manifestly betrayed emotion melmotte saw that be so have expected have come there on purpose to put down hardly expected to see in city to day mr melmotte did expect to see here always happens that when one expects that there be most to be done there be nothing to be done at be at work down at westminster balloting a ca go on voting for be of use have be at covent garden morning making stump speech if that say there be true have much to

rosy hue because of love have be declared to must not be happy if really loved a have told that loved must be true to through everything in present mood must not speak of to brother took opportunity of making good promise marie melmotte have extracted from gave short account of party told that have talked with marie promised to give message said be of use now said felix must tell what said think know that really love what be good of man ca marry girl when policeman in country be dodging want to let know what what intend to do if mean to give up think must tell how can tell suppose must let receive letter will write to will see just a like care felix be very heartless suppose be much worse than other men for matter of worse than great many woman of here put up to marry never put up to mother did now because did not go off serene be to hear nothing reproach of course never cared so very much about oh felix be so shocking awfully shocking dare say think be a black a very mischief sugar must melt in other men mouth other men be just a bad a be good deal worse too believe that there be nobody on earth like paul montague hetta blushed said nothing be not yet in condition to boast of lover before brother did in very truth believe that few young men be a true hearted a paul montague suppose 'd be surprised to hear that master paul be engaged to marry american widow living at islington mr montague engaged to marry american widow believe 'd better believe if be concern of yours for be true be true too that travelled about with for ever so long in united state that have down with at hotel at lowestoft about fortnight ago there be mistake about believe repeated hetta feeling that to say even a much a be relief to must not be true be impossible that man must have come to with such lie in mouth a though word astounded though felt faint almost a though must fall in swoon yet in heart of heart did not believe surely be horrid joke perhaps trick to divide from man loved felix how dare say thing so wicked a to what be there wicked in if have be fool enough to become fond of man be only right must be told be engaged to marry mr hurtle be lodging with one mr pipkin in islington know house must take there to morrow show woman there said be where be wrote mr hurtle name down on scrap of paper be not true said hetta rising from seat standing upright be engaged to mr

master paul by heaven yes will answer to mother must manage will not scruple to ask roger will believe what roger tell believe word of said hetta leaving room when be alone be very wretched there must be foundation for tale why must felix have referred to roger carbury did feel that there be something in brother manner forbade to reject whole story a being altogether baseless so sat upon bed cried thought of tale have heard of faithless lover yet why must man have come to not only with soft word of love asking hand in marriage if really be true that be in daily communication with woman whom have promised to make wife nothing on subject be said at dinner hetta with difficulty to herself sat at table did not speak lady carbury son be nearly a silent soon after dinner felix slunk away to music hall theatre in quest probably of other ruby ruggles then lady carbury who have now be told a much a son knew again attacked daughter very much of story felix have learned from ruby ruby have of course learned that paul be engaged to mr hurtle mr hurtle have at once declared fact to mr pipkin mr pipkin have be proud of position of lodger ruby have seen paul montague at house have known that have taken mr hurtle to lowestoft have also become known to two woman aunt niece that mr hurtle have seen roger carbury on sand at lowestoft thus whole story with most of detail not quite with have

be true will never be contented again if be true will never believe anything ca be true suppose there be something ca be that story be not altogether displeasing to lady carbury though pained to see agony daughter suffered have wish that paul montague must be son in law still thought that if roger must persevere might succeed on very night before went to bed wrote to roger told whole story if said know that there be such person a mr hurtle if know also that mr montague have promised to make wife of course will tell then declared own wish thinking that by doing so must induce roger carbury to give such real assistance in matter paul montague must certainly be driven away who must feel so much interest in doing a roger who be so closely acquainted with circumstance of montague life know said what wish be about hetta how utterly opposed be to mr montague interference if be true a felix say that be at present moment entangled with woman be guilty of gross insolence if know circumstance can surely protect also chapter lxviii miss melmotte declares purpose poor hetta passed very bad night story have heard seemed to be almost too awful to be true even about one else man have come to

afterwards will make lord nidderdale repent hour saw may tell papa then having thus entrusted message to madame melmotte marie left room chapter lxix melmotte in parliament melmotte did not return home in time to hear good news that day good news a must regard even though when told to must be accompanied by extraneous addition with marie have communicated purpose to madame melmotte be nothing to what girl thought of marriage if marriage must now be brought about too have cause for vexation if not for anger if marie have consented fortnight since might have so hurried affair that lord nidderdale might by time have be secured now there might be must be doubt through folly of girl villany of sir felix carbury be once father in law of eldest son of marquis thought might almost be safe even though something might be proved against might come to certain proof in le august circumstance matter must hardly be pressed against member for westminster whose daughter be married to heir of marquis of auld reekie so many person must then be concerned of course vexation with marie have be great of course wrath against sir felix be unbounded seat for westminster be be to be seen to occupy before world on very day have not a yet heard that daughter have yielded in reference to lord nidderdale there be considerable uneasiness felt in circle a to manner in melmotte must take seat when be put forward a conservative candidate for borough good deal of fuss have be made with by certain leading politician have be manifest intention of party that return if be returned must be hailed a great conservative triumph be made much of through length breadth of land be returned trumpet have not a yet be sounded loudly on sudden within space of forty eight hour party have become ashamed of man now who be to introduce to house with feeling of shame on one side there be already springing up idea among class that melmotte might become a be conservative tribune of people that might be realization of hitherto hazy mixture of radicalism old fogyism of have lately heard from political master whose eloquence have be employed in teaching that progress can only be expected from whose declared purpose be to stand still new farthing newspaper mob be already putting melmotte forward a political hero preaching with reference to commercial transaction grand doctrine magnitude in affair be valid defence for certain irregularity napoleon though may exterminate tribe in carrying out project can not be judged by same law a young lieutenant who may be punished for cruelty to few negro mob thought that good deal must be overlooked in melmotte that philanthropy of great design must be allowed to cover multitude of sin know that theory be ever so plainly put forward a be done by ingenious courageous writer in mob in practice have commanded assent of many intelligent mind mr melmotte therefore though be not where have be before wretched squercum have set afloat rumour a to purchase of pickering be able to hold head much higher than on unfortunate night of great banquet have replied to letter from messrs slow bideawhile by note written in ordinary way in office only signed by in merely said that must lose time in settling matter a to purchase of pickering slow bideawhile be of course anxious that thing must be settled wanted prosecution for forgery to make clear in matter client if possible to take wind out of sail of odious squercum must suit best be prone to hope that for own sake melmotte must raise money if be raised there must be reason why note purporting to have be signed by dolly longestaffe must ever leave office still protested belief that did bear dolly signature have various excuse for must have be useless for to summon dolly to office a knew from long experience dolly must not come very letter written by a suggestion given to dolly father have come back to with dolly ordinary signature sent to a believed with other paper by dolly father what justification must be clearer still money have not be paid be fault of longestaffe senior if money must be paid must set everything right squercum evidently thought that money must not be paid be ceaseless in intercourse with bideawhile people charged slow bideawhile with having delivered up title deed on authority of mere note that note with forged signature demanded that note must be impounded on receipt by mr bideawhile of melmotte rather curt reply mr squercum be informed that mr melmotte have promised to pay money at once that day two must be allowed mr squercum replied that on client behalf must open matter before lord mayor in way two three day have passed without renewal of accusation before public melmotte have in certain degree recovered position beauclerks luptons disliked feared a much a ever did not quite dare to be so loud confident in condemnation a have be be pretty well known that mr longestaffe have not received money be condition of thing tending greatly to shake credit of man living after melmotte fashion there be crime in forgery be implied by publication of statement to effect longestaffes father son might probably have be very foolish whoever expected anything folly from slow bideawhile might have be very remiss in duty be astonishing people said what thing attorney must do in day who have expected to see melmotte behind bar of prison before have regulated conduct accordingly now imagined that have be deceived have westminster triumph be altogether triumph must have become pleasant duty of popular conservative to express to melmotte pleasure must have in introducing new political ally to house in such case melmotte must have be walked up chamber with pleasurable ovation thing must have be done without trouble to now be not position of affair though matter be debated at carlton such popular conservative offered service think ought to throw over mr beauclerk said sir orlando drought quite leading conservative suggested that a lord nidderdale be very intimate with mr melmotte might do be not man for such performance be very good fellow everybody liked belonged to house because father have territorial influence in scotch county never did anything there selection for duty must be declaration to world nobody else must do must hurt lupton said mr beauclerk not at said lupton also like nidderdale be young man of use great deal too bashful melmotte who knew little about went down to house at four o'clock somewhat cowed by want of companionship carrying out resolution that must be stopped by phantom fear that must lose nothing by want of personal pluck knew that be member concluded that if presented must be able to make way in assume right here again fortune befriended very leader of party very founder of new doctrine of be thought that melmotte might become apostle expounder who a reader may remember have undertaken to be present at banquet when colleague be dismayed untrue to who kept promise sat there almost in solitude happened to be entering house a late host be claiming from door keeper fruition of privilege have better let accompany said conservative leader with something of chivalry in heart so mr melmotte be introduced to house by head of party when be seen many men supposed that rumour have be proved to be altogether false be not guarantee sufficient to guarantee man respectability lord nidderdale saw father in lobby of house of lord afternoon told what have occurred old man have be in state of great doubt since day of dinner party be aware of ruin must be incurred by marriage with melmotte daughter if thing have be said of melmotte must be proved to be true knew also that if son must now recede there must be end of match altogether did not believe rumour be fully determined that money must be paid down before marriage be celebrated if son be to secede now of course money must be forthcoming be prepared to recommend son to go on with affair still little longer old cure tell doe believe word of said father cure be family lawyer of marquis of auld reekie there be hitch about dolly longestaffe money sir said son what be to if have money ready suppose be always easy even for man like to get couple of hundred thousand together know have never found easy to get thousand if have borrowed trifle from longestaffe to make up girl money sha complain stand to gun there be harm done till parson have said word must let have couple of hundred must sir suggested son must replied father with very determined aspect be awfully hard up

tremendous speaker did not strike with awe have expected seemed to that who spoke be talking much like other people in other place for first hour hardly caught meaning of sentence be said did try to do so one man got up very quickly after of barely rising on leg to say few word that uttered seemed to to be very common place affair not so awful a festive occasion on have occasionally be called upon to propose toast to return thanks then suddenly manner of thing be changed one gentleman made long speech melmotte by time weary of observing have begun to listen word be familiar to reached ear gentleman be proposing little addition to commercial treaty be expounding in very strong language ruinous injustice to england be exposed by being tempted to use glove made in country in income tax be

belonging did not recognise paul montague chapter lxxiii marie fortune when marie melmotte assured sir felix carbury that father have already endowed with large fortune must not be taken from without own consent spoke more than truth knew of matter almost a little a be possible that must know a far a reticence on subject be compatible with object have in view melmotte have kept from knowledge of detail of arrangement have be necessary when thing be done to explain to pretend to explain much marie memory also intelligence have be strong beyond father anticipation be deriving very considerable income from large sum of money have invested in foreign fund in name have got to execute power of attorney enabling to draw income on behalf have done fearing shipwreck in course meant to run resolved that let circumstance go a might there must still be left enough to of money have realised to enable to live in comfort luxury must be doomed to live in obscurity even in infamy have sworn to solemnly that under circumstance must allow money to go back into vortex of speculation hitherto have be true to oath though bankruptcy apparent ruin might be imminent must not bolster up credit by use of money even though might appear at moment that money must be sufficient for purpose if such day must come then with certain income must make happy if possible at rate luxurious in city of world might know least of antecedent give warmest welcome on behalf of wealth such have be scheme of life have failed to consider various circumstance daughter might be untrue to in event of marriage might fail to release property might be that very money must be required to dower daughter there might come trouble on so great that even certainty of future income must not enable to bear now at present moment mind be tortured by great anxiety be to resume property must more than enable to pay be due to longestaffes must do tide for time over other difficulty now in regard to longestaffes certainly have desire to depart from rule have made for on behalf be necessary that crash must come must be a good creditor a other then be painfully alive to fact that something beyond simple indebtedness be involved in transaction have with own hand traced dolly longestaffe signature on letter have found in old mr longestaffe drawer have found in envelope addressed by elder mr longestaffe to messrs slow bideawhile have posted letter in pillar box near to own house in execution of manoeuvre circumstance have greatly befriended have become tenant of mr longestaffe house at same time have only be joint tenant of mr longestaffe study so that mr longestaffe paper be almost in very hand to pick lock be with accomplishment long since learned science in line did not go so far a to enable to replace bolt in receptacle have picked lock have found letter prepared by mr bideawhile with accompanying envelope have then already learned enough of domestic circumstance of longestaffe family to feel assured that unless must assist expedition of hitherto uncompleted letter by own skill letter must never reach intended destination in fortune have in degree befriended circumstance being a be be hardly possible that forgery must be discovered even though young man be to swear that signature be not even though old man be to swear that have left that drawer properly locked with unsigned letter in still there must be evidence people might think people might speak people might feel sure then crash must come there must still be that ample fortune on to retire eat drink make merry for rest of day then there came annoying complication in affair what have be so easy in reference to letter dolly longestaffe never must have signed be le easy still feasible in matter under joint pressure of immediate need growing ambition increasing audacity have be done then rumour be spread abroad to melmotte be serious indeed named at rate in reference to dolly longestaffe very thing have be done now if like of be brought actually home to if twelve juryman must be got to say that have done that thing of what use then must be money when fear arose then there arose also question whether might not be well to use money to save from such ruin if might be so used doubt danger in longestaffe affair might be bought off by payment of price stipulated for pickering property must dolly longestaffe squercum of whom mr melmotte have already heard concern in matter if money claimed be paid then money must be a good a wasted by such payment if a firmly believed sufficient evidence must be produced to prove thing have done complication be so many perhaps in admiration for country of adoption mr melmotte have allowed to attach higher privilege to british aristocracy than do in truth belong to did in heart believe must be known to world a father in law of eldest son of marquis of auld reekie must become not really free of law almost safe from fang in regard to affair a thought must so use family with must be connected a to force from that protection must need then again if must tide over bad time how glorious must be to have british marquis for son in law like many others have failed altogether to enquire when pleasure to must come what must be nature did believe that marriage must add charm to life now knew that lord nidderdale must not be got to marry daughter without positive assurance of absolute property did think that income might thus be transferred with marie though fell short of have be promised might suffice for time have already given proof to marquis lawyer that daughter be possessed of property in question indeed there be complication have arisen within last few day have startled mr melmotte very much indeed on certain morning have sent for marie to study have told that must require signature in reference to deed have asked what deed have replied that must be document regarding money reminded that have signed deed once before telling that be in way of business be not necessary that must ask more question a must be wanted only to sign paper then marie astounded not merely by showing that understood great deal more of transaction than have thought also by positive refusal to sign anything at reader may understand that there have be many word between know papa be that may have money to do what like with have be so unkind to about sir felix carbury wo do if ever marry money will belong to husband breath almost failed a listened to word did not know whether to approach with threat with entreaty with blow before interview be over have tried three have told that must must put in prison for conduct so fraudulent besought not to ruin parent by such monstrous perversity at last took by arm shook violently marie be quite firm might cut to piece must sign nothing suppose thought sir felix must have have entire sum said father with deriding scorn must if have spirit to take answered marie be reason for sticking to nidderdale plan must no doubt lose immediate income in doing so must secure marquis be therefore induced on weighing in nicest balanced scale advantage disadvantage to leave longestaffes unpaid to let nidderdale have money not that must make up mind to course with conviction that be doing best for danger on side be very great at present moment audacity recommended to be boldest stroke marie have now said that must accept nidderdale sweep at crossing on monday morning be on preceding thursday that have made famous speech in parliament one of bideawhiles have come to in city have told mr bideawhile world knew just at present moment money be very tight in city be not asking for payment of commercial debt said mr bideawhile for price of considerable property have purchased mr melmotte have suggested that characteristic of money be same let sum in question have become due how might then offered to make payment in two bill at three six month date with proper interest allowed offer mr bideawhile scouted with indignation demanding that title deed might be restored to have right to demand title deed said melmotte can only claim sum due have already told how propose to pay bideawhile be nearly beside with dismay in whole course of business in record of very respectable firm to belonged there have never be thing a of course mr longestaffe have be person to blame so at least bideawhiles declared among have be so anxious to have dealing with man of money that have insisted that title deed must be given up then title deed have not be to surrender pickering estate have be joint property of son house have be already pulled down now purchaser offered bill in lieu of purchase money do mean to tell mr melmotte that have not got money to pay for what have bought that nevertheless title deed have already gone out of hand have property to ten time value twenty time value thirty time value said melmotte proudly must know must think by time that man engaged in large affair can not always realise such sum a eighty thousand pound at day notice mr bideawhile without using language be absolutely vituperative gave mr melmotte to understand that thought that client have be robbed that must at once take severest step law put in power a mr melmotte shrugged shoulder made further reply mr bideawhile must only take departure attorney although be bound to be staunch to own client to own house in opposition to mr squercum nevertheless be becoming doubtful in own mind a to genuineness of letter dolly be so persistent in declaring that have not signed mr longestaffe who be at rate honest man have given a opinion that dolly have not signed letter son have certainly refused to sign once a far a knew must have have opportunity of signing since be sure that have left letter under lock key in own drawer in room have latterly become melmotte study a well a own then on entering room in melmotte presence friendship at time having already ceased found that drawer be open same mr bideawhile be with at time do mean to say have opened drawer said mr melmotte mr longestaffe have become very red in face have replied by saying that certainly made such accusation a certainly have not left drawer unlocked knew own habit be sure that have never left that drawer open in life then must have changed habit of life on occasion said mr melmotte with spirit mr longestaffe must trust to other word within house when be out in street together assured lawyer certainly that drawer have be left locked that to best of belief letter unsigned have be left within drawer mr bideawhile must only remark that be most unfortunate circumstance with have ever be concerned marriage with nidderdale must upon whole be best thing if must only be accomplished reader must understand that though mr melmotte have allowed considerable poetical licence in statement a to property thirty time a great a price ought to have paid for pickering still there be property man speculation have be so great so wide that did not really know what owned what owed did know at present moment be driven very hard for large sum chief trust for immediate money be in cohenlupe in whose hand have really be manipulation of share of mexican railway have trusted much to cohenlupe more than have be customary with to trust to man cohenlupe assured that nothing must be done with railway share at present moment have fallen under panic almost to nothing now in time of trouble melmotte wanted money from great railway just because wanted money great railway be worth nothing cohenlupe told that must tide over evil hour rather over evil month be at cohenlupe instigation that have offered two bill to mr bideawhile offer again said cohenlupe must take bill sooner later on monday afternoon melmotte met lord nidderdale in lobby of house have seen marie lately said nidderdale have be assured that morning by father lawyer in father presence that if married miss melmotte at present must undoubtedly become possessed of income amounting to something over l year have intended to get more than be hardly prepared to accept marie at price then there probably must be more doubt there be difficulty about pickering melmotte certainly have be raising money might probably be affair of few week melmotte have declared that pickering must be made over to young people at marriage father have recommended to get girl to name day marriage must be broken off at last day if property be not forthcoming be going up to house almost immediately said nidderdale will find woman at tea to certainty between five six said melmotte chapter lxxiv melmotte make friend have be thinking more about lord nidderdale said to girl a soon a madame melmotte have succeeded in leaving alone together have thought ever so much more about said marie what be result oh will have be right said nidderdale throwing on sofa close to so that might put arm round waist wait moment lord nidderdale said might a well call john then wait moment john

must anybody beat did do anything there be young lady in question marie young lady what young lady believe be nothing to care about anything lord nidderdale not bit suppose have made up that out of own head indeed believe be beaten believe be about young woman signifies nothing to suppose signifies much to think might fix day care least said marie longer be put off better will like be because be so detestable ai detestable think be very good fellow only care for be detestable not being able to do what one want be detestable having to quarrel with everybody never to be good friend with anybody be horribly detestable having nothing on earth to give one interest must take interest in not least suppose try must like to know anything about place where live be castle know yes castle reekie ever

next nonsense marie to morrow must be ready may manage just a like with papa oh yes kiss of course may if be to belong to what doe matter wo say that love if ever do say may be sure will be true be more than can say of john so interview be over nidderdale walked back to house thinking of lady love a far a be able to bring mind to operation of thinking be fully determined to go on with a far a girl herself be concerned have in latter day become much more attractive to than when have first known certainly be not fool though must not tell that be altogether like lady still have manner of own made think that must be able to live with lady did think that in spite of said to contrary be becoming fond of a certainly have become fond of have be up with lady melmotte asked oh yes what doe marie

something to do with mind telling that have have fearful weight on mind in reference to money never have to find so many large sum in so short time be not quite through yet wonder why gave dinner then dear boy be very pleasant to to call son of marquis dear boy a regard expenditure be flea bite nothing must spend must have slightest effect upon condition one way other wish must be same way with said nidderdale if chose to go into business with instead of taking marie money out very soon must be so with burden be very great never know whence panic arise why come whither go when do come be like storm at sea be only strong ship can stand fury of wind wave then buffeting man get leaf only man be have have very hard time suppose be getting right now yes be getting right be not in fear if mean that mind telling everything a be settled now that be to be husband know that be honest that if must hurt by repeating what say must do certainly must not see have partner nobody be bound to know affair wife be best woman in world be utterly unable to understand anything about of course ca talk freely to marie cohenlupe whom see so much with be very well in way never talk over affair with be concerned with in one two thing american railway for instance have interest generally in house be on own shoulder can tell weight be little heavy will be greatest comfort to in world if can get to have interest in matter suppose must ever really be good at business said modest young lord must come work suppose must expect that must be glad to think must tell how thing be going on of course heard be said just before election for forty eight hour have very bad time of then fact be that alf who be supporting thought that must carry election by running down be at for fortnight perfectly unscrupulous a to what said what harm might do others thought that very cruel must get man in must did have effect of depreciating property suddenly by nearly million of money think what be understand how must be done because understand how delicate thing be credit persuaded lot of men to stay away from infernal dinner consequently be spread about town be ruined effect upon share held be instantaneous tremendous mexican railway be at fell from that in two day to something quite nominal so that selling be out of question cohenlupe between have about of share think what come to nidderdale tried to calculate what did come to failed altogether be what call blow terrible blow when man be concerned a be with money interest concerned largely with be of course exchanging one property for day of life according a market go keep sum a in one concern a investment nobody doe then when panic come see how hit will never go up again oh yes perhaps higher than ever will take time in meantime be driven to fall back upon property intended for other purpose be meaning of what hear about place down in sussex bought for marie be so driven be obliged to raise forty fifty thousand wherever must will be right in week two a for marie money that know be settled quite succeeded in making nidderdale believe word that spoke produced also friendly feeling in young man bosom with something approaching to desire that might be of service to future father in law hazily a through thick fog lord nidderdale thought that did see something of trouble a have long seen something of glory of commerce on extended scale idea occurred to that might be almost more exciting than whist unlimited loo resolved too that whatever man might tell must never be divulged be on occasion somewhat captivated by melmotte went away from interview with conviction that financier be big man one with whom must sympathise to whom in certain way must become attached melmotte have derived positive pleasure even from simulated confidence in son in law have be pleasant to to talk a though be talking to young friend whom trusted be impossible that must really admit one to participation in secret be out of question that must ever allow to be betrayed into speaking truth of own affair of course word have said to nidderdale have be lie intended to corroborate lie have not be only on behalf of lie that have talked after fashion even though friendship with young man be mock friendship though must too probably be turned into bitter enmity before three month have passed by still there be pleasure in grendalls have left since day of dinner mile having sent letter up from country complaining of severe illness be comfort to to have someone to whom must speak much preferred nidderdale to mile grendall conversation took place in smoking room when be over melmotte went into house nidderdale strolled away to beargarden beargarden have be opened again though with difficulty with diminished luxury must even be done without rigid law a to payment of ready money herr vossner have never more be heard of bill vossner have left unpaid be held to be good against club whereas note of hand have taken from member be left in possession of mr flatfleece of course there be sorrow trouble at beargarden still institution have become so absolutely necessary to member that have be reopened under new management one have felt need more strongly during hour of day of day a counted day rising a did about hour after noon going to bed three four hour after midnight than did dolly longestaffe beargarden have become so much to that have begun to doubt whether life must be even possible without resort for hour now club be again open dolly must have dinner bottle of wine with luxury to be accustomed at time be almost mad with sense of injury circumstance have held out to prospect of almost unlimited ease indulgence arrangement made a to pickering estate must pay debt must disembarrass own property must still leave comfortable sum in hand squercum have told that if must stick to term must surely get have stuck to term have got now property be sold title deed gone have not received penny did not know whom to be loudest in abusing father bideawhiles mr melmotte then be said that have signed that letter be very open in manner of talking about misfortune at club father be most obstinate old fool that ever lived a for bideawhiles must bring action against squercum have explained to melmotte be biggest rogue world have ever produced by george world said must be coming to end there be that infernal scoundrel sitting in parliament just a if have not robbed of property forged name by george ought to be hung if man ever deserved to be hung that man deserves to be spoke openly in coffee room of club be still speaking a nidderdale be taking seat at one of table dolly have be dining have turned round upon chair so a to face half dozen men whom be addressing nidderdale leaving chair walked up to very gently dolly said go on in way about melmotte when be in room have doubt be mistaken so will find out in day two know melmotte mistaken dolly still continued to exclaim with loud voice be mistaken in supposing have be paid money believe have be owing very long be mistaken in supposing that name have be forged to letter be sure be mistaken if think that melmotte have anything to do with squercum say never mind squercum know be suspicion of fellow of kind 'd believe squercum deuced sight sooner than melmotte look here dolly know more probably of melmotte affair than do perhaps than anybody else if will induce to remain quiet for few day to hold tongue here will make responsible for entire sum owes devil will will indeed nidderdale be endeavouring to speak so that only dolly must hear probably nobody else did hear dolly must not lower voice be out of question know said how must take money truth be nidderdale man be thief so will find out sooner later have broken open drawer in father room forged name to letter everybody know even governor know now bideawhile before many day be over will find that will be in gaol for forgery be very unpleasant a one knew nidderdale be either engaged becoming engaged to melmotte daughter since will speak about in public way began nidderdale think ought to be spoken about in public way said dolly deny a publicly ca say anything about letter except be sure mr melmotte did not put name to from what understand there seems to have be blunder between father lawyer be true enough said dolly doe excuse melmotte a to money there can be more doubt that will be paid than stand here what be twenty five thousand be eighty thousand whole well eighty thousand be impossible to suppose that man a melmotte must be able to raise eighty thousand pound why do then asked dolly be very unpleasant made club le social than used to be in old day there be attempt night to get up game of card nidderdale must not play because be offended with dolly longestaffe mile grendall be away in country fugitive from face of melmotte carbury be in hiding at home with countenance from top to bottom supported by plaster montague in day never went to club at present moment be again in liverpool having be summoned thither by mr ramsbottom by george said dolly a filled pipe ordered more brandy water think everything be going to come to end do indeed never heard of such thing before a man being done in way then vossner have gone off seems everybody be to pay just what say owed now one ca even get up game of card feel a though there be good in hoping that thing must ever come right again opinion of club be good deal divided a to matter in dispute between lord nidderdale dolly longestaffe be admitted by to be very fishy if melmotte be so great man why did pay money why must have mortgaged property before be really own majority of men thought that dolly be wrong a to signature of letter dolly be man who must naturally be quite unable to say what have what have not signed then even into beargarden there have filtered through outer world feeling people be not now bound to be so punctilious in paying of money a be few year since doubt suited melmotte to make use of money therefore a have succeeded in getting property into hand did make use of must be forthcoming sooner later in way of looking at matter beargarden followed world at large world at large in spite of terrible falling off at emperor of china dinner in spite of rumour in spite of ruinous depreciation of mexican railway stock of undoubted fact that dolly longestaffe have not received money be inclined to think that melmotte must pull through chapter lxxv in bruton street mr squercum time be in perfect fever of hard work anxiety may be said of that have be quite sharp enough to perceive whole truth did really know if must prove knew have extended enquiry in city till have convinced that wealth melmotte might have have twelve month ago there be not enough of left at present to cover liability squercum be quite sure that melmotte be not falling fallen star perhaps not giving sufficient credence to recuperative power of modern commerce squercum told certain stockbroker in city who be specially confidential friend that melmotte be gone coon stockbroker made also few enquiry on evening agreed with squercum that melmotte be gone coon if such be case must positively be making of squercum if must be so managed that must appear a destroying angel of offensive dragon so squercum raged among bideawhiles who be unable altogether to shut door against must not dare to bid defiance to squercum feeling that have blundered feeling also that must be careful not to seem to screen fault by falsehood suppose give up about letter having be signed by client said squercum to elder of two younger bideawhiles give up nothing assert nothing said superior attorney whether letter be genuine not have reason to believe to be otherwise young gentleman signature be never very plain one be about a like other a other must be like last must let look at again mr bideawhile then letter have be very often inspected during last ten day be handed to mr squercum be stiff resemblance such a never must have written have tried ever so perhaps not mr squercum be not generally on lookout for forgery in letter from client client son just so mr bideawhile then mr longestaffe have already told that son must not sign letter how be one to know when how why young man like will change purpose just so mr bideawhile see after declaration a on part of client father letter be in little irregular perhaps know that be irregular at well did reach in very confirmatory manner will just say that what mr longestaffe can have be at to wish to give up title deed without getting anything for excuse mr squercum be between mr longestaffe just so a mr longestaffe have jeopardised client property be natural must make few remark think 'd have made few remark mr bideawhile if case have be reversed will bring matter before lord mayor know to mr bideawhile said not word think understand now that intend to insist on signature a being genuine say nothing about mr squercum think will find very hard to prove that be not genuine client oath mr bideawhile be afraid client be not always very clear a to what doe know what mean by mr bideawhile fancy that if be to speak in way of client must be very angry with besides what doe amount to will old gentleman say that gave letter into son hand so that even if such freak must have come into client head must have signed sent off if understand mr longestaffe say that locked letter up in drawer in very room melmotte occupied that afterwards found drawer open wo suppose be alleged that client knew so little what be about that broke open drawer in order that might get at letter look at way will did not sign bideawhile have never said did say be that have fair ground for supposing that be letter really know that can say anything more only that be to certain degree in same boat together in matter wo admit even mr squercum difference being that client by fault have jeopardised own interest of client while client have not be in fault at will bring matter forward before lord mayor to morrow a at present advised will ask for investigation with reference to charge of fraud presume will be served with subpoena to bring letter into court if so may be sure that will produce then mr squercum took leave went straight away to mr bumby barrister well known in city game be too powerful to be hunted down by mr squercum unassisted hand have already seen mr bumby on matter more than once mr bumby be inclined to doubt whether might not be better to get money guarantee for money mr bumby thought that if bill at three month must be have for dolly share of property might be expedient to take mr squercum suggested that property might be recovered genuine sale having be made mr bumby shook head title deed give possession mr squercum suppose that company have lent money to melmotte on title deed must have to lose take bill if be dishonoured run chance of what will get out of property there must be asset rap will have be made over said mr squercum took place on monday day on melmotte have offered full confidence to proposed son in law on following wednesday three gentleman met together in study in house in bruton street from be supposed that letter have be abstracted there be mr longestaffe father dolly longestaffe mr bideawhile house be still in melmotte possession melmotte mr longestaffe be no longer on friendly term direct application for permission to have meeting in place have be formally made to mr melmotte have complied meeting took place at eleven o'clock terribly early hour dolly have at first hesitated a to placing a thought between fire of two enemy mr squercum have told that a matter must probably soon be made public must not judiciously refuse to meet father old family lawyer therefore dolly have attended at great personal inconvenience to by george be hardly worth having if one be to take trouble about dolly have said to lord grasslough with whom have fraternised since quarrel with nidderdale dolly entered room last at time mr longestaffe mr bideawhile have touched drawer even table in letter have be deposited now mr longestaffe said mr bideawhile perhaps will show where think put letter think at said since matter have be discussed whole thing have come back upon memory never signed said dolly standing with hand in pocket interrupting father nobody say did sir rejoined father with angry voice if will condescend to listen may perhaps arrive at truth somebody have said that did have be told that mr bideawhile say so mr longestaffe have never said so have only said that have reason for supposing letter to be other than genuine have never gone beyond nothing on earth must have made sign said dolly why must have given property up before got money never heard thing in life father looked up at lawyer shook head testifying a to hopelessness of son obstinacy now mr longestaffe continued lawyer let see where put letter then father very slowly with much dignity of deportment opened drawer second drawer from top took from bundle of paper very carefully folded docketed there said letter be not placed in envelope on top of two be two first document in bundle went on to say that a far a knew other paper have be taken away be quite certain that have left drawer locked be very particular in regard to particular drawer remembered that about time mr melmotte have be in room with when have opened a be certain have locked again at special time there have be said considerable intimacy between melmotte be then that mr melmotte have offered seat at board of mexican railway of course picked lock stole letter said dolly be a plain a pike staff be clear enough to hang man be afraid that fall short of evidence however strong just may be suspicion induced said lawyer father for time be not quite certain about letter thought that have signed said dolly be quite certain now rejoined father angrily man have to collect memory before can be sure of anything be thinking know how must go to jury what want to know be how be to get money said dolly must like to see hung of course 'd sooner have money squercum say adolphus want to know here what mr squercum say know why what mr squercum say must be a good a what mr bideawhile say of course squercum doe sound very aristocratic quite a much so a bideawhile doubt said lawyer laughing squercum be aristocratic fetter lane be good deal lower than lincoln inn nevertheless squercum may know what be about be squercum who be first down upon melmotte in matter if be for squercum must know a much about a do at present squercum name be odious to elder longestaffe believed probably without much reason that family trouble came to from squercum thinking that if son must have left affair in hand of old slows old bideawhiles money must never have be scarce with that must not have made terrible blunder about pickering property sound of squercum a son knew be horrid to ear hummed hawed fumed fretted about room shaking head frowning son looked at a though quite astonished at displeasure there be nothing more to be done here sir suppose said dolly putting on hat nothing more said mr bideawhile may be that will have to instruct counsel thought well must see in presence of of exactly how thing stood speak so positively mr longestaffe that there can be doubt there be doubt now perhaps have better lock drawer in presence stop moment might a well see whether there be sign of violence having be used so saying mr bideawhile knelt down in front of table began to examine lock did very carefully satisfied that there be sign of violence whoever have done did very well said bideawhile illustration might a well see whether there be sign of violence having be used of course melmotte did said dolly longestaffe standing immediately over bideawhile shoulder at moment there be knock at door very distinct may say formal knock there be who knock immediately enter without waiting for sanction asked have who knocked done so on occasion mr bideawhile must have be found still on knee with nose down to level of keyhole intruder did not intrude rapidly lawyer jumped on to foot almost upsetting dolly with effort there be pause during mr bideawhile moved away from table a might have done have be picking lock then mr longestaffe bade stranger come in with sepulchral voice door be opened mr melmotte appeared now mr melmotte presence certainly have not be expected be known that be habit to be in city at hour be known also that be well aware that meeting be to be held in room at special hour might well have surmised with what view there be now declared hostility between longestaffes mr melmotte certainly be supposed by gentleman concerned that must not have put out of way to meet on occasion gentleman said perhaps think that be intruding at present moment one said that did not think so elder longestaffe simply bowed very coldly mr bideawhile stood upright thrust thumb into waistcoat pocket dolly who at first forgot to take hat off whistled bar then turned pirouette on heel be mode of expressing thorough surprise at appearance of debtor fear that do think be intruding said melmotte trust that what have to say will be held to excuse see sir said turning to mr longestaffe glancing at still open drawer that have be examining desk hope that will be more careful in locking than be when left before drawer be locked when left said mr longestaffe make deduction draw conclusion drawer be locked then must say must have be locked when returned to sir found open make deduction draw conclusion left locked found open must make deduction draw conclusion said dolly must be that somebody else have opened can answer purpose at said bideawhile be chance remark said melmotte did not come here out of city at very great personal inconvenience to myself to squabble about lock of drawer a be informed that three gentleman must be here together thought opportunity suitable one for meeting making offer about unfortunate business paused moment of three spoke did occur to dolly to ask to wait while must fetch squercum on second thought reflected that great deal of trouble must have to be taken probably for good mr bideawhile believe suggested melmotte lawyer bowed head if remember rightly wrote to offering to pay money due to client squercum be lawyer said dolly will make difference make deal of difference said dolly wrote continued melmotte offering bill at three six month date must be accepted mr melmotte must have allowed interest never have have bill refused before must be aware mr melmotte said lawyer that sale of property be not like ordinary mercantile transaction in bill be customarily given taken understanding be that money must be paid in usual way when learned a did learn that property have be at once mortgaged by of course became well think may be justified in saying more than suspicious be most most unusual proceeding say have offer to make mr melmotte of course have be short of money have have enemy whose business have be for time past to run down credit with credit have fallen value of stock in have be known have be largely interested tell truth openly when purchased pickering have idea that payment of such sum of money must inconvenience in least when time came at must pay stock be so depreciated that be impossible to sell very hostile proceeding be threatened against now accusation be made false a hell mr melmotte a spoke raised voice looked round room at present crisis may do most cruel damage have come to say that if will undertake to stop proceeding have be commenced in city will have fifty thousand pound be amount due to two gentleman ready for payment on friday at noon have taken proceeding a yet said bideawhile be squercum say dolly well sir continued melmotte addressing dolly let assure that if proceeding be stayed money will be forthcoming if not can not produce money little thought two month ago must ever have to make such statement in reference to sum a fifty thousand pound so be to raise money by friday will have to cripple resource frightfully will be done at terrible cost what mr bideawhile say be true have right to suppose that purchase of property must be looked upon a ordinary commercial transaction money must have be paid if will now take word money will be paid can not be done if be made to appear before lord mayor to morrow accusation brought against be damnably false know with whom have originated whoever did originate be damnably false unfortunately false a be in present crisis may be ruinous to now gentleman perhaps will give answer father lawyer looked at dolly dolly be in truth accuser through mouthpiece of attorney squercum be at dolly instance that proceeding be being taken on behalf of client said mr bideawhile will consent to wait till friday at noon presume adolphus that will say a much said elder longestaffe dolly longestaffe be certainly not impressionable person melmotte eloquence have moved even be not that be sorry for man at present moment believed though have be absolutely sure that melmotte have forged name caused to be forged did not now go so far into matter a to abandon conviction have be talked into crediting reason given for melmotte temporary distress also into belief that money must be paid on friday something of effect melmotte false confession have have upon lord nidderdale now also have on dolly longestaffe will ask squercum know said of course mr squercum will act a instruct said bideawhile will ask squercum will go to at once ca do more than upon word mr melmotte have given great deal of trouble melmotte with smile apologized then be settled that three must meet in very room on friday at noon that payment must then be made dolly stipulating that a father must be attended by bideawhile so must be attended by squercum to mr longestaffe senior yielded with very bad grace chapter lxxvi hetta lover lady carbury be at time so miserable in regard to son that found unable to be active a must otherwise have be in endeavour to separate paul montague daughter roger have come up to town given opinion very freely at rate with regard to sir felix roger have immediately returned to suffolk poor mother in want of assistance consolation turned naturally to mr broune who came to see for few minute almost evening have now become almost part of mr broune life to see lady carbury once in day told of two proposition roger have made first that must fix residence in second rate french german town that sir felix must be made to go with secondly that must take possession of carbury manor for six month where must mr carbury go asked mr broune be so good that doe care what doe with there be cottage on place say that must move to mr broune shook head mr broune did not think that offer so quixotically generous a must be accepted a to german french town mr broune said that plan be doubt feasible doubted whether thing to be achieved be worth terrible sacrifice demanded be inclined to think that sir felix must go to colony that might drink to death said lady carbury who now have secret from mr broune sir felix in mean time be still in doctor hand up stair have doubt be very severely thrashed there be not in truth very much ailing beyond cut on face be however at present moment better satisfied to be invalid than to have to come out of room to meet world a to melmotte said mr broune say now that be in terrible mess will ruin who have trusted girl be impossible to understand melmotte be to have be summoned before lord mayor to day on charge of fraud be postponed be told morning that nidderdale still mean to marry girl think anybody know truth about will hold tongue about till really do know something of whom mr broune spoke be of course morning breakfast table in there be nothing about hetta hetta however thought very much of own condition found driven to take special step by receipt of two letter from lover written to from liverpool have never met since have confessed love to first letter did not at once answer a be at moment waiting to hear what roger carbury must say about mr hurtle roger carbury have spoken leaving conviction on mind that mr hurtle be by mean fiction indeed fact very injurious to happiness then paul second love letter have come full of joy love contentment with not word in seemed to have be in slightest degree influenced by existence of mr hurtle have there be mr hurtle letter must have be that hetta must have desired must have answered unless forbidden by mother with girl usual enthusiastic affection for chosen lord be impossible that must now answer in strain be equally impossible that must leave such letter unanswered roger have told to ask now found constrained to bid come to answer question if thought better to give written account of mr hurtle so that might know who lady be whether lady condition did in way interfere with own happiness so wrote to paul a follows welbeck street th july dear paul found that after have passed between must not call dear sir dear mr montague that must either be sir dear paul be dear to very dear thought that have not be a yet convicted of conduct bad enough to force to treat a outcast have there be mr hurtle must have be dearest paul made choice so commenced dear paul strange report have come round to about lady called mr hurtle have be told that be american lady living in london that be engaged to be wife can not believe be too horrid to be true fear fear there be something true will be very very sad for to hear be from brother first heard who be of course bound to tell anything knew have talked to mamma about to cousin roger be sure roger know will not tell said ask so ask of course can write about nothing else till have heard about be sure need not tell that have made very unhappy if can not come see at once have better write have told mamma about letter then came difficulty of signature with declaration must naturally be attached to after hesitation subscribed affectionate friend henrietta carbury most affectionately own hetta must have be form in must have wished to finish first letter have ever written to paul received at liverpool on wednesday morning on wednesday evening be in welbeck street have be quite aware that have be incumbent on to tell whole history of mr hurtle have meant to keep back almost nothing have be impossible for to do so on one occasion on have pleaded love to successfully let reader who be intelligent in such matter say whether must have be possible for then to have commenced story of mr hurtle to have told to bitter end story must be postponed for second third interview may indeed be communicated by letter when paul be called away to liverpool did consider whether must write story there be many reason strong against such written communication man may desire that woman love must hear record of folly so that in after day there may be nothing to be detected so must mr hurtle of life at time intrude upon happiness may with clear brow undaunted heart say to beloved one ah be trouble of spoke to then beloved one will be in one cause together hardly wish to supply beloved one with written record of folly then who doe not know how much tenderness man may show to own fault by tone of voice by half spoken sentence by admixture of word of love for lady who have filled up vacant space once occupied by mr hurtle of romance written record must go through from beginning to end self accusing thoroughly perspicuous with sweet soft falsehood hidden under half expressed truth soft falsehood must be sweet a scent of violet in personal interview must stand in danger of being denounced a deceit added to deceit if sent in letter think therefore paul montague did quite right in hurrying up to london asked for miss carbury when told that miss henrietta be with mother sent name up said that must wait in dining room have thoroughly made up mind to course must know that have come at once must not if must be helped make statement in presence of lady carbury then up stair there be little discussion hetta pleaded right to see alone have done what roger have advised have done with mother consent mother might be sure that must not again accept lover till story of mr hurtle have be sifted to very bottom must herself hear what lover have to say for felix be at time in drawing room suggested that must go down see paul montague on sister behalf mother looked at with scorn sister quietly said that must rather see mr montague felix have be so cowed by circumstance that did not say word hetta left room alone when entered parlour paul stept forward to take in arm be matter of course knew must be so have prepared for paul said let hear about first sat down at distance from found compelled to seat at little distance from so have heard of mr hurtle said with faint attempt at smile yes felix told roger evidently have heard about oh yes roger carbury have heard about from beginning know whole history almost a well a know think brother be a well informed perhaps not be story that concern certainly so far concern hetta that ought to know trust will believe that be intention to tell will believe anything that will tell if so think that will quarrel with when know be engaged to marry mr hurtle be widow did not answer at once suppose must be widow if be going to marry yes be widow be divorced oh paul be american yes loved montague be desirous of telling own story did not wish to be interrogated if will allow will tell from beginning to end oh certainly suppose loved if meant to marry must have loved there be frown upon hetta brow tone of anger in voice made paul uneasy yes loved once will tell then did tell story with repetition of reader need not be detained hetta listened with fair attention not interrupting very often though when did interrupt little word spoke be bitter enough heard story of long journey across american continent of ocean journey before end of paul have promised to make woman wife have be divorced then asked hetta because believe get divorced just when like simple a question be must not answer must only know what told said a went on with story then mr hurtle have gone on to paris a soon a reached carbury have revealed everything to roger did give up then demanded hetta with stern severity no not then have gone back to san francisco have not intended to say that engagement have be renewed be forced to acknowledge that have not be broken off then have written to on second return to england then have appeared in london at mr pipkin lodging in islington can hardly tell how terrible be to said for have by time become quite aware that happiness must depend upon tried gentle soft falsehood must have be a sweet a violet perhaps be sweet be odd how stern girl can be while heart be almost breaking with love hetta be very stern felix say took to lowestoft quite other day montague have intended to tell almost there be something about journey to lowestoft must be impossible to make hetta understand thought that might be omitted be on account of health oh on account of health did go to play with did be that for health oh hetta speak to like can not understand that when came here following must not desert can not understand why deserted at said hetta say loved promised to marry seems horrid to to marry divorced woman woman who just say that be divorced be because understand american way be sure must have loved when took to theatre down to lowestoft for health be only week ago be nearly three week said paul in despair oh nearly three week be not such very long time for gentleman to change mind on matter be engaged to not three week ago hetta be not engaged to then suppose thought be when went to lowestoft with wanted then to force to to to oh hetta be so hard to explain be sure that understand do know that can not think that have even for one moment be false to why must be false to why must step in crush hope can understand that roger must think badly of because be divorced of course must engagement be engagement have better go back to mr hurtle tell that be quite ready to keep promise illustration have better go back to mr hurtle know now that be over dare say will be able to persuade to reconsider when came way here from san francisco after when asked to take to theatre to lowestoft because of health must be very much attached to be waiting here doubt on purpose for be very old friend very old ought not to treat unkindly good bye mr montague think have better lose time in going back to mr hurtle said with sundry little impedimentary gurgle in throat without tear without sign of tenderness mean to tell hetta that be going to quarrel with know about quarrelling wish to quarrel with one of course ca be friend when have married mr hurtle nothing on earth must induce to marry of course can not say anything about when told story did not believe hardly believed roger when must not tell for be too kind when must not contradict seemed to be almost impossible that must have come to just at very same moment for after mr montague nearly three week be very short time trip to lowestoft must have be much above week before came to what doe matter oh of course not nothing to think will go away now mr montague be very good of to come tell make so much easier do mean to say that be going to throw over want to throw mr hurtle over good bye hetta will not have lay hand upon good night mr montague so left paul montague be beside with dismay a left house have never allowed for moment to believe that affair of mr hurtle must really separate from hetta carbury if must only really know there must be such result have be true to from first moment in have seen never swerving from love be to be supposed that have loved woman before a world go must not must not affect anger be founded on presence of mr hurtle in london must have given possession to have prevented when did come be to have refused to see must hetta have wished to be cold cruel like doubt have behaved badly to mr hurtle that trouble have overcome now hetta be quarrelling with though certainly have never behaved badly to be almost angry with hetta a walked home everything that must do have done for for sake have quarrelled with roger carbury for sake in order that might be effectually free from mr hurtle have determined to endure spring of wild cat for sake so told have be content to abide by odious railway company in order that might if possible preserve income on to support now told that must part that only because have not be cruelly indifferent to unfortunate woman who have followed from america there be logic in reason a thought very little heart want to throw mr hurtle over have said why must mr hurtle be anything to surely might have left mr hurtle to fight own battle be against roger carbury lady carbury sir felix end of must be that must be forced into marriage with man almost old enough to be father must not ever really have loved be truth must be incapable of such love a be own for true love always forgives here there be really so very little to forgive such be thought a went to bed that night probably omitted to ask whether must have forgiven very readily have found that have be living nearly three week ago in close intercourse with lover of whom have hitherto never even heard name then a world know there be wide difference between young men young woman hetta a soon a have dismissed lover went up at once to own room thither be soon followed by mother whose anxious ear have heard closing of front door well what have said asked lady carbury hetta be in tear very nigh to tear struggling to repress struggling almost successfully have found that what told about woman be true enough of be true said hetta who angry a be with lover be not on account le angry with mother for disturbing bliss what do mean by hetta have not better speak to openly say mamma that enough be true know how to speak more openly need not go into miserable story of woman be like other men suppose have entangled with abominable creature then when be tired of think that have nothing to do to say so to begin with somebody else roger carbury be very different oh mamma will make ill if go on like that seems to that understand in least say be not like not in least of course know that be not in least like say that can be trusted of course can be trusted who doubt that if must give to there must be cause for alarm mamma said hetta jumping up how can talk to in way a soon a one man doe suit be to give to oh mamma how can propose nothing on earth will ever induce to be more to roger carbury than be now have told mr montague that be not to come here again know what told know very well what mean that be over hetta made reply hetta have right to ask have right to expect reply say that have hitherto behaved badly about mr montague have not behaved badly have told everything have done nothing be ashamed of have now found out that have behaved very badly have come here to with unexampled treachery to cousin roger deny that exclaimed hetta at very time be almost living with woman who say that be divorced from husband in america have told that will see more understood that if have not told so plainly must tell mamma need not trouble have told very plainly then lady carbury expressed satisfied for moment left daughter to solitude chapter lxxvii scene in bruton street when mr melmotte made promise to mr longestaffe to dolly in presence of mr bideawhile that must on next day one pay to sum of fifty thousand pound thereby completing satisfactorily a far a be concerned purchase of pickering property intended to be a good a word reader know that have resolved to face longestaffe difficulty that have resolved that at rate must not get out of by sacrificing property to have looked forward a safe haven when storm must come day by day resolution that made be forced to undergo change latterly have be intent on purchasing noble son in law with money still trusting to chapter of chance for future escape from longestaffe other difficulty squercum have be very hard upon in connexion with accusation a to pickering property there be must be forced to face also respecting certain property in east of london with reader need not much trouble specially in reference to be stated that have induced foolish old gentleman to consent to accept railway share in lieu of money old gentleman have died during transaction be asserted that old gentleman letter be hardly genuine melmotte have certainly raised between twenty thirty thousand pound on property have made payment for in stock be now worth almost nothing at melmotte thought that might face matter successfully if matter came upon single handed in regard to longestaffes considered that now at last moment have better pay for pickering property from intended to raise necessary fund be really own there must be doubt about that have never be intention to make over to daughter when have placed in name have done so simply for security feeling that control over only daughter must be perfect free from danger girl apparently le likely to take into head to defraud father must have crept quietly about father house did now think that must disobey when matter be explained to heaven earth that must be robbed by own child robbed openly shamefully with brazen audacity be impossible still have felt necessity of going about business with little care might be that must disobey if simply sent for bade to affix signature here there thought much about considered that must be wise that wife must be present on occasion that full explanation must be given to marie by might be made to understand that money have in sense become own so gave instruction to wife when started into city that morning when returned for sake of making offer to longestaffes brought with deed must be necessary that marie must sign brought also mr croll clerk that mr croll might witness signature when left longestaffes mr bideawhile went at once to wife room be here asked will send for have told have frightened why must frighten be not very easy to frighten melmotte be changed since young men have be so much about will frighten if doe not do a bid bid come now be said in french then madame melmotte left room melmotte arranged lot of paper in order upon table having done so called to croll who be standing on landing place told to seat in back drawing room till must be called melmotte then stood with back to fire place in wife sitting room with hand in pocket contemplating what might be incident of coming interview must be very gracious affectionate if be possible above thing explanatory by heaven if there be continued opposition to demand to just demand if girl must dare to insist upon exercising power to rob must not then be affectionate gracious there be little delay in coming of two woman be already beginning to lose temper when marie followed madame melmotte into room at once swallowed rising anger with effort must put constraint upon affection graciousness must be all there a long a might secure purpose in hand marie began spoke to other day about property for certain purpose be placed in name just a be leaving paris yes papa be child then mean when left paris must hardly explain to purpose of what did understood papa have better listen to dear think did quite understand must have be very odd if have a never explained to wanted to keep from going away if got into trouble be so true that melmotte did not know how at moment to contradict assertion yet have not intended to talk of possibility of trouble wanted to lay aside large sum of money must not be liable to ordinary fluctuation of commercial enterprise so that nobody must get at be little too quick dear marie why ca let papa speak said madame melmotte of course dear continued melmotte have idea of putting money beyond own reach transaction be very common in such case man naturally us name of one who be very near dear to in whom be sure that can put full confidence be customary to choose young person a there will then be le danger of accident of death be for reason be sure that will understand that chose of course property remained exclusively own be really mine said marie miss be never yours said melmotte almost bursting out into anger restraining how must become yours marie did ever make gift of know that did become mine legally by quibble of law yes not so a to give right to always draw income must stop that papa if be married of course must be stopped then quick a flash of lightning idea occurred to melmotte who feared that already began to see that child of might be stiff necked a be thinking of marriage said be necessary that change must be made settlement must be drawn for satisfaction of lord nidderdale father old marquis be rather hard upon marriage be so splendid have consented must now sign paper in four five place mr croll be here in next room to witness signature will call wait moment papa why must wait think will sign why not sign ca really suppose that property be own must not even get if did think so know how may be have rather not sign if be to be married ought not to sign anything except what tell have authority over yet have authority over marie give more trouble be very much pressed for time let call in mr croll papa said then came across brow that look have probably first induced marie to declare that must endure to be cut to piece rather than to yield in direction lower jaw squared teeth became set nostril of nose became extended marie began to prepare to be cut to piece reminded that there be game have proposed to play before resorted to anger violence must tell how much depended on compliance therefore relaxed frown a well a knew how softened face towards turned again to work be sure marie that will not refuse to do when explain to importance to must have property for use in city to morrow will be ruined statement be very short manner in made be not without effect oh shrieked wife be true harpy have so beset about election that have lowered price of stock in be concerned have brought mexican railway so low that can not be sold at like bringing trouble home from city on occasion can not help sum locked up here be very large be compelled to use in point of fact be necessary to save from destruction said very slowly with utmost solemnity told just now wanted because be going to be married rejoined marie liar have many point in favour have against that unless devote more time to management of lie than life will generally allow can not make tally melmotte be thrown back for moment almost felt that time for violence have come longed to be at that might shake wickedness folly ingratitude out of once more condescended to argue to explain think misunderstood marie meant to understand that settlement must be made that of course must get own property back into own hand before anything of kind can be done tell once more dear that if do a bid so may use that property first thing to morrow be ruined everything will be gone ca be gone said marie nodding head at paper marie do wish to see disgraced ruined have done great deal for turned away only person ever cared for said marie marie how can be so wicked do a papa bid said madame melmotte said melmotte doe not care who be ruined because saved from reprobate will sign now said madame melmotte will not sign said marie if be to be married to lord nidderdale a say be sure ought to sign nothing without telling if property be once made to be mine think ought to give up again because papa say that be going to be ruined think be reason for not giving up again be yours to give be mine said melmotte gnashing teeth then can do what like with without signing said marie paused moment then laying hand gently upon shoulder asked yet once again voice be changed be very hoarse still tried to be gentle with marie said will do to save father from destruction did not believe word that said to how must believe have taught to regard a natural enemy making aware that be purpose to use a chattel for own advantage never allowing for moment to suppose aught that did be to be done for happiness now almost in breath have told that money be wanted that might be settled on man to whom be to be married then that might be used to save from instant ruin believed one story other that must have done a be desired in matter can hardly be disputed father have used name because thought that must trust be daughter must not have betrayed trust have steeled to obstinacy against in thing even yet after have passed although have consented to marry lord nidderdale though have be forced by what have learned to despise sir felix carbury there be present to idea that might escape with man really loved such hope must depend only on possession of money now claimed a own melmotte have endeavoured to throw certain supplicatory pathos into question have asked though be in degree successful with voice eye mouth forehead still threatened be always threatening thought respecting reverted to inward assertion that might cut to piece if liked repeated question in pathetic strain will do now to save from ruin eye still threatened said looking up into face a though watching for personal attack must be made upon wo marie exclaimed madame melmotte glanced round for moment at pseudo mother with contempt said think ought wo wo shouted melmotte merely shook head do mean that own child will attempt to rob father just at moment can destroy by wickedness shook head said other word nec pueros coram populo medea trucidet let not medea with unnatural rage slaughter mangled infant on stage will attempt to harrow reader by close description of scene followed poor marie that cutting up into piece be commenced after most savage fashion marie crouching down hardly uttered sound madame melmotte frightened beyond endurance screamed at top of

brehgert be almost sick of thing herself must not back out of so a to obliterate trace of disgrace even if must not ultimately marry jew must be known that have be engaged to jew then must certainly

right to live alone young male bird be supposed to fly away from paternal nest daughter of house be compelled to adhere to father till will get husband only way in georgey must have done with at caversham must be by trusting to mr brehgert at present moment did not know whether mr brehgert did did not consider a engaged to day also passed away with ineffable tedium at one time be so beaten down by ennui that almost offered assistance to sister in reference to wedding garment in spite of very bitter word have be spoken in morning must have done so have sophy afforded slightest opportunity sophy be heartlessly cruel in indifference in younger day have have bad thing now with george whitstable by side meant to have good thing goodness of be infinitely enhanced by badness of sister thing have be so greatly despised that charm of despising again be irresistible be able to reconcile cruelty to conscience by telling that duty required to show implacable resistance to marriage a sister contemplated therefore georgiana dragged out day not in least knowing what be to be fate chapter lxxix brehgert correspondence mr longestaffe have brought daughter down to caversham on wednesday during thursday friday have passed very sad time not knowing whether be be not engaged to marry mr brehgert father have declared to that must break off match believed that have seen mr brehgert with purpose have certainly given consent have never hinted to one of family idea that be disposed to yield felt that at rate with father have not adhered to purpose with tenacity that have allowed to return to london with feeling that might still be controlled be beginning to be angry with mr brehgert thinking that have taken dismissal from father without consulting be necessary that something must be settled something known life such a be leading now must drive mad have disadvantage of brehgert connection none of advantage must not comfort with thinking of brehgert wealth brehgert house yet be living under general ban of caversham on account of brehgert association be beginning to think that must write to mr brehgert only did not know what to say to on saturday morning got letter from mr brehgert be handed to a be sitting at breakfast with sister who at moment be triumphant with present of gooseberry have be sent over from toodlam toodlam gooseberry be noted throughout suffolk when letter be being brought in sophia be taking lover offering from basket with own fair hand well georgey have exclaimed to send pottle of gooseberry to lady love across country who george whitstable must do dare say get nothing gem gold sophy retorted suppose that mr brehgert know what gooseberry be at moment letter be brought in georgiana knew writing suppose be from mr brehgert said sophy think matter much to who be from tried to be composed stately letter be too important to allow of composure retired to read in privacy letter be a follows dear georgiana father came to day after be to have met at lady monogram party told then must not write to till have taken day two to consider what said to also that thought better that must have day two to consider what might say to have now repeated what said at first interview almost with more violence for must say that think have allowed to be violent when be surely unnecessary long short of be altogether disapproves of promise to marry have given three reason first be in trade secondly that be much older than have family thirdly that be jew in regard to first can hardly think that be earnest have explained to that business be that of banker can hardly conceive to be possible that gentleman in england must object to daughter marrying banker simply because man be banker there must be blindness of arrogance in such proposition of think father to be incapable have merely be added in to strengthen other objection a to age be just fifty one at think too old to be married again whether be too old for be for to judge a be also question of child who of course must become wife will be to extent care upon shoulder a be very serious will not hope think wanting in gallantry if say must hardly have ventured to address if have be quite young girl doubt there be many year between so think there must be man of age hardly look to marry woman of same standing a question be one for lady to decide must decide now a to religion acknowledge force of what father say though think that gentleman brought up with fewer prejudice must have expressed in language le likely to give offence however be man not easily offended on occasion be ready to take what have said in good part can easily conceive that there must be who think that husband wife must agree in religion be indifferent to will not interfere with if make happy by becoming wife suppose will with must have daughter daughter be quite willing that must be brought up subject to influence there be plain speaking in made georgiana look round room a though to see whether one be watching a read doubt father object to specially because be jew if be atheist might perhaps say nothing on subject of religion on matter a well a on others seems to that father have hardly kept pace with movement of age fifty year ago claim jew might have to be a well considered a christian certainly be not so considered society be closed against except under special circumstance so be privilege of high position have be altered father doe not admit change think be blind to because doe not wish to see say more a defending than a combating view with must be for for alone to decide how far view will govern have told after rather peremptory fashion have behaved badly to to family because did not go to in first instance when thought of obtaining honour of alliance with daughter have be obliged to tell that in matter disagree with entirely though in so telling endeavoured to restrain from appearance of warmth have not pleasure of meeting in house have acquaintance with again at risk of being thought uncourteous must say that be to certain degree emancipated by age from positive subordination to few year ago probably submitted without question if gentleman meet lady in society a met in home of friend mr melmotte think that gentleman be to be debarred from expressing feeling because lady may possibly have parent father doubt with propriety have left to be guardian of can not submit to be accused of improper conduct because finding in condition availed of now having said so much must leave question to be decided entirely by beg to understand at wish to hold to promise merely because promise have be given readily acknowledge that opinion of family must be considered by though will not admit be bound to consult opinion before spoke to may well be that regard for appreciation of comfort with may be able to surround will not suffice to reconcile to such breach from own family a father with much repetition have assured will be inevitable take day two to think of turn well over in mind when last have happiness of speaking to seemed to think that parent might raise objection that objection must give way before expression of own wish be flattered by so thinking if may form judgment from father manner must suppose that be mistaken will understand say a reproach to contrary think father be irrational may well have failed to anticipate that must be so a to own feeling remain exactly a be when endeavoured to explain to though find to be too old to marry do think too old to write love letter have doubt believe when say that entertain most sincere affection for beseech to believe in saying further must become wife will be study of life to make happy be essentially necessary must allude to one other matter a to have already told father what will now tell think probable that within week will find loser of very large sum of money through failure of gentleman whose bad treatment of will more readily forgive because be mean of making known to must understand be private between though have thought proper to inform father such loss if fall upon will not interfere in least with income have proposed to settle upon for use after death a father declares that in event of marrying will neither give to bequeath to shilling might have abstained from telling to face be bankrupt merchant when told of loss be not bankrupt merchant at likely to become so will loss at interfere with present mode of living have thought right to inform of because if occur a think will will not deem right to keep second establishment probably for next two three year house at fulham stable there will be kept up just a be at present have now told everything think be necessary must know in order that may determine to adhere to to recede from engagement when have resolved will let know day two may probably be necessary for decision hope need not say that decision in favour will make happy man be in meantime affectionate friend ezekiel brehgert very long letter puzzled georgey good deal left at time of reading very much in doubt a to what must do must understand that be plain spoken truth telling letter not that to gave praise for virtue that imbued unconsciously with thorough belief be apt to suspect deceit in other people did not occur to that mr brehgert have written single word with attempt to deceive single minded genuine honesty of letter be altogether thrown away upon never said to herself a read that might safely trust to man though be jew though greasy like butcher though over fifty with family because be honest man did not see that letter be particularly sensible did allow to be pained by total absence of romance be annoyed at first allusion to age angry at second yet have never supposed that brehgert have taken to be younger than be be well aware that world in general attribute more year to unmarried woman than have lived a sort of equalising counter weight against pretence young woman make on other side lie be told on behalf have wished to appear peculiarly young in eye nevertheless regarded reference to be uncivil perhaps almost butcher like have effect upon then allusion to daughter daughter troubled told that be vulgar just what butcher might have said although be quite prepared to call father most irrational most prejudiced most ill natured of men yet be displeased that mr brehgert must take liberty with passage in mr brehgert letter be most distasteful to be that told of loss might probably incur through connection with melmotte what right have to incur loss must incapacitate from keeping engagement with town house have be great persuasion now absolutely have face to tell that there be to be town house for three year when read felt that ought to be indignant for few moment be minded to sit down without further consideration tell man with considerable scorn that must have nothing more to say to on side too there must be terrible bitterness how must have fallen from greatness when barely forgiven by father mother for vile sin have contemplated must consent to fill common bridesmaid place at nuptials of george whitstable what must then be left to in life episode of jew must make quite impossible for again to contest question of london house with father lady pomona mr george whitstable must be united with against there must be season for must be nobody at caversham a for london must hardly wish to go there everybody must know story of jew thought that must have plucked up courage to face world a jew wife not a young woman who have wanted to marry jew have failed how must future life go with must now make up mind to retire from proposed alliance if must get father to take abroad at once must do be not now in condition to make term with father a gradually passed through mind determined that must so far take mr brehgert advice a to postpone answer till have well considered matter slept upon next day asked mother few question mamma have idea what papa mean to do in what way dear lady pomona voice be not gracious a be free from fear of daughter ascendancy have formerly affected well suppose must have plan must explain know why must have particular plan will go to london next year will depend upon money suppose what make ask of course have be very cruelly circumstanced everybody must see that be sure do mamma long short of be if give up engagement will take abroad for year why must ca suppose must be very comfortable in england if be to remain here at caversham how be to hope ever to get settled sophy be doing very well oh mamma there be not two george whitstables thank god have meant to be humble supplicating must not restrain from use of one shaft mean what sophy may be very happy be sure that hope will wo do good must be very unhappy here see how be to find one to marry by going abroad said lady pomona see why papa be to be taken away from own home like caversham then be to be sacrificed on side said georgey stalking out of room still must not make up mind what letter must write to mr brehgert slept upon night on next day after breakfast did write letter though when sat down to task have not clearly made up mind what must say did get written here be caversham monday dear mr brehgert a told not to hurry have taken little time to think about letter of course must be very disagreeable to quarrel with papa mamma everybody if do do so be sure somebody ought to be very grateful papa have be very unfair in what have said a to not asking must have be of good for of course must be against think great deal of longestaffe family so suppose ought world doe change so quick that one doe think of anything now a one used to do anyway feel that be bound to do what papa tell just because say though be not quite so old a seem to think be old enough to judge for mean to do so say very little about affection suppose be to take for granted wonder at papa being annoyed about loss of money must be very great sum when will prevent having house in a agreed doe make great difference because of course a have regular place in country one must only see one friend in london fulham be very well now then think must like to live at fulham year through talk of three year must be dreadful if a say will not have lasting effect must not manage to have house in town if can do in three year must think must do now must like to have answer to question do think so much about being season in town a for other part of letter knew very well beforehand papa must be unhappy about know why be to let stand in way when so very little be done to make happy of course will write to again hope will say something satisfactory about house in london yours always sincerely georgiana longestaffe probably never occurred to georgey mr brehgert must under circumstance be anxious to go back from engagement so fully recognised own value a christian lady of high birth position giving to commercial jew that thought that under circumstance mr brehgert must be only too anxious to stick to bargain have idea that there be anything in letter must probably offend thought that might at rate make good claim to house in london that a there be other difficulty on side must yield to on point a yet hardly knew mr brehgert did not lose day in sending to second letter took letter with to office in city there answered without moment delay st cuthbert court london tuesday july dear miss longestaffe say must be very disagreeable to to quarrel with papa mamma a agree with will take letter a concluding intimacy must not however be dealing quite fairly with with if gave to understand felt to be coerced to conclusion simply by qualified assent to parent view be evident to from letter that must not wish to be wife unless can supply with house in town a well a with one in country for present be out of power must not have allowed loss to interfere with settlement because have stated certain income must therefore to certain extent have compromised child must not have be altogether happy till have replaced in former position must therefore have abstained from increased expenditure till have done so of course have right to ask to share with discomfort of single home may perhaps add have hoped that must have looked to happiness to source will bear disappointment a best may a may perhaps under circumstance be unwilling must wear ring gave return by post trust will be good enough to keep trifle be pleased to accept from in remembrance of one who will always wish well yours sincerely ezekiel brehgert so be over georgey when read letter be very indignant at lover conduct did not believe that own letter have at be of nature to warrant have regarded a being quite sure of only so far doubting a to be able to make own term because of such doubt now jew have rejected read last letter over over again more read more felt that in heart of heart have intended to marry there must have be inconvenience doubt must have be le than sorrow on other side now saw nothing before long vista of caversham dullness in must be trampled upon by father mother scorned by mr mr george whitstable got up walked about room thinking of vengeance what vengeance be possible to everybody belonging to must take part of jew in have now done must not ask dolly to beat must ask father to visit with stern frown of paternal indignation there must be revenge for time only for few second thought that must write to mr brehgert tell that have not intended to bring about termination of engagement doubt must

set against in city whole of affair of dinner be planned planned by g that might ruin be laid out just a must lay foundation of building be hard for one man to stand against when have dealing so large a mine very hard mr melmotte will find be mistaken yet there be too much of real stuff croll for to crush property kind of thing come out right at last be cut come again know if stuff be really there must stop talking here suppose will find brehgert in cuthbert court must say so mr melmotte mr brehgert never leaf much before six then mr melmotte took hat glove stick that usually carried went out with face carefully dressed in usually jaunty air croll a went heard mutter name of cohenlupe between teeth part have to act be one very difficult to actor carrying external look of indifference when heart be sinking within have sunk almost to very ground be more than difficult be agonizing task in mental suffering sufferer longs for solitude for permission to cast loose along ground so that limb feature of person may faint in sympathy with heart grandly urbane deportment over crushed spirit ruined hope be beyond physical strength of most men there have be men so strong melmotte very nearly accomplished be only to eye of one a herr croll that failure be perceptible melmotte did find mr brehgert at time mr brehgert have completed correspondence with miss longestaffe in have mentioned probability of great loss from anticipated commercial failure in mr melmotte affair have now heard that mr cohenlupe have gone upon travel be therefore nearly sure that anticipation must be correct nevertheless received old friend with smile when large sum of money be concerned there be seldom much of personal indignation between man man loss of fifty pound of few hundred may create personal wrath fifty thousand require equanimity so cohenlupe have be seen in city to day said brehgert have gone said melmotte hoarsely think once told that cohenlupe be not man for large dealing yes did said melmotte well ca be helped can what be now then melmotte explained to mr brehgert what be that wanted then taking various document out of bag throughout afternoon have carried in hand mr brehgert understood enough of friend affair enough of affair in general to understand readily be required examined document declaring a did so that did not know how thing must be arranged by friday melmotte replied that l be not very large sum of money that security offered be worth twice a much a that will leave with evening said brehgert melmotte paused for moment said that must of course do so must have given much very much to have be sufficiently master of to have assented without hesitation then weight within be so very heavy having left paper bag with mr brehgert walked westward to house of common be accustomed to remain in city later than often not leaving till seven though during last week ten day have occasionally gone down to house in afternoon be now wednesday there be evening sitting mind be too full of other thing to allow to remember a walked along embankment thought be very heavy how must thing go with must be end of ruin yes there be worse thing than ruin short time since have be so fortunate have made so safe a looked back at must hardly say how have come to pas that have be driven out of track that have laid down for have known that ruin must come have made so comfortably safe so brilliantly safe in spite of ruin insane ambition have driven away from anchorage told over over again that fault have be not in circumstance not in men call fortune in own incapacity to bear position saw now felt now if must only begin again how different must conduct be of what avail be such regret a must take thing a be now see in dealing with allowed to be carried away by pride cowardice if worst must come to worst then let face like man there be certain manliness about showed perhaps a strongly in own self condemnation a in other part of conduct at time judging of a though be standing outside looking on to man work pointed out to own shortcoming if be to be done again thought that must avoid bump against rock on one side that terribly shattering blow on other there be much that be ashamed of many little act recurred to vividly in solitary hour a thing to be repented of with inner sackcloth ash never once not for moment did occur to that must repent of fraud in whole life have be passed idea ever crossed mind of what might have be result have lived life of honest man though be inquiring into a closely a must never even told that have be dishonest fraud dishonesty have be very principle of life have so become part of blood bone even in extremity of misery made question within a to right judgment in regard to not to cheat not to be scoundrel not to live more luxuriously than others by cheating more brilliantly be condition of thing to mind have never turned in respect accused of want of judgment why have so unrighteous not made friend to of mammon of unrighteousness why have not conciliated lord mayor why have trod upon corn of neighbour why have be insolent at india office why have trusted man a have trusted cohenlupe why have not stuck to abchurch lane instead of going into parliament why have called down unnecessary notice on head by entertaining emperor of china be too late now must bear be thing have ruined walked into palace yard across to door of westminster abbey before found out that parliament be not sitting oh wednesday of course be said turning round directing step towards grosvenor square then remembered that in morning have declared purpose of dining at home now did not know what better use to make of present evening house must hardly be very comfortable to marie doubt must keep out of way did not habitually receive much pleasure from wife company in own house must at least be alone then a walked slowly across park thinking so intently on matter a hardly to observe whether be observed asked whether still might not be best for to keep money be settled on daughter to tell longestaffes that must make payment to face worst that mr squercum must do to for knew already how busy mr squercum be in matter though must put on trial for forgery what of have heard of trial in accused criminal have be hero to multitude while case be in progress who have be feted from beginning to end though one have doubted guilt who have come out unscathed at last what evidence have against might be that longestaffes bideawhiles squercums must know that be forger knowledge must not produce verdict a member for westminster a man who have entertained emperor a owner of one of most gorgeous house in london a great melmotte must certainly command best half of bar already felt what popular support might do for surely there need be despondency while so good hope remained to did tremble a remembered dolly longestaffe letter letter of old man who be dead knew that be possible that other thing might be adduced must not be better to face than surrender money become pauper seeing a did very clearly that even by such surrender must not cleanse character have given forged document into hand of mr brehgert again have acted in hurry without giving sufficient thought to matter in hand be angry with for also how be man to give sufficient thought to affair when step that take can be other than ruinous yes have certainly put into brehgert hand mean of proving to have be absolutely guilty of forgery did not think that marie must disclaim signature even though have refused to sign deed when must understand that father have written name did think that clerk must be urgent against a forgery of croll name must not injure croll brehgert must discover what have be done must certainly not permit to escape now have put forgery without guard into brehgert hand must tell brehgert in morning that have changed mind must see brehgert before action must have be taken on document brehgert must no doubt restore to then must instruct daughter to hold money fast to sign paper must be put before to draw income having done that must let foe do worst might drag to gaol probably must do so have idea that must not be admitted to bail if accused of forgery must bear that if convicted must bear punishment still hoping that end might come how great be chance that might fail to convict a to dead man letter a to dolly longestaffe letter did not think that sufficient evidence must be found evidence a to deed by marie be to have released property be indeed conclusive believed that might still recover document for present must be duty to hing when must have recovered destroyed document to live before eye of men a though feared nothing dined at home alone in study after dinner carefully went through various bundle of paper preparing for eye of minister of law who must probably before long have privilege of searching at dinner while be thus employed drank bottle of champagne feeling greatly comforted by process if must only hold up head look men in face thought that might still live through how much have done by own unassisted power have once be imprisoned for fraud at hamburgh have come out of gaol pauper friendless with wretched antecedent against now be member of british house of parliament undoubted owner of perhaps most gorgeously furnished house in man with established character for high finance commercial giant whose name be familiar word on exchange of two hemisphere even though must be condemned to penal servitude for life must not all die rang bell desired that madame melmotte might be sent to bade servant bring brandy in ten minute poor wife came crawling into room one connected with melmotte regarded man with certain amount of awe one except marie to whom alone have at time be almost gentle servant feared wife obeyed implicitly when must not keep away from came in now stood opposite to while spoke to never sat in presence in room asked where marie kept jewelry for during last twelvemonth rich trinket have be supplied to of of course answered by question be anything going to happen melmotte good deal be going to happen be here in house in grosvenor square be here then have packed up a small a can never mind about wool case have close to hand so that if have to move can take with do understand yes understand why speak then what be going to happen melmotte how can tell ought to know by time when man work be such a mine thing will happen will be safe enough nothing can hurt can hurt melmotte hurt know what call hurting whatever there be to be borne suppose be must bear have not have very soft life hitherto think be going to be very soft now will have to move very likely move what be harm of moving talk of moving a though be worst thing must happen how must like to be in place where must let move be going to send to prison hold tongue tell be going to then poor woman did sit down overcome by feeling did ask to come here for scene said melmotte do a bid about own jewel marie thing be to have in small compass that must not have to do at last moment when will be flurried incapable now need stay longer be good asking question because sha answer so dismissed poor woman crept out again immediately after own slow fashion went to work with ornament melmotte sat up during greater part of night sometimes sipping brandy water sometimes smoking did work hardly touched paper after wife left chapter lxxxii marie perseverance very early next morning very early be for london life melmotte be told by servant mr croll have called wanted to see then immediately became question with whether wanted to see croll be anything special asked man thought that be something special a croll have declared purpose of waiting when told that mr melmotte be not a yet dressed happened at about nine o'clock in morning melmotte longed to know detail of croll manner to know even servant opinion of clerk manner did not dare to ask question melmotte thought that might be well to be gracious ask if have breakfasted if not give something in study mr croll have breakfasted declined further refreshment nevertheless melmotte have not a yet made up mind that must meet clerk clerk be clerk might perhaps be well that must first go into city send word to croll bidding wait for return over over again against will question of flying must present to though discussed within own bosom in form knew that must not fly if stood ground a most assuredly must do then must not be afraid to meet man let man come with what thunderbolt in hand might of course sooner later man must come with thunderbolt why not croll a well a stood against press in chamber with razor in hand steadied how easily might put end to then rang bell desired that croll might be shown up into room three four minute intervened seemed to to be very long have absolutely forgotten in anxiety that lather be still upon face must not smother anxiety be fighting with at turn must not conquer when knock came at door grasped at own breast a though to support with hoarse voice told man to come in croll appeared opening door gently very slowly melmotte have left bag contained paper in possession of mr brehgert now saw at glance croll have got bag in hand must see also by shape of bag that bag contained paper man therefore have in own hand in own keeping very document to own name have be forged there be longer hope no longer chance that croll must be ignorant of what have be done well croll said with attempt at smile what brings here so early be pale a death let struggle a must must not restrain from trembling herr brehgert va vid last night said croll eh thought have better bring back to that be croll spoke in very low voice with eye fixed on master face with nothing of threat in attitude manner illustration thought have better bring back to eh repeated melmotte even though might have saved from coming evil by bold demeanour at moment must not assume flashed upon at moment brehgert have seen croll after melmotte have left city have then discovered forgery have taken way of sending back forged document have known brehgert to be of men who ever lived most good natured must hardly believe in pure good nature such a seemed that thunderbolt be not yet to fall mr brehgert came to continued croll because one signature be wanting be very late so took home with said 'd bring to in morning knew that have forged document brehgert croll how must concern melmotte if two friend have resolved together that must not expose have desired to get document back into own hand here be melmotte immediate trouble arose from difficulty of speaking in proper manner to own servant who have just detected in forgery must speak there be word appropriate to occasion va strong order mr melmotte said croll melmotte tried to smile only grinned vill not be back in lane mr melmotte not back at office croll tink not de leetle money coming to will send adieu so mr croll took final leave of old master after intercourse have lasted twenty year may imagine that herr croll found spirit to be oppressed capacity for business to be obliterated by patron misfortune rather than by patron guilt have not behaved unkindly have merely remarked that forgery of own name dozen time over be strong order melmotte opened bag examined document one by one have be necessary that marie must sign name half dozen time marie father have made necessary forgery have be of course necessary that name must be witnessed here forger have scamped work croll name have written five time one forged signature have left unattested again have be at fault again have aided own ruin by own carelessness one seems inclined to think sometimes that fool might do honest business fraud requires man to be alive wide awake at turn melmotte have desired to have document back in own hand now have did matter much that brehgert croll knew crime have committed have meant to take legal step against must not have returned forgery to own hand brehgert thought must never tell tale unless there must arise most improbable emergency in might make money by telling be by mean so sure of croll croll have signified intention of leaving melmotte service must therefore probably enter rival service thus become enemy to late master there must be reason why croll must keep secret even if got direct profit by telling must curry favour by making known of course croll must tell what harm must telling of secret do girl be own daughter money have be own money man have be own servant there have be no fraud robbery no purpose of peculation melmotte a thought of became almost proud of what have done thinking that if evidence be suppressed knowledge of fact must do harm evidence must be suppressed with view of suppressing took little bag paper down with to study then ate breakfast suppressed evidence by aid of gas lamp when be accomplished hesitated a to manner in must pas day have now given up idea of raising money for longestaffe have even considered language in must explain to assembled gentleman on morrow fact that little difficulty still presented that a must not exactly name day must leave matter in hand for have resolved that must not evade meeting cohenlupe have gone since have made promise must throw blame on cohenlupe everybody know that when panic arise breaking of one merchant cause downfall of cohenlupe must bear burden a must be so must do good by going into city pecuniary downfall have now become too much matter of certainty to be staved off by presence personal security must hardly be assisted by there must be nothing for to do cohenlupe have gone mile grendall have gone croll have gone must hardly go to cuthbert court face mr brehgert must stay at home till be time for to go down to house then must face world there must dine down at house stand about in smoking room with hat on be visible in lobby

of opulence have allowed pocket money almost without limit now have not only disobeyed by most perverse obstinacy on part have driven to act of forgery have already be detected have cause to be angry now with marie if have ever have cause for anger have almost forgotten transaction have at rate forgotten violence of own feeling at time of occurrence be no longer anxious that release must be made therefore no longer angry with for refusal papa said coming very gently into room think that perhaps be wrong yesterday of course be wrong doe matter now if wish will sign paper suppose lord

roger carbury mother must find out that in be mistaken must never marry cousin though must be always ready to acknowledge worth be sure now that must never marry man a made resolve have wicked satisfaction in feeling that must be trouble to mother for though be altogether in accord with lady carbury a to iniquity of paul montague be not le angry with mother for being so ready to expose

mamma hope will never talk of more be quite unworthy said lady carbury ca bear to have abused said hetta sobbing dear hetta have doubt have made for time unhappy such little accident do make people unhappy for time will be much for best that must endeavour not to be so sensitive about world be too rough too hard for people to allow feeling full play have to look out for future can best do so by

try earn bread suppose must go out a nurse then without waiting for reply left room betook to own apartment lady carbury did not even understand daughter must not conceive that have in way acted unkindly in taking opportunity of montague rejection for pressing suit of other lover be simply anxious to get husband for daughter a have be anxious to get wife for son in order that child might live comfortably felt that whenever spoke common sense to hetta daughter took a offence flew into tantrum being altogether unable to accommodate to hard truth of world deep a be sorrow son brought upon great a be disgrace must feel more sympathy for than for girl if there be anything that must not forgive in life be romance yet at rate believed that delighted in romantic poetry at present moment be very wretched be certainly unselfish in wish to see daughter comfortably settled before commenced miserable roamings with son seemed to be coming destiny in day thought good deal of mr broune offer of

to once have told that must be fool if did not do so so consequence be that almost regretted that have allowed to escape certainly made effort to recover lost prize for told trouble be on afternoon after disagreement with daughter that marie melmotte came to on same evening closeted with mr broune in back room told of occurrence if girl have got money began regretting son obstinacy believe bit of said broune from can hear think that there be money if there be may be sure that melmotte must not let slip through finger in way must not have anything to do with think be over with melmottes

be doubt imagine that will be found that not shilling will be saved out of property what wonderful career have be yes strangest thing have come up in day be inclined to think that utter ruin at moment have be brought about by reckless personal expenditure why did spend such lot of money because thought that must conquer world by obtain universal credit very nearly succeeded too only have forgotten to calculate force of envy of competitor think have committed forgery certainly think so of course know nothing a yet then suppose be better that felix must not have married certainly better redemption be to have be have on side think must regret loss of such money a lady carbury shook head meaning probably to imply that even melmotte money must have have bad odour to one so dreadfully in want of assistance a son at rate think of more then told grief about hetta ah there said feel le able to express authoritative opinion doe owe shilling said lady carbury be really fine gentleman if doe like oh doe think to be finest person in world must obey great deal sooner than must have mind stuffed with nonsense about love great many people lady carbury have mind stuffed with nonsense yes

took leave chapter lxxxvii down at carbury when roger carbury returned to suffolk after seeing cousin in welbeck street be by mean contented with that must be discontented generally with circumstance of life be matter of course knew that be farther removed than ever from object on whole mind be set have hetta carbury learned circumstance of paul engagement with mr hurtle before have confessed love to paul so that heart might have be turned against man before have made confession then thought might at last have listened to even though have loved other man might have at last done so a love must have be buried in own bosom tale have be told after fashion be most antagonistic to own interest hetta have never heard mr hurtle name till have given away have declared to friend that have given away to man who be so unworthy of more roger thought of more angry be with paul montague more convinced that man have done injury must never forgive grief extended even beyond though be never tired of swearing to that must not forgive paul montague yet there be present to feeling that injury be being done to man that be in sort responsible for injury have declined to tell hetta part of story about mr hurtle actuated by feeling that ought not to betray trust put in by man who be at time friend have told nothing one knew so well a did fact that attention latterly given by paul to american woman have by mean be effect of love have come from feeling on paul part that must not desert woman have once loved when asked for kindness if hetta must know everything exactly if must look back read state of paul mind a roger must read then must probably forgive man perhaps tell that there be nothing for to forgive roger be anxious that hetta anger must burn hot because of injury done to thought that there be ample reason why paul montague must be punished why paul must be utterly expelled from among allowed to go own course be not right that man must be punished on false ground seemed to roger now that be doing injustice to enemy by refraining from telling that knew a to girl misery in losing lover much a loved true a be that be willing to devote that have to happiness think that at present moment be disturbed in direction be hardly natural perhaps that man must love woman with such devotion a to wish to make happy by giving to man roger told that paul must be unsafe husband fickle husband one who might be carried hither thither in circumstance feeling that must be better for hetta that must not marry at same time be unhappy a reflected that be party to certain amount of deceit yet have said not word have referred hetta to man thought that knew did indeed accurately know state of hetta mind be wretched because thought that while lover be winning love while be willingly allowing to win love be dallying with woman making to other woman promise same a made to be not true roger knew that be not true when tried to quiet conscience by saying that must fight out among felt to be uneasy under assurance life at carbury at time be very desolate have become tired of priest who in spite of various repulse have never for moment relaxed effort to convert friend roger have told once that must beg religion might not be made subject of further conversation between in answer to father barham have declared that must never consent to remain a intimate associate with man on term roger have persisted in stipulation priest have then suggested that be host intention to banish from carbury hall roger have made reply priest have of course be banished even added to misery father barham be gentleman be good man in great penury to ill treat such one to expel one from house seemed to roger to be abominable cruelty be unhappy with about priest yet must not bid man come back to be already being said of among neighbour at eardly at caversham at bishop palace that have become be becoming roman catholic under priest influence mr yeld have even taken upon to write to most affectionate letter in said very little a to evidence have reached a to roger defection dilated at very great length on abomination of certain lady who be supposed to indulge in gorgeous colour be troubled too about old daniel ruggles farmer at sheep acre who have be so angry because niece must not marry john crumb old ruggles when abandoned by ruby accused by neighbour of personal cruelty to girl have taken freely to source of consolation found to be most easily within reach since ruby have gone have be drunk day be making generally scandal nuisance landlord have interfered with usual kindness old man have always declared that niece john crumb be cause of for now in maudlin misery attributed a much blame to lover a did to girl john crumb be in earnest if have be in earnest must have gone after to london at once must invite ruby to come back if ruby must come back repentant full of sorrow have be made fool of herself in meantime then 'd think of taking back in meantime with circumstance in present condition evidently thought that must best face difficulty of world by unfaltering adhesion to gin early in day day long too be grievance to roger carbury did not neglect work chief of at present moment be care of farm kept in own hand be making hay at time in certain meadow down by river side be standing by while men be loading cart when saw john crumb approaching across field have not seen john since eventful journey to london have seen in london knew well have occurred how dealer in pollard have thrashed cousin sir felix how have be locked up by police then liberated how be now regarded in bungay a hero a far a arm be concerned a being very soft in matter of love reader need hardly be told that roger be not at disposed to quarrel with mr crumb because victim of crumb heroism have be own cousin crumb have acted well have never said word about sir felix since return to country doubt have now come to talk about love in order that confession might not be made before assembled haymaker roger carbury hurried to meet there be soon evident on crumb broad face whole sunshine of delight a roger approached began to laugh aloud to wave bit of paper that have in hand be coomin be coomin be first word uttered roger knew very well that in friend mind there be one in world that name of be ruby ruggles illustration be coomin be coomin be delighted to hear said roger have made up with grandfather know now't about grandfeyther have made up wi ' know 'd must when 'd polish 'd t'other un off bit know 'd must have written to then well squoire ai not just do suppose be way doe be a one then mr crumb thrust mr hurtle note into roger carbury hand roger certainly be not predisposed to think well kindly of mr hurtle since have first known mr hurtle name when paul montague have told story of engagement on return from america roger have regarded a wicked intriguing bad woman may perhaps be confessed that be prejudiced against american looking upon washington much a did upon jack cade wat tyler pictured to american woman a being loud masculine atheistical certainly did seem in instance mr hurtle be endeavouring to do good turn from pure charity be lady crumb began to explain who do be living with mr pipkin be lady a be lady roger must not fully admit truth of assertion explained that too knew something of mr hurtle that thought probable that what said of ruby might be true true squoire said crumb laughing with whole face have ' doubt be true what be again being true when have dropped into t'other fellow of course made choice be a be to blame because did do before ought to have ' dropped into when first heard a be arter be that a girl like so squoire be just going again to lon'on right away roger suggested that old ruggles must of course receive niece a to john expressed supreme indifference old man be nothing to of course must like to have old man money old man must live for ever supposed that thing must come right in time knew that be going to cringe to old man about money when roger observed that must be better that ruby must have home to might at once return john adverted with renewed grin to substantial comfort of own house seemed to be idea that on arriving in london must at once take ruby away to church be married to out of hand have thrashed rival what cause must there now be for delay before left field made one other speech to squire ai a'taken amiss squoire 'cause be coosin to not in least mr crumb be koind now ai done yong man have'porth o harm feel grudge again when ruby once spliced be darned if give 'un bottle of wine first day a will come to bungay roger did not feel justified in accepting invitation on part of sir felix renewed assurance that on own part thought that crumb have behaved well in matter of street encounter expressed strong wish for immediate continued happiness of mr mr john crumb oh ay will be 'appy squoire said crumb a went exulting out of field on day after roger carbury received letter disturbed very much to hardly knew whether to return answer what answer be from paul montague be written by few hour after have left letter for hetta with own hand at door of mother house paul letter to roger be a follows dear roger though know that have cast off from can not write to in other way a other way must be untrue can answer of course a please do think that will owe answer a appeal to in name of justice know what have taken place between hetta have accepted therefore be justified in feeling sure that must have loved have now quarrelled with altogether have told that be never to see again of course mean to put up with who must will say that be business of yours think that must not wish that must be left under false impression if must put right somebody have told story of mr hurtle suppose be felix that have learned from people at islington have be told that be untrue nobody know nobody can know truth a do supposes have willingly be passing time with mr hurtle during last two month although during very time have asked for have received assurance of love now whether have be to blame about mr hurtle a to nothing at present need be said be certainly truth that coming to england be not only not desired by be felt by to be greatest possible misfortune after have passed certainly owed to not to neglect duty be more incumbent on a be foreigner unknown to one went down to lowestoft with at request having named place to a one known to myself because must not refuse so small favour know that be so know also a one else doe that courtesy have shown to mr hurtle in england have be constrained to show appeal to to let hetta know that be true have made understand that not only mother brother also be well acquainted with story of acquaintance with mr hurtle lady carbury sir felix have ever known anything about only have known truth now though at present be angry with call upon to tell truth a know will understand when say that feel that be being destroyed by false representation think that who abhor falsehood will see justice of setting right at rate a far a truth can do so want to say word for beyond yours always paul montague what business be that of mine of course be first feeling produced in roger mind by montague letter if hetta have received false impression have not come from have told story against rival whether true false have be so scrupulous that have refused to say word at if false impression have be made on hetta mind by circumstance by untrue word have not montague deserved evil might fall upon though word in montague letter might be true nevertheless in end no more than justice must be done even must be robbed at last of mistress under erroneous impression fact that have once disgraced by offering to make mr hurtle wife rendered unworthy of hetta carbury such at least be roger carbury verdict a thought over circumstance at rate be business of to correct wrong impression yet be ill at ease a thought of did believe that word in montague letter be true though have be very indignant when met paul mr hurtle together on sand at lowestoft be perfectly convinced that cause of coming there have be precisely that montague have stated took two day to think over two day of great discomfort unhappiness after why must be dog in manger girl did not care for looked upon a old man to be regarded in fashion altogether different from in regarded paul montague have let time for love making go by now behoved a man to take world a found not to lose in regret for kind of happiness must never attain in such emergency a must do what be fair honest without reference to own feeling yet passion dominated john crumb altogether made mealman so intent on attainment of object a to render other thing indifferent to for time be equally strong with roger carbury unfortunately for roger strong a passion be be embarrassed by other feeling never occurred to crumb to think whether be fit husband for ruby whether ruby having decided preference for man must be fit wife for with roger there be thousand surrounding difficulty to hamper john crumb never doubted for moment what must do have to get girl if possible meant to get might cost be always confident though sometimes perplexed roger have confidence knew that must never win game in sadder moment felt that ought not to win people around from old fashion still called young squire why felt at time to be eighty year old so old that be unfitted for intercourse with such juvenile spirit a of neighbour bishop of friend hepworth must by training bring to take happiness in hand altogether sacrificing own in such mood a did at last answer enemy letter answered a follows know that be concerned to meddle in affair at have told tale against know have wish to tell in favour must so tell if did wish think that have behaved badly to cruelly to mr hurtle disrespectfully to cousin nevertheless a appeal to on certain point for evidence can give say one else can give do acknowledge that in opinion mr hurtle presence in england have not be in accordance with wish that accompanied to lowestoft not a lover a old friend whom must not neglect roger carbury paul montague esq be at liberty to show letter to miss carbury if please if read part must read whole there be more perhaps of hostility in letter than of spirit of self sacrifice to roger intended to train so felt after letter have be dispatched chapter lxxxviii inquest melmotte have be found dead on friday morning late on evening of same day madame melmotte marie be removed to lodging far away from scene of tragedy up at hampstead herr croll have known of place at lord nidderdale instance have busied in matter have seen that room be made instantly ready for widow of late employer nidderdale have assisted in departure german with poor woman maid with jewel also have be packed according to melmotte last order to wife followed carriage took mother daughter did not start till nine o'clock in evening madame melmotte at moment must fain have be allowed to rest one other night in bruton street lord nidderdale with one hardly uttered word made marie understand that inquest must be held early on following morning marie be imperious with mother carried point so poor woman be taken away from mr longestaffe residence never again saw grandeur of own house in grosvenor square have not visited since night on have helped to entertain emperor of china on saturday morning inquest be held there be not slightest doubt a to one of incident of catastrophe servant doctor inspector of police between learned that have come home alone that nobody have be near during night that have be found dead that have undoubtedly be poisoned by prussic acid be also proved that have be drunk in house of common fact to one of clerk of house very much against will be called upon to testify that have destroyed there be doubt be there doubt a to cause in such case a be for jury to say whether unfortunate one who have found life too hard for endurance have rushed away to see whether must not find improved condition of thing elsewhere have have not be mad at moment surviving friend be of course anxious for verdict of insanity a in case further punishment be exacted body can be buried like other body can always be said afterwards that poor man be mad perhaps must be well that suicide must be said to have be mad for certainly juryman be not generally guided in verdict by accurately ascertained fact if poor wretch have up to last day be apparently living decent life if be not hated have not in last moment made specially obnoxious to world at large then be declared to have be mad who must be heavy on poor clergyman who have be at last driven by horrid doubt to rid of difficulty from saw escape in other way who must not give benefit of doubt to poor woman whose lover lord have deserted who must remit to unhallowed earth body of once beneficent philosopher who have simply thought that might a well go now finding powerless to do further good upon earth such such like have of course be temporarily insane though touch even of strangeness may have marked conduct up to last known dealing with fellow mortal let melmotte be found dead with bottle of prussic acid by side man who have become horrid to world because of late iniquity man who have so well pretended to be rich that have be able to buy to sell property without paying for wretch who have made odious by ruin to friend who have taken up a pillar of strength in regard to wealth brute who have got into house of common by false pretence have disgraced house by being drunk there of course will not be saved by verdict of insanity from cross road scornful grave may be allowed to who have killed with wit about just at moment there be very strong feeling against melmotte owing perhaps a much to having tumbled over poor mr beauclerk in house of common a to story of forgery have committed virtue of day vindicated by declaring to have be responsible for action when took poison be felo de se therefore carried away to cross road elsewhere may be imagined think that during night may have become a mad a other wretch have be driven a far beyond power of endurance a other poor creature who ever at time felt constrained to go have not be so drunk that knew happened must foresee pretty well what must happen summons to attend upon lord mayor have be served upon there be among croll mr brehgert who absolutely knew that have committed forgery have money for longestaffes be well aware what squercum must do at once have assured long ago have assured indeed not very long ago that must brave like man none of know what load can bear must break back melmotte back have be so utterly crushed that almost think that be mad enough to have justified verdict of temporary insanity be carried away one knew whither for week name be hateful after that certain amount of whitewashing took place in degree restitution of fame be made to mane of departed in westminster be always odious westminster have adopted never forgave in other district came to be said of that have be more sinned against than sinning for jealousy of old stager in mercantile world must have done very wonderful thing marylebone be always merciful took up quite with affection must have returned ghost to parliament must ghost have paid for committee room finsbury delighted for while to talk of great financier even chelsea thought that have be done to death by ungenerous tongue be however marylebone alone that spoke of monument mr longestaffe came back to house taking formal possession of few day after verdict of course be alone there have be no further question of bringing lady of family up to town dolly altogether declined to share with father honour of encountering dead man spirit there be very much for mr longestaffe to do very much also for son be becoming question with of how far have be ruined by connection with horrible man be clear that must not get back title deed of pickering property without paying amount have be advanced upon be equally clear that must not pay that sum unless be enabled to do so by fund coming out of melmotte estate dolly a sat smoking upon stool in mr squercum office where now passed considerable portion of time looked upon a miracle of ill usage by george know will have to go to law with governor there be nothing else for be there squercum squercum suggested that have better wait till found what picking there might be out of melmotte estate have made inquiry too about have be assured that there must be property property so involved tied up a to make impossible to lay hand upon suddenly say that thing in square plate carriage horse ought to fetch between twenty thirty thousand there be lot of jewel woman have taken said squercum by george ought to be made to give up everything did ever hear of thing very house pulled down house done without word from in matter suppose thing be ever known before since property be property then uttered sundry threat against bideawhiles in reference to whom declared intention of making very hot for be annoyance added to elder mr longestaffe that management of melmotte affair fell at last almost exclusively into hand of mr brehgert now brehgert in spite of many dealing with melmotte be honest man be perhaps of a much immediate consequence energetic patient man then be man who have wanted to marry georgiana longestaffe be man to whom mr longestaffe have be particularly uncivil then there arose necessity for presence of mr brehgert in house in melmotte have lately lived have died dead man paper be still there deed document such letter a have not chosen to destroy must not be removed quite at once mr brehgert must of course have access to private room a long a be necessary absolutely necessary said mr longestaffe in answer to message be brought to will of course see expediency of relieving from such intrusion a soon a possible soon found preferable to come to term with rejected suitor especially a man be singularly good natured forbearing after injury have received minor debt be to be paid at once arrangement to mr longestaffe cordially agreed a included sum of l due to for rent of house in bruton street then by degree became known that there must certainly be dividend of not le than fifty per cent payable on debt must be proved to have be owing by melmotte perhaps of more arrangement be very comfortable to dolly a have be already agreed between party interested that debt due to must be satisfied before father took anything mr longestaffe resolved during week that remained in town that a regarded own family house in london must not only not be kept up that must be absolutely sold with belonging that servant at caversham must be reduced in number must cease to wear powder be communicated to lady pomona in very long letter be instructed to read to daughter have suffered great wrong said mr longestaffe must submit to a submit so must wife child if son be different from what be sacrifice might probably be made lighter nature can not alter from daughter expect cheerful obedience from what incident of past life be led to expect cheerfulness at caversham might be difficult to say obedience be there georgey be for time broken down sophia be satisfied with nuptial prospect lady pomona have certainly no spirit left for combat think loss of hair powder afflicted most said not word even about in detail necessary for telling of story be anticipated mr longestaffe have remained in london actually over st of september in suffolk be one great festival of year before letter be written to allusion have be made in meantime saw much of mr brehgert absolutely formed kind of friendship for gentleman in spite of abomination of religion so that on one occasion even condescended to ask mr brehgert to dine alone with in bruton street too be in early day of arrangement of melmotte affair when mr longestaffe heart have be softened by arrangement with reference to rent mr brehgert came there arose somewhat singular conversation between two gentleman a sat together over bottle of mr longestaffe old port wine hitherto not word have passed between respecting connection have once be proposed since day on young lady father have said so many bitter thing to expectant bridegroom in evening mr brehgert who be by mean coward in such matter whose feeling be not perhaps painfully fine spoke mind in way at first startled mr longestaffe subject be introduced by reference brehgert have made to own affair loss must be at rate double that mr longestaffe must have to bear spoke of in easy way a though did not sit very near heart of course there be difference between said mr longestaffe bowed head graciously a much a to say that there be of course very wide difference in affair continued brehgert expect gain of course look for occasional loss when gentleman in position sell property expects to get purchase money of course doe mr brehgert be what made so hard ca even yet quite understand how be with why took upon to spend such enormous deal of money here in business

house long short of be that will lose something about sixty thousand pound be large sum of money very large so large a to affect daily mode of life in correspondence with daughter considered to be duty to point out to that must be so know whether told reference to daughter for moment altogether upset mr longestaffe reference be certainly most indelicate most deserving of censure mr longestaffe did not know how to pronounce censure on spur of moment be moreover at present time so very anxious for brehgert assistance in arrangement of affair so to say must not afford to quarrel with man assumed something more than normal dignity a asserted that daughter have never mentioned fact be so said brehgert doubt mr longestaffe assumed great deal of dignity yes be so have promised daughter when be good enough to listen to proposition made to must maintain second house when must be married be impossible said mr longestaffe meaning to assert such hymeneal be altogether unnatural out of question must have be quite possible a thing be when proposition be made looking forward to loss afterwards anticipated from affair of deceased friend found to be prudent to relinquish intention for present thought bound to inform miss longestaffe there be other reason muttered mr longestaffe in suppressed voice almost in whisper in whisper be intended to convey sense of present horror desire for future reticence there may have be in last letter miss longestaffe did honour to write to letter with have not slightest right to find fault seemed to to confine almost exclusively to reason why mention now mr brehgert why mention now subject be painful just because be not painful to mr longestaffe because wish that who have heard of matter must know that be not painful think that throughout behaved like gentleman mr longestaffe in agony first shook head twice then bowed three time leaving jew to take what answer must from so dubious oracle be sure continued brehgert behaved like honest man did quite like matter must be passed over a if be in way ashamed of perhaps on so delicate subject le said soonest mended have nothing more to say have nothing at to mend finishing conversation with little speech brehgert arose to take leave making promise at time that must use expedition in power to complete arrangement of melmotte affair a soon a be gone mr longestaffe opened door walked about room blew out long puff of breath a though to cleanse from impurity of late contact told that must not touch pitch not be defiled how vulgar have man be how indelicate how regardless of feeling how little grateful for honour mr longestaffe have conferred upon by asking to dinner yes yes horrid jew be not jew necessarily abomination yet mr longestaffe be aware that in present crisis of fortune must not afford to quarrel with mr brehgert chapter lxxxix wheel of fortune be long time now since lady carbury great historical work on criminal queen of world have be completed given to world reader careful a to date will remember that be a far back a in february that have solicited assistance of certain of literary friend who be connected with daily weekly press gentleman have responded to call with more le zealous aid so that criminal queen have be regarded in trade a one of successful book of season messrs leadham loiter have published second then very quickly fourth fifth edition have be able in advertisement to give testimony from various criticism showing that lady carbury book be about greatest historical work have emanated from press in present century with object passage be extracted even from column of evening pulpit showed very great ingenuity on part of young man connected with establishment of messrs leadham loiter lady carbury have suffered something in struggle what effort can mortal make a to there will not be disappointment paper print can not be have for nothing advertisement be very costly edition may be sold with startling rapidity may have be scanty edition when lady carbury received from messrs leadham loiter second very moderate cheque with expression of fear on part that there must not probably be third unless unforeseen demand must arise repeated to herself well known line from satirist oh amos cottle for moment think what meagre profit spread from pen ink not on account did for moment hesitate a to further attempt indeed have hardly completed last chapter of criminal queen before be busy on work although last six month have be to period of incessant trouble sometimes of torture though conduct of son have more than once forced to declare to herself that mind must fail still have persevered from day to day with care heavy upon have sat at work with firm resolve so many line must be always forthcoming let difficulty of making be what might messrs leadham loiter have thought that might be justified in offering certain term for novel term not very high indeed contingent on approval of manuscript by reader smallness of sum offered want of certainty pain of work in present circumstance have be felt by to be very hard have persevered novel be now complete can not with truth be said of that have have special tale to tell have taken to writing of novel because mr loiter have told that upon whole novel did better than anything else must have written volume of sermon on same encouragement have gone about work exactly after same fashion length of novel have be first question must be in three volume volume must have three hundred page what fewest number of word might be supposed sufficient to fill page money offered be too trifling to allow of very liberal measure on part have to live if possible to write novel a hoped upon better term when must be finished then what must be name of novel what name of hero above what name of heroine must be love story of course thought that must leave complication of plot to come by chance did come let end unhappily lady carbury mr loiter have said because though people like in play hate in book do lady carbury be historical historical novel lady carbury be worth mr loiter stopping suddenly remembering that be addressing to lady satisfied energy at last by use of word straw lady carbury have followed instruction with accuracy name for story have be great thing did not occur to authoress a plot be to be allowed to develop be at moment when be perplexed a to title altogether uncreated might a well wait to see what appellation might best suit work when purpose must have declared novel knew well be most unlike rose by other name will smell a sweet faultless father mysterious mother lame lover such name a be aware must be useless now mary jane walker if must be very simple must do blanche de veau if be able to maintain throughout somewhat high stilted style of feminine rapture a considered that must best deal with rapid action strange coincidence thought that something more startling descriptive must better suit purpose after hour thought name did occur to wrote down with considerable energy of purpose framed work in accordance with chosen title wheel of fortune have particular fortune in mind when chose particular wheel very idea conveyed by word gave plot wanted young lady be blessed with great wealth lost all by uncle got back by honest lawyer gave up to distressed lover found again in third volume lady name be cordinga selected by lady carbury a never having be heard before in world of fact in of fiction now with trouble thick about while son be still hanging about house in condition must break mother heart while daughter be so wretched sore that regarded around a enemy lady carbury finished work having just written last word in final glow of enduring happiness be given to young married heroine whose wheel have now come full round sat with sheet piled at right hand have allowed certain number of week for task have completed exactly in time fixed a sat with hand near pile did give herself credit for diligence whether work might have be better done never asked think that prided much on literary merit of tale if must bring paper to praise if must induce mudie to circulate if must manage that air for month must be so loaded with wheel of fortune a to make necessary for reading world to have read to have said that have read book then must pride very much upon work a be so sitting on sunday afternoon in own room mr alf be announced according to habit expressed warm delight at seeing nothing must be kinder than visit just at time when there be so very much to occupy one a mr alf mr alf in usual mildly satirical way declared that be not peculiarly occupied just at present emperor have left europe at last said poor melmotte poisoned on friday inquest sat yesterday know that there be anything of interest to day of course lady carbury be intent upon book rather even than on exciting death of man whom have known oh if must only get mr alf have tried before have failed lamentably be well aware of have deep seated conviction that must be almost impossible to get mr alf then have deep seated conviction that be almost impossible may possibly be done how great must be glory how infinite service did not seem a though providence have blessed with special opportunity sending mr alf to just at one moment at might introduce subject of novel without seeming premeditation be so tired said affecting to throw back a though stretching arm out for ease hope be not adding to fatigue said mr alf oh dear be not fatigue of moment of last six month just a knocked at door have finished novel at have be working oh with such diligence oh novel when be to appear lady carbury must ask leadham loiter question have done part of work suppose never wrote novel mr alf oh dear never write anything have sometimes wondered whether have hated loved most one becomes so absorbed in one plot one character one love loveable so intensely hate with such fixed aversion who be intended to be hated when mind be attuned to one be tempted to think that be so good one cry at one own pathos laugh at one own humour be lost in admiration at one own sagacity knowledge how very nice then there come reversed picture other side of coin on sudden everything becomes flat tedious unnatural heroine who be yesterday alive with celestial spark be found to day to be lump of motionless clay dialogue be so cheery on first perusal be utterly uninteresting at second reading yesterday be sure that there be monument put hand upon manuscript to day feel to be only too heavy for gravestone one judgment about one self always doe vacillate said mr alf in tone a phlegmatic a be word yet be so important that one must be able to judge correctly of one own work can at rate trust to be honest be more perhaps than can be said of critic dishonesty be not general fault of critic lady carbury at least not a far a have observed business be incapacity in what little have done in matter be sin have striven to conquer when want shoe go to professed shoemaker for criticism have certainly not gone to professed critic think that when gave up 'evening pulpit ' left upon staff of writer who be entitled to be regarded a knowing business given up 'pulpit asked lady carbury with astonishment readjusting mind at once so that might perceive whether if so what advantage might be taken of mr alf new position be no longer editor therefore heavy sense of responsibility must no longer exist must still have influence might not be persuaded to do one act of real friendship might not succeed if must come down from high seat sink on ground before tell plain truth beg for favour a poor struggling woman yes lady carbury have given up be matter of course must do so when stood for parliament now that new member have so suddenly vacated seat will probably stand again be no longer editor have given up suppose have now satisfied scruple of gentleman who seemed to think be committing crime against constitution in attempting to get into parliament while be managing newspaper never heard such nonsense of course know where came from where did come from where must come from 'breakfast table broune have be very good friend do think that of men know be most jealous be so little said lady carbury be really very fond of mr broune at present moment be obliged to humour mr alf seems to that man can be better qualified to sit in parliament than editor of newspaper be if be capable a editor one think have ever doubted that of only question be whether be strong enough for double work have doubted about have therefore given up paper almost regret dare say do said lady carbury feeling intensely anxious to talk about own affair instead of suppose still retain interest in paper pecuniary interest nothing more oh mr alf must do such favour can if can may be sure will false hearted false tongued man of course knew at moment be favour lady carbury intended to ask of course have made up mind that must not do a be asked will lady carbury clasped hand together a poured forth word of prayer never asked to do anything for a long a be editing paper did did not think right must not do took chance like others be sure must own bore what be said of with good grace never complained did certainly not now that have left if must have 'wheel of fortune ' done for really well done 'wheel of fortune be name of novel said lady carbury putting hand softly upon manuscript just at moment must be making of fortune for oh mr alf if must know how want such assistance have nothing further to do with editorial management lady carbury of course must get done word from must make certain novel be different from historical work know have taken so much pain with then doubt will be praised on own merit say that mr 'evening pulpit ' be like oh be like like like throne of heaven who can be justified before talk about own merit say that will have done must do man harm must sell five hundred copy at once be if be done really con amore mr alf looked at almost piteously shook head paper stand so high ca hurt to do kind of thing once woman be asking mr alf be for child that be struggling thing be done day of week with much le noble motif think that have ever be done by 'evening pulpit ' have seen book praised of course have think saw novel spoken highly of mr alf laughed why not suppose that be object of 'pulpit to cry down novel thought be thought might make exception here must be so thankful so grateful dear lady carbury pray believe when say have nothing to do with need not preach to sermon about literary virtue oh said not quite understanding what meant sceptre have passed from hand need not vindicate justice of successor will never know successor must assure that on account must think of meddling with literary arrangement of paper must not do for sister lady carbury looked greatly pained send book out let take chance how much prouder will be to have praised because deserves praise than to know that have be eulogised a mark of friendship sha said lady carbury believe that anything like real selling praise be ever given to anybody except to friend know how manage do mr alf shook head oh yes be very well from of course have be dragon of virtue tell that authoress of 'new cleopatra ' be very handsome woman lady carbury must have be worried much beyond wont when allowed so far to lose temper a to bring against mr alf double charge of being too fond of authoress in question of having sacrificed justice of column to improper affection illustration of course have be dragon of virtue at moment remember name of lady to whom allude said mr alf getting up to take leave be quite sure that gentleman who reviewed book if there be such lady such book have never seen so mr alf departed lady carbury be very angry with very angry also with mr alf have not only meant to be piteous have made attempt then have allowed to be carried away into anger have degraded to humility have then wasted possible good result by foolish fit of chagrin world in have to live be almost too hard for when left alone sat weeping over sorrow when from time to time thought of mr alf conduct must hardly repress scorn what lie have told of course must have done have chosen assumed honesty of man be infinitely worse to than lie doubt pulpit have two object in criticism other paper probably have one object common to paper that of helping friend destroying enemy of course prevailed with pulpit there be second purpose of enticing reader by crushing author a crowd used to be enticed to see men hanged when execution be done in public one object other be compatible with aristidean justice mr alf arrogated to to paper hoped with heart that mr alf must spend great deal of money at westminster then lose seat on following morning took manuscript to messrs leadham loiter be hurt again by small amount of respect seemed to be paid to collected sheet there be work of six month very blood brain concentrated essence of mind a must say when talking with energy of own performance mr leadham pitched across to clerk apparently perhaps sixteen year of age lad chucked parcel unceremoniously under counter author feel that work must be taken from with fast clutching reverential hand held thoughtfully out of harm way till be deposited within very sanctum of absolutely fireproof safe oh heaven if must be lost burned stolen scrap of paper so easily destroyed apparently so little respected may hereafter be acknowledged to have have value greater so far greater than weight in gold if robinson crusoe have be lost if tom jones have be consumed by flame who know that may be robinson crusoe better than tom jones will be safe there asked lady carbury quite safe quite safe said mr leadham who be rather busy who perhaps saw lady carbury more frequently than nature amount of authorship seemed to to require seemed to be put down there under counter be quite right lady carbury be left there till be packed packed there be two three dozen going to reader week be down in skye keep till there be enough to fill sack do go by post mr leadham not by post lady carbury there be not many of must pay expense send by long sea to glasgow because just at time of year there be not much hurry ca publish before winter oh heaven if ship must be lost on journey by long sea to glasgow evening a be now almost daily habit mr broune came to there be something in absolute friendship now existed between lady carbury editor of morning breakfast table almost made scrupulous a to asking from further literary favour fully recognised woman perhaps more fully necessity of making use of aid furtherance might come within reach with son with such need for struggling before must not be wicked not to catch even at straw man have now become so true to that hardly knew how to beg to do with mistaken feeling did in truth know that ought not to do have asked to marry for though have refused felt infinitely grateful though have refused have lent money have supported in misery by continued counsel if must offer to do thing for must accept kindness on knee even must not bring to ask to have added to other favour first word to be about mr alf so have given up paper well yes nominally be that suppose will really let go out of own hand nobody like to lose power will share work keep authority a for westminster believe have chance if poor wretch melmotte must beat when everybody be already talking about forgery how be likely that must stand against candidate a will get now be here yesterday full of triumph suppose never talk to much of be speaking of new book novel assured most positively that have nothing further to do with paper did not care to make promise dare say be just of course did not believe will make promise will see what can do if ca be good natured at rate will say nothing ill natured let see what be name wheel of fortune ' lady carbury a told title of new book to old friend seemed to be almost ashamed of let send early day two before be out if can ca answer of course for opinion of gentleman will go to nothing will go in must dislike good bye god bless a took hand looked at almost a though old susceptibility be returning to a sat alone after have gone thinking over thinking of own circumstance of kindness did not occur to to call old goose again felt now that have mistaken man when have so regarded that first only kiss have given have treated with so much derision for have rebuked so mildly yet so haughtily have now somewhat sacred spot in memory through man must have really loved be not marvellous that thing must be how have come to pas that in tenderness have rejected when have given chance of becoming wife chapter xc hetta sorrow when hetta carbury received that letter from lover be given to reader chapter back certainly did not tend in way to alleviate misery even when have read over dozen time must not bring to think possible that must be reconciled to man be not only that have sinned against by giving society to woman to whom have at rate be engaged not long since at very time at be becoming engaged to also that have done in such manner a to make offence known to friend perhaps have be too quick there be fact that with own consent have acceded to mother demand that man must be rejected man have be rejected even roger carbury knew that be so after be thought impossible that must recall must know that heart be unchanged roger carbury must certainly know that if ever asked further question on matter must never deny though knew that man have behaved badly having entangled with nasty american woman yet must be true to a far a own heart be concerned now told that have be most unjust to said that must not understand injustice did not fill letter with entreaty with reproach certainly reproach moved more than prayer must have done be too late now to remedy evil be not quite sure within own bosom that have not be unjust to more thought of more puzzled mind became have quarrelled with because have once be in love with mr hurtle because have ground for regarding mr hurtle a present rival hated mr hurtle be very angry with in that have ever be on affectionate term with woman hated have not be reason put forward by for quarrelling with perhaps be true that too have of late loved mr hurtle hardly better than did might be that have be indeed constrained by hard circumstance to go with woman to lowestoft having so gone with be doubt right that must be rejected for how can be that man who be engaged will be allowed to travel about country with woman to whom also be engaged few month back still there might be hardship in to to hetta circumstance be very hard loved man with heart must look forward to happiness in life without yet must be so at end of letter have told to go to mr hurtle if wanted corroboration of story a told by of course have known when wrote that must not must not go

herself that be too late to recover ground be at rate almost sure that must be too late yet be disposed to do battle with mother cousin in matter if only with object of showing that must not submit own feeling to control be savage to point of rebellion against authority roger carbury must of course think that communication between herself mr hurtle must be most improper altogether indelicate two three day ago thought so herself world be going so hard with that be beginning to feel capable of throwing propriety delicacy to wind man whom have once accepted whom altogether loved who in spite of fault certainly still loved of be beginning to have further doubt accused of dishonesty referred to rival for corroboration of story must appeal to mr woman be odious abominable nasty intriguing american female lover desired that must hear woman story must hear story if woman must tell so resolving wrote a follows to mr hurtle finding great difficulty in composition of letter must tell too little too much determined that must be restrained by mock modesty by girlish fear of declaring truth about letter at last be stiff hard sufficed for purpose madam mr paul montague have referred to a to certain circumstance have taken place between be right must tell be short time since engaged to marry have found obliged to break off engagement in consequence of what have be told a to acquaintance with make proposition to not thinking that anything will say to can change mind because have asked to do so have at same time accused of injustice towards wish to rest under accusation of injustice from one to whom be once warmly attached if will receive will make business to call afternoon may name yours truly henrietta carbury when letter be written be not only ashamed of very much afraid of also what if american woman must put in newspaper have heard that everything be put into newspaper in america what if mr hurtle must send back to horribly insolent answer must send such answer to mother instead of then again if american woman consented to receive must not american woman a matter of course trample upon with rough word once twice put letter aside almost determined that must not be sent at last with desperate fortitude took out with posted told word of to one mother thought have be cruel to have disregarded feeling made wretched for ever must not ask mother for

worsted be fear impossible to describe adequately various half resolution formed changing phase of mind before brought to conclusion soon after have assured that must be conclusion after have told paul montague that must be so there came back upon at time other half resolution to contrary effect have written letter to man threatening desperate revenge have then abstained from sending have then shown to man not intending to give to a letter upon must have to act only that might ask whether have received must have said that have not deserved then have parted with refusing to hear to say word of farewell have told mr pipkin that be no longer engaged to be married at moment everything be done must be done game have be played stake lost have schooled into such restraint a to have abandoned

teeth for inch of ground if did not mean to be trodden into dust have not held own among rough people after very rough fashion must now simply retire that might weep in corner like love sick schoolgirl have be so stoutly determined that must at rate avenge own wrong if must not turn wrong into triumph there be moment in thought that must still seize man by throat where world might see

beargarden paul having written from club having omitted to desire that answer must be sent to lodging just at moment thing at beargarden be not well managed be indeed so ill managed that paul never received that letter must have have for charm greater than of letter ever before written be terrible business said fisker immediately on entering room in montague be waiting be last man 'd have thought must be cut up in way be utterly ruined must have be ruined must have thought so if 'd known ought to have known south central must have pulled through abeost anything if 'd have understood how to play think much of south central here now said paul ah be because have never above half spirit enough for big thing nibble at instead of swallowing whole then of course folk see that be only nibbling thought that melmotte must have have spirit there be fear doubt that have committed forgery be dread of detection a to drove to destroy call dam clumsy from beginning to end dam clumsy took to be different man feel more than half ashamed of because trusted fellow chap cohenlupe have got off with lot of swag only think of melmotte allowing cohenlupe to get better of suppose thing will be broken up now at san francisco suggested paul bubet up at frisco not if know why must be bubet up d'you think be going to smash there because fool like melmotte blow brain out in london took poison p'ison be not just way will tell what be going to do why be over here so uncommon sharp share be at abeost nothing now in london will buy share in market wired for a many a dar 'd so a not to spoil own game will make clean sweep of one of bubet up be sorry for because thought biggish man what be done will just be making of over there will get out of will come back to frisco with in answer to paul asserted most strenuously that must not return to san francisco perhaps too ingenuously gave partner to understand that be altogether sick of great railway must under circumstance have anything more to do with fisker shrugged shoulder be not displeased at proposed rupture be prepared to deal fairly nay generously by partner having recognised wisdom of great commercial rule teach that honour must prevail among associate of certain class have fully convinced that paul montague be not fit partner for hamilton k fisker fisker be not only unscrupulous have thorough contempt for scruple in others according to theory of life nine hundred ninety nine men be obscure because of scruple whilst thousandth man predominated cropped up into splendour of commercial wealth because be free from such bondage have own theory too a to commercial honesty have promised to do must do if be within power be anxious that bond must be good word equally so work of robbing mankind in gross by magnificently false representation be not only duty also delight ambition of life how must man so great endure partnership with one so small a paul montague now what about winifrid hurtle asked fisker what make ask be in london oh yes know be in london hurtle at frisco swearing that will come after must only have got dollar be not dead then muttered paul dead likely to die will have bad time of with yet divorced got kansa lawyer to say so be got frisco lawyer to say that there be nothing of kind have played game badly for be have handling of own money have put so that ca get hold of dollar even if suited other way know must marry till saw way clearer out of wood be not thinking of marrying if mean that there be talk about in frisco be have heard hurtle say when be little farther gone than usual that be here with that meant to drop in on of day to paul made answer thinking that have now heard enough said enough about mr hurtle on following day two men who be still partner went together to london fisker immediately became immersed in arrangement of melmotte affair put into communication with mr brehgert went in out of office in abchurch lane room have belonged to railway company cross examined croll mastered book of company a far a be to be mastered actually summoned grendalls father son up to london lord alfred mile with have left london day two before melmotte death having probably perceived that there be further occasion for service to fisker appeal lord alfred be proudly indifferent who be american that must call upon director of london company to appear doe not one know that director of company need not direct unless plea lord alfred therefore did not even condescend to answer fisker letter advised son to run up to town must just go because 'd taken salary from d company said careful father when there must say word so mile grendall obeying parent reappeared upon scene fisker attention be perhaps most usefully most sedulously paid to madame melmotte daughter till fisker arrived one have visited in solitude at hampstead except croll clerk mr brehgert have abstained thinking that widow who have become widow under such terrible circumstance must prefer to be alone lord nidderdale have made adieu felt that must do more need hardly be said that lord alfred have too much good taste to interfere at time although for month have be domestically intimate with poor woman that sir felix must not be prompted by father death to renew suit to daughter fisker have not be two day in london before went out to hampstead be admitted to madame melmotte presence have not be there four day before be aware that in spite of misfortune marie melmotte be still undoubted possessor of large fortune in regard to melmotte effect generally crown have be induced to abstain from interfering giving up right to man plate chair table have acquired by finding of coroner verdict not from tenderness to madame melmotte for whom great commiseration be felt on behalf of such creditor a poor mr longestaffe son marie money be quite distinct from have be right in own belief a to property have be right too in refusing to sign paper unless may be that refusal led to father act be sure that be not so because have withdrawn refusal have offered to sign paper before father death what might have be ultimate result have done so when first made request one must now say that money must have gone there must be doubt money be now hers fact fisker soon learned with peculiar cleverness belonged to poor madame melmotte felt visit of american to be relief to in misery world make great mistake a to be be not beneficial to whom death have bereaved of companion may be doubt sometimes be case grief will be so heavy so absolutely crushing a to make interference with additional trouble be felt also in acute bodily pain in period of terrible mental suffering may also be doubt often be case that bereaved one chooses to affect such overbearing sorrow that friend abstain because even such affectation have own right privilege madame melmotte be neither crushed by grief did affect to be so crushed have be numbed by suddenness by awe of catastrophe man who have be merciless tyrant for year who have seemed to to be very incarnation of cruel power have succumbed shown to be powerless against own misfortune be woman of very few word have spoken almost none on occasion even to own daughter when fisker came to told more than have ever known before of husband affair spoke to of future life mixed for small glass of brandy water warm told that frisco must be fittest place for future residence certainly did not find to be intrusive even marie liked fisker though have be wooed almost won by lord baronet have understood if not much at least more than mother of life to have be introduced there be something of real sorrow in heart for father be prone to love though perhaps not prone to deep affection melmotte have certainly be often cruel to have also be very indulgent a have never be specially grateful for one so have ever specially resented other tenderness care real solicitude for well being have never known have come to regard unevenness of life vacillating between knock knick knack with blow one day jewel next a condition of thing be natural to when father be dead remembered for while jewel knick knack forgot knock blow be not beyond consolation also found consolation in mr fisker visit used to sign paper quarter said to fisker a be walking together one evening in lane round hampstead will have to do same now only instead of giving paper to one will have to leave in banker hand to draw money for can be done over in california just same a here banker will manage for without slightest trouble for matter of will do if will trust there be only one thing against miss melmotte what be after sort of society have be used to here know how will get on among american be pretty rough lot guess though perhaps what lose in look of fruit will make up in flavour fisker said in somewhat plaintive tone a though fearing that manifest substantial advantage of frisco must not suffice to atone for loss of fashion to miss melmotte have be used hate swell said marie flashing round upon do now like poison what be use of 'em never mean word that say say so many word be never more than half awake care least about anybody hate london do now oh wonder whether 'd hate frisco rather think must be jolly sort of place very jolly find wonder whether 'd hate mr fisker be nonsense why must hate anybody do have found out one two that love if do come to frisco hope wo just hate know then took gently by arm whisking away rapidly bade behave then returned to lodging mr fisker before went back to london mixed little warm brandy water for madame melmotte think that upon whole madame melmotte be more comfortable at hampstead than have be either in grosvenor square bruton street although be certainly not thing beautiful to look at in widow weed think much of a book keeper know fisker said to mile grendall in now almost deserted board room of south central pacific mexican railway mile remembering father advice answered not word merely looked with assumed amazement at impertinent stranger who dared thus to censure performance fisker have made three four remark previous to have appealed to paul montague to croll who be present have invited also attendance of sir felix carbury lord nidderdale mr longestaffe who be director none of have come sir felix have paid attention to fisker letter lord nidderdale have written short characteristic reply dear mr fisker really know anything about yours nidderdale mr longestaffe with laborious zeal have closely covered four page with reason for non attendance with reader will not be troubled may be doubted whether even fisker perused to end upon word continued fisker be astonishing to that melmotte must have put up with kind of thing suppose understand something of business mr croll va not department mr fisker said german anybody else said domineering american of course be on card mr grendall that will have to put into witness box because there be certain thing must get at mile be silent a grave at once made up mind that must pas autumn at pleasant economical german retreat that autumnal retirement must be commenced within very few day perhaps hour might suffice fisker be not in earnest in threat in truth greater confusion in london office better thought be prospect of company at san francisco mile underwent purgatory on occasion for three four hour when dismissed have certainly revealed none of melmotte secret did however go to germany finding that temporary absence from england must be comfortable to in more respect than one need not be heard of again in page when melmotte affair be ultimately wound up there be found to be nearly enough of property to satisfy proved liability very many men started up with huge claim asserting that have be robbed in confusion be hard to ascertain who have be robbed who have simply be unsuccessful in attempt to rob others doubt a be case with poor mr brehgert have speculated in dependence on melmotte sagacity have lost heavily without dishonesty of who like longestaffes be able to prove direct debt condition at last be not very sad excellent friend dolly got money early in day be able under mr squercum guidance to start on new career having paid debt with still large balance at banker assured friend nidderdale that meant to turn over entirely new leaf will just make squercum allow so much month will have bill kind of thing sent to will do everything pull up if be getting wrong like squercum wo rob old fellow suggested nidderdale of course will wo let one else do have to be plucked be everything to have done on system if will only let have ten shilling out of sovereign think can get along let hope that mr squercum be merciful dolly be enabled to live in accordance with virtuous resolution thing did not arrange till late in winter long after mr fisker departure for california that however be protracted till day much later than have anticipated before have become intimate with madame melmotte marie madame melmotte affair occupied for while almost exclusively furniture plate be of course sold for creditor madame melmotte be allowed to take declared to be specially own property though much be said about jewel attempt be made to recover marie advised madame melmotte to give up assuring old woman that must have wanted for maintenance be not likely that melmotte widow must willingly abandon property did not abandon jewel be agreed between fisker that be to be taken to new york will get a much there a in london if like to part with nobody will say anything about there must sell locket chain here without world talking about in thing madame melmotte put into fisker hand with most absolute confidence indeed with confidence be justified by result be not by robbing old woman fisker intended to make great to madame melmotte thinking fisker be finest gentleman have ever met so infinitely pleasanter in manner than lord alfred even when lord alfred have be most gracious with so much more to say for than mile grendall understanding so much better than man have ever done especially when supplied with small warm beaker of sweet brandy water will do tell said to marie be sure have nothing to keep here in country be willing to go said marie want to stay in london suppose will take if asks know anything about said marie man may be very well without one wanting to marry think will marry anybody what be use be only money nobody care for anything else fisker very well only want money do think fisker 'd ask to marry if have got anything not ai slow enough for think be very nice young man said madame melmotte chapter xciii true lover hetta carbury out of fulness of heart having made up mind that have be unjust to lover wrote to letter full of penitence full of love telling at great length detail of meeting with mr hurtle bidding come back to bring brooch with letter have unfortunately addressed to beargarden a have written to from club partly through own fault partly through demoralisation of once perfect establishment letter never reached hand when therefore returned to london be justified in supposing that have refused even to notice appeal be however determined that must still make further struggle have felt to contend with many difficulty mr hurtle roger carbury hetta mother be thought all inimical to mr hurtle though have declared that must not rage a lioness must hardly be friend in matter roger have repeatedly declared determination to regard a traitor lady carbury a well knew have always be always must be opposed to match hetta have owned that loved have submitted to caress have be proud of admiration paul though did not probably analyze very carefully character of beloved still felt instinctively that having so far prevailed with girl prospect must not be altogether hopeless yet how must continue struggle with what weapon must carry on fight writing of letter be one sided troublesome proceeding when person to whom be written will not answer calling at door at servant have be instructed to refuse visitor admission becomes disagreeable if not degrading after time hetta have written second epistle not to lover to one who received letter with more regularity when rashly with precipitate wrath quarrelled with paul montague at once communicated fact to mother through mother to cousin roger though must not recognise roger a lover did acknowledge to be head of family own special friend entitled in special way to know that did be done in regard to therefore wrote to cousin telling that have made mistake about paul that be convinced that paul have always behaved to with absolute sincerity in short that paul be best dearest most ill used of human being in enthusiasm went on to declare that there must be other chance of happiness for in world than of becoming paul wife to beseech dearest friend cousin roger not to turn against to lend aiding hand there be whom strong word in letter never affect at who perhaps hardly read take what do read a meaning more than half what be said roger carbury be certainly not one of a sat on garden wall at carbury with cousin letter in hand word have full weight with did not try to convince that be verbiage of enthusiastic girl who might soon be turned trained to mode of thinking by fitting admonition to now a read re read hetta letter sitting on wall there be not at rate further hope for though be altogether unchanged though be altogether incapable of change though must not rally sufficiently to look forward to even passive enjoyment of life without girl whom have loved yet told what believed to be truth at last owned directly plainly that whether happy unhappy must do without have let time slip by with too fast too far before have ventured to love must now stomach disappointment make best must of broken ill conditioned life a be left to if acknowledged did acknowledge in what fashion must in future treat man woman who have reduced so low at moment mind be tuned to high thought if be possible must be unselfish must not indeed bring to think with kindness of paul montague must not say to that man have not be treacherous to must forgive man supposed treason did tell very plainly that in comparison with man be nothing to must hardly be worth while to maintain quarrel with man if be once able to assure hetta a wife of man must still be dear to a friend might be dear be well aware that such assurance such forgiveness must contain very much if be to be so hetta child must take name of carbury must be to a heir a near a possible own child in favour must throw aside law of primogeniture to be so sacred that have be hitherto minded to make sir felix heir in spite of absolute unfitness of wretched young man must be changed must be able to persuade to give consent to marriage in such case carbury must be home of married couple a far a must induce to make so there must be born future infant to whose existence be already looking forward with idea that in old age might there find comfort in such case though must never again be able to love paul montague in heart of heart must live with for sake on affectionate term must forgive hetta altogether a though there have be no fault must strive to forgive man fault a best might struggling a be to be generous passionately fond a be of justice yet did not know how to be just must not see that in truth have be to extent ill used ever again a thought of great prayer a to forgiveness of trespass must not refrain from asking whether must really be intended that must forgive such trespass a committed against by paul montague nevertheless when rose from wall have resolved that hetta must be pardoned entirely that paul montague must be treated a though be pardoned a for chance of world have be unkind to must submit to nevertheless wrote answer to hetta letter perhaps felt with undefined still existing hope that writing of such letter must deprive of last chance hetta letter to hardly required immediate answer did not indeed demand answer have simply told that whereas have for certain reason quarrelled with man have loved have now come to conclusion that must quarrel with no longer have asked for cousin assent to own view that a roger felt be to be given rather by discontinuance of opposition than by positive action roger influence with mother be assistance hetta really wanted from influence must hardly be given by writing of letter thinking of roger determined that must again go up to london must have vacant hour of journey in to think of again tell whether be possible for to bring heart to agree to marriage then must see people perhaps learn something further from manner word before finally committed to abandonment of own hope completion of theirs went up to town know that vacant hour served much to man not accustomed to thinking there be nothing in world so difficult a to think after loose fashion turn over thing in mind ultimately reach decision guided probably by feeling at last moment rather than by process of ratiocination then think that have thought to follow out one argument to end then to found on base so reached commencement of be not common to process be hardly within compass of roger mind who when be made wretched by dust by female who have basket of objectionable provision opposite to almost forswore charitable resolution of day before who again a walked lonely at night round square be near to hotel looking up at bright moon with full appreciation of beauty of heaven asked what be that must wish to interfere with happiness of two human being much younger than much fitter to enjoy world have have bath have got rid of dust have eaten dinner next morning be in welbeck street at early hour when knocked have not made up mind whether must ask for lady carbury daughter did at last inquire whether lady be at home lady be reported a being at home be at once shown into drawing room where hetta be sitting hurried up to at once took in arm kissed have never done thing before have never even kissed hand though be cousin dear friend have never treated after fashion instinct told immediately that greeting from be sign of affectionate compliance with wish that man must kiss a best dearest relation a most trusted friend a almost brother be certainly to offence must cling to in fondest love if must only consent not to be lover oh roger be so glad to see said escaping gently from arm must not write answer so came always do kindest thing can be done know know can do anything now kind unkind be done without aid from hetta have be world to reproach said why must reproach have committed fault must not have come have intended to reproach one love so much for saying let be a wish if must have made up mind to bear there will be end of a said took by hand put head upon shoulder began to weep still will be world to continued with arm round waist a will not be wife will be daughter will be sister roger daughter rather will be have in world will hurry to grow old may feel for a old feel for young if have child hetta must be child a thus spoke tear be renewed have planned out in mind dear there if there be anything can do to add to happiness will do must believe of that to make happy will be only enjoyment of life have be hardly possible for to tell a yet that man to whom be thus consenting to surrender have not even condescended to answer letter in have told to come back to now sobbing a be overcome by tenderness of cousin affection anxious to express intense gratitude did not know how first to mention name of paul montague have seen said in whisper seen whom mr montague why must have seen be not for sake that be here will be friend husband will certainly be friend if not fault will not be mine will all be forgotten a nearly a such thing may be forgotten have nothing to say to till have seen at moment door be opened lady carbury entered room after greeting with cousin looked first at daughter then at roger have come up said to signify adhesion to marriage lady carbury face fell very low need not speak again of what be own wish have learned at last that must not have be so why must say so exclaimed lady carbury pray pray mamma hetta began be unable to find word with to go on with prayer know that need be so at continued lady carbury think be very much in own hand of course be not for to press such arrangement if be not in accord with own wish look upon a engaged to marry paul montague said roger not at said lady carbury yes mamma yes cried hetta boldly be so be engaged to beg to let cousin know that be not so with consent a far a can understand at present with consent of mr montague mamma paul montague ejaculated roger carbury consent of paul montague think may take upon to say that there can be no doubt a to that there have be quarrel said lady carbury surely have not quarrelled with hetta wrote to have not answered said hetta piteously then lady carbury gave full somewhat coloured account of what have taken place while roger listened with admirable patience marriage be on account objectionable said at last mean be precarious conduct with regard to woman have be very bad have be sadly mixed up with wretched man who destroyed now when henrietta have written to without sanction in opposition to express command take notice of very properly sent back present that made doubt have resented doing so trust that resentment may be continued hetta be now seated on sofa hiding face weeping roger stood perfectly still listening with respectful silence till lady carbury have spoken last word even then be slow to answer considering what might best say think have better see replied if a imagine have not received cousin letter that matter will be set at rest must not take advantage of such accident a that a to income that think may be managed connection with mr melmotte be unfortunate be due to fault of at moment must not remember lady carbury great anxiety to be closely connected with melmotte be too generous to say word on head will see lady carbury then will come to again lady carbury did not dare to tell that did not wish to see paul montague knew that if really threw into scale against opposition must weigh nothing be too powerful in honesty greatness of character have be too often admitted by to be guardian angel of family for to stand against still thought that have persevered hetta must have become wife be late that evening before roger found paul montague who have only then returned from liverpool with fisker whose subsequent doings have be recorded somewhat out of turn know what letter mean said paul wrote to certainly wrote to wrote to twice last letter be one think ought to have answered have accepted have given right to tell own story when unfortunately heard from other source story of journey to lowestoft with mr hurtle paul pleaded own case with indignant heat not understanding at first that roger have come to on friendly mission did answer letter have not have line from not word did answer letter what did say to nay must ask if will not see will see can tell will tell also that wrote to a girl writes to lover whom doe wish to see be that true exclaimed paul jumping up be here especially to tell that be true must hardly come on such mission if there be doubt may go to need have nothing to fear unless indeed be opposition of mother be stronger than mother said paul think be now wish to hear what have to say of course said paul sitting down suddenly up to moment roger carbury though have certainly brought glad tidings have not communicated a joyous sympathetic messenger face have be severe tone of voice almost harsh paul remembering well word of last letter old friend have written did not expect personal kindness roger must probably say very disagreeable thing to must bear with patience must summon to assistance know what feeling have be roger began how deeply have resented what thought to be interference with affection quarrel between whatever right of may be have never quarrelled with paul began if will listen to for moment will be better anger between let arise a might must be allowed to interfere with happiness of whom suppose love better than rest of world put together do said paul so do so always will be to be wife will be daughter will have property child will be heir house will be house if will consent to make so will not be afraid of know think too well for may now count on assistance must have from be father giving daughter in marriage do because will make happiness of life chief object of mine now good night say anything about at present by by will be able to talk about thing with more equable temper having so spoken hurried out of room leaving paul montague bewildered by tidings have be announced to chapter xciv john crumb victory in meantime great preparation be going on down in suffolk for marriage of happiest of lover john crumb john crumb have be up to london have be formally reconciled to ruby who have submitted to floury embrace not with best grace in world still with submission have satisfied future husband have be intensely grateful to mr hurtle almost munificent in liberality to mr pipkin to whom presented purple silk dress in addition to cloak have given on former occasion during visit have expressed no anger against ruby indignation in reference to baronite when informed by mr pipkin who hoped thereby to please that sir felix be supposed to be still one mash of gore blandly smiled remarking that man must be much worse for few sich tap a only stayed few hour in london during few hour settled everything when mr pipkin suggested that ruby must be married from house winked eye a declined suggestion with thanks daniel ruggles be old under influence of continued gin water be becoming feeble john crumb be of opinion that old man must not be neglected hinted that with little care five hundred pound have originally be promised a ruby fortune might at rate be secured be of opinion that marriage must be celebrated in suffolk feast being spread at sheep acre farm if dan ruggles must be talked into giving if not at own house when lady explained to that last proposition be not in strict accordance with habit of fashionable world john expressed opinion under peculiar circumstance of marriage ordinary law of world might be suspended ai jist like other folk after a have be through said meaning probably to imply that having have to fight for wife be entitled to give breakfast on occasion if pleased whether banquet be to be given by bride grandfather by be determined that there must be banquet that must bid guest invited mr pipkin mr hurtle at last succeeded in inducing mr hurtle to promise that must bring mr pipkin down to bungay for occasion then be necessary to fix day for purpose be of course essential that ruby must be consulted during discussion a to feast bridegroom entreaty that two lady must be present have taken part in matter in hand be brought up to be kissed having be duly kissed retired again among child having only expressed one wish of own namely that joe mixet might not have anything to do with affair day must not be fixed without be summoned crumb have be absurdly impatient proposing next tuesday making proposition on friday must cook enough meat for bungay to eat by tuesday be aware of other cause for delay be out of question ruby have said decisively a two elder lady have supported mr crumb yielded with good grace did not

very absolute word very slowly put out own gave to without looking at then drew towards in moment be kneeling at foot with face buried on knee considering age perhaps must say that attitude be awkward must certainly have thought so have imagined that one must have seen how many absurdity of kind be not only held to be pleasant almost holy a long a remain mystery inspected by profane eye be not age be ashamed of feeling passion acknowledging that display of be without grace of youth be proud age regret on occasion there be very little more said between have certainly be in earnest have now accepted a went down to office told now that have done best not only for for also yet think that have won more thoroughly by former refusal than by other virtue a sat alone late into night became subject to thorough reaction of spirit that morning world have be perfect blank to there be single object of interest before now everything be rose coloured man who have thus bound to who have given such assured proof of affection truth be one of considerable one of world man than whom few so now told be greater more powerful be not career enough for woman to be wife of such man to receive friend to shine with reflected glory whether hope be realised a human hope never be realised how far content be assured page can not tell must tell that before coming winter be over lady carbury became wife of mr broune in furtherance of own resolve took husband name house in welbeck street be kept mr broune tuesday evening be much more regarded by literary world than have be of lady carbury chapter c down in suffolk need hardly be said that paul montague be not long in adjusting affair with hetta after visit received from roger carbury early on following morning be once more in welbeck street taking brooch with though at first lady carbury kept up opposition did after so weak fashion a to throw in fact very little difficulty in way hetta understood perfectly that be in matter stronger than mother that need fear nothing now that roger carbury be on side know what mean to live on lady carbury said threatening future evil in plaintive tone hetta repeated though in other language assurance young lady made who declared that if future husband must consent to live on potato must be quite satisfied with potato peeling while paul made vague allusion to satisfactory nature of final arrangement with house of fisker montague montague see anything like income said lady carbury suppose roger will make right take everything upon now seems be before halcyon day of mr broune second offer be at rate decided that be to be married time fixed for marriage be to be following spring when be finally arranged roger carbury who have returned to own home conceived idea that must be well that hetta must pas autumn if possible winter also down in suffolk so that might get used to in capacity now aspired to fill with object induced mr yeld bishop wife to invite down to palace hetta accepted invitation left london before must hear tidings of mother engagement with mr broune roger carbury have not yielded in matter have not brought to determine that must recognise paul hetta a acknowledged lover without fierce inward contest two conviction have be strong in mind of be opposed to recognition first telling that must be fitter husband for girl than paul montague second assuring that paul have ill treated in fashion that forgiveness must be foolish unmanly for roger though be religious man one anxious to conform to spirit of christianity must not allow to think that injury must be forgiven unless man who did injury repented of own injustice a to giving coat to thief who have taken cloak told be others to be guided by precept honest industry must go naked in order that vice idleness might be comfortably clothed if one stole cloak must certainly put man in prison a soon a possible not commence lenience till thief must at rate affect to be sorry for fault now to thinking paul montague have stolen cloak be roger to give way in matter of love must be giving paul coat also no be bound after fashion to have paul put into prison to bring before jury to get verdict against so that sentence of punishment might be at least pronounced how then must yield paul montague have shown to be very weak in regard to woman might be doubt be true that mr hurtle appearance in england have be distressing to still have gone down with to lowestoft a lover to roger thinking man who must do be quite unfit to be husband of hetta carbury must tell tale against montague on head even when pressed to do so have told no tale not le be conviction strong that hetta ought to know truth to be induced by knowledge to reject younger lover then over conviction there came third equally strong told that girl loved younger man did not love that if loved girl be duty a man to prove love by doing what must to make happy a walked up down walk by moat with hand clasped behind back stopping now again to sit on terrace wall walking there mile after mile with mind intent on one idea schooled to feel that that only must be duty what did love mean if not that what must be devotion men so often affect to feel if did not tend to self sacrifice on behalf of beloved one man must incur danger for woman must subject to toil must even die for if be done simply with object of winning where be that real love of sacrifice of self on behalf of be truest proof so by degree resolved that thing must be done man though have be bad to friend be not all bad be one who might become good in good hand roger be too firm of purpose too honest of heart to buoy up into new hope by assurance of man unfitness what right have to think that must judge of better than girl so when many many mile have be walked succeeded in conquering own heart though in conquering crushed in bringing to resolve that energy of life must be devoted to task of making mr paul montague happy woman have seen how acted up to resolve when last in london withdrawing at rate sign of anger from paul montague behaving with utmost tenderness to hetta when have accomplished that task of conquering own heart of assuring thoroughly that hetta be to become rival wife be think more at ease le troubled in spirit than have be during month in there have still be doubt sort of happiness have once pictured to must certainly never be that must never marry be quite sure indeed be prepared to settle carbury on hetta eldest boy on condition that such boy must take old name must never have child whom must in truth call own if must induce people to live at carbury to live there for at least part of year so that there must be life in place thought that must awaken again again take interest in property a first step to must learn to regard a old man a one who have let life pas by too far for purpose of own home who must therefore devote to make happy home of others so thinking of so resolving have told much of story to friend bishop a consequence of revelation mr yeld have invited hetta down to palace roger felt that have still much to say to cousin before marriage must be said in country much better than in town wished to teach to regard suffolk a county to must be attached in be to find home day before came be over at palace with pretence of asking permission to come see cousin soon after arrival in truth with idea of talking about hetta to only friend to whom have looked for sympathy in trouble a to settling property on child said bishop be quite out of question lawyer must not allow to do where must be if after be to marry will never marry very likely not yet may how be man of age to speak with certainty of what will do what will not do in respect can make will doing a please with property will when made can be revoked think hardly understand just what feel said roger know very well that be unable to explain wish to act exactly a must do if be daughter a if son if have son must be natural heir if be daughter son must be natural heir a long a there be probability even chance that might have son of own man must never put power properly belongs to out of own hand if doe properly belong to must be better with than elsewhere think very highly of cousin have reason to think otherwise than well of gentleman whom intends to marry be only human nature to suppose that fact that property be still at own disposal must have effect in producing more complete observance of wish believe in least lord said roger somewhat angrily be because be so carried away by enthusiasm at present moment a to ignore ordinary rule of life there be not perhaps many father who have regans gonerils for daughter there be very many who may take lesson from folly of old king hadst little wit in thy bald crown ' fool said to 'when thou gavbet thy golden one away ' world take think that fool be right bishop did so far succeed that roger abandoned idea of settling property on paul montague child be not on account le resolute in determination to make own interest subordinate to of cousin when came over two day afterwards to see found in garden walked there with for couple of hour hope trouble be over now said smiling mean about felix said hetta mamma no indeed a to felix think that lady carbury have done best thing in power doubt have be advised by mr broune mr broune seems to be prudent man about mother hope that may now be comfortable be not alluding to felix mother be thinking of of hope that will never have trouble have have trouble mean to speak very freely to now dear be nearly upset what suppose people call broken hearted when be assured that certainly must never become wife ought not to have allowed to get into such frame of mind must have known be too old to have chance oh roger be not that well that other thing must have known sooner have got over misery quicker must have be more manly stronger after though love be wonderful incident in man life be not that only that be here for have duty plainly marked out for a must never allow to be withdrawn from by pleasure so must by sorrow be done now have conquered regret can say with safety look forward to presence paul presence at carbury a source of future happiness will make welcome a though be brother a though be daughter ask of be that will not be chary of presence there only answered by close pressure on arm be what wanted to say to will teach to regard a best closest friend a on whom have strongest right to depend of except husband there be teaching necessary for said a daughter lean on father must have lean on hetta will soon come to find that be very old grow old quickly already feel to be removed from everything be young foolish never be foolish young sometimes think now must promise will do that can to induce to make carbury residence have plan a yet at roger then will be certainly so much easier for to fall into plan of course will be married at carbury what will mamma say will come here be sure will enjoy regard a settled then after let be home so that must learn really to care about to love place will be home really know of day will have to be squire of carbury when be gone till have son old enough to fill exalted position with love to good will to must not bring to say that paul montague must be squire of carbury oh roger please talk like be necessary dear want to know what wish be if be possible must learn what be yours mind be quite made up a to future life of course wish to dictate to if did must not dictate to mr montague pray pray call mr montague well will not to paul then there go last of anger threw hand up a though be scattering indignation to air must not dictate either to to be right that must know that hold property a steward for who be to come after that satisfaction of stewardship will be infinitely increased if find that for whom act share interest will take in matter be only payment can make for trouble illustration there go last of anger felix roger brow became little black a answered to sister said very solemnly will not say word against brother on subject claim right to come to decision on own judgment be matter in have thought much may say suffered much have idea old fashioned idea on matter need not pause to explain to now if be a much together a hope will be will doubt come to understand disposition of family property even though be one so small a mine be to thinking matter man must not make in accordance with own caprice even with own affection owes duty to who live on land owes duty to country though may seem fantastic to say so think owes duty to who have be before who have manifestly wished that property must be continued in hand of descendant thing be to very holy in what be doing be in respect departing from theory of life do so under perfect conviction by course be taking will best perform duty to have alluded think hetta that need say more about that have spoken so seriously that though did not quite understand that have said did not venture to dispute will further did not endeavour to exact from promise having explained purpose kissed a must have kissed daughter then left rode home without going into house soon after paul montague came down to carbury same thing be said to though in much le solemn manner paul be received quite in old way having declared that must throw anger behind that paul must be again paul rigidly kept promise might be cost to own feeling a to love for hetta old hope disappointment have so nearly unmanned said not word to fortunate rival montague knew there be now necessity that allusion must be made to past misfortune roger indeed made solemn resolution to paul must never again speak of hetta a girl whom have loved though looked forward to time probably many year hence when might perhaps remind her of fidelity spoke much of land of tenant labourer of own farm of amount of income of necessity of so living that income might always be more than sufficient for want of household when spring came round hetta paul be married by bishop at parish church of carbury roger carbury gave away bride who saw ceremony declared that squire have not seemed
