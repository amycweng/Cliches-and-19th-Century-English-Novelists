mackenzie cared for harry handcock harry handcock be still bachelor when nature of late friend will be ascertained said word two to show that thought be not yet too old for matrimony margaret weariness must not now be cured in way must have taken while have nothing must have taken in early day have fortune filled lap with gold have seen harry handcock at least weekly for last ten year having seen without speech of love be not now prepared for renewal of such speaking when walter mackenzie died there be doubt through mackenzie circle a to what be destiny of money be well known that have be prudent man that be possessed of freehold estate gave at least six hundred year be known also that have money saved beyond be known too that margaret have nothing next to nothing of own old mackenzie have have fortune left to have felt to be grievance that son have not joined richer lot to poorer lot of course have be no fault of margaret have made feel justified in leaving daughter a burden upon younger son for last fifteen year have eaten bread to have positive claim if ever woman earned morsel required margaret mackenzie have earned morsel during untiring attendance upon brother now be left to own resource a went silently about house during sad hour intervened between death of brother burial be altogether in ignorance whether mean of subsistence have be left to be known that walter mackenzie have more than once altered will that have indeed made many will according a be at such moment on term of more le friendship with brother have never told to one be nature of bequest that have made thomas mackenzie have thought of brother sister a poor creature have be thought of by a being poor creature have become shopkeeper so declared must be admitted that margaret have shared feeling regarded brother tom trade a being disgraceful of arundel street have be idle reckless useless being so tom have often declared to wife only by fit start have there existed friendship between of firm of rubb mackenzie be not growing richer in day thomas wife have felt forced into certain amount of conciliatory demeanour by claim of seven surviving child walter however said word to one of money when be followed to grave by brother nephew by harry handcock one knew of what nature must be provision made for sister be great sufferer harry handcock have said at only interview took place between margaret after death of brother before reading of will yes indeed poor fellow said margaret sitting in darkened dining room in gloom of new mourning margaret have have sorry time of still called margaret from old acquaintance have always done so have have blessing of good health said have be very thankful have be dull life though for last ten year woman generally lead dull life think then have paused for while a though something be on mind wished to consider before spoke again mr handcock at time be bald very stout be strong healthy man have about to outward eye none of aptitude of lover be fond of eating drinking a one knew better than margaret mackenzie have altogether dropped poetry of life if at time of such poetry have belonged to be in fact ten year older than margaret mackenzie now looked to be almost twenty year senior be woman who at thirty five have more of grace of womanhood than have belonged to at twenty be man who at forty five have lost youth doe for man still think that must have fallen back upon former love found that to be sufficient have asked to do so even now must have felt bound by faith to do so have said that such be wish before reading of brother will did such thing hope will have made comfortable said hope will have left above want margaret have replied have then be have perhaps half expected something more from remembering that obstacle have separated be now removed nothing more came must hardly be true to say that be disappointed have strong desire to marry harry handcock whom one now called harry longer yet for sake of human nature bestowed sigh upon coldness when carried tenderness further than wish that might be comfortable there have of necessity be much of secrecy in life of margaret mackenzie have possessed no friend to whom must express thought feeling with confidence doubt whether living being knew that there now existed up in small back bedroom in arundel street quire of manuscript in margaret have written thought feeling hundred of rhyme have never met eye own outspoken word of love contained in letter have never be sent be intended to be sent to destination indeed letter have be commenced with name finished with signature must be hardly true to say that have be intended for harry handcock even at warmest period of love have rather be trial of strength proof of what might do if fortune must ever be so kind to a to allow of loving one have ever guessed have dreamed of accusing margaret of romance one capable of testing character have known in latter day have now again dined in gower street sister in law mr tom have declared to be silent stupid old maid a silent stupid old maid mackenzie of rubb mackenzie be disposed to regard how must treat stupid old maid of aunt if must now turn out that wealth of family belonged to when walter will be read such be found to be case there be doubt room for doubt in matter will be dated two month before death left everything to margaret

of two hundred pound not word be there in whole will of brother family tom when went home with sad heart told wife that have come of certain word have spoken when last have visited sick man knew must be so said tom to wife ca be helped now of course knew must not keep temper quiet always told not to go near how wife answered course of story at present moment doe not require to tell that did answer with sufficient spirit one must say need doubt may be surmised that thing in gower street be not comfortable that evening tom mackenzie have communicated content of will to sister who have declined to be in room when be opened have left everything just everything tom have said if margaret made word of reply tom did not hear there will be over eight hundred year have left furniture tom continued have be very good said margaret hardly knowing how to express on occasion very good to said tom with little sarcasm in voice mean good to said margaret then told that harry handcock have be named a executor there be more about in will be there said margaret at moment not knowing much about executor have fancied that brother have in making such appointment expressed further wish about mr handcock brother explained to that executor be to have two hundred pound gold watch then be satisfied of course be very sad look out for tom said on account blame if did must wrong margaret answered for never once during year that lived together spoke to walter one word about money blame brother rejoined then more have be said between have asked even before funeral to go up to gower street stay with have declined mr tom mackenzie have not asked mr tom mackenzie have hoped then have hoped have inwardly resolved that half at least of dying brother money must have come to husband have thought that if once encumbered with old maid old maid might remain longer than be desirable must never get rid of have said to eldest daughter mary jane never mamma mary jane have replied mother daughter have thought that must be on whole safer in not pressing such invitation have not pressed old maid have remained in arundel street before tom left house after reading of will again invited sister to own home hour two have intervened since have told her of position in world be astonished at finding how composed self assured be in tone manner of answer tom think have better not said sarah will be somewhat disappointed need not mind that said tom think have better not will be very glad to see if will come to hope will come tom think will remain here till have made up mind what to do remained in arundel street for next three month brother saw frequently mr tom mackenzie never went to never went to mr tom mackenzie let be even so said mr tom will not say that ran after money hate such air so do mamma said mary jane tossing head always said that be nasty old maid on same day day on will be read mr handcock have also come to need not tell have said a pressed hand how rejoiced be for sake margaret then have returned pressure have thanked for friendship know have be made executor to will continued did simply to save from trouble need only promise will do anything everything that can wish then left saying nothing of suit on occasion two month after during two month have necessarily seen frequently mr handcock wrote to from office in somerset house renewing old proposal of marriage letter be short sensible pleading cause a well perhaps a word be capable of pleading at time be not successful a to money told that doubt regarded now a great addition to chance of happiness must put lot together a to love for referred to day in have desired to make wife without shilling of fortune have never changed said if heart be a constant a must make good now proposal have once be willing to accept income be not equal to hers be not inconsiderable therefore a regard mean must be very comfortable such be argument margaret little a knew of world be able to perceive that expected that must succeed with little however a might know of world be not prepared to sacrifice new freedom new power new wealth to mr harry handcock one word said to when first be free before be rich must have carried argumentative well worded letter written to two month after fact of freedom fact of wealth have sunk into mind be powerless on have looked at glass have perceived that year have improved whereas year have not improved harry handcock have gone back over old aspiration aspiration of whisper have ever be uttered have not le be strong within have told that must not gratify by union with mr handcock thought rather hoped that society might still open to portal not simply society of handcocks from somerset house that society of have read in novel during day of have dreamed at night might not yet be given to to know clever people nice people bright people people who be not heavy fat like mr handcock sick wearisome like poor brother walter vulgar quarrelsome like relative in gower street reminded that be niece of one baronet first cousin once removed of that have eight hundred year liberty to do with pleased reminded also that have higher taste in world than mr handcock therefore wrote to answer much longer than letter in explained to that more than ten year interval have elapsed since word of love have passed between have have have changed nature of regard after much hesitation be phrase used be right in decision whether be doomed to be disappointed in aspiration to be partially disappointed partially gratified page be written to tell think may conclude that must hardly have made happy by marrying mr handcock while such aspiration be strong upon there be nothing on side in favour of such marriage faint remembrance of auld lang syne remained three month in arundel street before period be over made proposition to brother tom showing to what extent be willing to burden on behalf of family must allow asked to undertake education charge of second daughter susanna must not offer to adopt niece said because be on card that might marry must promise to take upon full expense of girl education charge of till such education must be completed if then future guardianship on part must have become incompatible with own circumstance must give susanna five hundred pound there be air of business about quite startled tom mackenzie who a have before be said have taught in old day to regard sister a poor creature there be specially air of business about allusion to own future state tom be not at surprised that sister must think of marrying be much surprised that must dare to declare thought of course will marry first fool that asks said mr tom father of large family however pronounced offer to be too good to be refused if doe will keep word about five

doubt a to soundness of mortgage assurance company with whom firm have dealing be quite ready to advance money on proposed security at proposed rate of interest in such matter a rubb mackenzie did not wish to deal with assurance company desired that control over premise must either be in own hand in hand of someone connected with by time mr samuel rubb have done miss mackenzie found to have dismounted altogether from horse to be pervaded by slight fear that lawyer might allow so favourable opportunity for investing money to slip through hand then on sudden mr rubb dropped subject of loan miss mackenzie a did so felt to be almost disappointed when found talking easily to about matter of external life although answered readily talked to also easily entertained feeling that ought to be offended mr rubb junior be tradesman who have come to on business having done business why did not go away nevertheless miss mackenzie answered when asked question allowed to be seduced into

laughed for long time past very little laughter have come to share when be gone prepared to think about at length why have talked to in way why be going to call again why be rubb junior from rubb mackenzie such pleasant fellow after retailed oilcloth at so much yard little a knew of world knew that with ever so much good blood in vein with ever so many hundred year of own be entitled to look for acquaintance of higher order than if be entitled to make boast about herself be by mean inclined to such boasting might at rate boast that be lady now mr rubb be not gentleman be not gentleman by position knew well enough thought that have also discovered that be not quite gentleman in manner mode of speech nevertheless have liked have laughed with remembrance of made sad that same evening

of very social place indeed in page have be described with accuracy advancement have made in direction have indeed returned miss todd call have not found that lady at home in doing have almost felt to be guilty of treason against new allegiance seemed to have taken upon in accepting mr stumfold invitation have done at last not from firm resolve of might have be proud have be driven to by ennui by easy temptation of miss todd neighbouring door have therefore slipped out finding wicked friend to be not at home have hurried back again have however committed to card knew that mr stumfold must hear of through miss baker miss baker visit have not returned being in doubt where miss baker lived being terribly in doubt also whether median rule of fashion demanded of that must return call of lady who have simply come to with caller hesitation on subject have be much vacillation many have thought safer to abstain for last day two have be expecting return of mr rubb junior keeping prisoner fear during best hour of day so that might be there to receive when did come though have so acted have quite resolved to be very cold with very cautious have be desirous of seeing solely with view to mercantile necessity of position behoved certainly to attend to business when business came in way therefore must take care to be at home when mr rubb must call have be to church twice day on of sunday that have passed in littlebath having in matter strictly obeyed hint mr stumfold have given for guidance doubt have received benefit from discourse have heard from gentleman morning let hope benefit also from much longer discourse have heard from mr stumfold curate on evening rev mr maguire be very powerful be also very long miss mackenzie who be hardly a yet entitled to rank among thoroughly converted be inclined to think that be too long be however patient by nature willing to bear much if only little might come to in return what of social comfort have expected to obtain from churchgoings can not quite define think that have unconsciously expected something from in direction that have be disappointed now at nine o'clock on appointed evening be of certainty in very truth going into society card said half past eight sun have not yoked horse so far away from tyre remote a tyre have be a to have left in ignorance that half past eight meant nine when watch showed that half past eight have really come be fidgety rang bell to inquire whether man might have probably forgotten to send fly yet have be very careful to tell man that did not wish to be at mr stumfold before nine understands miss said servant be afeard be doing of night then became painfully conscious that even maid servant knew more of social way of place than did when reached top of mr stumfold stair heart be in mouth for perceived immediately that have kept people waiting after have trusted to false intelligence in matter of hour half past eight have meant half past eight ought to have known that must be so in house so upright a of mr stumfold that lady met at door smiling blandly perhaps might be permitted to say not so blandly a might have smiled conducted stranger to seat generally open with little prayer for purpose dear friend be kind enough to come to punctually then mr stumfold got up pressed hand very kindly be so sorry miss mackenzie have uttered not in least replied knew must know therefore ventured to wait few minute time have be lost a mr maguire have treated to theological argument of great weight then company laughed miss mackenzie perceived that mr stumfold must joke in way be introduced to mr maguire who also pressed hand then miss baker came sat by side there be however at moment time for conversation prayer be begun immediately mr stumfold taking duty then mr maguire read chapter in bible after mr stumfold explained two lady asked mr stumfold question with great pertinacity question mr stumfold answered very freely walking about room while laughing often a submitted to interrogation miss mackenzie be much astonished at special freedom of manner how spoke of st paul a paul declaring saint to have be good fellow how said liked luke better than matthew how named even holier name than with infinite ease accustomed familiarity seemed to delight other lady at first shocked in ignorance be not going to have anything more to say to peter paul at present declared at last 'd keep here night tea will be spoilt then laughed again at absurd idea of great good man preferring food food of world to other food be special business to dispense there be nothing stumfoldian lady of littlebath liked so much a little joke bordered on profanity of outer world made feel to be almost a funny a sinner gave slight taste a be of pleasure of iniquity wine maketh glad heart of woman mr jones mr stumfold must say a filled for second time glass of old lady of set old lady must chirrup wink feel that thing be going almost a jollily with a did with wicked mr smith who spent night of life playing card a have done with horrid mr brown of whom such terrible thing be occasionally whispered when two three lady found sufficiently private to whisper that thing be going almost a pleasant here in world although accompanied by so much safety a to future in own case so much danger in other case think be aptitude for feminine rakishness more than of great virtue more even than indomitable industry made mr stumfold most popular man in littlebath dozen lady on present occasion skipped away to tea table in back drawing room with delighted alacrity be owing to unceremonious treatment st peter st paul have received from pastor miss mackenzie have just found time to cast eye round room examine scene of mr stumfold pleasantry while mr maguire be reading saw that there be only three gentleman there besides two clergyman there be very old man who sat close wedged in between mr stumfold lady by whose joint dress be almost obliterated be mr peter retired attorney be mr stumfold father from coffer have come superfluity of comfort miss mackenzie saw around rumour even among saintly people of littlebath said that mr peter have be sharp practitioner in early day that have be successful in labour be admitted by doubt have repented miss baker said one day to miss todd if have not have forgotten about generally mean same thing

stumfold higher still in grace of mr stumfold be almost worshipped by one two other lady whose power of external adoration be not diminished by possession of husband be of young men who have settled for time at littlebath that might be near mr stumfold have sufficient of worldly wealth to enable to pas time in semi clerical pursuit mr frigidy elder intended at time to go into church have not a yet made sufficient progress in study to justify in hoping that must pas bishop examination friend told of islington st bee of durham birkenhead other place where thing must be done for hesitated fearing whether might be able to pas even initiatory gate of islington be good young man at peace with world except mr startup with mr startup veracious chronicler doe not dare to assert mr frigidy be at peace now mr startup be other young man whom miss mackenzie saw in room mr startup be also very good young man be of fiery calibre whereas frigidy be naturally mild startup be already open air

reverend attached to name startup though be younger than frigidy must talk to seven lady at once with ease frigidy must not talk to one without much assistance from lady consequence of be that mr frigidy must not bring to love mr startup must not enable to justify veracious chronicler in saying that be at peace with world startup included lady be too many for miss mackenzie to notice specially a sat listening to mr maguire impressive voice mr maguire did notice found to be possessor of good figure of fine head of jet black hair of perfect set of white teeth of whisker be also black very fine streaked here there with grey hair of most terrible squint in right eye ever disfigured face that in other respect be fitted for apollo so egregious be squint miss mackenzie must not keep from regarding even while mr stumfold be expounding have looked mr maguire full in face at beginning think must so much have mattered to have seen first back of head then profile have unfortunately formed strong opinion a to almost perfect beauty when therefore defective eye be disclosed to feeling be moved in more than ordinary manner how be that man graced with head with mouth chin forehead nay with left eye must be cursed with right eye be still thinking of when frisky movement into tea room took place around when at moment mr stumfold offered arm to conduct through folding door condescension on part almost confounded other lady knew that always did so to newcomer therefore thought le of other gentleman took other lady be led up to special seat seat of honour a be at left hand side of huge silver kettle immediately before kettle sat mr stumfold immediately before kettle at table sat miss peter sister of mr stumfold back drawing room in be congregated be larger than other opened behind into pretty garden mr stumfold line in falling thus among peter have fallen to in pleasant place on other side of miss mackenzie sat miss baker on other side of mr stumfold stood mr startup talking aloud administering full tea cup with conscious grace mr stumfold mr frigidy be at other table mr maguire be occupied in passing promiscuously from one to other miss mackenzie wished with heart that

very good so be mr stumfold be very good a for mr stumfold look upon a very wonderful woman quite wonderful woman for grasp of intellect for depth of thought for tenderness of sentiment perhaps might have expected there be for tenderness of sentiment for strength of faith for purity of life for genial hospitality domestic duty mr stumfold have equal in littlebath perhaps few superior elsewhere

by personal contempt towards mr rubb rubbs of world in general be resolved that must not ask to take more sherry biscuit poor miss mackenzie fear that who read chronicle of life will already have allowed to think worse of than deserved many of know will think far worse of than must think of what fault even if analyse fault have be guilty where have be weak who among be not in weak also of what

way mr rubb be very good looking mr maguire be afflicted by terrible squint mr rubb mode of speaking be pleasant to whereas be by mean sure that liked mr maguire speech mr maguire be by profession gentleman a discreet young man who be desirous of rising in world will eschew skittle in preference go out to tea at aunt house much more delectable a skittle be to own heart so did miss mackenzie resolve that must become to select messrs stumfold maguire a male friend to treat mr rubb simply a man of business be denying skittle beer putting up with tea old aunt because preferred propriety of life to pleasure be right that must be blamed for such self denial now skittle beer have come after a delight will sometimes pursue prudent youth who must fain avoid mr rubb be there in drawing room looking extremely well shaking hand with very comfortably soon abandoning conversation on matter of business to have determined to confine be angry with thinking to be very free easy nevertheless must not keep from talking to ca do better than five per cent have said to not with first class security such a be have be well enough five per cent first class security be knew matter of business though mr rubb have winked eye at a spoke of leaning forward in chair looking at not at all a man of business quite in friendly way yet have felt that be so far safe nodded head also merely intending to understand thereby that herself understood something about business when suddenly changed subject asked how liked mr stumfold set drew up suddenly placed at once upon guard have heard great deal about mr stumfold continued mr rubb not appearing to observe lady altered manner not only here where have be for last few day up in london also be quite public character know clergyman in town who have large congregation always must so be suppose well yes more le mr stumfold be decidedly more not le people say be going in for bishopric have not heard said miss mackenzie who did not quite understand what be meant by going in for bishopric oh yes very likely man must have be year two ago say prime minister have changed tap lately changed tap said miss mackenzie used to draw bishop very bitter now draw mild creamy dare say stumfold did best did quite get hay in while sun shone seems to to be very comfortable where be said miss mackenzie dare say must be rather bore for having to live in house with old peter how peter scraped money together nobody ever knew yet be aware miss mackenzie old a be keep in own hand that house everything be in belongs to know that dare say miss mackenzie who must not keep from being little interested in matter said that have not known oh dear yes carriage too have doubt stumfold will be all right when old fellow dy such men a stumfold often make mistake about money a long a old peter last must think can be quite serene say that be always cutting up rough with old man seemed to to behave very well to said miss mackenzie remembering carriage of tea cup dare say be so before company of course be right be much better that dirty linen must be washed in private stumfold be clever man there be doubt about if have be much to house have probably met curate mr maguire have only be there once did meet mr maguire man squint fearfully say be looking out for wife too only must not have father living a mr stumfold have be astonishing how parson pick up good thing be going in way of money miss mackenzie a heard must not remember that might be regarded a good thing going in way of money became painfully aware that face betrayed consciousness will have to keep sharp look out continued mr rubb giving kind caution a though be old familiar friend think there be fear of kind said miss mackenzie blushing know about fear must say that there be great probability of course be only joking about mr maguire like rest of of course wish to feather own nest why must may be sure of miss mackenzie lady with fortune if may be allowed to say so with personal attraction will not want for admirer miss mackenzie be very strongly of opinion that mr rubb might not be allowed to say so thought that be behaving with unwarrantable degree of freedom in saying anything of kind did not know how to tell either by word look that such be case perhaps though impertinence be almost unendurable idea conveyed be not altogether so grievous have certainly never hitherto occurred to that might become second mr stumfold after why not what wanted be simply that something of interest must be added to life why must not also work in vineyard in open quasiclerical vineyard of lord people also in private vineyard of one of people pastor mr rubb be very impertinent might perhaps be worth while to think of what said a regarded mr maguire gentleman whose name have be specially mentioned be quite true that did squint awfully mr rubb said if please 'd rather not talk about such thing a nevertheless what say be true miss mackenzie hope take amiss that venture to feel interest about oh said not that suppose do feel special interest about indeed do be natural if will remember that only brother be oldest friend have in world how can be otherwise of course be much older than very much older than miss mackenzie just twelve year said very stiffly thought have be more in case be nearly of age a be so how can fail to feel interest about have mother sister wife of own sister indeed have be married at singapore have not seen for seventeen year indeed not for seventeen year heart doe crave for female friend miss mackenzie ought to get wife mr rubb be what brother always say beamuel ' said to just before left town be settled with now father have a good a given up to share of business ought to get married now miss mackenzie must take sort of thing from man brother be very odd that must say exactly same thing too hope have not offended offended indeed be not such fool a 'd sooner know that took interest in than woman living must indeed dare say think much of when remember that name of rubb mackenzie have be joined together for more than twenty year seems natural to that must be friend miss mackenzie in few moment be allowed to for reflection before be obliged to answer again admitted to herself that spoke truth if there be fault in matter fault be with brother tom who have joined name of mackenzie with name of rubb in first instance where be young man to look for female friend if not to partner family seeing that have wife mother of own indeed sister except one out at singapore who be hardly available for of purpose of family affection yet be hard upon be through negligence on part that poor mr rubb be so ill provided perhaps might have be so if have continued to live in london said miss mackenzie a live at littlebath then paused not knowing how to finish sentence what difference doe make distance be nothing if come to think of hall door be just two hour quarter from place of business in new road be one pound five nine if go by first class cab sixteen ten if put up with second class omnibus there be other way of counting mile mean nothing now day mean much certainly mean nothing why miss mackenzie must think trouble at to run down consult about anything occurred about matter of business weighed at heavily if nothing prevented except distance thirty shilling more than doe with return ticket including bit of lunch at station oh a for know what mean miss mackenzie will never forget how kind be to offer refreshment when be here before mr rubb hope wo think of doing such thing what good must do know nothing about business really to tell truth must be most unwilling to interfere be know to say anything about anything of kind only meant to point out that distance be nothing a to what be advising about getting married did mean to advise mr rubb thought said so of course did not intend to discus matter seriously be most serious subject to miss mackenzie doubt be ca know anything about men in business generally do find think that get on better when be married yes do be meant to say mr rubb after sat silent for few minute be inclined to think that be weighing in mind expediency of asking to become mr rubb on spur of moment if so mind finally gave judgment against attempt in giving such judgment mind be right must certainly have so startled by precipitancy of such proposition a to have greatly endangered probability of further intimacy with a be changed conversation began to ask question a to welfare of partner daughter at period of day susanna be at school be informed that must not be home till evening then plucked up courage begged to be allowed to come again just to look in at eight o'clock so that might see susanna must not go back to london comfortably unless must give tidings of susanna to family in gower street what be to do of course be obliged to ask to drink tea with must be so pleasant said miss mackenzie owned to herself that gratification expressed in face a spoke be very becoming when susanna came home did not seem to know much of mr rubb junior to care much about old mr rubb lived knew near place of business in new road sometimes came to gower street nobody liked did remember that have ever seen mr rubb junior at mother house once when came to dinner when be told that mr rubb be very anxious to see chucked up head said that man be goose came in very few minute have talked over susanna brought little present work box have bought for at littlebath though work box did not altogether avail paved way for civil word be more efficacious on occasion talked more to partner daughter than to partner sister promised to tell mamma how well be looking that air of littlebath have brought rose to cheek think be healthy place said miss mackenzie be quite sure be said mr rubb like mr crammer school susanna must have preferred to have be called miss mackenzie be not disposed to quarrel with on point yes like very well said other girl be very nice if one must go to school suppose be a good a other school susanna think that going to school at be rather nuisance said miss mackenzie 'd think so too aunt if have to practise day for hour in same room with four other piano be belief that will hate sound of piano longest day that will live suppose be same with young lady said mr rubb be same with at mr crammer there be one there doe not hate must like not to be able to play said aunt mamma doe play play see what be use of wo make anybody like music to hear four piano going at same time of out of tune must not tell in gower street mr rubb that susanna talk like said miss mackenzie yes may mr rubb must tell at same time be quite happy aunt margaret be dearest woman in world will be sure to tell said mr rubb then went away pressing miss mackenzie hand warmly a took leave a soon a be gone character be of course discussed be quite different man aunt from what thought be not at like old mr rubb old mr rubb when come to drink tea in gower street put handkerchief over knee to catch crumb there be great harm in susanna suppose there be harm in be not wicked be not wicked to eat gravy with knife doe old mr rubb do always used to laugh at because be so clever at never spill knife seems to be quite a good a spoon mr rubb doe do thing of sort be younger dear being younger doe make people more ladylike of did not know that mr rubb be exactly ladylike be taking up unfairly be aunt know what meant only fancy that man must go out buy work box be more than old mr rubb ever did for of since first day knew then did think that young mr rubb be handsome man aunt be very well dear oh think be downright handsome do indeed miss dumpus be mr crammer sister told other day be wrong to talk about man being handsome must be nonsense aunt see that at dear if told so ought to believe that be not nonsense come aunt mean to tell that must believe miss dumpus say miss dumpus say that girl must never laugh above breath when be more than fourteen year old how can make change in laughing just when come to be fourteen why must say man handsome if be handsome 'd better go to bed susanna wo make mr rubb ugly wish have asked to come dine here on sunday so that might have seen whether eats gravy with knife looked very hard to see whether 'd catch crumb in handkerchief then susanna went to bed miss mackenzie be left alone to think over perfection imperfection of mr samuel rubb junior from time up to christmas saw more of mr rubb heard from twice letter however have reference solely to business be not of nature to produce either anger admiration have also heard more than once from lawyer question have arisen a to be called upon to trust to own judgment for decision messrs rubb mackenzie have wanted money at once whereas paper for mortgage be not ready must miss mackenzie allow messrs rubb mackenzie to have money under circumstance to inquiry from lawyer made rejoinder asking for advice lawyer told that must not recommend in ordinary way of business to make advance of money without positive security a be matter between friend near relative might perhaps be willing to do added that a far a own opinion went did not think that there must be great risk then depended on did want to oblige friend near relative in answer to question told that certainly did wish to do so declared also to herself that be willing to advance money to brother even though there might be risk upshot of be that messrs rubb mackenzie got money time in october that mortgage be not completed when christmas came be on matter mr rubb junior have written to miss mackenzie letter have be of nature to give feeling of perfect security in transaction with brother have have further correspondence did not surprise a brother be man much le facile in

habit of going to mr stumfold tea party fortnight be now regarded a regular stumfoldian by who interested in such matter have begun system of district visiting bible reading with miss baker have at first be very agreeable to mr stumfold have on one occasion called upon taken to task a miss mackenzie have thought rather abruptly with reference to lack of energy indiscreet omission of have be judged to be guilty by highly gifted lady against miss mackenzie have rebelled mildly since thing have not gone quite so pleasantly with have still be honoured with mr stumfold card of invitation have still gone to tea party on miss baker strenuously urged advice mr stumfold have frowned miss mackenzie have felt frown mr stumfold have frowned retired coachbuilder wife have at once snubbed culprit mr maguire have openly expressed to be uneasy dearest miss mackenzie have said with charitable zeal if there have be anything wrong just beg pardon will find that everything have be forgotten at once more forgiving woman than mr stumfold never lived suppose have done nothing to be forgiven urged miss mackenzie mr maguire looked at shook head exact meaning of look must not understand a peculiarity of eye created confusion when repeated twice to same word heart of man be exceeding treacherous understood that meant to condemn so be mr maguire be reason why mr stumfold must scold then got up left did not speak to again that evening called on next day be very affectionate in manner in mr stumfold mode of treating have found no difference with miss todd whom met constantly in street who always nodded to very kindly have have one very remarkable interview think have better give up dear miss todd have said to have be in miss baker drawing room give what up miss mackenzie have asked idea of knowing other be sure never can come to anything though for part must have be so glad see ca serve god mammon be settled beyond doubt that be mammon be mary miss baker to whom appeal be made answered

stop at cedar altogether what be to do then just have girl returned upon hand with idea of life confused deranged hate such way have promised to provide for susanna whenever may not continue to give home must such promise be worth if john ball got hold of money be what be after a sure a name be martha what be after too very likely be there once before went to littlebath at want to get uncle money back want to be baronet wife same view of matter be perhaps taken by mr rubb junior when be told that miss mackenzie be to pas through london on way to cedar though did not express fear openly a mr mackenzie have done why ask sister to stay in gower street said to partner must come might at rate ask what good must do well know that must do good must do harm of course be natural that must wish to have friend about will only be natural too that must marry one may marry whom plea for will marry whom plea suppose want to see money go to ball must care straw where money went said thomas mackenzie if must only know that sum have have from be properly arranged to tell truth rubb be ashamed to look sister in face be nonsense money be a right a bank if in such matter a brother sister ca take liberty with other who deuce can in matter of money nobody must ever take liberty with anybody said mr mackenzie knew however that great liberty have be taken with sister money that firm have longer power of providing with security have be promised to mr mackenzie must take step at partner instance towards arresting sister in london mr rubb be more successful with mr mackenzie with whom during last month two have contrived to establish greater intimacy than have ever previously existed between two family have be of late good deal in gower street mr mackenzie have found to be much pleasanter better educated man than have expected such be language in expressed praise of though be disposed to doubt whether be at qualified to judge of education of man have now talked over affair of margaret mackenzie with sister in law result of talking be that mr mackenzie wrote letter to littlebath pressing miss mackenzie to stay few day in gower street on way through london did a well a knew how to do still there be that in letter plainly told apt reader that there be reality in profession of affection made in miss mackenzie became well aware of fact a read sister word available hypocrisy be quality very difficult of attainment of hypocrisy epistolatory hypocrisy be perhaps most difficult man woman must have studied matter very thoroughly be possessed of great natural advantage in direction who can so fill letter with false expression of affection a to make reader believe to be true mr mackenzie be possessed of such skill believe to be affectionate sister in law wo believe to be anything of kind margaret so spoke of writer to herself when have finished letter nevertheless answered with kind language saying that must not stay in town a passed through to cedar that must pas one night in gower street when called to pick up susanna on return home be hard to say what pleasure promised in going to cedar why accepted that invitation have in truth liked people house have felt to be uncomfortable while be there think felt to be duty to force to go out among people who though be personally disagreeable to might be socially advantageous if sir john ball have not be baronet call to cedar must not have be so imperative on yet be not tufthunter toady be doing what do endeavouring to choose friend from best of who made overture to of friendship if other thing be equal be probable that baronet will be more of gentleman pleasanter fellow than manufacturer of oilcloth who be there that doe feel that be true that have tried baronet have not found very pleasant that might probably have be own fault have be shy stiff perhaps ill mannered have at least accused herself of fault therefore resolved to go again called with susanna a passed through london just saw sister in law wish must have stayed said mr mackenzie will for one night a return on th of january said miss mackenzie mr mackenzie must not understand what mr rubb have meant by saying that old maid be soft pleasant must understand susanna love for aunt suppose men will put up with anything for sake of money said to herself a for child truth be will love anybody who indulges aunt be so kind susanna said be always kind if wake up in middle of night be kind in moment if there be anything good to eat will make eye quite shine if see that anybody else like have known sit for hour ever so uncomfortable because must not disturb cat then must be fool dear said mr mackenzie be fool mamma be quite sure of said susanna miss mackenzie went on to cedar mind almost misgave in going there a be driven up

to be renewed on wall have however be drawn from neighbouring station to house in private carriage belonging to establishment if there be sense of justice in must be presumed that balanced good thing with bad mind misgave not because house be outwardly dreary in fear of inward dreariness of people in fear rather of dreariness pride combined old lady ball though naturally ill natured be not ill mannered did give special air knew that be baronet wife that kept carriage that be obligation upon to make up for poverty of house by little haughtiness of demeanour there be woman high in rank poor in pocket so gifted with peculiar grace of aristocracy that show by word spoken by turn of head by step taken that be among high one of earth money have nothing to do with old lady ball be not so

have be aunt yes yes can understand that must not tell at once that must take wo mind telling must have told so in instant if have made up mind do think must wish to keep in suspense on matter if must have felt must love a wife must have told so instantly instantly why not love a wife why not lady ball a asked question be almost imperious in eagerness why not aunt be not easy to answer question a that woman suppose ca say why doe love man yet why doe see be so sudden have thought of in way have known now for nearly year have be in house with for last three week if have seen that have be attached to be only person in house have be so blind have seen at aunt perhaps be afraid of responsibility said lady ball must fear certainly that alone must not deter must endeavour to do best like living in same house with sir john indeed yes be always good to a to uncle know doe not mean to be unkind must not fear that truth be suppose margaret that like to part with money be unjust aunt think care more for money than woman then what be can give position in world higher than must have have hope to posse a lady ball will be equal in respect to own far away cousin lady mackenzie have nothing to do with aunt then what be asked lady ball again suppose have absolute objection to be baronet wife suppose aunt that love pshaw said old woman be pshaw said miss mackenzie woman ought to marry man unless feel that love pshaw said lady ball again have be standing a everybody else be gone miss mackenzie have determined that must go off to bed without settling in room so prepared for departure will say good night now aunt have still of packing to do must be up early be in hurry margaret want to speak to before leave will have other opportunity sit down wo then miss mackenzie seated most unwillingly know that there be anyone nearer to than be dear at rate woman therefore can say more than other person when talk of not loving john doe that mean doe mean that be engaged to anyone else doe not doe not mean that there be anyone else whom be thinking of marrying be not thinking of marrying anyone that love other man be cross questioning aunt more than be fair then there be one there be nobody what say about john say through feeling for anybody else then dear think that little talk between may make matter right be sure doubt john when say that love very dearly a for loving of course must come be not a if two be two young people that wanted to be billing cooing of course ought to be fond of other like other company have doubt that will must of course be thrown very much together be sure be very fond of indeed margaret have endeavoured to show that be have be very kind aunt therefore a to loving really think there need be doubt about then dear a to other part of arrangement money that if be to have child own fortune must be settled on at least must be arranged if required though a fortune came from ball be very money with title be intended to be maintained probably must not be very exacting about stop moment dear let finish before speak want particularly to think of what say to remember that money did come from ball have be very hard upon john must feel that look at with heavy family how work for uncle jonathan died left money to brother before john be married be twenty five year ago well remember dear john be just engaged to rachel marriage be put off because of great cruelty of jonathan will of course be not blaming be only ten year old uncle jonathan did not leave penny money came to from brother a far a can understand be nearly double a much a got from sir john brother may be must have doubled quite a readily a walter mackenzie what mean to say be that a have money in course of nature must have come to john must have be now if great injustice have not be done be done by ball not by mackenzie doe not alter case in least feeling must be just same in spite of of course money be yours can do what like with can give to young mr samuel rubb if please stupid old woman think must feel that must repair injury be done a be in power to do so fine position be offered when poor sir john go will become lady ball be mistress of house have own carriage terribly stupid old woman must have friend relative always round instead of being alone at place a littlebath must must say be very sad of course there must be duty to perform to dear child think so ill of margaret a to suppose for instant that must shrink from stop one moment dear will have done think have said now can well understand when john spoke to must not immediately give favourable answer be much better to leave till to morrow ca have objection to speaking out to really think might make happy by saying that will be a wish be astonishing harm that old woman may do when go well to work when belief can prevail by mean of own peculiar eloquence lady ball have so trusted to own prestige to own ladyship to own carriage horse to rest of have also so misjudged margaret ordinary mild manner that have thought to force niece into immediate acquiescence by mere word result however be exactly contrary to have miss mackenzie be left to herself after interview with mr ball have gone upstairs to sleep upon proposal without disturbance to vision of sacrificial duty plain statement have produced have be allowed to leave house think over without other argument to than have used think that must have accepted now be up in arm against whole thing mind clear a be be hardly lucid enough to allow of separating mother son at moment be claimed a wife into family because thought that have right to fortune temptation offered by hoped to draw into duty be beggarly title old coach vision of sacrificial duty be dispelled there be doubt before now there be doubt think will go to bed aunt said very calmly will write to john from littlebath can not put out of suspense if wish yes know must refuse wish have told so at once a then there must have be end of mean that have made up mind yes aunt do must be wrong to marry man love a for money aunt must say that think be mistaken how mistaken think that be called upon to put right wrong that think be done by sir john brother think that be under such obligation uncle jonathan left money to sister child instead of to brother child if money have come to john must not have admitted that have claim because be nephew niece whole thing must have be different well aunt be very tired if will let will go to bed oh certainly then with anything warm affection aunt niece parted miss mackenzie went to bed with firm resolution that must not become lady ball have be arranged for time back that mr ball be to accompany cousin up to london by train though under present circumstance arrangement be not without certain amount of

people wanted to be billing cooing lady ball have said to same evening miss mackenzie a thought of be not so sure that lady ball be right why must not want billing cooing a well a be natural that woman must want of in life have have none of yet have have lover certainly there have be no billing cooing with nothing of kind have be possible in brother walter house then question naturally arose to whether aunt have treated justly in bracketing with john ball in matter of age john ball be ten year senior ten year knew be very proper difference between man wife be by mean inclined to plead even to herself that be too young to marry cousin there be nothing in age to interfere if match be in other respect suitable still be not old for age be not young for hers if must ultimately resolve to devote what have left of youth to child welfare must not sacrifice be recognised have lady ball done well to speak of a certainly might well speak of be beyond aptitude for billing cooing if billing cooing might chance to come in way thinking of during long afternoon when susanna be at school got up looked at in mirror moved up hair from off ear knowing where must find few be grey shaking head a though owning to herself that be old a finger ran almost involuntarily across lock touch told that be soft silken looked into own eye saw that be bright hand touched outline of cheek knew that something of fresh bloom of youth be still there lip parted there be white teeth there came smile dimple slight purpose of laughter in eye then tear pulled scarf tighter across bosom feeling own form then leaned forward kissed in glass be very careworn soiled a be with world tired out with dusty weary life walk have be compelled to take of romance in there be nothing left while in aptitude for romance have only just be born be not only that head be bald that eye be dull step slow juice of life have be pressed out of thought be of care never of hope must be very sad to be wife of such man must be very sad if there be compensation might not sacrificial duty give atonement must require must fain do something with life money good great good to other person if good to person billing cooing might go together must be very pleasant knew there be danger in such idea billing cooing might lead altogether to evil there must be doubt that must do good service if married cousin money must go to good purpose care to child must be invaluable be cousin must not be sweet to make of sacrifice then reader remember that be saint that hitherto very little opportunity have be given to of learning to discriminate true metal from dross then thought of mr samuel rubb junior mr samuel rubb junior be handsome man about own age felt almost sure that mr samuel rubb junior admired be not worn out with life be not broken with care must look forward into world hope for thing to come one thing knew to be true be not gentleman then why must care for being gentleman be not everything a for herself might there not be strong reason to doubt whether who be best qualified to judge must call lady surviving brother kept oilcloth shop brother with whom have always lived have be so retired from world knew anything of way if love must be gained anything of romance if active living mode of life must thereby be opened to must not be well for to give up idea of being lady hitherto rank have simply enabled to become stumfoldian then remembered that mr maguire squint be very terrible how must live what must do with be matter to of painful thought looked in glass again resolved that must decline honour of becoming mr ball on following morning wrote letter be written thus paragon littlebath january dear john have be thinking great deal about what said to have made up mind ought not to become wife know that honour have proposed to be very great may seem to be ungrateful in declining can not bring to feel that sort of love for wife must have for husband hope will not make displeased with ought not to do so a feeling towards to child be most affectionate know aunt will be angry with pray tell from with best love have thought very much of said to feel sure that be doing right be not must be afraid of duty must fall upon a wife that woman who undertakes duty must feel for wife love think be best to speak openly hope that will not be offended give best love to uncle aunt to girl to jack who will hope keep promise of coming seeing very affectionate cousin margaret mackenzie there said john ball to mother when have read letter knew must be so be right why must give up money comfort ease to look after child lady ball took letter read pronounced to be nonsense may be nonsense said son such a be be answer suppose will have to go down to littlebath after said lady ball certainly will not do that must do good be not going to persecute persecute what nonsense men do talk a if woman in condition must be persecuted by being asked to become baronet wife suppose must go down beg that will not mother be just one of woman who be sure to stand off not knowing own mind best creature in world really very clever weak in respect have not have lover when be young think that man must come dallying about a though be eighteen only want little perseverance john if will take advice will go down to littlebath after john in matter must not follow mother advice declared that must take further step be inclined said to think that margaret be right why must woman burden with nine child then lady ball said great deal more about ball money giving a decided opinion that margaret owed money to ball a must not induce son to do anything wrote rejoinder to niece dearest margaret said letter have made john very unhappy have set heart upon making wife think will ever hold up head again if will not consent write now instead of john because be so much oppressed wish have remained here because then must have talked over quietly must not be better for to be here than living alone at littlebath for can not call little girl who be at school anything of companion must not leave a boarder come to for month must not be forced to pledge to anything further must talk over need hardly be said that miss mackenzie a read declared to herself that have desire to talk over own position with lady ball further john be afraid letter went on to say that offended by manner of proposition that said too much about child not enough about own affection of course love dearly if knew a do of course ca a yet though hope will must be aware that consideration of money about child must induce to propose to woman unless loved may take word for there be great deal more in letter of same kind in lady ball pressed own peculiar argument need hardly say that did not prevail with miss mackenzie if son must not induce cousin to marry mother certainly never must do so did not take long to answer aunt letter said that must with many thanks decline for present to return to cedar a charge have taken of niece made presence at littlebath necessary a to answer have given to john be afraid must only say that must stand have felt little angry with lady ball though tried not to show in tone of letter did show if be must never see speak to again said lady ball to son very likely never will replied have love making with old maid gone wrong john father asked john ball be used to father ill nature never answered nothing special to story occurred at littlebath during next two three month except miss mackenzie became more more intimate with miss baker more more anxious to form acquaintance with miss todd with stumfoldians be on term of mitigated friendship always went to mr stumfold fortnightly tea drinking with lady there always excepting miss baker did find that grew into familiarity with mr stumfold one be familiar be afflicted by weight of own position a suppose queen to be when say that majesty altitude be too high to admit of friendship mr stumfold never condescended except to bishop wife who in return have snubbed mr stumfold living a did in atmosphere of flattery toadying be wonderful how well preserved equanimity how must talk perhaps think of a poor erring human being when however insisted much upon fact of humanity coachmaker wife must shake head at last stamp foot in anger swearing that though everybody be of course dust grass worm though of course mr stumfold must by nature be included in everybody yet dust grass worm nowhere exhibited with so few of stain of humanity on a did within bosom of mr stumfold so though absolute fact of mr stumfold being dust grass worm must not in regard to consistency of thing be denied yet in dustiness grassiness worminess be so little dusty grassy wormy that be hardly fair even in to mention fact at know deceit of own heart mr stumfold must say of course do mr stumfold coachmaker wife replied be dreadful deceitful doubt where be heart ai there be difference in heart deceit be hard like most of know mr stumfold wrestle with get foot on neck of so that a one may say be always being killed got better of during month miss mackenzie learned to value at very low rate rank of stumfoldian circle into have be admitted argued matter with saying that coachbuilder wife others be not lady in general way be doubt bound to assume to be lady taught to think that such ladyhood be not of worth great deal must not be worth while of woman to abstain from having mr rubb like from being lawful mother of child in rubb mackenzie line of life for sake of such exceptional rank a be to be maintained by associating with stumfoldians a became used to thing person around indulged in considerable amount of social philosophy turning over idea in mind for who saw merely line of outer life must hardly have given credit after be good of being lady be there good in at must there possibly be good in making struggle to be lady be not rather one of thing be settled for one externally a be colour of one hair size of one bone must be taken left alone a providence may have directed one can not add cubit to one height yet make lady be nature of miss mackenzie argument with indeed carried argument further than that be well to be lady recognised perfectly delicacy worth of article miss baker be lady a to that there be doubt then might not also be very well not to be lady might not advantage of one position be compensated with equal advantage in other be grand thing to be queen queen have friend be fine to be princess princess have very limited choice of husband there be something about miss baker be very nice even miss baker be very melancholy miss mackenzie must see that melancholy have come from wasted niceness have not be so much lady might have be more woman there must be disgrace in not being lady if such ladyhood depended on external circumstance arranged for one by providence one blame one washerwoman for not being lady one wish one housekeeper to be lady people be dismayed rather than pleased when find that tailor wife want to be lady what doe woman get by being lady if fortune have made so fortune have done much for good thing come a natural concomitant of fortunate position be not because be lady that be liked by peer peeress choice gift have made lady have made also to be liked come from outside for struggle can usefully be made such be result of miss mackenzie philosophy one may see that self

dropped have always cared about gentleman once in life perhaps twice have cared about gentleman yes mr rubb be coming down again have written to say that be necessary that must again see miss mackenzie about money next morning after conversation have just be recorded miss mackenzie got letter about same money of will be necessary to say more in next chapter chapter x plenary absolution letter miss mackenzie received be from old mr slow lawyer be very unpleasant letter be so unpleasant that made ear tingle when read remembered that person to whom special allusion be made be one whom have taught to regard a friend mr slow letter be a follows little st dunstan court april dear madam think proper to write to specially about loan made by to messrs rubb mackenzie a sum lent be serious a there have be conduct on part of one regard a dishonest find that what have done in matter have be regulated rather by fact that mr mackenzie be brother sister than by ordinary course of such business perceive that have special warrant given to for by in letter of rd november last nevertheless be duty to explain to that messrs rubb mackenzie a believe to be case mr samuel rubb junior of firm have not dealt with fairly money be borrowed for purpose of buying certain premise believe be laid out in way be borrowed on special understanding a lender be to have title deed of property first mortgage upon be alleged when purchase be being made that money be wanted before mortgage must be effected desired to advance did aware of close family connection between one of firm of course on instruction must have done have there be such relationship in case must have made further inquiry probably have ventured to advise though money be so advanced without completion of mortgage be advanced on distinct understanding that security proffered in first instance be to be forthcoming without delay now learn that property be mortgaged to other party to full value that security for money be to be have have seen mr mackenzie mr rubb junior a regard brother believe to have be innocent of intention of deceit for deceit there certainly have be indeed doe not deny offer to give security on business such a stock in trade like may advise to take such must in truth be of avail to a security brother seemed to be much distressed by what have be done be grieved on behalf mr rubb younger mr rubb expressed in very different way at first declined to discus matter with when told that if be way must certainly expose altered tone little expressing regret that there must be delay a to security wishing to understand that be aware of fact there can be doubt that deceit have be used towards in getting money that mr rubb have laid open to proceeding if taken against must be absolutely ruinous to fear must be also ruinous to brother be painful duty to tell that money so advanced be on most precarious footing firm in addition to present liability be not worth money fear may say part of presume there be working profit a two family live upon business whether if be to come upon a creditor must get money out of asset can not say perhaps will not feel disposed to resort to measure have considered duty to tell fact though distinct authority to to advance money absolves from responsibility must regret that did not make further inquiry before allowed so large sum of money to pas out of hand be dear madam faithful servant jonathan slow mr rubb promised visit be to take place in eight ten day from date on letter be received miss mackenzie ear a have said tingled a read in first place gave terrible picture of precarious state of brother business what must do with wife child if thing be in such state a mr slow described yet month two ago be giving champagne iced pudding for dinner then what word discreet old gentleman mr slow have spoken about mr rubb what thing have hinted over above what have spoken be not manifest that conceived mr rubb to have be guilty of direct fraud miss mackenzie at once made up mind that money be gone in truth did not much annoy have declared to herself once before if anything be wrong about money must regard a present made to brother when so thinking of have undoubtedly felt that be not improbably lost to be something over hundred year to be deducted from computed income must still be able to live at paragon quite a well a have intended be able also to educate susanna indeed must do easily still save money therefore a regarded probable loss why need be unhappy before morning be over have succeeded in white washing mr rubb in own mind be think certainly fact that woman be le pervious to idea of honesty than men be be le shocked by dishonesty when find be le clear in intellect a to constitutes honesty where be woman who think wrong to smuggle what lady conscience ever pricked in omitted armorial bearing on silver fork from tax paper what wife ever ceased to respect husband because dealt dishonestly in business whereas let not go to church let drink too much wine let go astray in conversation wrath arises against fault lack of feminine accuracy in matter of honesty tends rather to charity in judgment of others than to deed of fraud on part of woman miss mackenzie who desired nothing be not own who scrupulously kept own hand from picking stealing gave peace after reading lawyer letter till be able to tell that mr rubb be to be forgiven for what have done after have doubt intended that must have promised security have not come to in london told whole truth if not whole truth a much of a be reasonable to expect that must be able to tell at evening party after dinner of course mr slow be hard upon lawyer always be hard if chose to give messrs rubb mackenzie two thousand five hundred pound out of pocket what be to so went on till at last be angry with mr slow for language have used be however before thing necessary that must put mr slow right a to fact of case have doubt condoned mr rubb have done mr rubb undoubtedly have sanction for keeping money without security therefore by return of post wrote following short letter rather astonished mr slow when received littlebath april dear sir be much obliged by letter about money truth be have known for time that there be to be mortgage when be in town saw mr rubb at brother house be understood between then that matter be to remain a be brother partner be very welcome to money believe to be yours sincerely margaret mackenzie letter be false letter suppose miss mackenzie did not know that be writing falsely letter be certainly false because when spoke of understanding between having just mentioned brother mr rubb intended lawyer to believe that understanding be between three whereas not word have be said about money in brother hearing be aware that partner have spoken of money mr slow be surprised annoyed a regarded comfort a lawyer client letter be of course satisfactory absolved not only from absolute responsibility also from feeling doubt have existed within own breast that have in sort neglected lady interest nevertheless be annoyed did not believe statement that rubb mackenzie have have permission to hold money without mortgage thought that of partner have so conceived when have seen have however be too many for too many also for poor female who have allowed to be duped out of money such be mr slow feeling on matter then dismissed subject from mind next day about noon miss mackenzie be startled almost out of propriety by sudden announcement at drawing room door of mr rubb before must bethink how must behave whether must become to say anything of mr slow letter to be in room miss mackenzie said hurriedly yet have paused for moment in hurry till servant have shut door may shake hand with there must miss mackenzie thought be objection to so ordinary ceremony therefore said certainly gave hand then be again said mr rubb having so said sat down miss mackenzie hoped that there be nothing matter with then also sat down at considerable distance there be nothing matter with said a be still so kind to tell have not received letter from lawyer yes have have done in power to blacken know tell miss mackenzie have not blackened have not laid thing to charge of be incapable have not accused of getting money from under false pretence than do 'd sooner have seen own brain blown out must indeed have written to about money mr rubb yes came to behaved shamefully to saw brother too have be making manner of ignominious inquiry lawyer can never understand that there can be anything of friendly feeling about money ca put friendly feeling into unconscionable bill believe world must go on better if there be such thing a attorney in wonder who invented why miss mackenzie must give information on point therefore went on must tell what have said what be want to do for sake if ask miss mackenzie will do anything will sell coat off back if wish will never lose one shilling by rubb mackenzie a long a have anything to do with firm be sure will excuse if say that can hing at bidding of old cormorant know that there be anything to be done mr rubb be not there well be very generous in to say so always be generous have always told brother since have honour of knowing that have sister to be proud of miss mackenzie will say more than have flattered that have have friend to be proud of now must tell why have come down to day know be to have be here next week well when mr slow came to found what be up said to myself at once that be right must know exactly exactly how matter stand be going to explain next week must leave in suspense when knew that lawyer be going to trouble have troubled mr rubb have though really be so good of again now truth be be pretty nearly just what told that day after dinner when agreed know to what have done here paused a though expecting answer yes did agree just at present while certain other party have right to hold title deed ca quite say how long may be can not execute mortgage in favour title deed represent property perhaps know that oh yes know a much a well then a have title deed ca execute mortgage perhaps will say ought to have title deed mr rubb want to say anything of kind if money can be of assistance to brother to brother be welcome to use of without mortgage will show copy of letter sent to mr slow thanks thousand thanks may see letter mr slow wrote think not know whether must be right to show to must think of doing anything about be resenting know only then must all be on square together think 'd better not mr slow when wrote probably did not mean must show to be right be always right will let see answer then miss mackenzie went to desk brought copy of note have written to lawyer read very carefully twice over then must see when refolded paper that eye be glittering with satisfaction miss mackenzie miss mackenzie said think that be angel did think so in so much at moment be at rate sincere saw that be pleased be pleased there need be further trouble about said a spoke rose from seat rose too came close to came close to hesitated for moment then putting one hand behind waist though barely touching took hand with other hand thought that be going to kiss lip for moment two thought so too courage failed else discretion prevailed whether be one other must depend on way in must have taken a be merely raised hand kissed that when must look into face eye be full of tear truth be said that have saved from ruin be real truth damn lying started at oath in instant have forgiven that too there be sound of reality about reconciled to indignity though have be true to faith a stumfoldian ought at least to have fainted at sound hardly know what be saying miss mackenzie beg pardon fact be must sell up if pleased did mean when first got brother to agree a to asking for loan did indeed thing be going wrong with just at moment went more wrong than ever then came temptation be able to make everything right by giving up title deed of premise be how be be that did be brother though may forgive wo be true how far truth must be taken towards palliating deed done must leave reader to decide reader will doubtless perceive that truth did not appear until mr rubb have ascertained that appearance must not injure think however that came from heart that must count for something in favour tear rubbed from eye with hand counted very much in favour with miss mackenzie have not only forgiven now almost loved for having given something to forgive with many woman doubt whether there be more effectual way of touching heart than ill using then confessing if wish to get sweetest fragrance from herb at foot tread on bruise have forgiven taken absolutely into favour have kissed hand having embraced a did so on present occasion did not get beyond lacked audacity to proceed at once from acknowledgment of fault to declaration of love hardly think that must have injured have done so must have struck while iron be hot be heated now nearly to melting be abashed by own position having something real in heart having remnant of generous feeling left about must not make such progress a might have done have be cool enough to calculate advantage let trouble more miss mackenzie said when have dropped hand doe trouble will trouble said with energy will not let there be end of will write to tom tell that be welcome to money be brother be welcome to if have be of service to be very happy that must be so now mr rubb if please wo have word about what be to say not word seemed a though must speak word for went to window stood there silently looking into street a did so there came visitor to miss mackenzie whose ringing at doorbell have not be noticed by miss baker be announced while mr rubb be still getting better of feeling of course turned round when heard lady name of course be introduced by hostess miss mackenzie be obliged to make apology for gentleman presence mr rubb be expected next week business brought down to day unexpectedly quite unexpectedly said mr rubb making violent endeavour to recover equanimity miss baker looked at mr rubb disliked at once must be remembered that be twenty year older than miss mackenzie that regarded stranger therefore with saner more philosophical judgment than friend must use with judgment on outward comeliness of man have undue influence must be remembered also that miss baker from early age by association of youth have be taught to know gentleman when saw miss mackenzie who be by nature cleverer woman of two watched friend face saw by glance that did not like mr rubb then within own bosom called friend old maid be having uncommonly fine weather for time of year said mr rubb very fine weather said miss baker have called dear to know whether will go in with next door drink tea evening what with miss todd asked miss mackenzie who be surprised at invitation yes with miss todd be not one of regular night know set wo be there have old friend with mr wilkinson clergyman wife seems that old enemy devoted slave mr maguire know mr wilkinson be going to be there mr maguire be slave of mine miss baker thought be at rate presence will be guarantee miss todd will be on best behaviour that need be afraid be not afraid of anything of sort will go oh yes if be going that right will call for a pas by must see now tell good morning sir whereupon miss baker bowed very stiffly to mr rubb good morning ma'be said mr rubb bowing very stiffly to miss baker when lady be gone mr rubb sat again down on sofa there remained for next half hour talked about business of firm saying how must now certainly be improved talked about tom mackenzie family saying what grand thing be for susanna to be thus taken in hand by aunt asked question two about miss baker then question two about mr maguire during question learned that mr maguire be not a yet married man from mr maguire got on to stumfolds learned somewhat of rite ceremony of stumfoldian faith in way prolonged visit till miss mackenzie began to feel that ought to take leave miss baker have gone at once to miss todd have told that lady that miss mackenzie must join tea party have also told how mr rubb of firm of rubb mackenzie be at moment in miss mackenzie drawing room will ask to come too said miss todd then miss baker have hesitated have looked grave what be matter said miss todd be not quite sure will like said miss baker probably not said miss todd like people meet be reason must ask be be be not exactly what be what

liverpool will find very hard to define difference dear said miss todd at rate will ask man to come be if wo offend wo in least offend said miss baker so note be at once written sent in to miss mackenzie in be asked to bring mr rubb with on evening when note reached miss mackenzie mr rubb be still with of course communicated to invitation wished that have not be sent wished that must not accept though on head have doubt have not sufficient presence of mind to keep matter to herself say nothing about of course be only too glad to drink tea with miss todd miss mackenzie attempted slight manoeuvre to induce mr rubb to go direct to miss todd house be not such as a that knew advantage kept insisting on privilege of coming there to miss mackenzie room escorting must have to escort miss baker also thing a thought be looking well with at last rose to go made good use of privilege of parting held miss mackenzie hand pressed must be angry said if tell that be best friend have in world have better friend than said older friend yes older friend none not one who have done for so much a have certainly none for whom have so great regard may god bless miss mackenzie may god bless too mr rubb what else must say when civility took so decorous shape must not bear to be le civil than have be le decorous yet seemed to that in bidding god bless with warm pressure of hand have allowed to escape from appearance of affection have not intended to exhibit thank thank said then at last went seated slowly in own chair near window chair in be accustomed to sit for many solitary hour asked what meant be allowing to fall in love with mr rubb if so be well that must be so must be bringing to sternest proof of reality philosophical theory on social life be very well for to hold bold opinion in discussion with miss baker a to man being man for ' even though might not be gentleman be prepared to go length of preferring such man to world be ready to go down among rubbs for now ever give up society of such woman a miss baker knew that be necessary that must come to resolve on matter a mr rubb purpose be becoming too clear to when unmarried gentleman of forty tell unmarried lady of thirty six that be dearest friend have in world must surely intend that will of remain unmarried longer then thought also of cousin john ball vague shadow of thought passed across mind also in respect of rev mr maguire chapter xi miss todd entertains friend at tea believe that desire to get married be natural state of woman at age of say from twenty five to thirty five think also that be good for world in general that must be so be now speaking not of female population at large of woman whose position in world doe not subject to necessity of earning bread by labour of hand there be know feeling abroad among woman that desire be one of be expedient that must become ashamed that will be well for to alter nature in respect learn to take delight in single state many of most worthy

not by mean bring to own yet be there strong within bosom man situated in outer matter a be situated possessed of good mean hampered by outer demand must have declared to clearly that must be well for to marry must probably be content to wait while must unless in love feel delay to be luxury miss mackenzie must not confess a much even to herself must not let know that thought a much yet desired to be married dreaded delay desired to be married although be troubled by half formed idea that must be wicked who be that must be allowed to be in love be not old maid by prescription a be by force of

gentleman who be frequently in thought whether doe not want one to love be natural that must presume that mean to be particular be natural also that must be in sort gratified by particularity miss mackenzie be think gratified did not express such feeling be not that idea also said one to love be not that great desideratum here below tone in repeated last word be by mean ineffective hope

mr maguire allowed to go on stumfold think mind be of joyous disposition that thing work to good for even when be most obdurate in sternness to law mr maguire did not think be ever stern to be very hard even then think mind much miss mackenzie that kind of companion must not do for at think woman must be soft soothing like dove did not stop to think whether dove be soothing felt that language be pretty just at moment be summoned by miss baker looking up perceived that mr mr fuzzybell be already leaving room know why need disturb miss mackenzie said miss todd have only got to go next door seems very happy just now must sooner go with miss baker said miss mackenzie mr maguire must see home suggested miss todd miss mackenzie of course went with miss baker mr rubb accompanied good night

amount of affectionate farewell mr maguire be there a well a mr rubb gentleman warmly pressed hand of lady be leaving mr rubb be not quite satisfied with evening work because have not be able to get near to miss mackenzie nevertheless be greatly gratified by general manner in have be received be much pleased with littlebath inhabitant mr maguire a walked home by assured that might a well now put question have be thinking about for last two month have made up mind that matrimony must be good for miss mackenzie a went to bed told that might have husband if pleased then must be mr rubb manner be very much against of mr maguire eye have caught gleam a turned from on doorstep made think of alliance with dismay chapter xii mr stumfold interferes on morning following miss todd tea party mr rubb called on miss mackenzie bade adieu be said going up to london at once having received letter made presence there imperative miss mackenzie must of course do more than simply say good bye to when have said so did not even then go at once be standing with hat in hand have bade farewell still did not go have something to say stood there trembling half fearing what nature of something might be hope may see again before long said at last hope may replied of course will after be come gone will think nothing of running down if be only to make morning call pray do that mr rubb will a matter of course in spite of miss mackenzie ca go away without saying word about money ca indeed there need be more about mr rubb there must be miss mackenzie there must indeed at least so much a know have done wrong about money talk about if choose to lend to brother without security there be nothing very uncommon in there ai at least perhaps there ai though a far a can see brother sister out in world be mostly a hard to other where money be concerned a other people thing be did mean to lend without security be quite contented a be did wrong about through feel so ca tell do indeed will never rest till that money be paid back again never will then having said that went away when early on preceding evening have put on bright yellow glove making smart before eye of lady of love must be presumed that did so with hope of success in hope be altogether betrayed when came confessed fraud about money must be supposed that in doing so felt that be lowering in estimation of whom desired to win for wife have only known thereby took most efficacious step towards winning esteem glove have be nearly fatal to word feel so ca tell redeemed evil that glove have done went away however saying nothing more then failing to strike while iron be hot six week after mr stumfold called on miss mackenzie making most important visit must be first explained before nature of visit be described that miss mackenzie have twice be to mr stumfold house since evening of miss todd party drinking tea there on occasion have twice met mr maguire on former occasion two have have conversation have be of great moment have spoken nothing then of pleasure of love have made allusion to dove like softness of woman on second meeting have seemed to keep aloof from altogether have begun to tell that dream be over to scold for having dreamed at when came close up behind whispered word in ear know said how much must wish to be with ca now have be startled have turned round have found herself close to dreadful eye have never be so close to before frightened then again came to just before left spoke to in same mysterious way will see in day two said never mind now then walked away have not spoken word to did speak word to that evening miss mackenzie have never before seen mr stumfold since first visit of ceremony except in lady drawing room be surprised when heard name announced be understood thing mr stumfold did not call on stumfoldians unless have great special reason for doing so unless erring sister required admonishing course of event in life of stumfoldian might demand special advice know that edict of kind have actually be pronounced miss mackenzie though have not yet be twelve month in littlebath knew that arrangement be generally understood to exist be plain to be seen by lady face a entered room that special cause have brought her now wore none of pretty smile with morning caller greet friend before begin first gentle attempt at miscellaneous conversation be true that gave hand to miss mackenzie did even with austerity when seated not on sofa a be invited to do on one of square hard straight backed chair miss mackenzie knew well that pleasantness be not to be order of morning dear miss mackenzie said mr stumfold hope will pardon if express much tender solicitude for welfare miss mackenzie be so astonished at mode of address at tone in be uttered that made reply to word have in intention of kindness voice look of lady be if kind at rate not tender came among continued mr stumfold became one of have be glad to welcome be sure have be much obliged be always glad to welcome who come among in proper spirit society with miss mackenzie be never looked upon a end in be only mean to end woman regard society more favourably than do think offer to one of most efficacious mean of spreading true gospel teaching with view have always thought right to open house in spirit a hope of humble hospitality mr stumfold be of same opinion holding view have be delighted to see among a have said already to welcome a one of there be something in so awful that miss mackenzie hardly knew how to speak let pas without speaking having spirit of own did not like being told that have be a be sat upon judged then admitted into mr stumfold society a child may be admitted into school after examination yet on spur of moment must not think what word might be appropriate for answer sat silent therefore mr stumfold again went on trust that will acknowledge that have shown good will towards desire to cultivate christian friendship with that will therefore excuse if ask question might otherwise have appearance of interference miss mackenzie be there anything between husband curate mr maguire miss mackenzie face became suddenly a red a fire for moment two made answer know whether may a yet have succeeded in making reader understand strength a well a weakness of heroine character mr stumfold have certainly not succeeded in perceiving be accustomed probably to weak obedient woman to woman who have taught to believe submission to stumfoldian authority be sign of advanced christianity in mild looking quiet mannered lady who have lately come among certainly did not expect to encounter rebel on such matter a to female hierarch of littlebath be now alluding miss mackenzie be not by nature adapted to be submissive be there anything between mr maguire said mr stumfold again particularly wish to have plain answer to question miss mackenzie a have said became very red in face when be repeated found obliged to speak mr stumfold know that have right to ask question a right no right to ask lady who sits under mr stumfold whether not be engaged to mr stumfold own curate think again of what be saying miss mackenzie there be in mr stumfold voice a spoke expression of offended majesty in countenance look of awful authority sufficient doubt to bring most stumfoldian lady to bearing said nothing about being engaged to oh miss mackenzie said nothing about being engaged to if have must have made same answer asked if there be anything between think be very offensive question offensive be afraid miss mackenzie have not spirit subject to proper control have come here in kindness to warn against danger tell that be offensive what be to think of have right to connect name with gentleman ca have right merely because go to mr stumfold church be quite preposterous if went to mr paul church mr paul be very high church young clergyman who have wished to have candle in church of whom be asserted that did keep pair of candle on inverted box in closet inside bedroom if went to mr paul church might wife if have one come ask manner of question like now mr paul name stank in nostril of mr stumfold be to thing accursed have miss mackenzie quoted pope cardinal wiseman even dr newman must not have be so bad mr stumfold have once met mr paul called to face most abject of slave of scarlet woman to courtesy mr paul being good humoured somewhat sportive young man have replied that be mr stumfold have interpreted gentleman meaning wrongly have ever since gnashed with teeth fired great gun with eye whenever mr paul be named within hearing ribald ruffian have once said of that think priestly rag protect must not have dared to insult be said that have complained to stumfold mr stumfold sacerdotal clothing whether ragged whole prevented also from interfering nothing further of personal nature have occurred between opponent miss mackenzie who certainly be stumfoldian by own choice must not have used name probably did not know whole truth a to passage of arm between mr paul mr stumfold did know that name in littlebath be so odious to lady a of rival clergyman very well miss mackenzie said speaking loudly in wrath then let tell that will come by ruin yes by ruin poor unfortunate woman be unfit to guide own step will not take counsel from who be able to put in right way how will be ruined said miss mackenzie jumping up from seat how yes now want to know after having insulted in return for kindness in coming to ask question if tell how doubt will insult again have insulted mr stumfold if like to tell need be sure did not want to come to talk in way want who ever doe want to be reproved for own folly suppose what want be to go on marry man who may have two three other wife for what know put money into hand of person whom never saw in life above few month ago of whose former life literally know nothing tell truth miss mackenzie be that what desire to do find acting a mr stumfold curate yes when come to warn insult be mr stumfold curate in many respect be well fitted for office have two three wife already mr stumfold never said that have thought hinted never hinted miss mackenzie if must only be little more careful in thing allow to say must be better for yourself better for too while be with declare said something about two three wife if there be anything of kind true of gentleman clergyman think ought to be allowed to go about a single gentleman mean a curate mr maguire be nothing to nothing whatever see why must have be mixed up with if there be anything of sort there be then mr stumfold think ought to have mentioned two three wife indeed be such horrid idea quite horrid suppose after poor man have not got one if have allowed must have told miss mackenzie mr maguire be not married never have be married a far a know then do think what said of be very cruel said nothing a must have known only be so hot miss mackenzie quite astonish do indeed have expected to find temperate calm instead of that be so impetuous that will not listen to word when first came to ear that there might be something between mr maguire will not be told about something what doe something mean mr stumfold when be told of continued mr stumfold determined that must not be stopped longer by miss mackenzie energy when be told of indeed may say saw never saw anything mr stumfold immediately perceived that be duty to come to to come to tell that lady have prior claim upon mr maguire hand heart oh indeed young lady with emphasis on word young whom first met at house who be introduced to by young lady not above thirty year of age quite suitable in way to be mr maguire wife may not have quite so much money a have fair provision money be not everything lady in way suitable be suitable young lady who be only thirty year of age engaged to presume miss mackenzie that in speaking to be speaking to lady who must not wish to interfere with lady who have be before do hope that can not be indifferent to ordinary feeling of female christian on subject what must think if be interfered with though perhaps a have not fortune in early life may never have known what be be too much even for miss mackenzie mr stumfold said again rising from seat wo talk about more with mr maguire be nothing to a far a can see if be must be nothing to must great deal no must may say what like to though for matter of think very indelicate thing for lady to go about raising such question at perhaps have known long time have nothing to do with what choose to talk about if be behaving bad to friend of yours go tell so a for wo hear anything more about a miss mackenzie continued to stand mr stumfold be forced to stand also soon afterwards found compelled to go away have indeed said that have come to say though must willingly have repeated again have miss mackenzie be submissive did not find encouraged to do so by rebellious nature of lady be visiting have meant well miss mackenzie said a took leave hope that will see just same a ever on thursday to miss mackenzie made answer only by curtsey then mr stumfold went way miss mackenzie a soon a be left to herself began to cry if mr stumfold must have seen how must have soothed rejoiced that lady ruffled spirit miss mackenzie must sooner have died than have wept in mr stumfold presence sooner be front door closed than began to have be attacked at in way must have be too much for to have be called old unsuitable for be in truth case to hear accused of being courted solely for money that when in truth have not be courted at to have be informed that lover for must have be impossible in day when have money be not enough to make cry then be truth that mr maguire ought to marry one else if so be last woman in littlebath to interfere between that other one how be to know that be not villainy on part of mr stumfold felt sure after what have now seen heard that nothing in way must be too bad for mr stumfold to say do never must go to mr stumfold house again be matter of course what must do about mr maguire mr maguire might never speak to in way of affection probably never must do so that must bear how be to bear fact that stumfoldian in littlebath must know about on one thing finally resolved that if ever mr maguire spoke to on subject must tell everything have occurred after cried to sleep on afternoon felt to be very desolate much in want of friend when susanna came back from school in evening be almost more desolate than before must say nothing of trouble to one so young yet must shake off thought of have be bold enough while mr stumfold have be with now that be alone almost worse than alone having susanna with now that reaction have come began to tell that continuation of solitary life must be impossible to how be to live if be to be trampled upon in way be not almost necessary that must leave littlebath yet if be to leave littlebath whither must go how must muster courage to begin everything over again if only have be given to have one friend one female friend to whom must have told everything thought of miss baker miss baker be staunch stumfoldian what did know of miss baker gave right to trouble miss baker on subject must almost rather have gone to miss todd if have dared laid awake cry night nothing of kind have ever occurred to before one have ever accused her of impropriety one have ever thrown in teeth that be longing after fruit ought to be forbidden to in former obscurity dependence have be safe now that have begun to look about hope for joy in world have fallen into terrible misfortune must not have be better for to have married cousin john ball thus have have clear course of duty marked out for must not have be better for even to have married harry handcock than to have come to misery what good must her money do if world be to treat in way then be true be fact that mr maguire be ill treating other woman in order that might get money in misery remembered that mr stumfold must not commit to such direct assertion remembered also that mr stumfold have especially insisted on own part of grievance on fact that suitable young lady have be met by mr maguire in drawing room a to mr maguire must reconcile to loss of indeed have never yet reconciled to idea of taking must not endure to think that mr stumfold interference must prevail worse still that other people must have supposed to prevail next day be thursday one of mr stumfold thursday in course of morning miss baker came to supposing that a matter of course must go to meeting not to night miss baker said not going why not 'd rather not go out to night dear how odd thought always went to mr stumfold there be nothing wrong hope then miss mackenzie must not restrain told miss baker everything told story not with whine lamentation a have thought of while lying awake during past night with spirited indignation what right have to come to accuse suppose meant for best said miss baker miss baker meant for worst be sorry to speak so of friend must speak a find intended to insult why did tell of age money have made out to be young misbehaved with mean providence have given a to gentleman have ever conducted so a to merit reproach know be ever ten minute in company that be not there also be last accusation must have brought against whimpered baker then why have treated in way what right have given to be advisor because go to husband church mr maguire be friend might have come to that that must be husband be there sin in must be rebuked be for other lady sake perhaps then let go to other lady to have forgotten in coming to will know think so miss baker when left paragon felt for miss mackenzie more of respect more of esteem also than have ever felt before miss mackenzie when be left alone went upstairs threw on bed be again dissolved in tear chapter xiii mr maguire courtship after scene between miss mackenzie miss baker more than week passed by before miss mackenzie saw of littlebath friend a called with much sadness when speaking of to herself littlebath acquaintance friend friend have none be slow heavy week with be hardly too much to say that hour in be spent in thinking of attack mr stumfold have made upon when first sunday came went to church saw there miss baker mr stumfold mr stumfold mr maguire saw indeed many stumfoldians seemed that eye looked at harshly be quite sure that coachmaker wife treated with marked incivility a left porch together miss baker have frequently waited for on sunday morning walked length of two street with encountered miss baker near church gate on morning be sure that mr stumfold have prevailed against if be to be thus with have not better leave littlebath a soon a possible in same solitude lived whole of next week with same feeling did go to church on next sunday then again be maltreated by upturned nose half averted eye of coachmaker wife life such a must be impossible to let of reader think of then tell whether must be possible mariana solitude in moated grange be a nothing to hers in grange such like rural retreat people expect solitude miss mackenzie have gone to littlebath to find companionship have be utterly disappointed found none must have be bad have found then lost mariana in desolateness be still waiting for coming of one so be miss mackenzie waiting though hardly knew for whom for if be to live in moated grange let be in country moated grange in midst of populous town be very terrible on monday morning morning of second monday after stumfoldian attack mr maguire came be weariness be for time at end susanna have hardly gone breakfast thing be still on table when maid brought up word that mr maguire be below must see if must allow to come up have heard no ring at bell having settled with novel in arm chair have almost ceased for moment to think of mr maguire of mr stumfold there be something so sudden in request now made to that took away breath mr maguire miss clergyman from mr stumfold church said girl again be necessary that must give answer though be ever so breathless ask mr maguire to walk up said then began to bethink how must behave to be there however before thought be of much service to began by apologising for breakfast thing be that ought to beg pardon for coming so early said time at present be so occupied that hardly know how to find hour for myself thought must excuse certainly said then sitting down waited for to begin must have be clear to observer have there be one present mr maguire have practised lesson must not rid of unmistakable sign of preparation speaker show when have be guilty of probably did not matter with miss mackenzie who be too intent on part have to play to notice imperfection saw that observed miss mackenzie said that kept aloof from on two last evening on met at mr stumfold be long time ago mr maguire answered be nearly month since went to mr stumfold house know that be not there on last thursday noticed must not fail to notice thinking so much of a do of course did notice might ask why did not go 'd rather not say anything about replied after pause then there have be reason dear miss mackenzie can assure ask without cause if please will not speak upon

excellent woman of whom not long since have spoken in term almost too strong for simple human virtue 'd rather not speak of ca do good know why must ask whether intend to go there more a have have answered then mr maguire got up from chair walked about room miss mackenzie watching closely must see that be much moved nevertheless think have made up mind to walk about room beforehand after while paused still standing spoke to again across table may ask question have mr stumfold said anything to about 'd rather not talk about mr stumfold surely may ask that think be woman to allow anything said behind person back to be received to detriment one doe hear about people one always hears behind back then have told something have believed felt to be so driven by that did not know how to protect seemed to that clerical people of littlebath have very little regard for feeling of others in mode of following own pursuit have told something of have believed repeated mr maguire have not right to ask what have said have right to ask anything have not miss mackenzie surely be hard be not hard must be stabbed in dark have mean of redressing did not expect such answer from indeed did not be not hard must be troubled in way talk of stabbing who have stabbed be not own particular friend whom described to a best person in world if fall out why must be brought into once for mr maguire wo be brought into now sat down again paused before went on with talk miss mackenzie said when did speak have not intended to be so abrupt a fear will think in be about to say believe will like plain

remonstrated begging wife to go to bed have not have clothes off for last week said husband matter about clothes said mr tom still weeping be always cry when in sick room always scolding when out of thus complying with two different requisition of nature matter however be settled by assurance on part that must go to bed so that might be stirring early there be woman who seem to have absolute pleasure in fixing for business by bedside of sick man generally commence operation by laying aside fictitious feminine charm by arraying with rigid unconventional unenticing propriety though be still gentle perhaps more gentle than ever in movement there be decision in do very unlike usual mode of action sick man who be not so sick what can ponder on matter feel to be like baby whom have seen nurse to take from cradle pat on back feed then return to little couch without undue violence tyranny still with certain consciousness of omnipotence a far a child be concerned vitality of man be gone from in prostrate condition debarred by feature of condition from spontaneous exertion feel to be more woman than woman if be such one a miss mackenzie arranges bottle with precision know exactly how to place chair lamp teapot settle cap usefully on head prepares for night work certainly with satisfaction such be best woman of world among number think that miss mackenzie have right to be counted few word of affection be spoken between brother sister for at such moment brotherly affection return estrangement of life be forgotten in old memory seemed comforted to feel hand upon bed be glad to pronounce name spoke to a though have be favourite of family for year instead of one member of who have be snubbed disregarded poor man who will say that there be anything hypocritical false in yet undoubtedly be fact that margaret be now only wealthy one among have made send to think of a lay there in sickness when word of love have be spoken turned on pillow lay silent for long while for hour till morning sun have risen daylight be again seen through window curtain be not much after midsummer daylight came to early from time to time have looked at hour in night have crept round to given that needed did with certain system noiselessly with absolute assurance on own part that carried with authority sufficient to ensure obedience on ground in place think that even miss todd must have succumbed to when morning sun have driven appearance of night from room making paraphernalia of sickness more ghastly than have be under light of lamp brother turned back again began to talk of thing be weighing on mind margaret said be very good of to come a to myself one coming can be of use to be in hand of god tom doubt doubt said sadly not daring to argue point with yet feeling little consolation from assurance so be bullock in god hand when butcher be going to knock on head yet know that beast will die men live die from natural cause not by god interposition there be hope be what mean if god plea ah well margaret fear that will not please what be to do about sarah child be question must be answered by general platitude by weak word of hopeless consolation coming from to demanded very substantial answer else answer at what be to do about sarah child perhaps there came thought across mind that sarah child have done very little for have considered very little in old weary day in arundel street day be not a yet so very old be now not much more than twelve month since have sat by deathbed of other brother since have expressed to herself to harry handcock humble wish that might find to be above absolute want think need fret about tom said after turning thing over in mind for minute two how not fret about suppose know nothing of state of business have rubb spoken to did say word a came along in cab what did say said well tell what said said that if died what then must not be afraid of speaking of openly why margaret have told that must be in month two did rubb say said that there must be very little coming out of business be for sarah child if anything be to happen to suppose 'd get anything how have be managed know have worked like galley slave at have kept book know how thing have gone so badly have gone badly very badly have be mr rubb fault wo say indeed if have be man fault have be old man want to say word against one know oh margaret fret now tom if have seven child must not fret hardly know how to speak to about know that have already have ever so much of money over two thousand pound fear will never see again never mind tom be yours with heart only tom a be so badly wanted must rather be yours than mr rubb must not do something must make share of building yours shifted uneasily in bed made understand that have distressed perhaps will be better to say nothing more about said will be better that must understand property belongs nominally to be mortgaged to full of value rubb can explain if will money went to buy other creditor must not be satisfied without security ah dear be so dreadful to have to speak of in way then speak of tom what be to do be there no proceeds from business yes for who work in think there will be something coming out of for sarah something will be very small if so must depend for solely on mr rubb on young one yes on one know there be great deal more said of course everyone will know how such conversation be ended will understand with what ample assurance a to own intention margaret promised that seven child must not want a did so made certain rapid calculation in head must give up mr maguire there be doubt about must give up idea of marrying one a thought of told that be perhaps well rid of trouble have already given away to firm of rubb mackenzie above hundred year out of income if divided remainder with mr tom keeping about three hundred fifty pound year for herself susanna must thought keep promise well yet retain enough for own comfort susanna education must be bad for prospect of young john third of name whom have taught to regard a heir young john ball must know nothing of good thing have lost a to living with sister in law sarah sharing house income with whole family that declared to herself nothing must induce to do must give up half of that have that half must be quite enough to save brother child from want in making promise to brother said nothing about proportion nothing a to own future life what have said will share with may rest assured that will not want of course thanked a dying men do thank who take upon such charge perceived a did so thought that perceived that still have something more upon mind mr tom came relieved in morning miss mackenzie be obliged to put off for time panoply of sick room armour made so indomitable in brother bedroom downstairs met mr rubb who talked to much about brother affair much about oilcloth business speaking a though be desirous that most absolute confidence must exist between said word of promise to brother except declared that money lent be now to be regarded a present made by to personally be afraid that will avail nothing said mr rubb junior for amount now stand a debt due by firm to firm must pay money if must can not pay to brother estate more than can to yours interest said miss mackenzie oh yes interest can be paid said mr rubb junior tone of voice did not give much promise that interest must be forthcoming with punctuality watched again that night on next day in afternoon be told that gentleman wished to see in drawing room thought at once pointed to mr maguire went downstairs prepared to be very angry with gentleman on entering room found cousin john ball be in truth glad to see for after thought that liked best of men woman that knew be always in trouble then fancied that with at rate knew worst there be nothing concealed with nothing to be afraid of hoped that might continue to know other intimately a cousin under existing circumstance must not of course be anything more to other than be very kind of john said taking hand how did know be here mr slow told be with mr slow about business of yours be afraid from what hear that find brother very ill very ill indeed john ill to death then asked after uncle aunt child at cedar be much a usual said added that mother must be very glad to see at cedar only supposed there be hope of not just at present john see be wholly occupied here will really die do think doctor say so wife child will be provided for margaret simply shook head john ball a watched felt assured that uncle jonathan money must never come in way in way of child be man used to disappointment bore with mild sufferance then explained to business about have specially come to have entrusted with certain arrangement a to portion of property came to tell that certain railway company wanted house belonged to that by act of parliament be obliged to sell act of parliament will make railway company pay for wo john then went on to explain to that be in luck way a usual said poor fellow thinking of own misfortune that must greatly increase income by sale indeed seemed to that must regain pretty nearly have lost by loan to rubb mackenzie how very singular thought to herself under circumstance might after be possible that must marry mr maguire if wished when mr ball have told business did not stay much longer said word of own hope if hope must be called longer a left just referred to what have passed between be time margaret said to ask whether have changed mind john there be other thing to think of now be there not besides will want here can do for spoke to with express conviction that what be wanted of by a well a by others be money did not occur to to contradict might have asked to see do think said mr tom when john ball be gone there always be upsetting pride about people at cedar never must endure be a poor a church mouse when poverty pride go together do detest suppose came to find out about hope told nothing to miss mackenzie made answer at chapter xv tearing of verse thing went on in gower street for three four week in same way then susanna be fetched home from littlebath miss mackenzie must have gone down that be averse to see mr maguire therefore kept on littlebath lodging though mr tom said much to of wasteful extravagance in doing so be at last settled that mr rubb must go down to littlebath bring susanna back with did not at to young lady satisfaction be understood that susanna did not leave school at have lately be received a boarder holiday have come be thought well that must see father during time miss mackenzie received two letter from mr maguire in first pleaded hard for answer to offer have said now relinquished curacy having found interference of terrible woman to be unendurable have left curacy be at present without employment under such circumstance margaret must understand how imperative be that must receive answer curacy rather small incumbency have offered among mine in cornwall must not think of accepting till must know what margaret might say to to margaret answered most demurely perhaps little slily said that brother health affair be at present in such condition a to allow to think of nothing else that completely understood mr maguire position that be essential that must not be kept in suspense under combined circumstance have alternative to release from offer have made did with le unwillingness a be probable that pecuniary position must be considerably altered by change in brother family be now expecting almost daily then bade farewell with many expression of esteem said that hoped might be happy among mine in cornwall such be letter did not satisfy mr maguire wrote second letter have declined said incumbency among mine having heard of something thought must suit better in manchester a to that there be immediate hurry proposed remaining at littlebath for next two month having be asked to undertake temporary duty in neighbouring church for time by end of two month hoped that margaret must be able to give answer in different tone a to pecuniary position must leave that said to herself to second letter miss mackenzie did not find necessary to send reply domestic in mackenzie family be not at time numerous poor mother have enough to do with family downstairs nurse have be hired for sick man for nurse can not be hired without money money with tom mackenzie be scarce miss mackenzie must have hired nurse thought better to take work entirely into own hand did so think may say that brother did not suffer by a sat by bedside night after night seemed to feel that have fallen again into proper place looked back upon year have spent at littlebath almost with dismay since brother death three men have offered to marry there be fourth from whom have expected offer looked upon with dismay told that be not fit to sail under own guidance out in broad sea amidst such rock a be not humbly feminine employment such a in be now engaged better for in way sad a be present occasion did not feel satisfaction in what be doing assurance that be fit for position have not always be ill at ease out of element while striving at littlebath to live life of lady of fortune told that be so that must be better for to be hard working dependent woman doing tedious duty day by day than to live life of ease prompted to longing for thing unfitted to have brought little writing desk with that have carried from arundel street to littlebath have with in sick man bedroom sitting there through long hour of night must open read over over again remnant of rhyme written in early day have kept when made great bonfire there have be quire of such verse have destroyed few leaf before started for littlebath what be left be now read be very sweet to yet knew that be wrong meaningless what business have one a to talk of sphere tune silvery moon of bright star shining heart repining must not for world have allowed one to know what fool have be either mr tom john ball mr maguire miss todd must have be covered with confusion if rhyme have fallen into hand of one of yet loved well a mother love only idiot child be expression of romance poetry have be in though expression doubtless be poor romance poetry of heart have be high noble how wrong world be in connecting so closely a doe capacity for feeling capacity for expression in thinking capacity for one implies capacity for other incapacity for one incapacity also for other in confusing technical art of man who sings with unselfish tenderness of man who feel world doe so connect consequently who express badly be ashamed of feeling read poor line again again throwing back into day thought of former period telling that be over have thought of encouraging love love have come to in shape of mr maguire very strict evangelical clergyman without cure income somewhat in debt with oh such eye tore paper very gently into smallest fragment tore again again swearing to herself a did so that there must be end of a there be fire at hand replaced piece in desk during ceremony of tearing devoted to duty of single life to drudgery of ordinary utility to such work a be now doing a to society wicked religious wicked after manner of miss todd religious after manner of st stumfolda must come not a circumstance might direct must go more in search of such be resolve of certain night during ceremony of tearing took place came to pas at time mr rubb junior visited dying partner almost daily be always left alone with for time when visit be made miss mackenzie must descend to room in sister in law be sitting there must be conversation between about mr rubb affair much a two woman disliked other there have necessarily arisen between certain amount of confidence two person who be much thrown together to exclusion of other society will tell other thought even though there be love between what be saying to time when be with said mr tom one morning when miss mackenzie have come down on appearance of mr rubb in sick room be talking about business suppose what good can do tom ca say anything about that a to how must be done think great deal about sam rubb be more than do must necessarily be in other confidence must say be not in confidence belief be be be deal too clever for tom that will turn out to be too clever for poor orphan upon mr tom put handkerchief up to eye there be coming down continued wife do go up now make tom tell what be that sam rubb have be saying to margaret mackenzie did go up a heard mr rubb close front door have such purpose a with sister in law have striven to inspire have wish to make sick man tell anything that did not wish to tell in considering matter within own breast owned to herself that did not expect much from rubbs in aid of want of nephew niece what must be use of troubling dying man about have agreed with to believe that oilcloth business be bad affair that must be well to hope for nothing from that brother to last must harass about business be only natural there must be reason why must harass on same subject have recognised fact that widow child must be supported by have now be told that oilcloth factory have be absolutely abandoned a being worth nothing must not have caused much disappointment thought great deal more of railway company be going to buy property under such favourable circumstance be therefore much surprised when brother began about business a soon a have seated know that reader need be delayed with of detail that gave with content of paper showed however found compelled to go into matter compelled also to make endeavour to understand seemed that everything hung upon samuel rubb junior except fact that samuel rubb father who now never went near place got more than net profit further fact that whole thing must come to end if payment to old rubb be stopped tom said in middle of when head be aching with figure if will comfort enable to put thing away may know will divide everything have with sarah assured that kindness did comfort hoped better than that still thought that something better might be arranged if must only go on with task so went on painfully toiling through figure sam drew up on purpose for yesterday afternoon said who did asked samuel rubb then went on to declare that might accept samuel rubb figure a correct be quite willing to accept strove hard to understand certainly did seem to that when money be borrowed somebody must have known that promised security must not be forthcoming perhaps that somebody be old rubb whom a did not know be quite ready to regard a villain in play be being acted own money too be thing of past that fault if fault there have be be condoned be angry with in now thought of again now said brother a soon a have put paper back declared that understood now have something to say to hope will hear without being angry raised on bed a said doing so with difficulty pain turning face upon so that must look into eye if did know be dying think must say to say what tom thought of what most terrible thing might be possible that must have to communicate must be that have got hold that rubb mackenzie have got hold of fortune turned into unprofitable oilcloth must in way have made responsible for engagement wished to trust tried to avoid suspicion feared that thing be amiss samuel rubb have be talking of think have better come from said brother what have better come asked be proposition margaret then knew about felt great relief then knew about let go on till have spoken speech god know how far may be indulging false hope deceiving altogether think possible that might might become fond of there margaret be long short of when told that have better say that declared that must not bring to listen to while be lying here dying of course must not look here margaret know must do much to comfort in last moment indeed must tom must ask to marry man did like not even if be to do child service if can be got over other feeling must not restrain when must be greatest possible comfort to how must serve tom if must be arranged rubb must give up to sarah during father life proceeds of business after paying old man when dy be very old now five hundred year must be continued to think what must be margaret tom will have what will make comfortable without waiting for old man death will be quite half of income if be not enough will be more will not that do for then brother strove to explain a best must that mere money be not all wanted if sister did not like man if have wish to become married woman of course said plan must fall to ground if there be anything in mr rubb belief that be not altogether indifferent to if arrangement must be made palatable to then must be able to think that by work of life have left something behind to wife family sarah must be more comfortable pleaded of course be grateful to a be a be given bread be bitter bread if must think came to of own right said ever so much more that ever so much more be quite unnecessary sister understood whole matter be desirable that by fortune must enable widow orphan of brother to live in comfort be not desirable that dependence on must be plainly recognised did not however feel to be angry hurt must doubt be better for family that must draw income in apparently independent way from late father business than that must owe support to charity of aunt then how about month two ago before maguire feature in career have displayed so strongly overture from mr rubb might probably not have be received with disfavour now while be a be half engaged to man must not entertain such proposition womanly feeling revolted from doubt intended to refuse mr maguire doubt have made up mind to absolutely during ceremony of tearing up verse have never have much love for mr maguire have felt almost for mr rubb in case be sure that have married man one man other must instantly have become devoted to who chronicle deed endeavour to chronicle thought feel equally sure that must have be so there be something harsh in that mr maguire offer to must though never accepted debar from possibility of marrying mr rubb thus settling affair of family in way must have be satisfactory to not altogether unsatisfactory to be aware that did so felt that be so then threw back for consolation upon security must still be hers want of security must attach to marriage with mr rubb might make duck drake of then there must be nothing left for for sister in law for child may tell to speak to yourself brother asked while be thinking of tom must do good fancy then know about fancying think will be better for to remain a be must do anything for sarah almost anything can not do then will say nothing further ask to do did not ask again turned face from thought of bitterness of death bed that evening when went down to tea met samuel rubb standing at drawing room door there be one here said will mind coming in have brother spoken to have followed into room have closed door a asked question yes have spoken to must see that man be trembling with anxiety eagerness almost loved that be anxious eager mr maguire when have come wooing have not done badly altogether there have not be so much reality a there be about sam rubb while stood there shaking fearing hoping well said may hope may think will be so may ask to be mine be handsome in eye though perhaps delicate reader must not have be handsome in yours knew that be not gentleman what did matter be sister in law sarah lady there be not much in house in gower street be after manner of gentleman lady be ready to throw to dog must have done so for mr maguire felt that must like to have allowed to love in spite of tearing of verse felt be very angry with mr maguire fact be stern there be hope for mr rubb said there can be nothing of kind ca there really now said assured in strongest language that there must be nothing of kind then went down to dining room did not venture to follow made way out of house without seeing anyone else fortnight went by then towards close of september came end of thing in world for poor tom mackenzie died in middle of night in wife arm while sister stood by holding hand since day on have endeavoured to arrange match between partner sister have spoken word of business at rate to latter thing now stood on footing have then attempted to give know how silent on such matter be voice of in bereft household from hour of death till that other hour in body be consigned to kindred dust woman make mourning men creep about listlessly during few sad day there may be talk about money so be in gower street widow doubt thought much of bitter state of dependence thought something perhaps of chance there might be that husband sister must be le good than word now that be gone meditated with what amount of submission must accept generosity of woman have always hated be still mistress of house till undertaker have done work till work have be done said little of future plan 'd earn bread if knew how began putting handkerchief up to eye on afternoon of very day on be buried there will be occasion for sarah said miss mackenzie there will be enough for must if knew how must mind what did 'd scour floor rather than be dependent have spirit in have worked moiled toiled with child so have miss mackenzie then told that have solemnly promised brother to divide income with widow informed that intended to see mr slow lawyer on following day with reference to doing of if there be anything from factory can be divided too said miss mackenzie there wo rubbs will take of course will tom put into near upon ten thousand pound then began to cry again soon interrupted tear to ask what be to become of susanna susanna who be by looked anxiously up into aunt eye susanna said aunt have thrown in lot together mean to remain so dear if mamma will let be sure be very good of to take one off hand said mother for even one will be felt then came note to miss mackenzie from lady ball asking to spend few day at cedar before returned to littlebath be if did return consented to do while be there mr slow must prepare necessary arrangement for division of property must then make up mind a to manner whereabouts of future life be at sea again knew not how to choose if be romanist must go into convent protestant convent thought be bad peculiarly unfitted for follower of mr stumfold have nothing to bind to spot something to drive from spot of knew anything before went to cedar mr rubb came to gower street bade farewell have allowed to hope miss mackenzie said have indeed suppose be very foolish know a to being foolish mr rubb unless be in caring about person a do care for very much suppose be wrong to think must put up with such a be only did think that perhaps seeing that have be partner with brother so long same know that mackenzie be different from rubbs have nothing to do with nothing in least have now then perhaps miss mackenzie at future time miss mackenzie be obliged to tell that there must not possibly be other answer given to at future time than gave now suggested that perhaps might be allowed to try again when first month two of grief for brother must be over assured that must be useless at moment of conference with did with energy then a soon a be alone asked why have be so energetical after marriage be excellent state in to live romance be doubtless foolish wrong tearing of paper have be discreet yet there must be no good reason why must turn back upon sober wedlock nevertheless in speech to mr rubb did do so there be something in position a connected with mr maguire made feel that must be indelicate to entertain suitor before gentleman have received final answer a went away from gower street to cedar thought of very sadly told that have be like as who starved between two bundle of hay a boy who have fallen between two stool chapter xvi lady ball grievance miss mackenzie before left gower street be forced to make arrangement a to affair at littlebath be ultimately settled in manner be not altogether palatable to mr rubb be again sent down having susanna in charge be empowered to settle with miss mackenzie landlady give up lodging there be much that be disagreeable in miss mackenzie having just rejected mr rubb suit did not feel quite comfortable in giving commission to see stocking petticoat packed up brought away from lodging indeed must give commission of kind intimated intention of writing to lodging house keeper however be profuse in assurance that nothing must be left behind if miss mackenzie must tell anything of way in thing ought to be packed must be so happy to attend to to miss mackenzie must give such instruction doubtless gave many to susanna a to susanna be settled that must remain a boarder at littlebath school at rate for next half year after there might be great doubt whether aunt must bear expense of maintaining in such position miss mackenzie have reconciled to going to cedar because must thus have opportunity of seeing lawyer arranging about property whereas have be down at littlebath there must have be difficulty wanted one whom must trust to act for one besides lawyer thought that must trust cousin john ball a to getting away from suitor be impossible have gone to littlebath there be one there have remained with sister in law must have be always near on going to cedar must meet third must not on account absolutely isolate from everybody that knew in world perhaps be getting somewhat used to suitor le liable than have be to fear that must force into action against own consent so went to cedar on arriving there received from uncle aunt moderate amount of condolence a to death of brother first second day in aunt house be very quiet nothing be said of john former desire nothing about own money brother family on morning of third day told cousin that must on next morning accompany to town if must allow be going to mr slow said perhaps must go with to assented willingly then after pause surmised that visit must probably have reference to sale of house to railway company partly to said chiefly concern arrangement for brother family to john ball said nothing did lady ball who be present then speak miss mackenzie must see that aunt looked at cousin opening eye expressing concern john ball allowed change to come upon face went on deliberately with bread butter will be very happy to go with said will come call for when have done stay with while be there just a like particularly want to stay with said a go up to town will tell about observed that before cousin left house on day mother got hold of be alone with for nearly hour after lady ball be alone with sir john in own room for half hour old baronet have become older of course much weaker since niece have last be at cedar be now seldom seen about house till afternoon of institution at cedar of carriage be most important miss mackenzie found that carriage arrangement have be fixed upon new more settled basis since last visit then used to go out perhaps a often a three time week there did not appear to be fixed rule like other carriage did to certain degree come when be wanted now there be a have said settled basis carriage came to door on tuesday thursday saturday exactly at two o'clock sir john with lady ball be driven about till four on first tuesday of visit miss mackenzie have gone with uncle aunt even have found pace to be very slow whole affair to be very dull uncle have once enlivened thing by asking whether have found lover since went to littlebath question have perplexed very much must not say that have found none a be not prepared to acknowledge that have found must only sit still blush woman have plenty of lover when have plenty of money said baronet believe that margaret think of anything of kind said lady ball after margaret determined to have a little to do with carriage a possible on evening learned from cousin that horse have be sold to man who farmed land be hired other day for two hour work be on thursday morning that miss mackenzie have spoken of going into town on morrow on day when aunt asked about driving declined hope that nothing uncle said on tuesday annoyed oh dear if mind 'd rather stay at home of course will if like said aunt by by a want to speak to a might not find time after coming home if mind will do now of course margaret said that did not mind though in truth did mind be afraid of aunt well then margaret look here want to know something about brother affair from what have heard fear be not very good be very bad aunt very bad indeed dear dear say so sir john always feared that must be so when thomas mackenzie mixed up with rubbs there have gone half of jonathan ball money money sir john made well well miss mackenzie have nothing to say to a have nothing to say to sat silent making attempt at word doe seem hard dear must make difference to anybody now to uncle mean to john if money be not gone be quite true quite true only doe seem to be pity however that half of jonathan money have got be not lost there be comfort in miss mackenzie be not called upon to make answer to for although have lost large sum of money by lending to brother nevertheless be still possessed of larger sum of money than brother walter have received from jonathan ball be going to do dear child mean widow suppose there will be something for out of business think there will be anything aunt a far a can understand there will be nothing certain may probably get hundred twenty five pound year named a being interest of money have lent given hundred twenty five pound year be much will keep from absolute want must aunt oh yes at least suppose so hope be good manager ought to be for be very disagreeable woman told that know then miss mackenzie having considered for one moment resolved to make clean breast of did with fewest possible word be going to divide what have got with hope will make comfortable what exclaimed aunt be going to give sarah half what have got for child will have enough to live on left margaret mean not mean why not aunt must not have let starve besides promised brother when be dying then must say be very wrong very wicked may say to exact such promise from such promise be binding if ask sir john lawyer will tell so what exact promise from to amount of income be very wrong aunt must do same if have made promise must dear friend must let indeed friend must prevent now will not hear of such sacrifice being made aunt well dear be own know margaret a said plucked up courage looked aunt full in face yes be own by law suppose dear that be of disposition that character that 'd wish to set world at defiance make everybody belonging to feel that have disgraced disgraced by relieving brother family disgraced by giving to woman money have come to a fortune have come think of where came from came to from brother walter where did get who made know that brother tom have share of wasted did not come from ball yet think so little of that that be going to let woman rob of rob grandchild for tell be way in world will look at perhaps know property be a good a given to john at one time who be first took by hand when be left alone in arundel street oh margaret go be such ungrateful foolish creature margaret waited for moment then answered there be nobody so near to a own brother child a to margaret there be much difference in nearness between uncle nephew niece there be right wrong in thing when money be concerned people be not justified in indulging fancy everything here have be told to know how john be situated with child after what there have be between after what there still might be if must have so own that be astonished fairly astonished indeed dear can only look on a simple weakness on part be other day that told have done that thought necessary by brother in taking susanna be when be alive thought be doing well fact be have be there have talked over ca be that love child that never saw till other day a for woman always hated whether love hate have nothing to do with will promise that will see mr slow talk to about before do anything must see mr slow before can do anything say will do same will speak to uncle have rather not be afraid to tell of of course must be told will speak to john certainly meant to do so going to town to morrow if tell be wrong aunt know be not wrong be nonsense to say that be wrong in be disrespectful margaret want to be disrespectful aunt in such case a know have right to do what like with own money if be going to give away to other friend if be going to marry anything like blushed at remembrance of iniquity have half intended a said then there might be reason for to scold with brother brother family ca be wrong if have brother have be with when be dying have left wife child looking to must have done same upon lady ball got up from chair walked to door margaret have be more impetuous have answered with much more confidence than have expected be determined now to say one more word so to say that must not be answered to strike one more blow so to strike that must not be returned margaret said a stood with door open in hand if will reflect where money came from conscience will tell without much difficulty where must go to when think of brother child whom time last year have hardly seen think also of john ball child who have welcomed into house a dearest relative in one sense certainly money be yours margaret in sense that highest sense be not yours to do what please with then lady ball shut door rather loudly sailed away along hall when passage be clear miss mackenzie made way up into own room saw none of family till came down just before dinner sat for long time in chair by bed side thinking of position be true after that be bound by sense of justice to give of money to ball be true that in one sense have be taken from have have nothing to do with taking if brother walter have married have child then ball must have not expected money back again be ever so many year five twenty year more since legacy have be made by jonathan ball to brother seemed to that aunt have common sense on side in argument be possible that must allow own nephew niece to starve while be rich have moreover made promise promise to one who be now dead there be solemnity in carried everything else before even though thing might be unjust still must do be to give only half fortune to brother family there must still be half left for herself for herself for ball if wanted so sorely be beginning to hate money have brought to nothing tribulation disappointment have walter left hundred year must not having then dreamed of higher thing have be amply content must not be better that must take for modest competence something on might live without trouble to relative without trouble to friend have first said a did so told with scorn friend have none then let ball have what be left after have kept promise to brother anything must be better than such persecution a to aunt have subjected at last made up mind to speak of openly to cousin have idea in such matter men be more trustworthy than woman perhaps le greedy cousin must thought be more just to than aunt have be that aunt have be very unjust cruel unjust felt assured came down to dinner must see by manner of that matter have be discussed since john ball return from london jack eldest son be not at home three girl who came next to jack dined with father grandfather to margaret endeavoured to talk easily failed have never be favourite with a jack be on occasion must get very little from be satisfactory to john ball be courteous to be very silent throughout whole evening aunt showed displeasure by not speaking to speaking barely with word uncle of whose voice be always in fear seemed to be more cross when did speak more sarcastic than ever asked whether intended to go back to littlebath think not said then have be failure suppose said old man everything be failure think said with tear in eye be in drawing room immediately cousin john came sat by came sat there a though have intended to speak to went away again in minute two without having uttered word thing went on in same way till moved off to bed then formal adieu for night be made with coldness amounted on part of lady ball almost to inhospitality good night margaret said a just put out tip of finger good night dear said sir john know what be matter with look a though 'd be doing something that be ashamed of lady ball be altogether injudicious in treatment of niece a to sir john made probably very little difference miss mackenzie have perceived when first came to cedar that be cross old man that have to be endured a such by one who chose to go into house have depended on lady ball for kindness of manner have be tempted to repeat visit to house because aunt have after fashion be gracious to now there be rising in breast feeling that have better leave cedar a soon a must shake dust off foot see nothing more of ball even rubb connection seemed to to be better than ball connection le exaggerated in greediness be not for cousin john must have resolved to go on morrow must have faced indignation of aunt cutting taunt of uncle have taken off at once to lodging in london john ball have meant to be kind to when came sat close to on sofa soft heart relented towards lady ball have in truth mistaken niece character have found to be unobtrusive gentle unselfish have conceived that must therefore be weak compliant a to many thing be compliant a to thing be weak there be in composition power of resistance sustenance on lady ball have not counted when conscious of absolute ill usage must fight well must not bow neck to mr stumfold to lady ball chapter xvii mr slow chamber came down late to breakfast on following morning not being present at prayer when came down wore bonnet got ready john for fear must keep waiting aunt spoke to somewhat more graciously than on preceding evening accepted apology for being late just a be about to start lady ball took apart spoke one word to one can tell better what ought to do than cousin john pray remember that be far too generous to say word for margaret made answer then cousin started on foot across ground to station distance be nearly mile during walk word be said between about money got into train be to take up to london sat opposite to other happened that there be passenger in of seat next to so that there be ample opportunity for to hold private conversation mr ball said nothing to not knowing how to begin said nothing to in way reached london station at waterloo bridge then asked what proposed to do next will go to mr slow at once asked to assented at proposition agreed to walk to lawyer chamber be on north side of lincoln inn field near turnstile mr ball remarked that distance be again not much above mile so crossed strand together made way by narrow street into drury lane then under certain archway into lincoln inn field to miss mackenzie who felt that something ought to be said distance time occupied seemed to be very short why be lincoln inn field exclaimed a came out upon west side yes be lincoln inn field mr slow chamber be over there knew very well where mr slow chamber be situated paused on pavement not wishing to go thither quite at once john said thought that perhaps might have talked over before saw mr slow talked over what about money want to give to brother family did not aunt tell of yes told that have differed told what about yes said slowly told what about what ought to do john a asked question caught hold of lappet of coat looked up into face a though supplicating to give advantage of discretion honesty be still standing on pavement where street come out from under archway be gazing into face be looking away from over towards inner railing of square with heavy brow dull eye motionless face be very eager seemed to be simply patient nevertheless be working hard with thought striving to determine how best might answer mother have told that might model woman to will have repeated to that story have heard so often of wrong have be done to by uncle jonathan may be said that there be need for such repetition a john ball have always thought quite enough of injury have thought of for last twenty year almost hourly till be graven upon very soul have be ruined wretched moody man because of uncle jonathan will there be need one must have said to have stirred on subject mother on morning in ten minute before prayer time have told of again have told also that last vestige of uncle money must now disappear from unless interfered to save on very day must be saved will do anything tell said mother regard more than anyone else if be to ask again now believe must accept very day at rate let people have money yet have not spoken to margaret on subject during journey must now have taken to lawyer chamber without word have not interrupted stopped nevertheless have be thinking of uncle uncle will uncle money throughout morning be thinking of at moment when stopped thinking how hard be how cruel that people in new road must have have spent uncle fortune now remainder at one time have seemed to be near reach of own child must also go to atone for negligence fraud of wretched rubbs know with how strong bias regard own side of question regarded side in question with very strong bias nevertheless have refrained from word must have refrained have not stopped when took hold of by coat looked for moment into face thought that in trouble be very sweet leaned somewhat against a spoke wished that must lean against altogether there be about quiet power of endurance at same time comeliness womanly softness seemed to fit altogether for want wish a looked with dull face across into square physiognomist must have declared of at moment be suffering from love thinking of woman be dear to be so with physiognomist have one be there must have be wrong have now asked question be bound to answer in way what ought to do john turned slowly round walked with away from destination round by south side of square then up along blank wall on east side nearly to passage into holborn back again round enclosed space while be speaking to listening to hardly remembered where be whither be going thought said in answer to question that intended to ask mr slow advice did mean to do more than tell what must be done be not friend know john be customary to ask lawyer advice on such subject 'd rather have yours john in truth what want to say be that be right in doing right in keeping promise to brother providing for child like most people margaret want to be advised to follow own counsel god know want to do right john want to hing else john what be right a to money care little for for be own have right to enjoy know much about enjoyment a to enjoyment seems to to be pretty much same whether person be rich poor always used to hear that money brought care be sure have found so since have have got child margaret there be orphan be not bound to look upon a mine now that have gone if depend on whom be to depend on if mind be made up margaret have nothing to say against know what wish be be just same now a when be last with be only for money say though of course must go long way with man circumstanced a be margaret love dearly if can make up mind to be wife must do best to make happy have meant to talk in way john said margaret be not much flurried be now so used to overture that did not come to a much out of common way gave none of personal credit woman be apt to take to when find be often sought in marriage looked upon lover a so many men to whom income must be convenient felt to be almost under obligation to for willingness to put up with incumbrance be attached to be only way can talk when ask about said then paused for moment before added how much be wish to give to brother widow half what have got left got left have lost of money have margaret then explained to fact a to loan took care to explain to also very fully compensatory fact of purchase by railway company promise to be made after have lent know urged do think ought to be deducted do indeed said be not speaking on own behalf now a for sake of child simply a man of business a for though do think have be hardly used in matter of uncle money will try to forget will try at rate to do without when first knew found found that liked so much own did have hope if must be there will be end of that child starve suppose oh john a for wo hanker after money for own sake margaret there will be more than enough for know john be going to make promise to tell something of intention towards son to make tender of assistance to being now in mind to live on smallest possible pittance of have before spoken when ceased speaking listening hurried on to attorney chamber do what like with be own said will do good by talking about longer out here so at last made way up to mr slow room on first floor in old house in lincoln inn field be informed that gentleman be at home must be pleased to sit down in waiting room there be think sadder place in world than waiting room attached to attorney chamber in london in instance be three cornered room have got wedged in between house fronted to lincoln inn field building in narrow lane ran at back of row there be carpet in hardly need of one a greater part of floor be strewed with bundle of dusty paper there be window in looked out from point of further angle against wall of opposite building dreariness of aspect have be thought to be too much for mind of who waited therefore bottom pane have be clouded so that there be in fact power of looking out at over fireplace there be table of descent relationship showing how heirship went table be very complicated describing not only heirship of ordinary real personal property also explaining wonderful difficulty of gavelkind other mysteriously traditional law table be a dirty a be complicated ordinary waiting reader must make nothing of there be small table in room near window be always covered with loose paper loose paper be on occasion again covered with sheet of parchment pale faced man of about thirty whose beard have never yet attained power to do more than sprout be sitting at table poring over parchment round room on shelf there be variety of iron box on be written name of mr slow client of client whose property justified in having special box of own box be there must be supposed for temporary purpose purpose might be described a almost permanently temporary for box be allowed to exist in absolute permanence of retirement be kept in iron room downstairs trap door into have yawned upon miss mackenzie a be shown into waiting room there be however one such box open on middle of floor sundry of parchment have be taken from be lying around there be two chair in room besides one occupied by man at table be taken by john ball cousin sat down armed with patience indifferent to delay indifferent to dusty ugliness of everything around a woman be on such occasion thinking much of time somewhat annoyed at being called upon to wait sat with chin resting on umbrella between leg a did so allowed eye to roam around among name upon box there be nothing on one of up on shelf attracted there be marquis of b sir c d dowager countess of e seeing speculated mildly whether mr slow put forward box of aristocratic customer to show how well be doing in world presently eye fell from shelf settled upon box on floor there on box saw name of walter mackenzie did not astonish a immediately said to that paper be being searched with reference to business on cousin be there that day suddenly occurred to that margaret have given to understand mr slow did not expect stepped over to therefore one step over paper asked question whispering into ear said have appointment think expects returned to seat again sitting down with chin on top of umbrella surveyed parchment lay upon ground upon one of be not far from foot read outer endorsement written a such endorsement always be in almost illegible old english letter jonathan ball to john ball junior deed of gift after there be nothing more than coincidence in of course mr slow must have in possession paper appertaining to transfer of jonathan ball property to mackenzie at rate such a referred to walter share of indeed mr slow at time of jonathan ball death acted for two brother be probable that paper must be with john ball have known that there have be intention on uncle part before quarrel between father uncle to make over to on coming of age certain property in london have be told that money mackenzie have inherited have ultimately come from very property uncle have be eccentric quarrelsome man prone to change mind often not regardful of money a far a be concerned john ball remembered to have heard that uncle have intended to become possessed of certain property in own right day that became of age that have be changed because of quarrel have taken place between uncle father father now never spoke of for many year past have seldom mentioned from mother have often heard of special injury have undergone uncle have said have given have taken back again have taken back that might waste on mackenzie have heard very often have never known anything of deed of gift be not singular thought that draft of such deed must be lying at foot at moment showed nothing of in face still sat there with chin resting on umbrella certainly stronger idea than usual of great wrong have suffered did come into head a looked upon paper at foot began to wonder whether must be justified in taking up inspecting a be thinking of pale faced man rose from chair after moving among paper on ground for instant selected very document carried with to table mr ball a eye followed parchment watched young man dust open then having flattened with hand glance over till came to certain spot pale faced clerk accustomed to such document glanced over ambage whereases aforesaids rich exuberance of admors exors assigns till deftly came to pith of matter then began to make extract date here date there john ball watched time till door be opened old mr slow appeared in room stepped across paper to shake hand with client then shook hand also with mr ball whom knew eye glanced at once down to box after over towards pale faced clerk mr ball perceived that attorney have joined in own mind operation be going on with special document presence of two special visitor that in measure regretted coincidence there be something wrong john ball began to consider whether old lawyer must be old scoundrel lawyer knew be desperate scoundrel said nothing however obeying mr slow invitation followed cousin into sanctum sanctorum of chamber did tell be here at first said lawyer in tone of vexation must have have shown in there john ball thought that be doubtless true very probably might not have be put in among paper have mr slow known what be being done truth be continued lawyer duke of f man of business be with did not like to interrupt mr slow be grey haired old man nearer eighty than seventy who with exception of fortnight holiday year always spent at margate have attended same chamber in lincoln inn field daily for last sixty year be stout thickset man very leisurely in motion who walked slowly talked slowly read slowly wrote slowly thought slowly who nevertheless have reputation of doing great deal of business doing very well have partner in business almost a old a named bideawhile who knew used to speculate of two be most leisurely be however generally felt that though mr slow be slowest in speech mr bideawhile be longest in getting anything said mr slow must often beguile time with unnecessary remark mr bideawhile be so constant in beguiling time that men wondered how in truth ever did anything at of of may be said that men stood higher in profession that mr suspicion have be known in neighbourhood of lincoln inn must have be scouted a utterly baseless for comfort of reader let assure that be utterly baseless there might perhaps have be little vanity about mr slow a to name of aristocratic client be honest painstaking man who have ever done duty well by who have employed be not remarkable that common repute give to attorney in general be exactly opposite to man give to own attorney in particular whom doe anybody trust so implicitly a trust own attorney yet be not case that body of attorney be supposed to be most roguish body in existence old man seemed now to be little fretful said something more about sorrow at having be sent into room be so crowded said that hardly know how to stir miss mackenzie said did not signify in least mr ball said nothing seated with chin again resting on umbrella be so sorry to see in paper account of brother death said mr slow yes mr slow have gone left wife very large family hope be provided for miss mackenzie indeed be not provided for at brother have not be fortunate in business yet went into with large capital with large capital in such business a john ball with chin on umbrella said nothing said nothing winced a thought whence capital have come thought too of much meaning word jonathan ball to john ball junior deed of gift have be unfortunate said miss mackenzie in apologetic tone what will do about loan said mr slow looking over to john ball when asked question a though inquiring whether miss mackenzie affair be to be talked over openly in presence of gentleman be gift said miss mackenzie deed of gift thought john ball to deed of gift oh indeed then there be end of suppose said mr slow exactly so have be explaining to cousin about hope firm will be able to pay sister in law interest on that doe not seem sure be afraid can not help there miss mackenzie of course not be not thinking of what have come about be then told mr slow whole of project with reference to fortune how on death bed have promised to give half of that have to brother wife family how have come there to with cousin in order that might put in way of keeping promise mr slow sat in silence patiently heard to end finding thus encouraged to speak expatiated on solemnity of promise declared that must not be comfortable till have done that have undertaken to perform will have quite enough for afterwards mr slow quite enough mr slow did not say word till have done even then seemed to delay speech john ball never raised face from umbrella sat looking at lawyer whom still suspected of roguery if lawyer be rogue what then about cousin must not be supposed that suspected what must come of if fortune held be in truth not own have told cousin about continued margaret believe that think be doing right at rate must hing without knowing think be giving sister in law too much said john ball be only doing what promised urged margaret think that money lent to firm must at rate be deducted said john ball speaking with kind of proviso to that word so spoken be intended to be taken a having meaning only on presumption that document have seen in other room must turn out to be wholly inoperative inefficient at present moment in answer to side question corollary point a to deduction non

why postpone said brother death be very recent happened not above fortnight since think want to have settled at once so that there will be distress what be good of waiting such thing want thinking of miss mackenzie have thought of want now be to have done slight smile came across puckered grey face of lawyer a felt imperative nature of instruction given to lady have come there not to be advised to have work done for out of hand smile be very melancholy soon passed away be widow in immediate distress asked mr slow now fact be that miss mackenzie have be in good fund having have ready money in hand from time of brother walter death for last year have by mean spent full income have therefore given sister in law money have paid small debt have come in a such small debt will come in directly

mackenzie explained that mr tom intended if possible to keep house to take lady in to lodge with then there can not be immediate hurry urged lawyer a sum of money in question be large really think matter must be considered miss mackenzie still pressed be very anxious to make understand of course did understand at once that have wish to hurry in work that required of be assurance that accepted instruction that thing must be done with not more than ordinary amount of legal delay can pay what like out of own income said lawyer be not what promised said margaret mackenzie then there be silence among mr ball have said very little since have be sitting in room now be not who broke silence be still thinking of deed of gift wondering whether have anything to do with mr slow unwillingness to undertake commission margaret wished to give at last mr slow got up from chair spoke a follows mr hope will excuse have word two to say to miss mackenzie have rather say to alone certainly said mr ball rising preparing to go will wait for john said miss mackenzie asking favour of a though be very anxious that must grant mr slow said that might be closeted with miss mackenzie for little time perhaps for quarter of hour twenty minute john ball looked at watch then at cousin face then promised that must wait mr slow took into outer office then handed chair observed that be not allowed to go back into waiting room there waited for three quarter of hour constantly looking at watch thinking more more about deed of gift surely must be case that document have seen have reference to great delay at last heard door open step along passage then door be opened mr slow reappeared with margaret mackenzie behind john ball eye immediately fell on cousin face must see that be very pale lawyer wore that smile men put on when wish to cover disagreeable seriousness of moment good morning miss mackenzie said pressing client hand good morning sir said lawyer mr ball then touched other hand former followed cousin down step out into square chapter xviii tribulation when be once more out in square side by side miss mackenzie took hold of cousin arm walked on for few step in silence in direction of great queen street be to say away from city towards knew cousin must go in pursuit of own business indeed hour be now close at hand in must be sitting a director at shadrach fire assurance office if not at shadrach by two with possible allowance for shortcoming of generally punctual director by quarter past two must be too late for guinea now a looked at watch wanted only ten minute to two be very particular about guinea chamber of shadrach be away in old broad street nevertheless walked on with john said when have walked length of side of square have heard dreadful news then deed of gift be after fact mr slow instead of being rogue must be honestest old lawyer in london must have be at work in discovering wrong have be done be now about to reveal to world such idea a have glimmered across mr ball mind a have sat in mr slow outer office with chin still resting on umbrella though such idea a did cross mind thought on instant be of cousin what dreadful news margaret be about money stop moment margaret be sure that ought to tell to if to whom will tell how can bear without telling to one did mr slow bid speak of to no bade think much of before did so a be concerned said that might perhaps be disappointed then walked on again in silence john ball found position to be very difficult hardly knew how to speak to how to carry if be to be that money be to come back to if be now in spite of have come gone if wrong done be to be righted property wrested from be to be restored restored to who wanted so sorely how must not triumph in such act of tardy restitution remembered particular at moment twelve thousand pound of uncle jonathan money have gone to walter mackenzie sum once intended for have be much more than more believed than double that if twelve thousand pound be now restored to how different must make whole tenor of life mr slow said that might be disappointed then mr slow be not lawyer did not owe to family immediately to go to own attorney now thought no more of guinea at shadrach walked on by cousin side with mind intently fixed on uncle money be still leaning on arm tell john what will do said looking up into face must not be better for better for interest of that must be separated be probable possible that with interest so adverse must give other good advice did not behove to explain to till must be settled between must necessarily regard other a enemy for moment two wished away from be calculating how might escape then when looked down at saw softness of eye felt confidence implied in weight of hand upon arm hard heart be softened relented be difficult to tell what must do said at present nothing seems to be known have said nothing for certain must understand said in reply must see by face knew by tone of voice that be almost certain know that be sure of john will be beggar absolute beggar will have nothing poor child will be beggar mother feel a though did not know where be what be doing then idea came into head if money be not hers be if be not then be hers must not be well that must solve difficulty by agreeing then there to be man wife be true that since rachel death have seen woman whom so much coveted to have in home a one who now leaned on arm a thought of there seemed to be romance about step must not befit must mother father say to if after trouble be at last to marry woman without farthing then too must consent to give up further consideration for brother family must agree to abandon idea of assisting if ultimately must turn out that property be hers there be certainly looseness about plan did not befit moreover be to attempt must probably not succeed something must be done now at moment guinea at shadrach be gone for ever therefore must devote for day to cousin be to hear again from mr slow said be to go to day week then will be decided john be decided now be sure of feel that be gone careful man like must never have spoken a did unless be sure will be yours john so must have be that brother have said suppose so be dreadful to think of very dreadful can only promise will spend nothing till be decided john wish must take from have lest must go absolutely have hand upon purse in pocket said slowly need think of nothing of sort what be to do where be to go while week pass by will stay where be of course oh john if must understand how be to look aunt in face know that must not wish to have there at if be poor creature without anything poor creature did not know how terribly heavy be accusation be bringing against aunt what will say when know that money have spent have never really be own then counselled to say nothing about to aunt till after next visit to mr slow made understand that must not mention subject at cedar till week be passed must go said to own lawyer tell whole story a far a knew be not that in least doubted mr slow honesty judgment must be better that two must act together then when week be over margaret must once more go to lincoln inn field what week will have said will be nervous time for answered what must do after question asked not in least a desirous of obtaining from assurance of assistance in agony of spirit in sheer dismay a to prospect must hope for best said god temper wind to shorn lamb have often thought of way in have be shorn did not at moment remember that shearing have never be so tempered a to be acceptable to own feeling in god only can trust answered a said mind went away to littlebath stumfoldians mr maguire be there not great mercy in fact that ruin have not found married to unfortunate clergyman what must say at littlebath when heard story how must mr stumfold exult over downfall of woman who have rebelled against how must nose of coachmaker wife rise in air how must mr maguire rejoice that great calamity have not fallen upon margaret mackenzie heart spirit have be sullied by mean feeling with reference to own wealth have never puffed up with exultation calculated on meanness of others a though be matter of course not indeed knowing that be meanness blaming in way for attributed to four gentleman have wished to marry during past year never occurred to now that one of four must on account hold out hand to help in losing money must have lost be desirable in eye seemed to to be natural be still walking round lincoln inn field john exclaimed suddenly must go to in gower street what now to day yes now immediately need not mind can get back to twickenham by know train if be margaret must not go till be decided be decided john know be how can leave in condition spending money will never get must know time sooner better mr rubb must know too must understand that be more than ever bound to provide with income out of business must not do to day if be must john very day if be not home by dinner tell have to go to gower street will at rate be there in evening mind coming back with be then at gate leading into new square turned abruptly round hurried away from up into holborn passing very near to mr slow chamber john ball did not attempt to follow stood there awhile looking after felt in heart knew by judgment that be good woman true unselfish full of love clever too in way quick in apprehension endowed with admirable courage have heard spoken of at cedar a poor creature who have money nay have taken part in so speaking of now have money knew well that be creature very reverse of poor what must do for in what way must behave towards in early day of youth before care of world have made hard have married rachel without penny father have laughed at mother have grieved over tough hard careworn a be now defiled by price of stock saturated with poison of money market then there have be in touch of romance dash of poetry have be happy with rachel must try again now woman must surely love when found that came to in poverty a have before come to in wealth watched till passed out of sight along wall leading to holborn then made way to city through lincoln inn chancery lane margaret walked straight into holborn over towards red lion square crossed line of omnibus feeling that now must spend penny must save be tired for have already walked much that morning day be close hot nevertheless went on quickly through bloomsbury square russell square to gower street a got near to door heart almost failed went up to knocked boldly thing must be done let pain of doing be what might law miss margaret be that said maid yes missus be at home will see of course be hard at work on furniture then went directly up into drawing room there found sister in law with dress tucked up to elbow with cloth in hand rubbing chair what margaret expected to see if be to let room be a well to have thing tidy be besides person bear better when there be anything to do then mary jane eldest daughter came in from bedroom behind drawing room similarly armed for work margaret sat down wearily upon sofa having muttered word in answer to mr tom apology for having be found at work so soon after husband death sarah said have come to to day because have something to say to about business oh to be sure never thought for moment have come for pleasure out of civility a might be of course did expect when saw sarah will come upstairs with into own room upstairs margaret oh yes if please will be down directly dear dare say margaret will stay to tea tea early because since went have dined at one then mr tom led way up to room in margaret have watched by dying brother bed side be come in here said mr tom again apologising because child have to come out of room behind drawing room miss colza be staying with mary jane have room margaret did not care much for solemnity of chamber in when last saw brother body be lying added something to sadness at moment sarah said endeavouring to warn sister in law by tone of voice that news be bad news have just come from mr slow be lawyer be yes be lawyer know what promised brother went to to make arrangement for doing when there heard oh sarah such dreadful news say be not to do suppose in woman voice eye there be sign of anger not against mr slow alone also against miss mackenzie knew how must be margaret mr slow have got nothing to do with promise be promise promise made to dying man oh margaret if have to give must give a surely a be standing here when told brother must be so believed at once of course believed sarah tell now have nothing to give who tell so lawyer can not explain to indeed a yet understand have learned morning that property walter left be not to leave have be given away before mr jonathan ball died be lie said injured woman woman who be least injured who with child have perhaps best excuse for being ill able to bear injury must be lie be more than twenty year ago believe wo believe that can be so john ball must have something to do with property will go to have have nothing to do with mr slow found out ca be so not after twenty year may have done from walter ca take away from not if have spirit enough to stand up for right if let take in way ca tell what will think of be own lawyer say so yes mr slow biggest rogue of always knew that of always oh margaret think of child be to do what be to do sitting down on bedside put dirty apron up to eye have be thinking of ever since heard said margaret what good will thinking do must do something oh margaret after that said to when lay there dying woman with approach to true pathos put hand on spot where husband head have rested let child come to beggary because men like choose to rob widow orphan one have right to what be own said margaret even though widow must be beggar orphan must want be very well of margaret be very well for to say that who have friend like ball to stand by perhaps if will let have without saying anything will stand by firmer than ever who be there to stand by child ca be that after twenty year fortune must belong to anyone else why must have gone on for more than twenty year nobody have found out believe can come so margaret unless choose to let do believe word of there be nothing more to be said upon subject at present mr tom did indeed say great deal more about sometimes threatening margaret sometimes imploring miss mackenzie must not allow to speak of thing otherwise than a ascertained fact have other woman be more reasonable le passionate in lamentation miss mackenzie might have trusted to tell that there be yet doubt felt that doubt be so small that in mr tom mind must be so magnified into nearly certainty on other side that thought most discreet not to refer to exact amount of information mr slow have given to will be best for to think sarah said trying to turn other mind away from coveted income must never posse to think what child have better do oh dear oh dear oh dear be very bad there be always something to be done must lose time in letting mr rubb know truth when hears how be will understand that something must be done for out of firm wo do anything be downstairs now flirting with girl in drawing room instead of being at business if be downstairs will see a mr mackenzie made objection to margaret went downstairs when came near passage at bottom heard voice of people talking merrily in parlour a hand be on lock of door word from miss colza became very audible now mr rubb be quiet so knocked at door having be invited by mr rubb to come in opened may be presumed that flirting have not gone to perilous extent a there be three four child present nevertheless miss colza mr rubb be somewhat disconcerted expressed surprise at seeing miss mackenzie thought be staying with baronet lady said miss colza miss mackenzie explained that be staying at twickenham that have come up to pay visit to sister in law have word two want to say to mr rubb if will allow suppose then 'd better make scarce said miss colza a be not asked to stay did make herself scarce taking child with up among table chair in drawing room there found mary jane did not find mr mackenzie who have thrown on bed in agony upstairs then miss mackenzie told wretched story to mr rubb telling for third time be awe struck a listened did not once attempt to deny fact a have be done by mr mackenzie be sure asked when story be over suppose be quite sure yet indeed mr slow said be not quite sure have not allowed to doubt doubt if have not felt sure must not have told just so mr rubb be what think therefore have given sister in law hint that there be chance left think have better not do so either perhaps not said spoke in low voice almost whispering a though be half scared by tidings have heard be very dreadful said very dreadful for sarah child for too miss mackenzie about mr rubb what can do for out of business looked very blank made immediate answer know will feel for position said do do not indeed do miss mackenzie will do what can can at rate ensure interest of money of money know came from still mr rubb sat in silence thought that must be stonyhearted surely might undertake to do knowing a so well knew way in money have be obtained knowing also that have already said that so much must be forthcoming out of firm to make up general income for family of late partner surely there will be doubt about mr rubb ball will claim debt said hoarsely then in answer to inquiry explained that sum have lent have not in truth be hers to lend have formed part of money that john ball must claim mr slow held in hand acknowledgement of debt from rubb mackenzie of course mr ball must claim that interest must be paid to must claim principal too if on inquiry must find that firm must be able to raise know that must be able to come upon firm for money brother put into business said gloomily think will be such fool a that 'd get nothing by then may god help said miss mackenzie what will do asked shook head made answer a for herself have not begun to form plan own condition did not seem to to be nearly so dreadful a of young child wish knew how to help said samuel rubb there be position mr rubb in one god can help one perhaps perhaps may still do something for child will try miss mackenzie thank may god bless will bless if try 'who giveth drop of water to one of in name giveth also to ' will think of will not will think of do best can have hoped to have made so comfortable god will be done god will be done think have better go now mr rubb there will be use in going to upstairs again tell from with love that will hear from when have seen lawyer will try to come to perhaps may not be able good bye mr rubb good bye miss mackenzie hope will see other sometimes perhaps so do what can to support will want that friend can do for so saying went out of room let out of front door into street began walk back to waterloo station have not broken bread in sister in law house be now nearly six o'clock have taken nothing since have breakfasted at twickenham affair of day have be such a to give little time to think of such want now a made weary way through street became sick with hunger went into baker shop for bun a ate felt that be almost wrong in to buy even at present moment nothing that possessed seemed to to be by right own shilling in purse be property of john ball if mr slow statement be true then when bun be finished a went down by bloomsbury church region of st giles back to strand did begin to think of own position what must do how must commence to do have declared to herself lately that work for be fittest be that of nursing sick be not possible that might earn bread in way must not find such employment in quarter where labour must be worth food must eat raiment must require there be hospital somewhere in london with thought have heard that john ball be connected might not obtain for situation such a that be past eight when reached cedar then be very tired very tired nearly sick also with want went first of up to room then crept down into drawing room knowing that must find at tea when entered there be large party round table consisting of girl child lady ball john ball who never took tea be sitting in accustomed place near lamp old baronet be half asleep in arm chair if be going to dine in gower street margaret why did say so said lady ball in answer to margaret burst out into tear be not unkindness of aunt voice that upset so much a own weakness terrible struggle of long day what on earth be matter said sir john one of girl brought cup of tea felt to be too weak to take in hand made sign that must be put on table be not aware that have ever fainted fear came upon that might do so now rallied struggled striving to collect strength do know what be matter with john said lady ball then john ball asked if have have dinner when did not answer saw how be mother said have have food day will get for if want anything servant can bring to john said mother must not trust servant in matter went out fetched meat wine pressed to take sat beside spoke kind word into ear at last in sort be comforted chapter xix showing how two of miss mackenzie lover behaved mr ball on return home to cedar have given definite answer to mother inquiry a to day work in london have found difficult to make reply to must for moment suffice be not woman easily satisfied with evasive answer nevertheless told nothing of what have occurred left simply in bad humour conversation have taken place before dinner after dinner asked question john might a well tell be engaged to margaret mackenzie be not said son angrily after that mother humour have become worse than before in state niece have found when returned home in evening have suffered in consequence on next morning miss mackenzie sent down word to say be not well must not come down to breakfast so happened that john ball be going into town on day also abednego life office holding board day immediately after of shadrach fire office therefore be not able to see before encountered mother lady ball went up to in bedroom immediately after breakfast there remained with for time aunt at first be tender with giving tea only asking gentle little question at interval a old lady became impatient at learning nothing began system of cross question at last grew to be angry disagreeable son have distinctly told that be not engaged to cousin have in fact told nothing else distinctly when have seen how careful have be in supplying margaret want with what anxious solicitude have pressed wine on how have sat by saying soft word to lady ball when remembered must not think that son have deceived if so why have wished to deceive must be that have allowed to give away money have promised to marry with other half there be moment in dear son john must be very foolish in spite of life long devotion to price of stock for be conspicuous still remembered a though be other day how have persisted in marrying rachel though rachel brought nothing with sweet face light figure happy temper clothes on back to mother son be ever young to old lady ball john ball be still young still possibly capable of such folly a of be thinking if be not so if there be not something of kind in wind why must why must be so hard uncommunicative in answer there lay niece however sick with headache therefore weak very much in lady ball power evil to be done be great necessity for preventing might be immediate lady ball be lady who did not like to be kept in dark in reference to anything concerning family having gone downstairs therefore for hour so to look after servant a have said to allow margaret to have little sleep returned again to charge sitting close to margaret pillow did best to find out truth if must only have known whole truth how son thought be running throughout day even a sat at abednego board not on margaret with fortune on margaret with none how be recalling sweetness of face a looked up to in square took by coat tear a spoke of orphan child grace of figure a have walked away from persistency of courage in doing what thought to be right how be struggling within with endeavour vain endeavour at resolution that marriage a must be out of question have lady ball known that think must have flown to office of abednego after son never have left till have conquered heart trampled folly under foot did not conquer margaret mackenzie poor creature lying there racked in truth with pain sorrow altogether incapable of escape from aunt gripe must not say word might tend to ease lady ball mind if have told that knew that surmised how must aunt have rejoiced that money must come without wife must indeed have be triumph margaret in telling must have have nothing to tell of terribly foolish thought be then at work in city to such state of thing a have hinted must have seemed quite a improbable quite a unaccountable a must have done to aunt did not tell in truth did tell anything john be with at lawyer said lady ball attempting cross examination for third time yes be with there what did say when asked mr slow to make such settlement a that did say anything aunt whole thing be put off know be put off of course be put off did suppose respectable lawyer in london must have dreamed of doing such thing what want to know be how be put off what did mr slow say be to see again next week not to get to do anything of kind ca tell aunt what be to do then what did say when made proposition a did not tell that be quite out of question think said that aunt then what did say margaret never saw such person a be why must be so mysterious there ca be anything want to know seeing how very much be concerned do think ought to tell occurred knowing a do have done very best to be kind to indeed there be anything can tell not yet then lady ball remained silent at bed head for space perhaps of ten minute meditating over if son be in truth engaged to woman at rate must find that out if asked point blank question on subject margaret must not be able to leave unanswered must hardly be able to give directly false answer dear said think will not refuse to tell plainly whether there be anything between john a mother have right to know how anything between said margaret raising on elbow be engaged to marry oh dear there be nothing of sort going on nothing at be determined still to refuse be quite out of question aunt doe not wish at may be sure that have quite changed mind about wo have changed mind if have given up plan about sister in law have changed altogether aunt need think anything more about that think more about nevertheless be thinking about very moment a voted for accepting doubtful life at abednego be urged on board by director who hope have intimate personal relation with owner of doubtful life in question lady ball did not know what to make of for many year past have not seen son carry so much like lover a have done when sat beside cousin pressing to drink glass of sherry why be so anxious for comfort why before have be so studiously reticent a to affair ca make anything out of said lady ball getting up from chair with angry alacrity must say that think very ungrateful of seeing have done for so saying left room what oh what must think when must come to know truth margaret told a lay there holding head between hand that be even now occupying that room enjoying questionable comfort of bed under false pretence when be known that be absolutely pauper must then be made welcome to uncle house be now remaining there without divulging circumstance under advice by authority of cousin have resolved to be guided by in thing a long a must be at trouble to guide on whom else must depend nevertheless position be very grievous to more so now that aunt have twitted with ingratitude when servant came to felt that have right to girl service when message be brought to from lady ball asking whether must be taken out in carriage acknowledged to herself that such courtesy to be altogether out of place on evening cousin said nothing to on next day went again up to town what four day running john said lady ball at breakfast have particular business to day mother said on that evening when came back found moment to take margaret by hand tell that own lawyer also be to meet at mr slow chamber on day named took thus held hand closely in while be speaking said nothing to more tender than nature of communication required john be terribly mysterious said lady ball to minute two afterwards if there be anything do hate be mystery in family never have with till came on next day letter reached have be redirected from gower street be from mr maguire took up into own room to read answer letter reply be a follows littlebath oct dearest margaret hope circumstance of case will in opinion justify in writing to again though be sorry to intrude upon at time when heart must yet be sore with grief for loss of lamented brother be now in to other a hope may still be before long must be sweet privilege to wipe eye comfort in sorrow bid remember that be lord who giveth lord who taketh away blessed be name of lord doubt that have spoken to daily in word nay almost hourly since brother be taken from have not privilege of knowing if be in way like sister must have be friend whom must have delighted to press to breast carry in heart of heart now dearest margaret will allow to intrude upon with theme of course well know subject upon at present be thinking more than on other may be permitted to hope that subject sometimes present to in light be not altogether disagreeable when left littlebath so suddenly carried away on mission of love kindness left a will doubtlessly remember in state of suspense have kindly consented to acknowledge be not altogether indifferent to be not true said margaret to herself almost out loud never told anything of kind be arranged that on very day be to have have meeting to will confess looked forward a happiest moment of life can hardly tell what feeling be when found that be going must only just say to farewell if must only have be with when letter came think must have softened sorrow perhaps then in gentleness might have said word must have left nothing to wish for in world have be otherwise ordered margaret complain what make write now be great necessity must know exactly how stand said something in last dear letter gave to understand that wished to do something for brother family promise made by bed side of dying be always dangerous in case of roman catholic have be found to be replete with ruin mr maguire doubt forgot that in such case promise be made by not to dying person nevertheless be far from saying that must not be kept in modified form need not for moment think that if may be allowed to have interest in matter must wish to hinder from doing may be becoming think may promise that will find mercenary spirit in although of course be bound looking forward to tender tie will hope connect to regard interest above other worldly affair if may then say word of advice be to recommend that nothing permanent be done till can act together in matter however suppose that anything can do have done can alter nature of regard now dearest margaret will not allow to press for immediate answer to appeal will tell exactly how be circumstanced then will see how strong be reason that there must be delay very many people here may say elite of evangelical circle including mr perch mr perch be coachmaker wife who have always be so true to mr stumfold desired must establish church here on own bottom quite independent of mr stumfold stumfolds must then soon have to leave littlebath there be doubt of have already made so unendurable father together be so distressing that best of society have fallen away from treatment to be such that must never endure afterwards now opening for clergyman with pure gospel doctrine must be best thing have turned up for long time church must be worth over six hundred year besides interest of money must have to be laid out must have commenced at once secure incumbency if must myself subscription list with two thousand pound must not be le than will understand that money must not be given though doubt great many person must in way be induced to give theirs pew rent must go in first instance to provide interest for money not given lent a must of course be case with money if must advance must not think of plan a if did not feel that be best thing for interest be if a fondly hope be ever to call mine of course in case be only common prudence on part to do can to insure for professional income for sake for dearest margaret brightest earthly hope be to see with everything comfortable around if must be arranged must be quite within mean to keep sort of carriage here must be fine opportunity for rivalling mr stumfold be temptation with hoped to allure thing must be done quite immediately therefore let pray not to postpone hope with unnecessary delay know seems unromantic to urge lady with pecuniary consideration think that under circumstance a have explained will forgive believe to be dearest margaret yours with truest most devoted affection jereh maguire one man have wanted money to buy house on mortgage now asked for to build church giving promising to give security of pew rent of two be worst be lover thought that be worst who first made love then tried to get money be idea at once occurred to upon reading mr maguire letter have quite wit enough to see through whole project how outsider be to be induced to give money thinking that be to be given whereas inside temple who knew about be simply to make for good speculation cousin john constant solicitude for money be bad after be not so bad a told at once that letter be one must of have ended everything between mr maguire even have nothing occurred to put absolute imperative stop to affair mr maguire pressed for early answer before left room sat down wrote cedar twickenham october dear sir before wrote word dear sir have to think much of not having have a yet much experience in writing letter to gentleman concluded at last that if simply wrote sir must take a insult that if wrote dear mr maguire must under circumstance be too affectionate dear sir have got letter to day hasten to answer at once that to allude between must be considered a being altogether over be very sorry that must have have so much trouble circumstance be altogether changed can not explain how a must make letter very long may be assured that such be case to so great extent that engagement speak of must not at suit at present pray take a being quite true believe to be very humble servant margaret mackenzie feel that letter be somewhat curt dry a answer to effusion so full of affection a gentleman have written fair reader when remembers that miss mackenzie have given gentleman considerable encouragement will probably think that must have expressed something like regret at so sudden termination to so tender friendship in truth regarded offer a having be made to money solely a in fact no longer existing a offer now that money be no longer in existence be angry with mr maguire for word have written about brother affair for wish to limit kindness to nephew niece also for greediness in being desirous of getting money at once a to main question thought bound to answer plainly a must have answered man who came to buy from house house be longer in possession mr maguire when received letter did not believe word of did not in least believe that have actually lost everything have once belonged to that if married now must obtain le than must have done have married before brother death thought that brother family friend have got hold of in london that mr rubb might very probably have done that be striving to obtain command of money be influencing to desert thinking so being man of good courage took resolution to follow game to see whether even yet might not obtain good thing have made eye glisten mouth water knew that there be very much against in race that be desirous of running that heiress with did not know how much year have be rumoured among stumfoldians that be over thousand might not again fall in way there be very many thing against of be quite conscious have not shilling of own be in receipt of professional income be not altogether young man there be in personal appearance defect many lady might find difficult to overcome then little story about debt miss todd have picked up be not only true be degree under truth doubt have great wish that wife must be comfortable also for have long be pining after eligible comfort when appertain to clergyman world with so much malice persists in calling flesh pot of egypt thinking of of position have already gained in spite of personal disadvantage of great chance there be that margaret might yet be rescued from philistine resolved upon journey to london in meantime miss mackenzie other lover have not be idle also be resolved by mean to give up battle can not be said that mr rubb be not mercenary in view with desire for lady money be mingled much be courageous something also be generous whole truth have be told to a plainly a have be told to mr ball nevertheless determined to persevere went to work diligently on very afternoon deserting smile of miss colza made such inquiry into law of matter a be possible to resulted a far a miss mackenzie be concerned in appearing late one afternoon at front door of sir john ball house on day following miss mackenzie be to keep appointment with mr slow cousin be now up in london among lawyer miss mackenzie be sitting with aunt when mr rubb called be in drawing room lady ball who have a yet succeeded in learning nothing who be more than ever convinced that there be much to

very quiet till margaret little after tea took candle went off wearily to room then business of day a regarded cedar began for john ball before went to bed told father mother whole story story be a far a money be concerned also a far a margaret conduct to be concerned of own feeling towards said nothing have behaved admirably mother said must acknowledge think that be entitled to kindness can

nature have deserted except on one occasion when remarked that be like brother jonathan to do a much harm with money a be within reach memory in such matter be worth nothing absolutely nothing old man have said always supposed something be wrong remember left to lawyer in lady ball room conversation be prolonged to late hour of night took various twist turn a such conversation will do what be to do about young woman be lady ball main question arising doubt from reflection that world must lean very heavily on if absolutely turned out to starve in street john ball made proposition in answer to having not a yet made up mind a to what own wish be with reference to young woman then mother made proposition of course that money due by rubbs must be paid let take son made reply to other than that feared rubbs be not in condition to pay money must pay interest at rate said lady ball till have got into other way of life must do admirably for companion to old lady because manner be good doe not want much waiting upon on next morning miss mackenzie trembled in shoe a came down to breakfast uncle whom feared most must not be there meeting with aunt when aunt must know that be pauper that have for last week be impostor be terrible to by anticipation have not calculated that aunt triumph in newly acquired wealth for ball family must for present cover other feeling might exist aunt met with gracious smile be very urbane in selecting chair for at prayer close to own pressed upon piece of buttered toast out of little dish be always prepared for ladyship own consumption after breakfast john ball again went to town went daily to town during present crisis on occasion mother made remark a to urgency of business when be gone lady ball began to potter about house after daily custom be longer in pottering than be usual with miss mackenzie helped younger child in lesson a often did when time for luncheon came have almost begun to think that be to be allowed to escape conversation with aunt touching great money question be not so at one be told that luncheon child dinner be postponed till two be asked by servant to go up to lady ball in own room come sit down dear said lady ball in sweetest voice have got to be very cold have better come near fire margaret did a be bidden sat down in chair immediately opposite to aunt be wonderful story john have told continued aunt very wonderful be sad enough for said margaret who did not feel inclined to be so self forgetful in talking to aunt a have be with cousin be sad for margaret doubt be sure have within that conscientious rectitude of purpose that must not wish to keep anything for that in truth belongs to to margaret answered nothing aunt went on be great change to doubt of course be point on wish to speak to most especially have told john that something must be done for jarred terribly on poor margaret feeling cousin have said nothing not word a to doing anything for man who have told her of love asked to be wife not twelve month since who have pressed to be of woman dearest to nearest have talked to of ruin without offering aid although ruin to must enrich very greatly have expected nothing from have wanted nothing from by degree when absent from feeling have grown upon that have be hard to in abstaining from expression of commiseration have yielded to in whole affair assuring that nothing must be done by to cause trouble must have be grateful to if in return have said something to of future mode of life have intended to speak to about hospital have thought that might abstain from doing so till must ask question a to plan have asked no such question be now almost determined to go away without troubling on subject if who have once professed to love must make suggestion a to future life must ill bear that offer of kind must come from aunt who a knew have only regarded her for money must rather replied that nothing must be said to on subject why not margaret desire may be burden to anybody will go away earn bread even if can not do that relation will not be troubled by hearing from said without sobbing not without almost hysterical emotion indicates that tear be being suppressed with pain be false pride dear very well aunt daresay be false be pride may be allowed to keep pride though can keep nothing else what say about earning bread be very proper john uncle also have be thinking of must be glad if additional assistance must be provided for in event of old age know illness now a to earning bread remarked to john that be peculiarly qualified for being lady companion for being what aunt for being companion to lady in decline of life who must want to have nice mannered person always with have advantage of being ladylike gentle think that be patient by disposition aunt said miss mackenzie voice a spoke be hardly gentle be indicative of much patience hysteric also seemed for time to have given way to strong passionate feeling aunt said must sooner take broom in hand sweep crossing in london than lead life a what make slave of old woman who must think that have bought power of tyrannising over by allowing to sit in same room with indeed may very likely be case may have to serve one in kitchen will be in kitchen not in drawing room have not have much experience in life have have enough to learn that lesson lady ball who during first part of conversation have be unrolling winding great ball of worsted now sat perfectly still holding ball in lap staring at niece be quick witted woman doubt occurred to that great objection to living with old lady niece have expressed so passionately must have come from trial of sort of life have have at cedar there be enough in miss mackenzie manner to justify lady ball in thinking that such expression of feeling a have be intended by have never before heard margaret speak out so freely even in day of undoubted heiress ship now though greatly disliked niece must not avoid mingling something of respect something almost amounting to fear with dislike did not dare to go on unwinding worsted giving advantage of condescension to young woman who spoke out at in way thought be advising for best said hoped that must have be thankful know what may be for best said margaret again bordering upon hysterical in tremulousness of voice that be sure must be for worst however have made up mind to nothing a yet dear of course not must think of know cousin john have not thought of did not want one else to do so especially did not want aunt to think of be doubt necessary that aunt must consider how long must be required to provide home for impoverished niece margaret mind at once applied to view of subject have made up mind will go to london next week then must settle upon something mean when go to mr slow

respecting margaret to mother acerbated that lady more than ever against niece have not proposed that anything special must be done have hinted when mother complained of margaret that margaret conduct be everything that ought to be believe must take anybody part against lady ball have said then a matter of course have be very cross whole of day be terrible to miss mackenzie resolved that nothing said by cousin must induce to postpone departure for day in order to insure by few minute private conversation with also with view of escaping for short time from house walked down to station in evening to meet cousin train by arrived reached twickenham at five o'clock walk occupied about twenty minute met just a be coming out of station gate at once told that have come there for sake of

london on business mr maguire made up mind to go to london to look after lady love when found there did not quite know what to do be often case with that make up mind for great action that in special crisis of life resolve that something must be done that make energetic start find very soon that know how to go on doing anything be so with mr maguire when have secured bed at small public house near great western railway station thinking doubt that must go to great hotel on next coming to town must then have obtained lady fortune scarcely knew what step must next take margaret last letter have be written to from cedar thought probable that might only have gone there for day two knew address of house in gower street at last resolved that must go boldly in among enemy there for be assured that family of lady late brother be special enemy in case be considerably past noon when reached london be about three when with hesitating hand loud knock presented at mr mackenzie door first asked for miss mackenzie be told that be not staying there be thereupon to leave card go away have told that in pursuit of heiress must probably be called upon to dare much if did not begin to show daring at once how must respect trust to for future daring so boldly asked for mr mackenzie be at once shown into parlour there sat widow in full lugubrious weed there sat miss colza there sat mary jane be busy hemming darning clipping turning old sheet into new one for now be more than ever necessary that mr mackenzie must make money at once by taking in lodger when mr maguire be shown into room lady rose from chair with sheet in hand in lap then a stood before at other side of table lady again sat down gentleman a be asking for miss servant have said that same cook to whom mr grandairs have be so severe on occasion of mr mackenzie dinner party other girl have be unnecessary to in poverty have left name be rev mr maguire from littlebath where have pleasure of knowing miss mackenzie then widow asked to take chair took chair sister in law be not with at present said mr mackenzie be staying for visit with aunt lady ball at cedar twickenham said mary jane who have contrived to drop sheet hustle under table with foot a soon a learned that visitor be clergyman lady ball be lady of sir john ball baronet said miss colza whose good nature made desirous of standing up for honour of family with be for time domesticated knew have be at lady ball said clergyman a heard from from thence thought have probably returned oh dear said widow ai returned here mean have room for be truth have mary jane that have not mamma think aunt margaret must think of thing then thought mr maguire ball must have got hold of heiress not mackenzie battle must be fought at cedar not here still a be there thought possibly might obtain further information must be easier if a appeared to be case there be enmity between gower street family relative have miss mackenzie gone to live permanently at cedar asked not that know of said widow be at unlikely mamma that may be so when consider everything be just sort of way in will most likely get over mary jane hold tongue said mother must say thing of sort before stranger though may not have pleasure of knowing amiable family said mr maguire smiling sweetest be by mean stranger to miss mackenzie then lady looked at thought have never seen anything so terrible a squint miss mackenzie be making long visit at cedar said miss colza be know at present be told ball be very nice people perhaps little worldly minded be to be expected however from people who live out of west end from london live in finsbury square at least did before came here ai bit ashamed to own of course west end be nicest then mr maguire got up saying that must probably do pleasure of calling on miss mackenzie at cedar went way wonder what be after said mr mackenzie a soon a door be shut perhaps came to tell to bear with christian resignation said miss colza always do come when anything be in wind like like to know everything before anybody else be belief be after money said mr mackenzie with squint a said mary jane must have though be made of money have farthing beauty be skin deep said miss colza be manner to wait till be asked said mr mackenzie mary jane chucked up head with disdain thereby indicating that though have not be asked though beauty be skin deep still held same opinion mr maguire a went away to clerical advertising office in neighbourhood of exeter hall thought over matter profoundly be clear enough to that mackenzie of gower street be not interfering with very probably might have hoped attempted to keep heiress among assertion that there be room for in house a though be ever have be averse to having with seemed to imply such be case be natural language of disappointed woman if so that hope be now over with then young lady have plainly exposed suspicion entertained a to ball grand people at cedar baronet family at twickenham must have got to come among with intention of keeping there did not occur to that baronet baronet son must actually want miss mackenzie money presumed baronet to be rich people still might very probably be a dog in manger desirous of preventing relative from doing with money that active service to humanity in general must be done be to marry deserving clergyman who have nothing of own made visit to advertising office learned that clergyman without cure be at present drug in market must understand how must be case seeing that newspaper be constantly declaring that supply of university clergyman be becoming le le day have come from trinity dublin after success of career at littlebath be astonished that must not be snapped at by retailer of curacy on next day visited twickenham now on morning of very day margaret mackenzie first woke to consciousness that be promised wife of cousin john ball there be great comfort in thought be not only even chiefly that who on preceding morning have awakened to remembrance of utter destitution now felt that terrible trouble be over be not simply that great care have be vanquished for be that man who have second time come to asking for love have now given sufficient evidence that did so for sake of love who be so anxious for money have shown that must care for more even than cared for gold a thought of made happy in thought must not rise at once from bed curled in clothes hugged in joy must have taken before at once instantly if must have thought that be so said to herself be thousand time better then found that pillow beneath cheek be wet with tear on preceding evening have be very silent demure betrothed have also be silent there have be no word about tea making lady ball have be silent also a far a knew margaret be to go on following day must say nothing on subject margaret indeed have commenced packing did not know when went to bed whether be to go not rather hoped that might be allowed to go a aunt must doubtless be disagreeable in in matter now must of course be guided implicitly by mr ball have told to be firm of own firmness have doubt lady ball with anger with eloquence must not talk out of husband must be firm have doubt that john ball must be firm also nevertheless when be dressing did not fail to tell that might have bad time of that morning bad time of for day to come if be john intention that must remain at cedar be convinced that lady ball must not welcome a daughter in law now a must have done when property be thought to belong to what right have to expect such welcome doubt hard thing must be said to knew own courage be sure that must bear hard thing with hope within breast a now possessed left room little earlier than usual thinking that might thus meet cousin receive order in be not disappointed be in hall a came down be able to smile on press hand make morning greeting to with tenderness in voice looked heavy about face almost more careworn than usual took hand led into breakfast room did tell mother john said standing very close to almost leaning upon shoulder however did not probably want such sign of love a moved step away from yes said told father mother what say to must hear bear quietly for sake will said margaret think that be unreasonable still be mother will always remember that john be old thing have not always gone well with say too that have be impertinent to margaret face became very red at charge made immediate reply think must mean to be impertinent certainly not john of course will feel much more bound to now than be before yes of course wish that nothing have occurred to make so angry with think be impertinent john though perhaps might seem so when be talking about being companion to lady perhaps answered sharply be so determined must lead sort of life that perhaps said more than must have done know john that have be quite pleasant between for last few day john did know knew also that there be not much probability of pleasantness for day to come mother last word to on preceding evening a be leaving after having told story did not give much promise of pleasantness for margaret john have said nothing on earth will induce to live in same house with margaret mackenzie a wife if choose to break up everything for sake can do can not control remember will be doing margaret then asked what be to do where be to live must fain have asked when be to be married did not dare to make inquiry on point told that for present must remain at cedar if went away must be regarded a open quarrel moreover did not wish that must live by in london lodging will be able to see how thing go for day two said to submitted without murmur then lady ball came into room be very nervous in watching first behaviour be not at prepared for line of conduct adopted john ball margaret have separated when heard rustle of dress have made step towards window have retreated to other side of fire place lady ball on entering room have be nearest to margaret walked round table away from usual place for prayer accosted son good morning john said giving hand margaret waited second two then addressed aunt good morning aunt said stepping half across rug aunt turning back to moved into embrasure of window have be decided that there be to be absolute cut between a long a remained in house lady must not speak to john said nothing black frown came upon brow poor margaret retired rebuked to corner by chimney just at moment girl child rushed in from study with daily governess who came morning sir john rang for servant to come to prayer wonder whether old lady heart be at softened a prayed whether ever occurred to to think that there be meaning in form of word used when asked god to forgive a might forgive others not that margaret have in truth trespassed against at doubtless regarded niece a black trespasser a being quite qualified for forgiveness must have brought to forgive fear that form of word on occasion meant nothing that have be delivered from evil during moment have be on knee margaret sat down in accustomed place notice be taken of by aunt when tea have be poured out john got up from seat asked mother be be cup dear said if will sit down miss mackenzie will have tea will take to said john said mother drawing chair somewhat away from table if flurry in way will drive out of room then have sat down margaret

deferred drive be also apparently about to drop purpose of cutting niece acquaintance in own house will go back to mr maguire have passed evening morning in thinking over method of attack have at last resolved that must be very bold must go down to cedar claim margaret a affianced bride went therefore down to cedar in accordance with plan a arranged gave card to servant asked if must see sir john ball alone now sir john ball never saw one on business indeed not on business after while word be brought out to mr maguire that must see lady ball that sir john be not well enough to receive visitor lady ball mr maguire thought must suit better than sir john signified will accordingly on being shown into drawing room found ladyship there alone must be acknowledged that be brave man that be doing bold thing knew that must find among enemy that claim must be ignored ridiculed by person whom be about to attack knew that everybody on first seeing be affrighted somewhat horrified knew too at least must presume that knew that lady have given promise thought possible nay almost probable that must turn to if saw again that might own a own that feeling might be strong enough in favour to induce to throw off thraldom of relative that might make good ground in breast even if must not bear away in triumph out of hand of enemy when entered room lady ball looked at shuddered people always did shudder when saw for first time lady ball said be rev mr maguire of littlebath be holding card in hand having notified to that be aware of fact have mentioned asked to sit down have called said taking seat hoping to be allowed to speak to on subject of extreme delicacy indeed said lady ball thinking to catch eye failing in effort may say of very extreme delicacy believe niece miss margaret mackenzie be staying here in answer to lady ball acknowledged that miss mackenzie be now at cedar have objection lady ball to allowing to see in presence lady ball be quick thinking intelligent at same time prudent old lady gave answer to before have considered import of question why must clergyman want to see margaret must seeing conduce most to own success to margaret then there be fact that margaret be of age entitled to right of seeing visitor who might call on thinking over a best must in few moment at command thinking also of clergyman stipulation that be to be present at interview said that have objection must send for miss mackenzie rose to ring bell mr maguire also rising from chair stopped hand pardon for moment said before call margaret to come down must wish to explain to for what purpose have come here lady ball when heard man call niece by christian name listened with ear under circumstance one must such man call woman by christian name in such company lady ball said know whether may be aware of be engaged to marry niece lady ball who have not yet resumed seat now did so have not heard of said may be so said mr maguire be so said lady ball very probably there be many reason operate upon young lady in such condition to keep secret even from nearest relative for being clergyman of church of england professing evangelical doctrine therefore a have need not say averse to everything may have about even seeming of impropriety think best to declare fact to even though in doing so may perhaps give offence to dear margaret must think be acknowledged that mr maguire be true to that be conducting case at rate with courage lady ball be doubtful what must do be on tongue to tell man that niece fortune be gone remembered that might probably advance own interest by securing interview between two lover of littlebath in own presence never for moment doubted that mr maguire statement be true never occurred to that there have be no such engagement felt confident from moment in mr maguire important tidings have reached ear that have now in hand mean of rescuing son that mr maguire must cease to make demand for bride when must hear truth be of course to be expected son must not be such idiot soft fool a to go on with purpose when must learn that secret a have be kept back from have refused taken up with horrid greasy evil eyed parson when be rich then when be poor even before have got rid of other engagement have come back upon playing upon pity have secured in toil lady ball felt well inclined to thank clergyman for coming to relief at moment will be best must ask niece to come down to said getting up walking out of room did not go up to niece first went to sir john quieted impatience with reference to driving then after few minute further delay for consideration sent servant up to niece having done returned to drawing room found mr maguire looking at photograph on table be very like dear margaret very like indeed said looking at one of miss mackenzie sweetest face that ever eye rested on may ask if have just seen niece lady ball sir have not seen have sent for there be still little delay before margaret came down be much fluttered wanted time to think if only time must be allowed to perhaps there have come man to say that money be not gone if so with what delight must give to cousin john be first thought if so how then about promise made to dying brother almost wished that money might not be hers looking to herself only to own happiness must certainly be better for that must not be hers if must be mr rubb with yellow glove before must consider that alternative have opened door there be mr maguire standing ready to receive dearest margaret exclaimed own love there stood with arm open a though expected miss mackenzie to rush into be certainly man of very great courage mr maguire said stood still near door then looked at aunt saw that lady ball eye be keenly fixed upon something like truth approximation to fact a be flashed upon in moment knew that have to bear in difficulty with discretion fortitude margaret exclaimed mr maguire will not come to what do mean mr maguire said still standing aloof from retreating somewhat nearer to door gentleman say that be engaged to marry said lady ball margaret looking again into aunt face saw smile of triumph that sat there resolved at once to make good ground if have said that have told untruth untruth unmanly unmannerly hear sir what lady ball have stated be true that have made assertion will contradict margaret oh margaret margaret can not contradict reader must remember that clergyman doubt thought felt that have good deal of truth on side gentleman when make offer to lady be told by lady that may come again that time be required for consideration be always disposed to think that difficulty of siege be over in nine case out of ten be so mr maguire doubt since interview in question have received letter from lady must at rate have prevented from uttering such assertion a have now made looked upon letter a work of enemy chose to go back for authority to last word margaret have spoken to knew that be playing intricate game that be not quite on square thought that enemy be playing false falsehood in return be therefore fair be going on be robbery of church spoiling of israel touching with profane hand of thing have already be made sacred do contradict said margaret stepping forward into room almost exciting admiration in lady ball breast by demeanour aunt said a gentleman have chosen to come here with such story a must tell fact have ever be engaged to asked lady ball never oh margaret again exclaimed mr maguire sir will ask to let tell aunt truth when be at littlebath before knew that fortune be not own a said looked hard into mr maguire face before have become penniless a be now then paused again still looking at saw with inward pleasure elongation of suitor face gentleman asked to marry did ask said lady ball of course asked urged mr maguire there can be denying that on side did not now quite know what to do certainly did not wish to impoverish church by marrying miss mackenzie without fortune might not all be trick that have be rich knew how must have become poor so quickly did ask told that must take fortnight to consider of did not refuse then said lady ball not then have done so since by letter twice have written to telling have nothing of own that there must be nothing between got letter said mr maguire turning round to lady ball certainly got letter such letter a if be written under dictation be rather anxious that lady bell must quarrel with in programme have made for when came to house quarrel to knife with ball family be part of tactic programme doubt be disturbed by course event have taken still quarrel with lady ball might be best for if be to quarrel with must give evidence that story about loss of money be untrue lady ball must not quarrel with sat still said nothing nobody dictated said margaret now be here will tell fact money thought be mine in truth belongs to cousin mr john ball so far spoke loudly with face raised eye fixed upon then a concluded dropped voice eye together be now engaged to a wife oh indeed said mr maguire statement must be taken for what be worth said lady ball rising from seat of what miss mackenzie say now know nothing sincerely hope that may find that be mistaken now margaret said mr maguire may ask to see for one minute alone certainly not said if have anything more to say will hear in aunt presence waited few moment a did not speak took back to door made escape to own room how mr maguire took out of house need not stop to inquire there must must think have be difficulty in manoeuvre be considerably past three when sir john be taken out for drive while be in carriage wife told what have occurred chapter xxii still at cedar margaret when have reached own room seated so that must consider have occurred in quietness immediately knew own difficulty of course lady ball must give account of what have occurred to son of course john must be angry when learned that there have be purpose of marriage between mr maguire took different view of matter now than have hitherto presented have not thought much of mr maguire proposal have be made under state of thing differing much from now existing change have come upon affair have seemed to to annul offer have learned to regard almost a though have never be there have be no engagement there have hardly be purpose in own mind moment have never come in must have spoken of to cousin with propriety that last in truth be valid excuse for not having told whole story have hardly be with long enough to do more than accept offer have made of course must have told of mr maguire of mr maguire of mr rubb also when first opportunity might come for to do so have desire to keep from knowledge tittle of what have occurred there have be nothing of be ashamed not le did feel that must have be well for that must have told own story before horrid man have come to cedar story must now first be told to by aunt knew well tone in must be told occurred to that might even yet go meet at station if so must tell at once must know that have done so because be afraid of aunt disliked idea of excusing before be accused if really loved must listen to believe if did not why then let lady ball have own way have promised to be firm must keep promise must not intrigue with hope of making firm if be infirm of purpose let go so sat in room even when heard door close after entrance did not go down till be time for to show in drawing room before dinner when entered room be full nodded at with pleasant smile made up mind that have heard nothing a yet uncle have excused from coming to table aunt john be talking together in apparent eagerness about for one moment cousin spoke to before dinner be afraid said that father be sinking fast then felt quite sure that have a

thanked for speaking of together then took away surely after speaking to in way must not allow word from mother to dissuade from purpose must not go to bed knew that fate be being discussed knew that aunt at very time be using argument in power to ruin felt moreover that story might be told in such way a to be terribly prejudicial to now when father be so ill might not be very natural that must do almost anything to lessen mother trouble to must be absolute ruin such ruin that nothing have yet endured must be in way like story of loss of money have stunned have not broken spirit misery from have arisen chiefly from want of brother family if be now to tell that must be over between very heart must be broken must not go to bed while be going on so sat listening till must hear noise of foot

nothing claiming to use of night for consideration circumstance against margaret owned to be very strong felt angry with for having have lover at littlebath be other day during winter visit to cedar that have proposed to that have rejected have now renewed proposal did not like to think that there have be one else between overture must not deny strength of mother argument when averred that mr maguire must not have come down there unless have have a said encouragement indeed throughout whole affair lady ball believed mr maguire disbelieved niece something of belief something also of disbelief communicated to son still reserved to right of postponing own opinion till morrow a be coming upstairs when margaret saw through chink of door be thinking of smile of graciousness goodness

occupied in arundel street have at death remained in hand of old servant of who have bought late master furniture with saving have continued to live there letting out house in lodging former mistress have gone to see once twice during past year have be understood between that if miss mackenzie ever wanted room for night two in london must be accommodated at old house must have preferred to write to hannah protheroe mr protheroe a be now called by brevet rank since have held house of own have time permitted to do so time circumstance did not permit therefore have driven to arundel street without notice mr protheroe received with open arm with many promise of comfort attendance a be to be expected seeing that mr protheroe be a thought receiving into house rich heiress proffered at once use of drawing room of best bedroom declared that a house be now empty with exception of one young gentleman from somerset house upstairs must be able to devote almost exclusively to miss mackenzie thing be much changed from former day in hannah protheroe used frequently to snub margaret mackenzie being almost of equal standing in house with young mistress now margaret be called upon to explain that low a standing might have be then at present moment be even lower have indeed mean of paying for lodging be called upon to husband with minutest economy task of telling be difficult began by declining drawing room by saying that bedroom upstairs must suffice for have heard hannah what have happened to said when mr protheroe expressed surprise at decision brother will be will at get of property go under other will to cousin mr john ball by tidings hannah be of course prostrated driven into state of excitement be not without pleasantness a far a be concerned of course objected that last will must be real will in way matter came to full discussion between after john be to have everything said mr protheroe holding up hand by time hannah protheroe have got comfortably into chair doubt personal pleasure in evening occupation be considerably enhanced by unconscious feeling that be richer woman of two behaved very well be inclined to think in preparing buttered muffin for guest be more particular in toasting more generous with butter than must have be have be preparing dainty for drawing room use when learned that margaret have eaten nothing since breakfast went out brought in sweetbread with own hand though kept servant whom might have sent to shop for honour of lodging house keeper protest that sweetbread never made appearance in bill will be more comfortable down here with wo dear than up there with not creature to speak to in way mr protheroe made apology for giving miss mackenzie tea downstairs in little back parlour behind kitchen be tidy room with two wooden armchair bit of carpet over flag in centre rug before fire margaret did not inquire why smelt of tobacco did mr protheroe think necessary to give explanation why went up at past seven to answer bell at area did say anything then of office messenger from somerset house who often found little room convenient for evening pipe so be passed first evening after griselda have left cedar next day sat at home doing nothing still talking to hannah protheroe thinking that perhaps john ball might come did not come dined downstairs at one o'clock in same room behind kitchen then have tea at six a hannah intimated that perhaps gentleman friend must look in during evening be obliged to betake after tea to solitude of own room a hannah be between fifty sixty nearer latter age than former there must be objection to receiving what visitor pleased third day passed with miss mackenzie same a second still cousin came to see next day being sunday diversified by going to church three time on sunday be forced to dine alone a gentleman friend usually came in on day to eat bit of mutton with friend mr protheroe most respectable man in admiralty branch miss margaret will have pension of twenty seven shilling sixpence week in year two be so lonely by know then miss mackenzie knew that hannah protheroe intended to become hannah buggins understood whole mystery of tobacco smoke on monday went to house in gower street communicated to fact that have left cedar miss colza be in room with sister in law niece a be soon evident that miss colza knew whole history of misfortune with reference to property talked about affair before miss colza a though young lady have be one of late brother family yet felt that did not like miss colza once twice felt almost inclined to resent certain pushing question miss colza addressed to have quarrelled with ball family young lady asked putting great emphasis on word did not say that have quarrelled with of said miss mackenzie oh beg pardon thought a came away so sudden like a did see of since know be matter of importance said miss mackenzie none in least said miss colza in way made up mind to hate other what did woman mean by talking in way of ball a though quarrel with one of family be thing of more importance than quarrel with of others must know must even guess anything of john ball of offer have made mystery be soon cleared up in margaret mind when at mr mackenzie request two went upstairs into lady bedroom for little private conversation conversation be desired for purpose appertaining solely to convenience of widow wanted money then with tear in eye demanded to know what be to be done miss colza paid eighteen shilling week for board lodging be now two week in arrear one bedroom be let to young man employed in oilcloth factory at seven shilling week rent be ninety pound tax twenty two said mr mackenzie with handkerchief up to eye there be taxman come now for seven pound ten where be to get unless coined blood know margaret gave two sovereign have in purse promised to send cheque for amount of tax due then told a much a must tell of proposal a to interest of money due from firm in new road if must only be made certain said widow who have fallen much from high idea since margaret have last seen thing be greatly changed in house since day on dinner la russe have be given under auspex of mr grandairs if can only be made certain still keep name up in firm there be a plain a life over place of business must not even yet call shop rubb mackenzie yet wo let know anything a to how matter be going on went there other day must tell nothing a for samuel rubb have be here last fortnight have got one to see righted if be to ask mr slow must be able to see righted margaret declared that hardly knew whether must come within mr slow line of business that did not feel competent to give advice on point a then explained a best must that own affair be not a yet settled that be led to hope from have be said to that interest due by firm on money borrowed might become fixed annual income for mr mackenzie benefit after that came out that mr maguire have again be in gower street be alone for best part of hour with young woman downstairs said mr mackenzie saw margaret asked oh yes saw afterwards what did say did say much to only gave to understand at least be what suppose meant that meant to say that have be courting suppose then margaret understood why miss colza have desired to know whether have quarrelled with ball in open somewhat indignant speech in drawing room at cedar have declared before mr maguire in aunt presence that be engaged to marry cousin john ball mr maguire have now enlisted miss colza in service have told miss colza what have occurred still miss mackenzie did not thoroughly understand matter why asked must mr maguire trouble further now that knew that have fortune in truth be not so easy to satisfy mr maguire on point a be to satisfy miss mackenzie believed that relative of lady love be robbing that be at rate taking advantage of weakness if might be given to to rescue fortune from then in such case a surely must get reward reader will therefore understand why miss colza be anxious to know whether miss mackenzie have quarrelled with ball margaret face became unusually black when be told that mr maguire have be courting did not contradict assertion did however express opinion of gentleman be mean false greedy man said then paused moment have be cause of ruin must not however explain what meant by left house without going back to room in miss colza be sitting about week afterwards got letter from mr slow in gentleman rather firm for letter be signed slow bideawhile asked whether be in want of immediate fund affair between cousin be not yet said in

excepting on sunday did go out of house during hour that cousin must be in london very sad monotonous be life passed alone in own bedroom be more sad because mr buggins somewhat resented manner in husband be treated mr buggins be still attentive made little speech about buggins respectability margaret felt that presence in house be annoyance at last at end of ten day john ball came again margaret with fluttering heart descended to meet in empty parlour be first to speak a have come downstairs have made up mind to tell openly what be thought have hoped to have seen before john said a gave hand did call before did not get card oh yes got card have expected to see before that kind of life that be leading here be very sad can not be long continued must have have remain at cedar margaret must not be counselled by not in john only mention now to excuse be not to suppose be not anxious about because have not seen have be with mr slow constantly law question be always very tedious in being settled want nothing for myself behoves mr slow for very reason to be more anxious on behalf if will believe margaret be quite a anxious a be if have remained with must have discussed matter with from day to day of course can not do so while be here a be talking in way everything with reference to past intercourse came across mind must not tell that have be anxious to see not with reference to money that might tell that did not find guilty on charge aunt have brought against concerning mr maguire did not want assurance of solicitude a to future mean of maintenance cared little nothing about future maintenance if must not get from one kind word with reference to past went on talking to about mr slow interest property law till at last in anger told that did not care to hear further about till must be told at last what be to do a have got nothing of own said want to be earning bread think that delay be cruel do think said that delay be not cruel to also thought that alluded to fact that must not yet obtain possession of income for own purpose may have at once for said have what replied margaret think fail to see difficulty of position in first place father be on deathbed oh john be sorry for then mother be very bitter about how can at time tell that opinion be to go for nothing be bound to think of own child can not abandon claim to property one want to abandon at least what be to do then mr maguire be making charge against oh john be saying that be robbing trying to cover robbery by marrying own lawyer mr slow have told that plain statement of whole case must be prepared so that one who care to inquire may learn whole truth before can venture to do anything might otherwise compromise character think of margaret when be angry with margaret hanging down head confessed that have not thought of difficulty must have be le have remained at cedar then again lifted head told that must have be impossible let thing go a might knew that have be right in leaving aunt house there be not much more said between did give definite promise a to when must see again told that might draw on mr slow for money if wanted that again declined told also not to withdraw susanna mackenzie from school at littlebath at rate not for present intimated also that mr slow must pay schoolmistress bill then took leave of have spoken word of love to yet felt when be gone that case be not a hopeless now a have seemed to be that morning chapter xxiv little story of lion lamb during three month of october november december mr maguire be certainly not idle have by mean of pertinacious inquiry learned good deal about miss mackenzie indeed have learned most of fact reader know though not quite of have seen jonathan ball will have seen walter mackenzie will have ascertained through miss colza john ball now claimed property by deed said to have be executed by jonathan ball previous to execution of will have also learned from miss mackenzie own lip in lady ball presence that have engaged to marry man who be thus claiming property why must mr ball want to marry who must in such case be penniless that felt compelled in way to quell further inquiry into thing that be doing why must desire to marry that in way might a be go with own property not lose value of when compelled to surrender to cousin that must have given with property to maguire few month ago mr maguire felt fully convinced a have said before have ground for such conviction have learned also from miss colza miss mackenzie have certainly quarrelled with lady ball that have so miss colza believed be turned out of house at cedar whether mr ball have have not abandoned matrimonial prospect miss colza must not quite determine having made up mind to hate miss mackenzie therefore a be natural thinking that gentleman must really like poor dowdy creature rather thought that have abandoned matrimonial prospect mr maguire have thus learned much on subject have not learned john be honest throughout in matter that lawyer employed in be honest also now having got together information being in somewhat precarious condition a to own affair mr maguire resolved upon using information boldly have not incorrect idea of fitness of thing did not fail to tell be at moment in possession of clerical advantage labour in vineyard must have earned for must not have run risk must undoubtedly incur by engaging in matter have full church at littlebath depending on have mr stumfold chance mr stumfold success be have still even be adherent of stumfoldian fold must have paused before rushed to public with account of miss mackenzie grievance a matter stood with looking round upon own horizon did not see that have course before more likely to lead to good pecuniary result than reader have be told how mr maguire went to arundel street how be there received that reception did not at daunt courage showed that lady be still under ball influence that ally miss colza be probably wrong in supposing that ball marriage be altogether off only made more determined to undermine influence to prevent marriage if must once succeed in convincing lady that best chance of regaining fortune lay in assistance if must even convince that interference must result with without good wish in dividing altogether from ball alliance then must be almost compelled to throw into arm that be violently in love with did not suppose did think at more probable that must be violently in love with cousin put down in own mind a one of weak good woman who can bring easily to love man who be sure to make useful wife because understand so thoroughly nature of obedience if must secure for fortune must divide from john ball have little doubt that must come to in spite of manner in have refused to receive in arundel street having considered after mode of thinking have attempted to describe went to work with such weapon a be readiest to hand a first step wrote boldly to john ball in letter reasserted statement have made to lady ball a to miss mackenzie engagement to added circumstance have not mentioned to lady ball said that having become engaged to lady have in consequence given up curacy at littlebath otherwise so disarranged circumstance a to make imperative upon to take step be now taking have come up to london expecting to find anxious to receive in gower street have then discovered that have be taken away to cedar must not said give adequate description of surprise when on arriving there heard from mouth of own margaret that be now engaged to cousin if surprise then have be great terrible how much greater more terrible must have be when step by step story of claim upon fortune revealed to pledged in letter a gentleman a christian minister to see matter out must not allow miss mackenzie to be despoiled of fortune hand of have right to regard a own without making known to public transaction regarded a nefarious then there be good deal of eloquent indignation nature purport of reader will probably understand mr ball did not at like letter have that strong feeling of disinclination to be brought before public with reference to private affair be common to englishman specially have dislike to seeing that there must be question not only a to money also a to love gentleman doe not like to be accused of dishonest attempt to posse of lady property at age of fifty even be almost better than one charge with such attempt against lady heart knew that be not dishonest therefore must endure first be not quite sure that be not might not become ridiculous therefore feared latter very greatly must not ignore letter there be nothing for to show to lawyer unfortunately have told lawyer on very day of mr maguire visit to cedar that be to be made smooth by marriage with miss mackenzie now with much misery many inward groanings have to explain story of mr maguire be more painful in that have to admit that offer have be made to lady by clergyman have not be rejected think there be more than asked lawyer having paved way for question with sundry apologetic flourish be sure there be not said john ball be a true a gospel be a false a devil oh yes said lawyer there be doubt about falsehood be one of fellow for whom nothing be too dirty clergyman be like woman a long a be pure be long sight purer than other men when fall sink deeper need be afraid of taking word said john ball if woman be a pure a be there must be much amiss with eye glittered a spoke of be pity margaret must not have heard then seen there think have be just little foolish know think be very foolish in not bidding such man to go about business at once have not be more so than what owns be a brave a be good think must keep anything back result be that letter be written by lawyer to mr maguire telling mr maguire that further communication must be made to also making slight suggestion a to pain penalty be incurred in matter of libel mr maguire have dated letter from littlebath there answer reached have returned thither having found that must take further immediate step towards furthering cause in london now what step must take next more than once thought of putting own case into hand of lawyer what be lawyer to do for action for breach of promise be open to have wit enough to feel that there be very little chance of success for in line might instruct lawyer to look into miss mackenzie affair thought probable that might find lawyer to take such instruction there must be much expense in probably result advancing logically from one conclusion to at last resolved that must rush boldly into print lay whole iniquity of transaction open to public believed think did believe that woman be being wronged particle of such belief have fostering with sat down wrote leading article now there existed in littlebath at time weekly periodical called christian examiner with mr maguire have for time have dealing have written for paper taking earnest part in local religious subject paper in return have very frequently spoken highly of mr maguire eloquence of mr maguire energy there have be give take in people understand who be conversant with provincial perhaps might add with metropolitan press of country paper in question be not wicked paper be gentleman concerned in publication intentionally scurrilous malignant be subject to great temptation beset class newspaper of kind to avoid seems to be almost more difficult in handling religious subject than in handling other editor of christian examiner if a be probable have of own very strong one sided religious conviction will think that who differ from be in perilous way so thinking will feel bound to tell so man who advocate one line of railway instead of one prime minister a being superior to others doe not regard opponent a being fatally wrong wrong for world for next can restrain how be newspaper writer to restrain when opponent be incurring everlasting punishment worse still carrying away others to similar doom in read perhaps even purchase lost one have written in way content of religious newspaper be apt to be personal heavy biting scorching attack become natural vehicle of christian examiner mr maguire sat down wrote leading article on following saturday appeared in glory of large type article will not be repeated here at length because contained sundry quotation from holy writ may a well be omitted purport of will be explained commenced with dissertation against undue love of wealth auri sacrum fame a writer called described with powerful unction terrible strait into when indulged led vile wicked ugly hideous loathsome devilish human heart then there be eloquent passage referring to worm dust grass quotation respecting treasure corruptible incorruptible not at once with crafty gradation author sloped away to point of subject how fearful be to watch way in strong wicked one roaring lion of earth beguiled ignorance of innocent led lonely lamb into slaughter house much amplified made up article then after manner of pleasant relater of anecdote clerical story teller began little tale when however came to absolute writing of tale found to be prudent for present to omit name of hero heroine to omit indeed name of person concerned have first intended boldly to dare perhaps must yet have done so have be quite sure of editor editor found might object to direct personality at first sound of trumpet unless communication be made in guise of letter with mr maguire name at end of after while editor might become hot in fight then name must be blazoned forth there existed chance small chance that robber lion john ball might be induced to drop lamb from mouth when heard premonitory blast then lion prey might be picked up by bold hunter mr maguire must probably have said have be called upon to finish sentence anyone else might perhaps say by jackal little story be told therefore without mention of name mr maguire have read other little story told in way in other newspaper of greater weight doubt than littlebath christian examiner have thought that must wield thunderbolt a well a other jupiter in wielding thunderbolt a in other operation of skill man must first try 'prentice hand with reticence thus reconciled to prudence not without pang of conscience accused inwardly of cowardice not long ago there be lady in town loved respected by who knew thus began then gave not altogether inaccurate statement of whole affair dropping of course own share in concern accusing vile wicked hideous loathsome human heart of devouring lion who lived mile to west end of london of brutal desire hellish scheme to swallow up inheritance of innocent loved respected lamb in spite of closest tie of consanguinity between then went on to tell how with base desire of covering up from eye of indignant public bestial greediness in having made dishonest meal lion have proposed to plan of marrying lamb be pity maguire have not learned that miss colza have not be able to tell that lion have once before expressed wish to take lamb for wife have known that what picture must have drawn of disappointed vindictive king of forest a lying in lair at twickenham meditated foul revenge unfortunately be unknown to mr maguire unsuspected by article did not end here indignant writer of went on to say that have buckled on armour in support of lamb that be ready to meet lion either in forest in social circle in court of law before christian arbitrator with loud trumpetings summoned lion to appear plead guilty to stand forward if dared declare innocent with hand on heart if lion must prove to be innocent writer of article offered right hand of fellowship offer lion must not perhaps regard a strong inducement if lion be not innocent if a writer of article be well aware be case lion be basely greedily bestially guilty then writer of article pledged to give lion peace till have disgorged prey till lamb be free to come back with property to christian circle in littlebath have loved so warmly respected so thoroughly such be nature of article editor put in after what in such matter be editor to do be not business to sell paper if editor of christian examiner can not trust clergyman have sat under whom can trust risk editor be obliged to run will never sell paper there must be little doubt that article a must be popular among religious world of littlebath that must create demand have misgiving have that poor editor did not feel quite sure of lion lamb talked matter over vehemently with mr maguire in little room in occupied with scissors paste ultimately article be inserted who doe not know that interval of triumph warms man heart when have delivered blow return blow have not be yet received blow have be so well struck that must be successful nay may probably be death dealing so felt mr maguire when two dozen copy of christian examiner be delivered at lodging on saturday morning article though printed a leading article have be headed a little story lion lamb so that might more readily attract attention read very nicely in print have that religious unction be so necessary for christian examiner with that spice of devilry so delicious to humanity that without even christian examiner can not be made to sell be very busy with two dozen damp copy before two dozen have be sent to by agreement a price of workmanship made up directed with own hand to lion lamb sent two copy two to to mr slow sent copy to messrs slow bideawhile third to other lawyer sent copy to lady ball one to sir john sent to old mackenzie baronet at incharrow two more to baronet eldest son baronet eldest son wife copy sent to mr tom mackenzie copy to miss colza copy also sent to mr buggins sent copy to chairman of board at shadrach fire office to chairman at abednego life office copy sent to mr samuel rubb junior copy to messrs rubb mackenzie out of own pocket supplied postage stamp with own hand dropped paper into littlebath post office poor miss mackenzie when read article be stricken almost to ground how did hate man whose handwriting on address recognised at once what must do in agony almost resolved that must start at once for cedar profess willingness to go before magistrate in london littlebath swear that cousin be lion that be lamb at moment feeling towards christian christian examiner of littlebath be not feeling of griselda think must have spoken mind freely have mr maguire come in way then when saw mr buggins copy anger blazed up afresh agony became more intense horrid man must have sent copy over world must never have thought of sending copy to mr buggins did not go to cedar reflected that when there might probably find cousin absent in such case must hardly know how to address to aunt mr ball too might perhaps come to for three day patiently awaited coming on evening of third day there came to not mr ball clerk from mr slow same clerk who have be with before made appointment with at mr slow office on following morning be to meet mr ball there also to meet mr ball lawyer of course consented to go of course be on mr slow staircase exactly at time appointed of what be thinking a walked round lincoln inn field to kill quarter of hour found to have on hand will not now inquire be shown at once into mr slow room first thing met eye be copy of horrible christian examiner lying on table before knew instantly must have known have simply seen corner of printing to eye to mind other printed paper have ever be so ugly so vicious saw that there be also newspaper under christian examiner mr slow brought to fire gave chair be very courteous in few moment came other lawyer with came john ball mr slow opened conference detail of need not be given here first asked miss mackenzie whether have seen that wicked libel with much energy may almost say with virulence declared that horrid paper have be sent to hoped that nobody suspected that have known anything about in answer to assured that need not trouble on head mr slow then told that london paper have copied whole story of lion lamb expressing hope that lion must be exposed if there be truth in writer must be exposed if there be none writer be mr maguire clergyman said miss mackenzie with indignation know that said mr slow with slight smile on face then went on reading remark of london paper declared that littlebath christian examiner having gone so far must of necessity go further article be calculated to give greatest pain to doubt many person innocence guilt of lion a poor john ball be called must be made manifest to public now dear miss mackenzie will tell what propose to do said mr slow then explained that be absolutely necessary that question of law must be tried settled in court of law between cousin when protested against endeavoured to explain to that cause must be amicable cause simple reference in short to legal tribunal of course did not understand of course still protested after while when began to perceive that protest be of avail let that matter drop cause must be brought on a soon a possible must not be decided till late in spring be told that have better make great change in own manner of life till time be again informed that must have what money wanted for own maintenance refused to take money when reference be made to proposed change in life looked wistfully into cousin face however have nothing to say then kept eye intently fixed upon carpet mr slow then took up christian examiner declared to what be intention with reference to that letter must be written from house to editor of london newspaper giving plain statement of case with name explaining that party be acting in perfect concert that matter be to be decided in only way must be regarded a satisfactory in answer to miss mackenzie almost in tear pointed out how distressing must be publicity thus given to name particularly said particularly must not go on with expression of thought explain that so public reference to proposal of marriage from cousin must be doubly painful to seeing that idea of such marriage have be abandoned mr slow understood coming over to took gently by hand dear said may trust in a though be father know that such publicity be painful believe be best that can do of course have alternative to yield when interview be over cousin walked home with to arundel street said much to a to necessity for trial said so much that at last dimly understood that matter must not be set at rest by simple renouncing of property own lawyer must not allow to do so must john ball consent to receive property in such manner see by newspaper what people must say of have not power of making everything easy by doing have before proposed to do why did not again say margaret come be wife acknowledged to herself that have right to act a though have never said word that fact elicited by mr maguire visit to cedar be sufficient to absolve from offer yet thought that must have be sufficient also to induce to renew on occasion when left at door in arundel street have not renewed offer chapter xxv lady ball in arundel street on christmas day miss mackenzie be pressed very hard to eat christmas dinner with mr mr buggins almost gave way have half formed idea in head must once sit down to table with buggins must have given up fight altogether have objection to buggins have indeed no strong objection to put on par with buggins felt that must not be on par with buggins with john ball at same time why must be that in associating with man must take step downwards might yet associate with man wife without taking step downwards did not attempt to explain to herself think that must have explained have put to task of analysing question that felt exactly result of such analysis without making at rate refused invitation persistently ate wretched dinner alone in bedroom have often told in day of philosophy at littlebath that did not care to be lady told now same thing very often when be thinking of hospital cosseted with false idea a to nature of work proposed to undertake knew very well that might have to keep rougher company than of buggins if put shoulder to wheel be willing enough to do have be willing to encounter such company ever since left cedar be prepared for roughness must not put beyond pale a be of cousin hearth moved simply by temptation to relieve monotony of life when work came within reach must go to till then must bear wretchedness of dull room upstairs wondered whether ever thought how wretched must be in solitude on new year day heard that uncle be dead be already in mourning for brother be therefore called upon to make change in respect wrote note of condolence to aunt in strove much vainly to be cautious sympathetic at same time in return received note in lady ball declared purpose of coming to arundel street to see niece a soon a found able to leave house must said give margaret warning day beforehand a must be very sad if have journey for nothing aunt lady ball be coming to see in arundel street what must be purpose of such visit after have passed between why must aunt trouble to make at period of such great distress lady ball must have very important plan to propose poor margaret heart be in flutter be ten day after before second promised note arrived then margaret be asked to say whether must be at home able to receive aunt visit at ten minute past two on day one following margaret wrote back to say that must be at home at ten minute past two on day named aunt be old again borrowed parlour though be not now well inclined to ask favour from mr buggins mr buggins have taken to heart slight put upon husband sometimes made nasty little speech oh dear yes in course miss margaret not that ever did think much of ball le than ever now since gentleman be kind enough to send newspaper be welcome to room seeing a how mr tiddy will be in city of course be welcome to too though do keep so close to wo ever bring round to have money again that wo lady ball came be shown into parlour niece went down to receive must have be here before came aunt only room be not mine in answer to lady ball said that did very well room must answer present purpose then sat down on sofa from have risen be dressed of course in full weed of widowhood wide extent of black crape be almost awful in margaret eye did not look to be so savage a niece have sometimes seen there be about ponderous accumulation of crape made even more formidable than used to be must be almost impossible to refuse anything to person so black so grave so heavy so big have come to dear said a soon a possibly must after sad event have have at home in answer to margaret said that be much obliged hoped that aunt have put to trouble then said word two about uncle word two be very difficult a of course must mean nothing yes said widow have be taken from after long useful life hope son will always show to be worthy of such father after there be silence in room for minute two during margaret waited for aunt to begin lady sat there solid grave black a though thought that very presence without word might be effective upon margaret a preliminary mode of attack margaret must find nothing to say to aunt therefore also remained silent lady ball be so far successful in when three minute be over niece have certainly be weakened by oppressive nature of meeting have about le of vivacity perhaps also le of vitality than when first entered room well dear said aunt at last there be thing know must be talked about though be ever so disagreeable then pulled out of pocket that abominable number of littlebath christian examiner oh aunt hope be not going to talk about dear be cowardly be indeed how be to help talking about have come here from twickenham on purpose to talk about then aunt must decline must indeed dear must indeed aunt let man woman vitality be ever so thoroughly crushed quenched by fatigue oppression even by black crape there will always be mode of galvanising will restore for time specific of joy torture will produce return of temporary energy littlebath newspaper be battery of sufficient power to put margaret on leg again though perhaps might not be long able to keep be vile lying paper be written by vile lying man hope will put up say nothing about be vile lying paper margaret lie be against son not against be man know what be about doe not signify to aunt wo talk about there be end of hope doe know what be about said lady ball hope doe a say be woman therefore specially behoves to know what be about be not doing anything to anybody said margaret lady ball have now refolded offensive newspaper restored to pocket perhaps have done a much with a have from first intended at rate brought forth more made further intentionally direct allusion to suppose really wish to do injury to anybody said doe anybody accuse of doing injury margaret asked well dear if be to say that accused perhaps must misunderstand hope thoroughly expect that before leave may be able to say that accuse if will only listen to patiently for few minute margaret must get to do know before went away from cedar in very extraordinary manner think can explain to something here lady ball became embarrassed paused margaret gave assistance therefore began new sentence in point of fact want to listen to what say then think do think will do a must have whom did include in word margaret have still sufficient vitality not to let word pas by unquestioned mean john said mean family said lady ball rather sharply mean whole family including dear girl to whom have be in position of mother since son wife died be in name of ball family now speak surely have right margaret thought that lady ball have such right must not say so at moment well margaret to come to point at once fact be must renounce idea that may still have of becoming son wife then paused have john sent here to say demanded margaret wish to ask such question a if have real regard for think must ask consider difficulty consider position of poor child if be brother must advise at age to marry woman without farthing also to incur certain disgrace must attach to name after after have be said about in newspaper then lady ball put hand upon pocket in newspaper in others be more than margaret must bear there must be disgrace said jumping to foot margaret if put into passion how can understand reason ought to know by very fact of being in passion that be wrong must there be disgrace after have come out about mr maguire none none almost shouted modern griselda there must be disgrace wo admit a for marrying expect there be nothing to bind to if doe come to certainly will not go to have looked upon a over between a have not troubled with importunity yet be cruel in to come to in way be free to do what like why go to there must be disgrace of course be free of course such marriage never can take place now be quite out of question say that be over be quite right why not let be settled in friendly way between so that might be friend again must be so glad to help in difficulty if must agree with about want help margaret be nonsense in position be very wrong to set natural friend at defiance if will only authorise to say that renounce marriage will not renounce said margaret who be still standing up will not renounce must sooner lose tongue than let say such word may tell if choose to tell anything that demand nothing from nothing once thought mine be now demand nothing from when asked to be wife told to be firm in will obey may renounce will have nothing with to reproach will never renounce never then modern griselda who have be thus galvanised into vitality stood over aunt in mood be almost triumphant margaret be astonished at said lady ball when have recovered ca help aunt now let tell son be of course old enough to do a plea if chooses to ruin child by marrying anybody even if be out of street ca help stop moment hear to end said a niece have made movement a though towards door say even if be out of street must help nothing will induce to live in same house with if marries will be on conscience for ever that have brought ruin on whole family will be punishment a for will take off to solitude there will die then lady ball put handkerchief up to face wept copiously margaret stood still leaning upon table spoke word either in answer to threat to tear immediate object be to take out of room did not know how to achieve at last aunt spoke again if please will get to ask landlady to send for cab then cab be procured buggins who have come home for dinner handed ladyship in not word have be spoken during time that cab be being fetched when lady ball went down passage merely said wish good bye margaret good bye said margaret then escaped to own bedroom lady ball have not done work well be not within power to induce margaret to renounce engagement have known niece better think that must have made attempt did succeed in learning that margaret have received renewal of offer from son that there be in fact positive engagement now existing between with think must have be satisfied margaret have declared that demanded nothing from cousin with assurance lady ball must have be contented have thought to carry point to obtain full swing of will by mean of threat have forgotten that in very word of own menace conveyed to margaret intimation that son be still desirous of doing very thing be so anxious to prevent there be chance that threat must have effect on margaret ought to have known that tone of woman mind be much too firm for margaret knew be a sure of a woman must be sure that cousin be bound to by tie of honour believed too that be bound to by love that if must finally desert must be moved to do so by mean motif be anger on score of mr maguire must bring to course suspicion that be personally unworthy of being wife griselda with power of suffering willingness to suffer understood be by mean disposed to give way to threat from lady ball when be upstairs once more in solitude disgraced again by cry must be strong enough when attacked by others must not be strong when alone cried sobbed upon bed then rising looked at in glass told that be old ugly fitted only for hospital nursing of have be thinking still there be something about heart that bore up lady ball must not have come to must not have exercised eloquence upon must not have called upon to renounce engagement have not found similar attempt upon own son to be ineffectual must then be so that after cousin must be true to if be so if must be so what must not do for for child if be so how blessed must have be trouble have brought to such haven at last then tried to reconcile coldness to with so longed to believe might be fact be not to expect to be lover such a be young men be young must like better if be to assume anything of youth in manner understood that life with be serious thing that be duty to be serious grave in what did might be that be essential to character after have passed that question of property must be settled finally before must come to declare wish thus flattering put away from tear dressed smoothing hair washing away trace of weeping then again looked at in glass to see if be possible that might be comely in eye month of january february slowly wore away during whole of time margaret saw cousin once then met at mr slow chamber have gone there to sign document there have found have then be told that must certainly lose cause one who have looked into matter have doubt of that certainly be case jonathan ball have bequeathed property be not at time made will at time of death in fact absolutely belonged to nephew john ball

performance of bazaar male eye beheld scene a mr manfred smith manager have gone out to look for duchess missing carriage in crowd did not return till bazaar have be opened that mr chaucer munro did not sink collapsed among bevy must have be owing altogether to callousness long habit of endurance produce probably did feel something a at moment there came titter from other bevy corresponding to titter be raised by own bevy retired to allotted place conscious that time for glory must not come till male world must appear upon scene lady ware tiara still wagged nodded behind counter margaret looking at thought that must have come there a grand duenna of occasion just at three o'clock poor duchess hurried into building in terrible flurry went hither thither among stall not knowing at first where be throne unkind chance threw at first almost into booth of mr conway sparkes woman whom of woman hated most from thence recoiled into arm of lady hartletop who be sitting serene placid contented in appointed place opposite think duchess mr conway sparkes have said be only small fry here oh ah beg pardon told middle to left be middle to right said mr conway sparkes duchess have turned round since came in must not at understand where be under canopy duchess just whispered lady hartletop lady hartletop be young woman who knew right hand from left under circumstance of life who never made mistake duchess looked up in confusion to centre of ceiling must see canopy lady hartletop have done must be required of if duchess be to die amidst difficulty must not be fault then came forth lady glencora with true charity conducted lady president to chair just in time to avoid crush ensued upon opening of door door be opened very speedily space of bazaar between stall became too crowded to have admitted safe passage of such woman a duchess of st bungay lady glencora who be le majestic in size gait did not find embarrassed now there arose before general work of fleecing wether lamb have well commenced terrible discord a of brass band with broken bassoon trumpet out of order from further end of building terrible noise of most unmusical music such a bartholomew fair in loudest day must hardly have known at diapason one must have thought that tender ear of may fair belgravia must have be crushed cracked riven asunder that female voice must have shrieked intensity of fashionable female agony must have displayed in best recognised form crash of brass be borne by a though have be rough schoolboy delighting in din duchess gave one jump then remained quiet undismayed if lady hartletop heard did not betray hearing lady glencora for moment put hand to ear a laughed did a though prettiness of motion be only one cause fine nerve of mr conway sparkes poetess bore without flinching mr chaucer munro with bevy rushed forward so that might lose nothing of what be coming what be going to do said margaret to cousin in alarm be play part of thing have not seen bill then margaret looked at great placard be exhibited near to though by mean intelligible to gave to understand that there be show in progress wit of thing seemed to consist chiefly in wonderful name chosen king of cannibal island be to appear on white charger king chrononhotonthologos be to be led in chain by tom thumb achilles must drag hector thrice round wall of troy queen godiva must ride through coventry accompanied by lord burghley ambassador from japan be also signified that in back part of premise theatrical entertainment must be carried on throughout afternoon king of cannibal island with royal brother sister chrononhotonthologos godiva taking principal part a nobody seemed to go to theatre performer spent time chiefly in making procession through amidst stall when a day waxed hot work became heavy seemed to be taken much in dudgeon by various bevy with whose business interfered materially on opening march rushed into bazaar with great energy though bore resemblance to character named in playbill though there be among godiva hector tom thumb japanese nevertheless a be dressed in paint armour after manner of late mr richardson hero a most of lady have probably be without previous opportunity of seeing such delight have effect when have made twenty first procession thing certainly grew stale a brought with infinity of dirt be doubt nuisance one must have be inclined to judge amateur actor with harshness who knew how much be called on to endure who must appreciate disgusting misery of hot summer afternoon spent beneath dust paint tin plate armour who must remember that performer received payment neither in eclat in thanks even in smile of beauty ca somebody tell not to come more said duchess almost cry with vexation towards end of afternoon then mr manfred smith who managed everything went to rear king warrior be sent away to get beer cooling drink at respective club poor mr manfred smith have not be present at moment in be wanted to lead duchess to stall duchess never forgave instead of calling by name from time to time enabling to shine in public a deserved to shine for have worked at bazaar for last six week a professional man ever worked at profession duchess always asked for somebody when wanted mr smith treated when came a though have be servant hired for occasion one very difficult job of work be given to before day be done wish 'd go over to young woman said duchess say that if make so much noise must go away young woman in question be mr chaucer munro bevy commission be one poor manfred smith found difficult to execute mr munro said will be sorry to hear that duchess have got headache think might be little quieter shout of loud nymph be by time high pooh said one of headache indeed said bother head said third if duchess be ill perhaps have better retire said mr chaucer munro then mr manfred smith walked off sorrowfully towards door seating on stool of money taker by entrance wiped off perspiration from brow have already put on third pair of yellow kid glove for occasion be soiled torn disreputable polished boot be brown with dust magenta ribbon round neck have become moist rope hat have be thrown down rumpled drop of oil have made spot upon trouser whisker be draggled out of order mouth be full of dirt doubt if mr manfred smith will ever undertake to manage bazaar duchess think be right in endeavour to mitigate riot among mr munro nymph indeed there be rioting among other nymph than hers though noise noise be loudest be difficult to say how there must not be riot seeing what be to be

pound have be cleared whether orphan of negro soldier be ever better for money be not able to say chapter xxviii showing how lion be stung by wasp may be remembered that mr maguire when first made public that pretty story of lion lamb declared that must give lion peace till that beast have disgorged prey that have pledged to continue fight till must have succeeded in bringing lamb back to pleasant pasture of littlebath mr maguire found difficulty in carrying out pledge be willing enough to fight weapon with to do battle be wanting to christian examiner having got so far into mess finding that ready sale did in truth result from special article a to lion lamb be indeed ready to go on with libel christian examiner probably have not much to lose there arose question whether fighting simply through column of christian examiner be not almost tantamount to fight at wanted to bring action against sir john ball to have sir john ball summoned into court examined about money to hear truculent barrister tell sir john ball that must not conceal from scorn of indignant public behind spangle of parvenu baronetcy have feeling that lion must be torn to piece if only properly truculent barrister must be got to fix claw into unfortunately lawyer not even solomon walker low church attorney at littlebath must advise that have ground for action if indeed chose to proceed against lady for breach of promise of marriage then result must depend on evidence in such case a that low church attorney at littlebath be willing to take matter up mr maguire be of course aware said solomon walker that there be prejudice in public mind against gentleman appearing a party to such suit mr maguire be also aware that must adduce evidence of fact beyond own unsupported in such case untrue word declared therefore to attorney in very high tone indeed that on account must take step to harass lady be simply against sir john ball that wished to proceed thing must come out in trial mr walker said must astonish legal world rapacious scheme of villainy have be conceived brought to bear through stupidity of people iniquity of others must unroll fold by fold a certainly a stand here if be properly handled by competent barrister in one of court of law think that mr maguire believed what be saying that believed moreover that be speaking truth when told mr walker that lady have promised to marry men who can succeed in deceiving one else will succeed at last in deceiving lawyer told repeating fact over over again that thing be impracticable that there be mean of carrying matter so far that sir john ball must be made to appear in witness box everything sir john have done have done legally even at moment of discussion between mr walker mr maguire question of ownership of property be being tried before proper tribunal in london mr maguire still thought mr walker to be wrong thought that attorney be weak ignorant man acknowledged to fact that in unhappy position be unable to get more cunning attorney to take matter in hand christian examiner still remained to that used with diligence from week to week there appeared in article attacking lion stating that lion be still being watched that prey must be snatched from at last that lamb must even yet have right like a thing went on periodical writer of article became courageous by habit till thing be printed sir john ball found almost impossible to bear be declared that be going to desert lamb now that have taken lamb property that lamb shorn of fleece be to be condemned to earn bread a common nurse in ward of common hospital information came readily enough to mr maguire by hand of miss colza paper containing article be always sent to sir john ball to miss mackenzie article be always headed lion lamb miss mackenzie in accordance with arrangement made to that purpose sent paper a soon a came to mr slow sir john ball have such ready way of freeing from burden groaned toiled under going to lawyer with imploring permission to bring action for libel against mr maguire venom of unclean animal sting have gone so deep into fond a be of money have told lawyer that must not begrudge expense if must only punish man who be hurting attorney who understood something of feeling a well a something of money begged to be quiet at rate till fate of property must be settled if will take advice sir john will not notice at may be sure that have not shilling in world that want to prosecute when have got damage against will be off out of country will have stopped impudent ribaldry said sir john ball then lawyer tried to explain to that one read ribaldry be of use sir john read be enough to make wretched little fable made sir john so unhappy have not for month past appeared in of metropolitan newspaper when legal inquiry into proper disposition of mr jonathan ball property be over when be known that a result of inquiry will in favour of mackenzie be to be set aside remains of property handed over to sir john then very influential newspaper in early day of question have told story of lion lamb told again tearing indeed littlebath christian examiner into shred for iniquity speaking of romantic misfortune of lamb in term made sir john ball very unhappy fame accrued to from being so publicly pointed out a lion be not fame of be proud when writer in very influential newspaper went on to say that world be now looking for termination of wonderful story must make pleasant to party be nearly beside in misery man of fifty of slow habit with none of buoyancy of youth left in apt to regard a older than age who have lived with father mother almost on equality in regard to habit of life father of large family of eldest be now man must be endured that one a must enter upon matrimony amidst din of public trumpet under halo of romance idea of be frightful to on very day on result of legal investigation be officially communicated to sat in old study at cedar with two newspaper before in one of there be description of love knew be intended a furtive ridicule assurance to public that lamb misfortune must all be remedied by sweet music of marriage bell what right have one to assert publicly that intended to marry one in wretchedness anger must have indicted newspaper also for libel have not lawyer assured that according to law there be libel in stating that man be going to be married other paper accused of rapacity dishonesty in must not marry lamb now that have secured lamb fleece so that in truth have escape on side for mr maguire having at last ascertained that lamb have in very truth lost fleece be no longer desirous of personal connection felt that must best carry out pledge by attacking possessor of fleece on side under such circumstance what be such man a sir john ball to do must marry cousin amidst trumpet halo doggrel poetry must abound be right that must be made mark for finger of scorn have done anything to deserve punishment must be remembered that from day to day own mother who lived with who sat with late night talking on one subject be always instigating to abandon cousin have be admitted between that be no longer bound by offer margaret have admitted doe not attempt to deny a lady ball repeated over over again when have made offer have known nothing of mr maguire offer have margaret then told of such reticence on part of course released from bond so lady ball argued against argument son made demur indeed be hardly possible that must comprehend exactly what have taken place between cousin mr maguire mother did not scruple to assure that must undoubtedly at one time have accepted man proposal in answer to john ball must always assert entire reliance on cousin word did without knowing that did so lady ball must answer in language must have assented mother be never able to extract from son intimation of intention to give up marriage though used threat tear ridicule argument appeal to pride appeal to pocket never said that certainly must marry never said so at least after night on margaret in bedroom have told story with reference to mr maguire did ever say that certainly must not marry lady ball gathered from word conviction that must be glad to be released if must be released by act on margaret behalf therefore have made attempt on margaret with what success reader will hope remember margaret when accepted cousin offer have be specially bidden by to be firm bidding obeyed on side there be hope at for lady ball fear there be much of cowardice on sir john part have in truth forgiven margaret offence that have committed in reference to mr maguire have accepted offer while offer be still dragging on existence after sort have not be first to tell of circumstance there have be offence to in offence have in truth forgiven have there be littlebath christian examiner tale of lion lamb publicity ridicule must quietly have walked off with cousin to church having gone through preliminary ceremony in most silent manner possible for must have quietly got married have carried margaret home with now that father be dead that uncle jonathan money have come to pecuniary care be comparatively light believed that must be very happy with margaret child then to be pointed at daily a lion to be asked by acquaintance after lamb must be owned that be coward be not most men coward in such matter a now trial be over money be own margaret be left without shilling in world be quite necessary that must make up mind have once told lawyer in premature joy on very day on mr maguire have come to cedar that everything be to be made smooth by marriage between disinherited heiress have since told lawyer that something have occurred might perhaps alter arrangement after that lawyer have asked question about marriage when communicated to client final intelligence that jonathan ball money be at client disposal said that must be well to arrange what must be done on miss mackenzie behalf sir john ball have assumed very plainly look of vexation when question be put to promised mr slow must ask said lawyer mr slow be of course anxious for client be business not mr slow said sir john ball may tell say so then there have be moment silence sir john have felt to be wrong pray tell also said sir john be very grateful to for solicitude about cousin that fully appreciate admirable conduct to throughout affair when have made up mind what will be done will let know at once a walked down from lawyer chamber in bedford row to railway station thought of thought also of word mr mackenzie have spoken to in bazaar have right to scold yet have said to margaret of course have understood what meant of course margaret have understood also have not be at angry when be spoken margaret have be so prettily dressed have looked so fresh nice at moment have forgotten annoyance in admiration have listened to mr mackenzie cunning speech not without confusion without immediate desire to contradict necessary inference moment two afterwards harpy have be upon then have gone off in anger poor margaret have be unable to distinguish between effect produced by speech by harpy mr mackenzie have be more clever have consequently predicted cousin speedy promotion in world rank sir john a went home made up mind to one of two alternative must either marry cousin halve jonathan ball money with wanted to marry wanted to keep money wanted to marry especially since have seen how nice looked in black freckled muslin wanted to marry in silence without clash of absurd trumpet without ridicule moving leading

thereupon lady ball got out handkerchief son perceived that real tear be running down face nobody have ever spoken of going except wo live in house with what must have do must wish to let go way

certainly came true few day passed by lover came early on friday morning after bazaar margaret who at moment be in own room be told that sir john be below in drawing room with mr mackenzie have already be there little time servant said mr mackenzie have sent up with love to know if miss mackenzie must come down must go down of course must go to cousin be coward indeed true griselda can

be put into hand how be to marry cousin after if be to do so must not that wretch at littlebath declare through provincial metropolitan newspaper that have compelled marriage that letter must be published in very column that told of wedding yet must decide must do something who read will probably declare that be weak fool to regard anything that one a mr maguire must say of be not fool be so far weak foolish in such matter such men be weak foolish often cowardly be however absolutely necessary that must do something be a well aware a be mr mackenzie that be essentially duty to see cousin now that question of law between have be settled even if have thought of again asking to be wife must not confide to one else task of telling what be to be fate conduct to in matter of property have be exemplary be incumbent on to thank for generous forbearance have pledged also to give mother final answer on saturday on friday morning therefore knocked at mackenzie house door in cavendish square soon found alone with mr mackenzie know that even then have come to fixed purpose what must have preferred must have be permission to postpone action a regard cousin for six month to have be empowered to use time in crushing mr maguire out of existence might not be so therefore went to cavendish square that might there decide fate want to see margaret doubt said mr mackenzie that may tell that ruin be finally completed a thus spoke of cousin ruin smiled sweetest smile put on pleasantest look yes do want to see presently said mr mackenzie have stood up a though be about to go in quest of cousin have sat down again when word presently be spoken be by mean averse to having few word of conversation about margaret if sir john must wish sir john fear have merely used word through instinctive idea that might thereby stave off difficulty for while think looked very well at bazaar said mr mackenzie very well indeed answered very well ca say liked place of can assure only must do sort of thing sometimes know margaret be very much admired there so much have be said of singular story about fortune that people have of course talked more of than must otherwise have done have be great misfortune said sir john frowning have be misfortune have be one of thing ca be helped think have cause to complain for margaret have behaved a other woman ever did behave think conduct have be perfect complain of a for rest must settle that with world care for one beyond for part think be best to let thing die away of after what doe matter a long a one doe nothing to be ashamed of oneself people ca break bone by talking must think very unpleasant mr mackenzie to have name brought up in newspaper upon word think must care about a long a husband stood by what be after people say that margaret be lion lamb what be harm of being called lamb lion a long a people be not made to believe that have behaved badly that have be false cruel ca see that come to much one doe not of course wish to have newspaper article written about one indeed ca break bone can make world think dishonest a long a take care that be honest now in matter take for granted that margaret be going to make match of have told so mr mackenzie paused moment to collect thought before answered be only for moment sir john ball hardly perceived that have ceased to speak said have not told so have told that must be so doe not wish do want to tell lady secret in such case a truth be always best doe wish with heart a much a woman ever wished for anything need have doubt about loving of course mr mackenzie must take care in case that be provided for amply if single life will suit best will have half of that ever thought to be own do wish to be so have not said that mr mackenzie may be must wish to have choice fairly in own power then can tell at once must choose offer be very generous be more than generous sir john single life will not suit belief be that be to offer money without hand must not take farthing of must have provision will take none from one need be under doubt whatsoever will take without moment doubt a to own future happiness sir john think must have best wife know anywhere among acquaintance then stopped sat silent making reply will send to now said mr mackenzie suppose might a well said sir john then mr mackenzie got up left room did not go up to cousin felt that must not see margaret without saying something of what have passed between sir john that must be better that nothing must be said so went away to own room dispatched maid to send lamb to lion nevertheless be not without compunction twang of feminine conscience that mr mackenzie gave up opportunity of saying last important word perhaps doing last important little act with regard to niceness of thought perhaps too much mr mackenzie philosophy be not without truth man of fifty must not be made to marry woman by muslin starch if be not prepared to marry on other consideration when message came margaret thought nothing of muslin starch bonnet have be worth weight in gold black freckled dress be forgotten thought of word cousin john have spoken to a soon a have got through little gate into ground of cedar when have walked back together from railway station at twickenham remembered that have then pledged to be firm if alluded to offer have then made repeated must throw into arm at once tell that must serve with heart strength a long a god might leave together be quite a strongly determined to accept from for other kind of provision that money for short while have be hers be now must have claim upon unless gave claim of wife after what have passed between must not be recipient of charity certain word have be written spoken from have gathered existence in mr slow mind of such plan a client must lose cause meekly graciously must then have claim for alms have be idea on mr slow have worked have long made up mind that mr slow must be taught to know better if day for such offering of alms must ever come perhaps have come now took up little scarf that wore ordinarily folded tight across shoulder quite forgetful of muslin starch a descended to drawing room in order that question might be solved for sir john met almost at door a entered be afraid have be expecting to come sooner said indeed be not quite sure that must come at oh yes be certain to come have hardly received a yet official notification that cause have be lost be not cause john said smiling received other notification than what got through mr mackenzie indeed a know have regarded law business a nonsense through since what mr slow told have known that property be yours be quite necessary to have judgment suppose so there be end of for one be not in least disappointed if will give comfort to know believe that other woman in england must have lost fortune with equanimity that have shown must not explain to that in first day of dismay caused by misfortune have given such consolation a to make forget loss that subsequent misery have be caused by withdrawal of consolation must not tell that very memory of money have be a be drowned by other hope in life by other hope by other despair when praised for equanimity thought of still smiled a heard praise suppose ought to return compliment said declare that cousin who have be kept so long out of own money ever behaved so well a have done can assure have thought of very often of injustice have be involuntarily done to have be unjust have not said piteously thinking of injury so much of have gone in oilcloth business for nothing be glad at rate that walter share did not go knew that be not kind of conversation have desired to commence that must be changed before anything must be settled so shook began again now margaret a lawyer have finished part of business ours must begin have be standing hitherto have felt to be strong enough to stand at sound of word knee have become weak under found retreat upon sofa of course said nothing a came stood over hope have understood continued that while be going on must propose arrangement of kind know have be very much troubled indeed have seems that blackguard have right to publish lie that like about one in of newspaper that nobody can do anything to protect sometimes have thought that must drive mad again perceived that be getting out of right course in thus dwelling upon own injury have come there to alleviate misfortune not to talk about own be good however talking about be margaret will cease now will not can not say fear not whichever way turn abuse for what do what business be of mean absurd story calling lion talk of margaret then margaret be again silent by mean wished to talk of story if must only leave alone now about then came sat beside put hand back behind cushion on sofa so a to save from trembling in presence need not have cared much for let tremble ever so much have then capacity for perceiving come margaret want to do what be best for how will be john have child must do what be best for then there be pause again when spoke after while be looking down at floor poking among pattern on carpet with stick margaret when first asked to marry refused did said then property be mine afterwards said must have yes when asked second time have nothing know thought nothing about money then mean that never thought refused because be rich took because be poor be not at unhappy about when be walking round shrubbery when thought have cared for man have never cared for said margaret withdrawing hand from behind pillow in energy fearing no longer that might tremble have never cared for be false man told untruth to aunt yes be liar damnable liar be true at rate be beneath notice john beneath mine will not speak of sir john however have idea when felt wasp venom through blood wasp must not be altogether beneath notice question be said speaking between teeth hardly pronouncing word question be whether care for do said turning round upon a did so griselda took hand in hers do john do care for love better than world besides whom else have to love at if choose to think mean of now that be so poor can not help who be told to be firm who be told who be told lady ball have lost game mr mackenzie have be true prophet mr mackenzie have be one of prophet who knew how to assist accomplishment of own prophecy lady ball have played game with very indifferent skill sir john endeavoured to say word a to that other alternative that have to offer lamb be not lamb like enough to listen to doubt even whether margaret knew when at night thought over
