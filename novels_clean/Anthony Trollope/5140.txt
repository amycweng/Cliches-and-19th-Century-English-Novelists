wife be clever pretty attractive nora be that unmarried sister must be there have come to be trouble bitter word lady rowley have be right when said that daughter emily also liked to have own way if be suspected said mr trevelyan to sister one morning a sat together in little back drawing room life will not be worth having how can talk of being suspected emily what doe mean then by saying that must rather not have colonel osborne here man older than own father who have known since be baby did mean anything of kind emily know did not must not say so must be too horrible to think of be great deal too horrible to be spoken know if doe not beg pardon will will continue to live with of course a sort of upper servant because of baby will know what think feel if be must forget how can forget nothing can do plea be civil kind to because be not master know what thing say to be to tell colonel osborne not to come heaven earth how must ever hold up head again if be driven to do that will be here to day have doubt louis will sit there below in library hear step will not come up tell richard to say be not at home yes everybody will understand why for what be to deny in way to best oldest friend have if such order be to be given let give then see what will come of mr trevelyan have described colonel osborne truly a far a word went in saying that have known since be baby that be older man than father colonel osborne age exceeded father by about month a be now past fifty might be considered perhaps in respect to be safe friend for young married woman be in respect man very different from sir marmaduke sir marmaduke blessed at same time burdened a be with wife eight daughter condemned a have be to pas large portion of life within tropic have become at fifty what many people call quite middle aged man be to say be one from whom effervescence elasticity salt of youth have altogether passed away be fat slow thinking much of wife eight daughter thinking much also of dinner now colonel osborne be bachelor with burden imposed upon by position a member of parliament man of fortune to whom world have be very easy be not therefore said so decidedly of a of sir marmaduke that be middle aged man although have probably already lived more than two third of life be good looking man of age bald indeed at top of head with considerable sprinkling of grey hair through bushy beard upright in carriage active quick in step who dressed well be clearly determined to make most must of what remained to of advantage of youth colonel osborne be always so dressed that one ever observed nature of garment being doubt well aware that man after twenty five can afford to call special attention to coat hat cravat trouser nevertheless matter be one to paid much attention be by mean lax in ascertaining what tailor did for always rode pretty horse mounted groom on one at rate a pretty be known to have excellent stud down in shire have reputation of going well with hound poor sir marmaduke must not have ridden hunt to save government credit when therefore mr trevelyan declared to sister that colonel osborne be man whom be entitled to regard with semi parental feeling of veneration because be older than father made comparison be more true in letter than in spirit when asserted that colonel osborne have known since be baby fell again into same mistake colonel osborne have indeed known when be baby have in old day be very intimate friend of father of have seen little nothing since baby day till have met her just a be about to become mr trevelyan though be natural that so old friend must come to congratulate renew friendship nevertheless be not true that made appearance in husband house in guise of useful old family friend who give silver cup to child kiss little girl for sake of old affection have borne for parent know appearance of old gentleman how pleasant dear fellow be how welcome be face within gate how free make with wine generally abusing how tell eldest daughter to light candle for how gave silver cup when girl be born now bestows tea service a get married most useful safe charming fellow not year younger looking more nimble than without whom life must be very blank know that man man be not colonel osborne in house of mr trevelyan young bride emily rowley when be brought home from mandarin island to be wife of louis trevelyan be very handsome young woman tall with bust rather full for age with dark eye eye looked to be dark because eye brow eye lash be nearly black be in truth so varying in colour that must not tell hue brown hair be very dark very soft tint of complexion be brown also though colour of cheek be often so bright a to induce enemy to say falsely of that painted be very strong a be girl who come from tropic whom tropical climate have suited must sit on horse whole day long must never be weary with dancing at government house ball when colonel osborne be introduced to a baby whom have known thought must be very pleasant to be intimate with so pleasant friend meaning harm indeed a few men do mean harm on such occasion still not regarding beautiful young woman whom have seen a one of generation succeeding to of own to whom must be duty to make useful on account of old friendship bore to father be moreover well known in london though not known at to mr trevelyan that ancient lothario have before made troublesome in more than one family be fond of intimacy with married lady perhaps be not averse to excitement of marital hostility must be remembered however that hostility to allusion be here made be not hostility of pistol horsewhip indeed be generally hostility of word of spoken anger young husband may dislike too friendly bearing of friend may yet abstain from outrage on own dignity on wife be conveyed by word of suspicion louis trevelyan having taken strong dislike to colonel osborne having failed to make wife understand that dislike must have induced to throw cold water upon colonel friendship have allowed to speak word probably must have willingly recalled a soon a spoken word spoken can not be recalled many man many woman who have spoken word at once regretted be far too proud to express regret so be with louis trevelyan when told wife that did not wish colonel osborne to come so often to house have said with flashing eye angry tone though have seen eye flash before be familiar with angry tone have never before felt to be insulted by husband a soon a word have be spoken trevelyan have left room have gone down among book when be alone knew that have insulted wife be quite aware that must have spoken to gently have explained to with arm round waist that must be better for of that friend friendship must be limited there be so much in turn of eye in tone given to word when such thing have to be said so much more of importance than in word a trevelyan thought of remembered what manner have be how much anger have expressed how far have be from having arm round wife waist a spoke to almost made up mind to go up stair to apologise be one to whose nature giving of apology be repulsive must not bear to have to own to have be wrong then wife have be most provoking in manner to when have endeavoured to make understand wish by certain disparaging hint have thrown out a to colonel osborne saying that be dangerous man one who did not show true character snake in grass man without settled principle such like wife have taken up cudgel for friend have openly declared that did not believe word of thing be alleged against still for that be true husband have said have doubt that think so wife have replied men do believe evil of one very often must excuse if say that think be mistaken have known colonel osborne much longer than have done louis papa have always have highest opinion of then mr trevelyan have become very angry have spoken word must not recall a walked to fro among book down stair almost felt that ought to beg wife pardon knew wife well enough to be sure that must not forgive unless did so must do so thought not exactly now moment must come in might be easier than at present must be able to assure when went up to dress for dinner that have meant harm be going out to dine at house of lady of rank countess dowager of milborough lady standing high in world esteem of whom wife stood little in awe calculated that feeling if did not make task easy must yet take from of difficulty emily must be not exactly cowed by prospect of lady milborough dinner perhaps little reduced from usual self assertion must say word to when be dressing assuring that have not intended to animadvert in slightest degree upon own conduct illustration shewing how wrath began luncheon be served two lady went down into dining room mr trevelyan did not appear there be nothing in singular in a be accustomed to declare that luncheon be meal too much in day that man must eat nothing beyond biscuit between breakfast dinner must sometimes come in eat biscuit standing on hearth rug drink what must call quarter of glass of sherry must probably have be well that must have done so now remained in library behind dining room when wife sister in law have

picture wife have declined to join mr fairfax party having declared that a be going to dine out must not leave baby afternoon louis trevelyan though strove to apply mind to article be writing for scientific quarterly review must not keep from anxiety a to expected visit from colonel osborne be not in least jealous swore to fifty time over such feeling on part must be monstrous injury to wife nevertheless knew that must be gratified if on special day colonel osborne must be informed that wife be not at home whether man be admitted not must beg wife pardon must thought do so with more thorough efficacy affection if must have shown disposition to comply with wish on day do say word to richard said nora to sister in whisper a be going up stair after luncheon will not said mr trevelyan may do certainly not nora must feel that be demeaning be to allow what be said to in manner to have effect upon think be so wrong emily do indeed must allow to be best judge what to do in own house with own husband oh yes certainly if give command will obey if have expressed wish in other word must have complied to be told that must rather not have colonel osborne here if have seen manner heard word must not have be surprised must feel a do be gross insult be not first a spoke fire flashed from eye bright red colour of cheek told tale of anger sister well knew how to read then there be knock at door knew that colonel osborne be there louis trevelyan sitting in library also knew of whose coming that knock gave notice chapter ii colonel osborne have be already said that colonel osborne be bachelor man of fortune member of parliament one who carried half century of year lightly on shoulder will only be necessary to say further of that be man popular with among whom

health have that world must give be fond of book picture architecture china have various taste mean of indulging be one of few men on whom seems that pleasant thing have be lavished there be little slur on good name to allusion have be made who knew colonel osborne best be generally willing to declare that harm be intended that evil arose be always to be attributed to mistaken jealousy have friend said free pleasant way with woman woman like pleasant way of free friendship that there be more that harm have come have always come from false suspicion there be certain lady about town good motherly discreet woman who hated name of colonel osborne who must not admit within door who must not bow to in other people house who must always speak of a serpent hyena kite shark old lady milborough be one of daughter of friend of hers having once admitted serpent to intimacy augustus poole be wise enough to take wife abroad said old lady milborough discussing about time with gossip of hers danger of mr trevelyan position there must have be break up there yet there never be better girl in world than jane marriott reader may be quite certain that colonel osborne have premeditated evil intention when allowed to become intimate friend of old friend daughter there be nothing fiendish in nature be not man who boasted of conquest be not ravening wolf going about seeking whom might devour determined to devour might come in way liked that be pleasant of pleasant thing company of pretty clever woman be to pleasantest at exact period of life woman be so pleasantly pretty to so agreeably clever a mr trevelyan when louis trevelyan heard on stair step of dangerous man got up from chair a though too must have gone into drawing room must perhaps have be well have done so must have done kept temper with man must have paved way for easy reconciliation with wife when reached door of room have placed hand upon lock withdrew again told withdrew because must not allow to be jealous in truth did so because knew must not have brought to be civil to man hated so sat down took up pen began to cudgel brain about scientific article be intent on raising dispute with learned pundit about wave of sound must think of other sound than of light step of colonel osborne a have gone up stair put down pen clenched fist allowed black frown to settle upon brow what right have man to come there unasked by disturb happiness then poor wife of who knew so little of english life who have lived in mandarin island almost since have be child who have lived in one colony almost since have be born who have have so few of advantage for must have looked in marrying wife how be poor girl to conduct properly when subjected to art practised villanies of viper yet poor girl be so stiff

become mr poole must too carry off wife to naples in order to place out of reach of hyena be terrible to to think that must pack up everything run away from such one a colonel osborne even be to consent to do how must explain to very wife for whose sake must do if got hint of reason must did not doubt refuse to go a thought of a visit up stair prolonged almost thought must be best for to be round with know what husband mean when resolve to be round with wife began to think that must not apologise at for word have spoken must speak again somewhat more sharply than before must be very wrathful with there must be silent enduring indignation a understood well must be infinitely worse than torrent of word be man to abstain from doing believed to be duty because be afraid of wife anger must be deterred from saying that conceived must be right that must say because be stiff necked no must not apologise must tell again that be necessary for happiness for hers that intimacy with colonel osborne must be discontinued be brought to strongly marital resolution by length of man present visit by by fact that during latter portion of wife be alone with colonel osborne nora have be there when man came mr fairfax have called not getting out of carriage nora have be constrained to go down to have hesitated moment colonel osborne have observed partly understood hesitation when saw have be perfectly well minded in matter must have gone too probably told that nora rowley be fool that in such matter be quite enough for man to know that did not intend harm have better go down nora said mr trevelyan mr fairfax will be ever so angry if keep waiting then nora have gone two be alone together nora have gone trevelyan have heard a be going knew colonel osborne be alone with wife if

must be gross job be nonsense to colonel osborne lady always like political job think that only make politics bearable must not be job at papa must do better than anybody else think how long have be

of common be about to sit on subject committee have be voted two governor be to be brought home for purpose of giving evidence what arrangement must be so pleasant to governor living in mandarin island who have have holiday lately who must ill afford to take holiday at own expense colonel osborne be on committee moreover be on good term at colonial office there be men in office who must be glad to do colonel osborne service then if be job must be so very little of job perhaps sir marmaduke might not be very best man for purpose perhaps government of mandarin did not afford best specimen of colonial lore be business of committee to master then two governor be to come might be a well to have one of best sort one of second best one supposed that excellent old sir marmaduke be paragon of governor then have infinity of experience for over twenty year have be from island to island have at least steered clear of great scrape will try at rate said colonel do colonel osborne mamma must come with of course must leave to manage that be not very likely that must leave lady rowley behind never have know think more of mamma than ever doe of fancy having here in autumn suppose if came for

out in horrible place how must like to live in mandarin must prefer london certainly of course must must begrudge papa month two when come never cared about being in parliament before will think so much of now if can manage to get papa home there must be nothing more innocent than nothing more innocent at rate a regarded offence against mr trevelyan just then there came word little startled mr trevelyan made feel afraid be doing wrong must make one stipulation with emily said colonel what be that must not tell husband oh dear why not be sure be sharp enough to see why must not word of repeated at club must put end at once to project must be very damaging to beyond must wish to know have meddled with at be very chary of having name connected with anything of kind upon word must do for living human being will promise emily gave promise there be two thing in matter a stood at present did not at like be very averse to having secret from husband with colonel osborne be not at pleased at being told that be doing for favour that must not have done for other living human being have said so to yesterday before offensive word have be spoken by husband must not have thought much about must have connected man friendship for herself with very old friendship for father must have regarded assurance a made to rowleys in general not to herself in particular now after what have occurred pained to be told by colonel osborne that must make specially on behalf sacrifice of political pride must make for other person living then a have called by christian name a have exacted promise there have be tone of affection in voice that have almost felt to be too warm gave promise when pressed hand at parting pressed again in token of gratitude for kindness to be done to father mother immediately afterwards colonel osborne went away mr trevelyan be left alone in drawing room knew that husband be still down stair listened for moment to hear whether must now come up to too have heard colonel step a went for few moment have doubted whether must at once go to wife though believed to be man very firm of purpose mind have oscillated backwards forward within last quarter of hour between two purpose of being round with wife of begging pardon for word have already spoken believed that must best do duty by plan of being round with then must be so much pleasanter at rate so much easier to beg pardon of one thing be quite certain must by mean exclude colonel from house must not live continue to endure feeling have suffered while sitting down stair at desk with knowledge that colonel osborne be closeted with wife up stair might be that there be nothing in that wife be innocent be quite sure nevertheless be so much affected by feeling pervaded in reference to man that energy be destroyed power of mind body be paralysed must not must not stand rather than that must follow mr poole take wife to naples so resolving put hat on head walked out of house must have advantage of afternoon consideration before took one step other a soon a be gone emily trevelyan went up stair to baby must not stir a long a there have be chance of coming to very much wished that must come have made up mind in spite of fierceness of assertion to sister to accept slightest hint at apology husband might offer to to state of mind be brought by consciousness of having secret from by sense not of impropriety on own part of conduct people might have called improper in mode of parting from man against whom husband have warned warmth of hand pressing affectionate tone in name have be pronounced promise made to softened heart towards husband have gone to now said word to in gentleness might have be made right did not go to if chooses to be cross sulky may be cross sulky said mr trevelyan to herself a went up to baby have louis be with nora asked a soon a mr fairfax have brought home have not seen since left said mr trevelyan suppose went out before colonel osborne indeed waited till colonel osborne have gone then went did not come near be for to judge of own conduct must say that think be very foolish young wife said in tone clearly indicated that have judged husband conduct have found to be very foolish indeed do think that papa mamma will really come said nora changing subject of conversation how can tell how be to know after have passed be afraid to say word lest must be accused of doing wrong remember nora be not to speak of to one will tell louis will tell one dear dear emily pray keep anything secret from what do mean by secret there be secret only in such matter a about politics gentleman like to have name talked about look of great distress came upon nora face a heard to seemed to be very bad that there must be secret between sister colonel osborne to be kept from brother in law suppose will suspect next said mr trevelyan angrily emily how can say anything so cruel look a if did only mean that think must be wiser to tell to louis how can tell colonel osborne private business when colonel osborne have desired not to do so for whose sake be colonel osborne doing for papa mamma suppose louis wo be jealous because want to have papa mamma home must not be bit le unreasonable than other chapter iii lady milborough dinner party louis trevelyan went down to club in pall acrobat there heard rumour added to anger against colonel osborne acrobat be very distinguished club into be now difficult for young man to find way almost impossible for man who be no longer young therefore known to many have be founded twenty year since with idea

getting done be to come a witness for committee must be end of lounge for doe count a leave have shilling paid for down to cab fare when go out to dinner there be nothing like having friend at court such be secrecy of colonel osborne secret have be so chary of having name mentioned in connection with political job that have found necessary to impose on young friend burden of secret from husband yet husband heard whole story told openly at club on same day there be nothing in story to anger trevelyan have not immediately felt that there must be plan in matter between wife colonel osborne of have be kept ignorant hitherto indeed wife a reader know must not have told have not seen since matter have be discussed between friend be angry because first learned at club that thought ought to have learned at home a soon a reached house went at once to wife room maid be with nothing must be said at moment then dressed intending to go to emily a soon a girl have left girl remained be a believed kept in room purposely by wife so that must have moment of private conversation went down stair therefore found nora standing by drawing room fire so be dressed first to day said thought turn always came last emily sent jenny to first to day because thought must be home did go up to dress till last minute be intended well by nora did not have desired effect trevelyan who have command over own feature frowned showed that be displeased hesitated moment thinking whether must ask nora question a to report about father mother before have spoken wife be in room be late fear said emily at rate be last said husband about minute said wife then got into hired brougham be standing at door trevelyan in sweet day of early confidence with wife have offered to keep carriage for explaining to that luxury though costly must not be beyond reach have persuaded against carriage there have come to be agreement that instead of carriage there must always be autumn tour one learns something from going about one learns nothing from keeping carriage emily have said have be happy day in have be intended that everything must always be rose coloured now be meditating whether in lieu of autumn tour must not be necessary to take wife away to naples altogether so that might be removed from influence of of of not even to must think of colonel osborne a wife lover idea be too horrible yet how dreadful be that must have for reason to withdraw from influence of man lady milborough lived ever so far away in eccleston square trevelyan did not say single word to of companion during journey be cross vexed be conscious that knew that be cross vexed mr trevelyan sister talked to other whole way did so in tone clearly indicates that conversation be made up not for interest attached to question asked answer given because be expedient that there must not be silence nora said something about marwill snellgrove tried to make believe that be very anxious for sister answer emily said something about opera at covent garden be intended to show that mind be quite at ease of failed altogether knew that failed once twice trevelyan thought that must say word in token a be of repentance like naughty child who knew that be naughty be trying to be good must not do fiend be too strong within must have known that there be proposition for father return through colonel osborne influence a man at club have heard how must not have known when got out at lady milborough door have spoken to of there be large dull party made up mostly of old people lady milborough trevelyan mother have be bosom

emily have of course followed husband mode of thinking lady milborough have once twice given advice on small matter telling that that air must be good for baby explaining that mother during certain interesting portion of life must refresh with certain kind of malt liquor of counsel on such domestic subject mr trevelyan be impatient a indeed be nature to be in matter consequently authorized a have be by husband manner of speaking of mother friend have taken habit of quizzing lady milborough behind back almost of continuing practice before old lady face lady milborough who be most affectionate old soul alive good tempered with friend to fault have never resented have come to fear that mr trevelyan be perhaps little flighty have never a yet allowed to say anything worse of young friend wife than must always add that kind of thing must cure a nursery became full must be understood therefore that mr trevelyan be not anticipating much pleasure from lady milborough party that have accepted invitation a matter of duty there be present among guest certain honourable charles glascock eldest son of lord peterborough who made affair more interesting to nora than be to sister have be whispered into nora ear by more than one person among others by lady milborough whose own daughter be married that might if thought fit become honourable mr charles glascock now whether might think fit whether might not presence of gentleman under such circumstance a far a be concerned gave interest to evening a lady milborough took care that mr glascock must take nora down to dinner interest be very great mr glascock be good looking man just under forty in parliament heir to peerage known to be well off in respect to income lady milborough mr trevelyan have told nora rowley must encouragement in direction come in way ought to allow to fall in love with mr glascock certain amount of encouragement have come in way have not a yet allowed to fall in love with mr glascock seemed to that mr glascock be quite conscious of advantage of own position that power of talking about other matter than with be immediately connected be limited did believe that have in truth paid compliment of falling in love with be compliment to few girl be indifferent nora might perhaps have tried to fall in love with mr glascock have not be forced to make comparison between other one have not fallen in love with a well knew certainly have not fallen in love with still comparison be forced upon did not result in favour of mr glascock on present occasion mr glascock a sat next to almost proposed to have never seen monkhams said monkhams be father seat very grand place in worcestershire of course knew very well that have never seen monkhams how must have seen have never be in part of england at replied must so like to show monkhams oak there be finest in kingdom do like oak who doe not like oak have none in island nobody have ever seen so few a have will show monkhams day will indeed hope that day may really show monkhams now when unmarried man talk to young lady of really showing house in will be destiny to live can hardly mean other than to invite to live there with must at least be purpose to signify that if duly encouraged will so invite nora rowley did not give mr glascock much encouragement on occasion be afraid be not likely that anything will ever take into part of country said there be something perhaps in tone checked mr glascock so that did not then press invitation when lady be up stair in drawing room lady milborough contrived to seat on couch intended for two person only close to mr trevelyan emily thinking that might perhaps hear advice about guinness stout prepared to be saucy matter in hand be graver than lady milborough mind be uneasy about colonel osborne dear said be not father very intimate with colonel osborne be very intimate with lady milborough ah yes thought have heard so that make of course natural that must know have known life said emily forgetting probably that out of twenty three year month have hitherto lived there have be consecutive period of more than twenty year in have never seen man whom have known life make difference of course mean to say anything against hope not lady milborough because be especially fond of be said with so much of purpose that poor dear old lady milborough be stopped in good work knew well terrible strait to augustus poole have be brought with wife although nobody supposed that poole wife have ever entertained wrong thought in pretty little heart nevertheless have be compelled to break up establishment take wife to naples because horrid colonel must make at home in mr poole drawing room in knightsbridge augustus poole with courage enough to take man by beard have taking by beard be possible have found impossible to dislodge colonel must not do so without making row must have be disgraceful to injurious to wife therefore have taken mr poole to naples lady milborough knew whole story thought that foresaw that same thing be about to happen in drawing room in curzon street when attempted to say word to wife found stopped must not go on in quarter after reception with beginning of word have be met perhaps might succeed better with husband after friendship be with trevelyan side not with rowleys dear louis said want to speak word to come here then led into distant corner mr trevelyan watching while guessing why husband be thus carried away just want to give little hint be sure believe be quite unnecessary continued lady milborough then paused trevelyan must not speak looked into face saw that be black man be only child of dearest friend persevered do know quite like colonel osborne coming so much to house face before became still blacker still man said nothing dare say be prejudice on part have always disliked think be dangerous friend what call snake in grass though emily high good sense love for general feeling on subject be just what husband must desire indeed be quite sure that possibility of anything wrong have never entered into head be very purity of innocence make danger be bad man must just say word to if be to make understand that coming to of morning be not desirable upon word believe there be nothing like so much a going about making mischief between men wife thus delivered louis trevelyan though be sore angry must not feel that have taken part of friend that have said have be true that have said to have said to more than once too hated man believed to be snake in grass be intolerably bitter to that must be warned about wife conduct by living human being that to whom world have be so full of good fortune that who have in truth taught to think that deserved so much good fortune must be made subject of care on behalf of friend because of danger between wife on spur of moment did not know what answer to make be not man whom like said just be careful louis be said lady milborough then be gone to be cautioned about wife conduct can not be pleasant to man be very unpleasant to louis trevelyan too have be asked question about sir marmaduke expected visit to england after lady have left room town have heard of except hardly spoke word that evening till brougham be announced wife have observed silence when be seated in carriage together with wife nora rowley immediately asked question about sir marmaduke emily said be there truth in report hear that father be coming home answer be made for moment two there be silence must have heard of then said perhaps can tell nora a emily will not reply have heard anything of father coming yes have heard of said nora slowly why have not be told be to be kept secret said mr trevelyan boldly secret from everybody else know why be to be secret colonel osborne did not wish that must be known said mr trevelyan have colonel osborne to do between father in matter with may not be made acquainted will have nothing more between colonel osborne will not see colonel osborne do hear hear louis do mean to obey by g will obey remember lay positive order upon that will not see colonel osborne again know perhaps be already forfeiting reputation a honest woman bringing disgrace upon by familiarity with colonel osborne oh louis say that said nora have better let speak at once said emily have said what have got to say be now only necessary that must give solemn assurance that will obey if have said that have to say perhaps will listen to said wife will listen to nothing till have given promise then certainly will not give dear emily pray pray do what tell said nora have yet to learn that be duty to do a tell said trevelyan because be obstinate will not learn from who know better than what woman may do what may not will ruin destroy happiness know that have destroyed happiness by unreasonable jealousy said wife have considered what must feel in having such word addressed to by husband if be fit to be told must promise not to see man living can not be fit to be man wife then burst out into hysterical fit of tear in condition got out of carriage entered house hurried up to own room indeed have not be to blame said nora to trevelyan on staircase why have there be secret kept from between man that too after have cautioned against being intimate with be sorry that must suffer be better that must suffer little now than that must suffer much by by nora endeavoured to explain to truth about committee colonel osborne promised influence reason why there be to be secret be too much in hurry to get to sister to make matter plain be too much angered to listen to shook head when spoke of colonel osborne dislike to have name mentioned in connection with matter world know said with scornful laughter be in vain that nora endeavoured to explain to that though world might know emily have only heard of proposition a thing quite unsettled a to nothing at present must be spoken openly be in vain to endeavour to make peace on night nora hurried up to sister found that hysterical tear have again given place to anger must not see husband unless must beg pardon must not see unless must give promise demanded husband wife did not see other again on night chapter iv hugh stanbury illustration have be already stated that nora rowley be not quite so well disposed a perhaps ought to have be to fall in love with honourable charles

question that must fall in love because have not shilling in world other gentleman be equally aware that be not open to to fall in love with nora rowley for same reason in regard to such matter nora rowley have be properly brought up having be made to understand by best most cautious of mother in matter of falling in love be absolutely necessary that bread cheese must be considered romance be very pretty thing lady rowley have be wont to say to daughter think life must be worth having without little of must be very sorry to think that of girl must marry man only because have money ca even

bread of man in whose house be more than visitor lot of woman a often told be wretched unfortunate almost degrading for woman such a there be path open to energy other than of getting husband nora rowley thought of till be almost sick of prospect of life especially sick of when be told with much authority by lady milboroughs of acquaintance that be bounden duty to fall in love with mr glascock a to falling in love with mr glascock have not a yet quite made up mind there be so much to be said on side of question if such falling in love must only be made possible have quite made up mind that

partly on account partly perhaps on have stayed away from curzon street a nora rowley have made comparison about so have made comparison about have owned to have be possible that must marry must willingly entrust happiness to miss rowley have thought once twice that trevelyan have wished that such arrangement might be made at future day trevelyan have always be much more sanguine in expecting success for friend at bar than stanbury have be for might well be that such man a trevelyan might think that clever rising barrister must be excellent husband for sister in law that man earning precarious living a writer for penny paper must be by mean so desirable connection stanbury a thought of declared to that must not care two straw for trevelyan in matter if must see way without other

than love have possessed money position name make life worth having have found in remote corner of world with fortune with advantage of family social standing so circumstanced that friend must have warned against marriage have given heart hand house have asked for nothing in return that must be in to that must be one god upon earth have done more even than bring sister have said house will be big enough for also will be sister a well a yours who have ever done more for woman shown more absolute confidence now what be return received be not contented with one god upon earth must make to herself other god god that too out of lump of basest clay to be found around thought that must remember to have heard said in early day long before have have idea of marrying that man must look for wife from among tropic woman educated amidst languor of sunny clime rarely came to posse high idea of conjugal duty feminine truth man must regard a first requisite of good wife a thought of almost regretted that have ever visited mandarin ever heard name of sir marmaduke rowley must have nourished such thought in heart have indeed be generous to wife to wife family may almost say that man who be really generous in such matter be unconscious of own generosity giver who give most give doe not know that give have not given too in matter of giving between man wife if give two be equal let thing given be what may king cophetua did nothing for beggar maid unless be to after have married a royal queen a though have taken from oldest stock of reigning family then extant trevelyan knew have said so to score of time though not probably in spoken word formed sentence that be equal between wife of bosom have be thing ascertained by a certainty there be debt of gratitude from to did not acknowledge to exist also a from to yet in anger must not keep from thinking of gift have showered upon have be be must ever be if must only allow so true to have selected no other friend to take place in council there be dear mary dear augusta with whom have secret to be kept from wife when there arose with question of interest question of interest such a be of return of sir marmaduke to must show in bearing to wife have secret too secret have be made secret for also there be not woman in world in whose company took special delight in absence if there have be how much le must have be ground of complaint let man have such friendship what friendship may doe not disgrace wife felt to be so true of heart that desired such friendship for man indulging in such friendship there might be excuse even though man be false woman be not shamed brought unto dust before world slightest rumour on woman name be load of infamy on husband shoulder be not enough for caesar that wife must be true be necessary to caesar that must not even be suspected trevelyan told that suspected wife of sin god forbid that must ever come to for sake for hers above for sake of boy who be so dear to there must be vile whisper dirty slander must be dropped from envious tongue into envious ear mind prone to evil must think evil of of have not lady milborough already cautioned oh that must have lived to have be cautioned about wife that must be told that eye outside have looked into sacred shrine of heart seen that thing there be fatally amiss yet lady milborough be quite right have not in hand at moment document proved to be right dear emily took note crushed in fist then pulled into fragment what must do there be first of consideration duty owed to wife love bore that be ignorant innocent be sure then be so contumacious that hardly knew how to take step in direction of guarding from effect of ignorance maintaining for advantage of innocence be master must know that be master how be to proceed when refused to obey plainest most necessary command laid upon let man be ever so much wife master can not maintain masterdom by power law place in hand have asked wife for promise of obedience must not give to what be to do next must no doubt at least thought so keep man from presence must order servant not to admit man servant must doubtless obey to what condition must then have be brought must not world then be over for over for a husband of wife whom must not love unless respected better that there must be such world than call in aid of servant to guard conduct of wife a thought of seemed to that if must not obey give promise must be separated must not live with must not give privilege of wife if refused to render to obedience be privilege more thought of more convinced be that ought not to yield to let once yield to then tenderness must begin there must be limit to must not see till have yielded must not see if must find that did see colonel osborne then must tell that must no longer dwell under same roof with resolution on point be very strong yet there came over feeling that be duty to be gentle there be feeling also that privilege of receiving obedience be so indubitably own must only be maintained by certain wise practice on part in gentleness must predominate wife be bound to obey husband obedience can not be exacted from wife a may from servant by aid of law with penalty a from horse by punishment manger curtailment man must be master in own house must make mastery palatable equitable smooth soft to touch thing almost unfelt how be to do now when have already given order to obedience have be refused unless under certain stipulation agreement with must be degradation to have pointed out to wife duty have said must do duty a pointed out on condition that must beg pardon for having pointed out must not must not do let heaven fall falling of heaven in case be separation between wife must not consent to such injustice a what be to do at moment especially with reference to note have destroyed at last resolved to write to wife consequently did write send to following letter may dearest emily if colonel osborne must write to again will be better that must not open letter a know handwriting will have difficulty in so arranging must further letter come from colonel osborne addressed to have better put under cover to take notice of will dine at club

find that must be wholly unnoticed by must request that will comply with wish in matter if will send for will go to instantly after one word from to desired effect will find that there will be recurrence by to subject so hateful a have done be doing what think to be right can not stultify by saying that think have be wrong yours always dearest emily with most thorough love louis trevelyan letter put on wife dressing room table then went out to club chapter vi shewing how reconciliation be made look at said mr trevelyan when sister came into room about hour before dinner time nora read letter then asked sister what meant to do have written to mr peacock know what else can do be very hard upon that must have be kept at home suppose mr glascock must have be at mr peacock what else will do emily nothing simply live deserted forlorn till will choose to find wit again there be nothing else that woman can do if chooses to dine at club day ca help must put off engagement will be hard upon talk about be too terrible to think that there must be such quarrel what can do have be wrong simply do what tell whether be wrong right if be right ought to be done if be wrong will not be fault be very easily said sound logical must know be unreasonable care about reason be husband if wish must do what will be harm mean to see colonel osborne more have already said that be not to be admitted have said that nobody be to be admitted louis have driven to how can look servant in face tell that special gentleman be not to be admitted to see oh dear oh dear have done anything to deserve be ever so monstrous accusation made against woman if be not for boy must defy to do worst on day following nora again became messenger between husband wife before dinner time reconciliation have be effected of course wife gave way at last of course gave way so cunningly that husband received none of gratification have expected in surrender tell to come nora have urged of course can come if plea emily have replied then nora have told louis to come louis have demanded whether if did so promise have exacted must be given be to be feared that nora perverted truth little if ever such perversion may be forgiven forgiveness be due to if must only be brought together be sure that there must be reconciliation be brought together there be reconciliation dearest emily be so glad to come to said husband walking up to wife in bed room taking in arm illustration shewing how reconciliation be made have be very unhappy louis for last two day said very gravely returning kiss returning somewhat coldly have be unhappy be sure said then paused that promise might be made to have certainly understood that be to be made without reserve a act on part have fully consented to perform stood silent with one hand on dressing table looking away from very beautiful dignified too in manner not a far a must judge repentant submissive nora said that must make promise ask from can not think louis how can want such promise from think right to ask do indeed can imagine that will ever willingly see gentleman again after what have occurred will be for to tell servant know how can do a matter of course will encourage person to come to house of whom disapprove must be exactly same of man of woman be that ask be surprised that must have thought necessary to make formal request in matter word be quite sufficient that must find cause of complaint in colonel osborne coming here be of course different thing quite different thing said can not pretend to understand motif fear understand own self respect prevents from supposing to be possible that have attributed evil thought to indeed indeed never have said husband can assure regard a matter of course said wife know emily way in world talk world do regard world louis lady milborough believe spoke to yourself lady milborough did not speak to began to do so be careful to silence at once from louis be bound to hear may choose to say

hardly be possible louis answered can not forget have be cautioned can not bring to believe have meant for good have never doubted louis never for moment have hurt to find that must think that such caution be needed for good be almost on tongue to beg pardon to acknowledge that have made mistake to implore to forget that have ever made objection to colonel osborne visit remembered at moment

conquered perhaps respected more than have done when be resolving three four day since that must be master in own house may be feared that tenderness of love for have be impaired late in afternoon wife sister in law came down dressed for walking finding trevelyan in library asked to join be custom with to walk in park on sunday afternoon at once assented went out with emily who have have triumph be very gracious there must not be word more said by about colonel osborne must avoid that gentleman never receiving in curzon street having a little to say to a possible elsewhere must not throw name in husband teeth make reference to injury have so manifestly be done to unless louis must be indiscreet must be a though have be forgotten a walked by chesterfield house stanhope street into park began to discus sermon have heard that morning when found that subject be not alluring spoke of dinner to be to go at mr fairfax house louis trevelyan be quite aware that be being treated a naughty boy who be to be forgiven went across hyde park into kensington garden still same thing be going on nora found to be almost impossible to say word trevelyan answered wife question be otherwise silent emily worked very hard at mission of forgiveness hardly ceased in effort at conciliatory conversation woman can work so much harder in way than men find possible to do never flagged continued to be fluent conciliatory intolerably wearisome on sudden came across two men together who a knew be barely acquainted with other be colonel osborne hugh stanbury be glad to find be able to be out said colonel thanks yes think seclusion just now be almost a much due to baby a to anything else mr stanbury how be never see now be d r mr trevelyan nothing else d r be most grateful mistress

there be word of tenderness spoken between colonel osborne be now between mr mr trevelyan must have avoided position have be possible for to do so while be falling into present place have made little mute appeal to husband to take away from spot to give arm return with to save in way from remaining in company with man to whose company for have objected took such step have seemed to that must take such step without showing hostility to colonel osborne walked on along broad path together colonel be between hope think satisfactory about sir rowley said beggar must not be chooser know colonel osborne felt little disappointed when found that be not to see till february next will stay longer then know than must now have doubt when time come will believe to be better suppose think emily that little pudding to day be better than much to morrow colonel osborne certainly have caressing must be affectionate mode of talking to woman unless be reciprocated enjoyed be likely to make disagreeable possible word must have be more innocent than have now spoken have turned face down close to face have almost whispered then too have again called her by christian name trevelyan have not heard word have walked on making distance between other man greater than be necessary anxious to show to wife that have jealousy at meeting a wife be determined that must put end to state of thing let cost be what might did not say word to colonel osborne addressed at once to husband louis said will give arm will go back if please then took husband arm turned abruptly away from companion thing be done in such manner that be impossible that colonel osborne must not perceive that have be left in anger when trevelyan wife have gone back few yard be obliged to return for nora did so then rejoined wife be quite unnecessary emily said that must behave like suspicion said have made almost impossible for to behave with propriety have told everything now said trevelyan be requisite that must be told said wife then walked home without interchanging word when reached house emily at once went up to own room trevelyan to parted a though have common interest be worthy of moment conversation by step gait movement of body showed to that be not wife now in sense must bring to feeling of domestic happiness compliance with command be of use to unless must be brought to comply in spirit unless must be soft to must not be happy walked about room uneasily for hour trying to shake off sorrow then went up to room emily said for god sake let pas away what be to pas away feeling of rancour between what be world to unless can love one at rate will be nothing to do doubt love said certainly not yours without love louis can not be happy love alone will not make so there must be trust there must also be forbearance feeling of annoyance will pas away in time till doe will shew a little a may be possible felt that have nothing more to say then left have gained nothing by interview be still hard cold

into club waiting room club waiting room be always gloomy unpromising place for confidential conversation so stanbury felt to be on present occasion have alternative there be together must do a have promised trevelyan kept on hat did not sit down looked very gloomy stanbury having to commence without assistance from outward auxiliary almost forgot what be that have promised to do have just come

about trevelyan said holding door of room half open in hand so that other be obliged to pas out through good evening said stanbury with much anger good evening said trevelyan with assumption of indifference stanbury went away in absolute wrath though trouble have have in interview be much le than have anticipated result quite a favourable have known that good must come of visit yet be now full of anger against trevelyan have become partisan in matter be exactly that have resolutely determined that must not become believe that woman on earth must live with said to a walked away be always same with desire for mastery did not know how to use when have obtained if be nora instead of other sister must break sweet heart within month trevelyan dined at club hardly spoke word to one during evening at about eleven started to walk home went by mean straight thither taking long turn through st james park by pimlico be necessary that must make up mind a to what must do have sternly refused interference of friend must be prepared to act on own responsibility knew well that must not begin again with wife on next day a though nothing have happened stanbury visit to if have done nothing else have made impossible determined that must not go to room to night must see a early a possible in morning must then talk to with wisdom of be master how many husband have come to same resolution how few of have found word of wisdom to be efficacious chapter x hard word illustration be to be feared that men in general regret a must do temporary ill feeling irritating jealousy between husband wife of have be cause author be not speaking now of actual love making of intrigue devilish villany either perpetrated imagined rather of passing gust of short lived unfounded suspicion to a to other accident very well regulated family may occasionally be liable when such suspicion rise in bosom of wife woman intervening being believed to intervene between man who be own that woman who have intervened be supposed to intervene will either glory in position bewail bitterly according to circumstance of case will charitably suppose that in great majority of such instance will bewail when such painful jealous doubt annoy husband man who be in way will almost always feel justified in extracting slightly pleasurable sensation from transaction will say to probably unconsciously indeed with formed word that husband be as as if be in twitter either for have kept for have be unable to keep that lady have shewn good deal of appreciation that be be be quite captain bold of halifax while will not have slightest intention of wronging husband honour will have received greater favour from intimacy accorded to than privilege of running on one day to marwill

consolation in position let interest be ever so flaccid unreal trouble in running about like ever so considerable time destructive be so certainly with colonel osborne when became aware that intimacy with mr trevelyan have caused husband uneasiness be not especially vicious man have now a know reached time of life when such vice a in question might be supposed to have lost charm for gentleman over

old friend daughter such wickedness have never come into head have certain pleasure in being confidential friend of very pretty woman when heard that pretty woman husband be jealous pleasure be enhanced rather than otherwise on sunday a have left house in curzon street have told stanbury that trevelyan have just gone off in huff be true enough have walked from thence down clarges street across piccadilly to st james street with jauntier step than usual because be aware that have be occasion of trouble be very wrong there be reason to believe that many such men a colonel osborne who be bachelor at fifty be equally malicious thought good deal about on that evening be still thinking about on following morning have promised to go up to curzon street on monday really on most trivial mission on matter of business man must have taken in hand whose time be of slightest value to one else now that mission assumed importance in eye seemed to require special observance special excuse there be real reason why must not have stayed away from curzon street for next fortnight have done so need have made excuse to mr trevelyan when met opportunity for little excitement be not to be missed instead of going wrote to following note albany monday dear emily what be about yesterday be to have come up with word of opera perhaps will be better to send if be not wicked do tell whether

look before own almost quailed may be that have better part said slowly in first place wish to tell be content of letter if be there when came in doubt be there still go look at be answer to have desired to tell be content will not tell will not demean by repeating anything so insignificant in own justification if suspect of writing what must not write will suspect also of lying to conceal have heard from colonel osborne morning have where be letter have destroyed again paused trying to think what have better do trying to be calm stood still opposite to confronting with scorn of bright angry eye of course be not calm be very reverse of calm refuse to tell what wrote said letter be there answered pointing away towards door if want to play spy go look at for do call spy what have called because be husband be privilege of vituperation to be on side be impossible must put up with said quite impossible must kill anything be better than present order to be not to see colonel osborne not to write to have communication with to put under cover to unopened letter may come from will expect implicit obedience to order well go on have promise have promise will make promise exacted from in so disgraceful manner refuse to obey will refuse nothing will promise nothing then must part be will take care that will hear from before to morrow morning so saying left room passing

just reverse day two before will obey absurd a be will obey a for submitting to letting suppose that think be right never must be lying to then will never lie to have said that must part suppose will be better so how can woman live with man suspect can not take baby from there be many such conversation a above between two sister before mr trevelyan received from husband communication with have be threatened nora acting on own judgment in matter made attempt to see mr trevelyan writing to pretty little note beseeching to be kind to declined to see two woman sat at home with baby between holding such pleasant conversation a above narrated when such tempest occur in family woman will generally suffer least during thick of tempest while hurricane be at fiercest will be sustained by most thorough conviction that right be on side that be aggrieved that there be nothing for to acknowledge position that need surrender whereas husband will desire compromise even amidst violence of storm afterwards when wind have lulled while heaven around be still black murky then woman suffering begin when passion give way to thought memory feel loneliness of position loneliness possible degradation be very well for man to talk about name honour be woman honour woman name be in truth placed in jeopardy let woman do what will man can in truth show face in world after awhile doe show face woman may be compelled to veil hers by own fault by mr trevelyan be now told that be to be separated from husband did not at rate believe that have done harm if such separation did come where must live what must do what position in world must posse must not her face be in truth veiled a effectually a though have disgraced husband then there be that terrible question about child mr trevelyan have said dozen time to sister that husband must not take boy away from nora however have never assented to partly from conviction of own ignorance not knowing what might be power of husband in such matter partly thinking that argument must be good fair by must induce sister to avoid catastrophe so terrible a be now threatened suppose must take if chose said at last believe be wicked like said mr trevelyan must not wish to kill will say that love baby a well a do will never take child from must never be so bad a will never be so bad a to leave said nora after pause will not believe that can come to that know that be good at heart nobody on earth love a doe so went on for two day on evening of second day there came letter from trevelyan to wife have of seen although have be in out of house on afternoon of sunday new grievance very terrible grievance be added to mr trevelyan be made to bear husband have told one of servant in house that colonel osborne be not to be admitted servant to whom have given order be cook there be reason why cook must be le trustworthy in such matter than other servant in mr trevelyan household there be reason why must be more so a alone be what generally call old family domestic have lived with master mother have known master when be boy looking about therefore for one in house to whom must speak feeling that be bound to convey order through medium called to ancient cook imparted to so much of trouble a be necessary to make order intelligible did with various ill worded assurance to mr prodgers that there really be nothing amiss when mr trevelyan heard what have be done did from mr prodgers mr prodgers having be desired by master to make communication declared to sister that everything be now over must never again live with husband who have disgraced wife by desiring own cook to keep guard upon have footman be instructed not to admit colonel osborne there must have be in such instruction apparent adherence to recognised usage of society if desire friend enemy to be received into house communicate desire to person who have charge of door cook now nora if be do mean to say that must remain with asked mr trevelyan nora simply replied that anything under circumstance must be better than separation on morning of third day there came following letter wednesday june midnight dearest emily will readily believe when say that never in life be so wretched a have be during last two day that must be in same house together not able to speak to other be in misery be terribly enhanced by dread lest state of thing must be made to continue want to understand in least suspect of having a yet done anything wrong having even said anything injurious either to position a husband to position a wife can not perceive that be allowing to be entrapped into intimacy with colonel osborne if be not checked will be destructive to happiness own after what have passed before can not have thought right to receive letter from be not to see to write letter to of be not to know content must be manifest to that such conduct on part be wrong a judged by of rule by wife conduct can be measured yet have refused even to say that will be discontinued need hardly explain to that if persist in refusal can not continue to live together a man wife hope prospect in life will be blighted by such separation have not a yet be able to think what must do in such wretched circumstance for a also for nora such catastrophe must be most lamentable do therefore think of well write such letter a may bring back to side there be only one friend in world to whom must endure to talk of great grief have be to told everything will know that mean lady milborough after much difficult conversation have persuaded to see will call in curzon street to morrow about twelve there can be kinder hearted more gentle woman in world than lady milborough did one ever have warmer friend than have in let implore then to listen to be guided by advice pray believe dearest emily that be now a ever most affectionate husband have wish so strong a that must not be compelled to part louis trevelyan epistle be in many respect very injudicious composition trevelyan must have trusted to eloquence of own written word to of ambassador whom be about to despatch by sending weakened then there be certain word in letter be odious to mr trevelyan must have be odious to young wife have said that did not a yet suspect of having done anything wrong then when endeavoured to explain to that separation must be very injurious to herself have coupled sister with thus seeming to imply that injury to be avoided be of material kind have better do what told a otherwise sister must not have roof over head be nature of threat word be supposed to convey matter have become so serious that mr trevelyan haughty stiff necked a be did not dare to abstain from showing letter to sister have other counsellor at rate till milborough came weight of battle be too great for own unaided spirit letter have be written late at night a be shown by precision of date have be brought to early in morning at first have determined to say nothing about to nora be not strong enough to maintain such purpose felt that needed poor consolation of discussing wretchedness first declared that must not see lady milborough hate know that hate ought not to have thought of coming said mr trevelyan be at last beaten out of purpose by nora argument that world must be against if refused to see husband old friend then though letter be odious letter a declared dozen time took little comfort in fact that not word be said in about baby thought that if must take child with into separation must endure husband must ultimately be conquered yes will see said a finished discussion a chooses to send suppose have better see think doe much to mend matter when sends woman whom know dislike more than other in london exactly at twelve o'clock lady milborough carriage be at door trevelyan be in house at time heard knock at door during two three day of absolute wretchedness spent most of hour under same roof with wife sister in law though spoke to of have have doubt a to reception of lady milborough be to tell truth listening with most anxious ear when ladyship be announced wife however be not so bitterly contumacious a to refuse admittance to friend heard rustle of ponderous silk a old woman be shown up stair when lady milborough reached drawing room mr trevelyan be alone have better see by have said to sister nora have then left with one word of prayer that must be a little defiant a possible that must depend emily have said with little shake of head there have be suggestion that child must be with mother have rejected must be stagey have said clap trap there be nothing hate so much a that be sitting therefore quite alone a stiff a man in armour when lady milborough be shown up to lady milborough herself be not at comfortable a commenced interview have prepared many wise word to be spoken be not so little ignorant of character of woman with whom have to deal a to suppose that wise word must get spoken without interruption have known from first mr trevelyan must have much to say for feeling that must be so became stronger than ever a entered room ordinary feeling between two lady be cold constrained then there be silence for few moment when countess have taken seat mr trevelyan have quite determined that enemy must fire first shot be very sad state of thing said countess yes indeed lady milborough saddest in world so unnecessary be not very unnecessary indeed a think yes dear yes of course must remember then lady milborough must not clearly bring to mind what be that have to remember fact be dear that kind of thing be too monstrous to be thought of goodness gracious two young people like louis who thoroughly love other who have got baby to think of being separated of course be out of question can not suppose lady milborough want to be separated from husband of course not how must be possible very idea be too shocking to be thought of declare have slept since louis be talking to about dear must remember know that husband have right to expect sort of submission from wife have right to expect obedience lady milborough of course be one want will obey mr trevelyan in anything reasonable dear who be to say what be reasonable that see be always difficulty must allow that husband be person who ought to decide have told have refused to obey lady milborough countess paused moment before replied well yes think have said asked to do something about letter letter to colonel osborne who be man dear really to be very much afraid of man who have done great deal of harm declined now in matter of kind of course husband lady milborough must ask to listen to have listened to mr trevelyan must ask to listen to be sorry to trouble a have come here about unpleasant business must forgive if insist upon of course will listen to dear have never refused to obey husband refuse now gentleman of whom have be speaking be old friend of father have become friend nevertheless have mr trevelyan given plain order about must have obeyed wife doe not feel that chance of happiness be increased when find that husband suspect of being too intimate with man be thing very hard to bear must have endeavoured to bear knowing how important be for sake more especially for child must have made excuse must have endeavoured to think that horrid feeling on part be nothing more than short delusion dear must ask to hear out lady milborough when tell first that be not to meet man so instructs servant then tell that be to meet go on just a be going before then again tell that be not to see again instructs servant above cook colonel osborne be not to come into house then obedience becomes rather difficult just say now that will do what want then will be right will not say so to lady milborough be not to ought to say a have chosen to send here will explain to have never disobeyed when be free in accordance with mr trevelyan wish to have what intercourse pleased with colonel osborne received note from gentleman on most trivial matter

say nothing further about will gain nothing by sending messenger here lady milborough who have undertaken most disagreeable task from purest motif of old friendship did not like being called messenger woman before be so strong in word so eager so passionate that did not know how to resent injury there be coming over idea of be hardly conscious that after perhaps husband be not in right have come

trevelyan with sister be established in clock house at nuncombe putney under protection of hugh mother before reader be made acquainted with of circumstance of life there few word must be said of occurrence took place before two lady left curzon street a to quarrel between trevelyan wife thing went from bad to worse lady milborough continued to interfere writing letter to emily be full of good sense a emily said never really touched point of dispute be who be altogether unconscious of having done anything amiss to confess have be in wrong if be about small matter must not mind for sake of peace when concern conduct in reference to man must rather die first have be mr trevelyan line of thought argument in matter then old lady milborough in letter spoke only of duty of obedience a promised at altar did promise to tell lie said mr trevelyan there be interview between lady milborough trevelyan interview between lady milborough nora rowley poor dear old dowager be exceedingly busy full of groan prescribing naples prescribing course of extra prayer prescribing general course of letting by gones be by gones to however trevelyan must by mean assent without assurance might regard a guarantee prescribing retirement to small town in west of france if naples must not suffice must effect nothing mr trevelyan indeed did thing be sure of to render step taken for reconciliation ineffectual in midst of turmoil while husband be still living in same house apart because of absurd quarrel respecting colonel osborne wrote letter to gentleman argument by justified to herself to sister after be done be real propriety of own conduct throughout whole intimacy with colonel osborne be just what louis doe want to do nora have said filled with anger dismay then let louis give order to effect behave to like husband will obey emily have answered have gone on to plead that in present condition be under order from husband be left to judge for herself judging for knew a said that be best that must write to colonel osborne unfortunately there be ground for hoping colonel osborne be ignorant of insane jealousy on part of husband be better therefore said that must write to whom on occasion took care to name to sister a papa old friend explain to what must wish to do what not to do colonel osborne answered letter very quickly throwing much more of demonstrative affection than must have done into dear emily dearest friend of course mr trevelyan have burned answer of course mr trevelyan have be told of correspondence wife indeed have be especially careful that there must be nothing secret about matter that must be so known in house that mr trevelyan must be sure to hear of have heard of be driven almost mad by have flown off to lady milborough have reduced old friend to despair by declaring that after began to fear that wife be be be infatuated by d scoundrel lady milborough forgave language protested that be wrong in suspicion to continue to correspond with after what have said to exclaimed trevelyan take to naples at once said lady milborough at once have after said trevelyan lady milborough have answer ready not having thought of looked very blank must find harder to deal with there even than here continued trevelyan then be that lady milborough spoke of small town in west of france urging a reason that man a colonel osborne must certainly not follow there trevelyan have become indignant at declaring that if wife good name must be preserved in other manner than that must not be worth preserving at then lady milborough have begun to cry have continued cry for very long time be very unhappy a unhappy a nature must allow to be must have made almost sacrifice to bring two young people together must have willingly given time money labour in cause must probably have gone to little town in west of france have going be of service nevertheless after own fashion extracted small enjoyment out of circumstance of miserable quarrel lady milboroughs of day hate colonel osborne from very bottom of warm heart pure soul respect colonel osborne almost a much a hate find to be inestimable privilege to be brought into contact with roaring lion there arose to dear lady milborough great trouble out of quarrel irrespective of absolute horror of separation of young husband from young wife excess of trouble on head be great proof of real goodness of heart for in matter welfare of trevelyan be not concerned rather that of rowley family now rowleys have not given lady milborough special reason for loving when have first heard that dear young friend louis be going to marry girl from mandarin have be almost in despair be opinion have properly understood own position must have promoted welfare by falling in love with daughter of english country gentleman english peer to honour with advantage lady milborough thought that might have aspired nevertheless when girl from mandarin have be brought home a mr trevelyan lady milborough have received with open arm have received even sister in law with arm partly open have of shown tendency to regard a mother must have showered motherly care upon for lady milborough be like old hen in capacity for taking many under wing two sister have hardly done more than bear with nora indeed bearing with more graciously than mr trevelyan in return even for old dowager be full of motherly regard now knew well that mr glascock be over head ear in love with nora rowley only wanted slightest management easiest discretion to bring on knee with offer of hand then how much that hand contained how much indeed a compared with other hand be to be given in return be to speak truth completely empty mr glascock be heir to peer be heir to rich peer be heir to very very old peer be in parliament world spoke well of be not so to say by mean old man be good tempered reasonable easily led yet by mean despicable on subject connected with land held opinion be very much respected be supposed to be thoroughly good specimen of upper class englishman here be suitor be not to be supposed that man a mr glascock must be so violently in love a to propose to girl whose nearest known friend female relation be misbehaving only who have closely watched natural uneasiness of human hen can understand how great be lady milborough anxiety on occasion marriage to be thing always delightful to contemplate though have never be sordidly match maker course of world around have taught to regard men a fish to be caught girl a angler who ought to catch rather must her mind have be accurately analysed must have be found that girl be regarded a half angler half bait girl angled visibly with own hook with manifestly expressed desire to catch fish be odious to be very gentle hearted in regard to fish thinking that fish in river must have hook bait presented to in mildest pleasantest form still when trout be well in basket joy be great then came across unlaborious mind half formed idea that great ordinance of nature be being accomplished in teeth of difficulty for a well knew there be difficulty in catching of fish lady milborough in kind anxiety on nora behalf that fish must be landed before nora might be swept away in sister ruin hardly knew what step might safely take mr trevelyan must not see again having already declared that further interview must be painful useless have spoken to trevelyan trevelyan have declared that must hing what be there that must have done must not a said overlook gross impropriety of wife conduct because wife sister have might possibly have lover then a to speaking to mr glascock nobody knew better than lady milborough how very apt fish be to be frightened at last lady milborough did speak to mr glascock making allusion to hook prepared for saying word two a to affair of other fish whose circumstance a floundered about in bucket of matrimony be not a happy a might have be care discretion nay wisdom with did be most excellent have become aware that mr glascock have already heard of unfortunate affair in curzon street indeed one who knew trevelyan have heard of great many who did not know harm therefore must be done by mentioning circumstance lady milborough did mention explaining that only person really in fault be that odious destroyer of peace of family colonel osborne of whom lady milborough on occasion said very severe thing indeed poor dear mr trevelyan be foolish obstinate self reliant a innocent a babe unborn that thing must come right before long one who knew affair knew from beginning to end must for moment doubt real victim must be that sweetest of girl nora rowley mr glascock innocently asked why nora rowley must be victim understand mr glascock how most remote connection with thing of kind tarnish young woman standing in world mr glascock be almost angry with well pleased countess a declared that must not see that miss rowley standing be at tarnished old lady milborough when got up left felt that have done good morning work if nora must have known nora ought to have be very grateful for mr glascock got into cab in eccleston square have driven direct to curzon street believed that be at moment only doing thing have for time past resolved that must do perhaps may be justified in thinking that actual resolution be first fixed by discretion of lady milborough communication at rate arrived in curzon street with mind fully resolved have spent minute in cab considering how have better perform business in hand be at once shown into drawing room where found two sister mr trevelyan a soon a saw understood purpose of coming there be air of determination about manifest intention of doing something absence of vagueness almost always flavour morning visit be so strongly marked that mr trevelyan felt that must have be almost justified in getting up declaring that a visit be paid to sister must retire such declaration on part be unnecessary a mr glascock have not be in room three minute before asked to go by clever device of own got into back room whispered to that wanted to say few word in private to sister oh certainly said mr trevelyan smiling dare say may guess what be said know what chance may have can tell nothing about replied a know nothing have good wish then went may be presumed that gradually idea of mr glascock intention have made way into nora mind by time that found alone with gentleman why else have brought into room with manifest air of purpose why else have taken very strong step of sending lady of house out of own drawing room nora beginning to understand put into attitude of defence have never told that must refuse mr glascock have never acknowledged to herself that there be man whom liked better than liked mr glascock have ever encouraged wish for such interview feeling at moment must have be very different from what be a be must have given much to postpone so that might have asked question have discovered whether must reconcile to do doubt friend must commend for doing of course be clear enough to mind of girl that have fortune to make that beauty youth be capital on have to found have not lived so far from taint of corruption a to feel actual horror at idea of girl giving to man not because man have already by own capacity in direction forced heart from because be one likely to be at point good husband have affair concerned other girl friend of own have known circumstance of case must have have hesitation in recommending that other girl to marry mr glascock girl thrown out upon world without shilling must make hay while sun shine nevertheless there be something within bosom made long for better thing than have dreamed if have not thought of being able to worship man must hardly worship mr glascock have dreamed if have not thought of leaning upon man through life with whole weight a though man have be specially made to be staff prop support wall of comfort protection knew that if be to marry mr glascock become lady peterborough in due course must stand good deal by own strength live without comfortable leaning nevertheless when found alone with man by mean knew whether must refuse not knew that must pluck up courage for important moment collected braced muscle a be for fight threw mind into attitude of contest mr glascock a soon a door be shut behind mr trevelyan back took chair placed close beside head of sofa on nora be sitting miss rowley said have known other now for month hope have learned to regard a friend oh yes indeed said nora with spirit have seemed to that have met a friend can most truly say for have taken greatest possible pleasure in acquaintance be not only that admire very much looked straight before a said moved about point of stick be holding in hand be not only that perhaps not chiefly that though do admire very much truth be that like everything about nora smiled said nothing be better thought to let tell story mode of telling be not without efficacy be not simple praise made way with certain tone in word seemed to convince that be true if have really found fancied to be what said there be manliness in telling so in plainest word pleased much know continued that be very bald way of telling of pleading cause know whether bald way may not be best if can only make understood to be true of course miss rowley know what mean a said before have thing not only make love make like also if think that can love say so a long a live will do best to make happy a wife there be clearness of expression in downright surrender of so flattered so fluttered that be almost reduced to giving of up because must not reply to appeal in language le courteous than of agreement after moment two found remaining silent with growing feeling silence must be taken a conveying consent there floated quickly across brain idea of hardness of woman lot in must be called upon to decide future fate for life in minute have have week to think of week in must have be almost unmaidenly in so to think of a to have made up mind to accept man have so made up mind have not come to where must have be then have come to there be still poking about with stick waiting for must answer be eldest son of peer enormous match for very proper in respect such man that if must accept everybody around must regard fortune in life a miraculously successful be not such man that one must point at say there see of who have sold for money title mr glascock be not apollo not admirable crichton be man whom girl might have learned to love now have asked to be wife be necessary that must answer sat there waiting for very patiently still poking about point of stick did really love though be so pressed by consideration of time did find moment in to ask question with quick turn of eye glanced at to see what be like up to moment though knew well must have given detail of personal appearance be better looking man than hugh stanbury so told with passing thought lacked lacked what be that lacked be spirit strength be outward sign of inward gift of mind be that be heavy while hugh be light be that must find fire in eye while hugh eye be full of flashing be that for especially for hugh be appointed staff appropriate wall of protection be a might knew at moment that did love not man that other who be writing article for daily record must refuse offer be so brilliant give up idea of reigning a queen at monkhams oh mr glascock said ought to answer more quickly dearest not more quickly than suit nothing ever in world can be more important to to if want more time to think of take more time mr glascock know why must have paused be not truth best yes certainly truth be best love pray pray understand understand too well miss rowley stick be still going eye more intently fixed than ever on something opposite do like like very much be so grateful can not understand why such man a must want to make wife because love better than others simply that reason that only justifies man in wanting to marry girl what good fellow be how flattering be word did not deserve what wanted even though must not be given without sacrifice yet did not love a looked at again must not there recognise staff a looked at be more than ever convinced that other staff ought to be staff may come again after month say asked when there have be short period of silence why must trouble be not worth be for to judge of miss rowley same know that be not worth must not tell to do then will wait come again without telling oh mr glascock did not mean that indeed did not pray think take what say a final like more than can say feel gratitude to can not express will never forget have never known one who have seemed to be so good a be just what said before then fairly burst into tear miss rowley said very slowly pray think want to ask question might embarrass to answer happiness be so greatly at stake if will allow to say so happiness too be so greatly concerned that be most important that must not come to conclusion too quickly if thought that heart be vacant must wait patiently have be thinking of a possible wife for week past for month past of course have not have such thought about a said almost loved for considerate goodness have sometimes seemed to odd girl must love men in such hurry if heart be free will wait if esteem can see try whether can not learn to love do esteem depends on question then said slowly sat silent for fully minute with hand clasped then answered in whisper know said also be silent for while before spoke again ceased to poke with stick got up from chair stood little apart from not looking at even yet see said at last understand well miss rowley quite perceive that can not press suit further now will not despair altogether know that if might possibly succeed must be very happy man good bye miss rowley took offered hand pressed so warmly that have not be manly big hearted must have taken such pressure a sign that wished to ask again such be nature god bless said make happy whatever may choose to do then left heard walk down stair with heavy slow step thought that must perceive from sound that be sad at heart that be resolved not to show sadness outwardly when be alone began to think in earnest of what have done if reader be told that regretted decision have be forced to make so rapidly wrong impression must be given of condition of thought there came upon suddenly strange capacity for counting up making mental inventory of might have be hers knew where be girl so placed that doe not know that be great thing to be english peeress now a stood there thinking of be nora rowley without shilling in world without prospect of shilling have often heard mother speak fearful word of future possible day when colonial governing must no longer be within capacity of sir marmaduke have be taught from very early age that material prosperity of life must depend on matrimony must never be comfortably disposed of in world unless fitting man who possessed thing of be so bare must wish to make wife now there have come man so thoroughly fitting so marvellously endowed that worldly blessing must have be wanting mr glascock have more than once spoken to of glory of monkhams thought of monkhams now more than have ever thought of place before must have be great privilege to be mistress of old time honoured mansion to call oak elm own to know acre of garden be submitted to caprice to look at herd of cow ox be aware that lowed on own pasture to have be mother of future peer of england to have nursing sweet custody very making of future senator must not have be much man who must have be husband be such one woman might have trusted to with perfect confidence now that be gone almost fancied that did love then thought of hugh stanbury sitting a have described in little dark closet at office of d r in very old inky shooting coat with tarnished square cut cloth cap upon head with short pipe in mouth writing at midnight for next morning impression that article according to order of master tallow chandler for editor of daily record be gentleman whose father happened to be grocer in city hugh have be accustomed thus to describe family trade might certainly have have peer acre of garden big house senatorial honour whereas tallow chandler journeyman have never be so out spoken told from moment to moment that have done right that must do same dozen time if dozen time experiment must be repeated still still there be remembrance of that have lost how must mother look at anxious heavily laden mother when story must be told of have be offered to have be refused illustration to have be mother of future peer a be thinking of mr trevelyan came into room nora felt that though might dread to meet mother must be bold enough on occasion before sister emily have not done so well with own affair a to enable to preach with advantage about marriage have gone said mr trevelyan a opened door yes

place oh why not go to quiet town in west of france be not anything better than flying in face of god man perhaps trevelyan did not like idea of quiet dull french town perhaps thought that flying in face of god man be done by wife not by that be right that wife must feel consequence after many such entreaty many such argument be at last decided that house in curzon street must be given up that wife live apart what about nora rowley asked lady milborough who have become aware by time of nora insane folly in having refused mr glascock will go with sister suppose who will maintain dear dear dear doe seem a though young people be bent upon cutting own throat family poor lady milborough just at time went a near to disliking rowleys a be compatible with nature be not possible to to hate

twenty yard square rectory of st diddulph can not be said to have be comfortable abode neighbourhood be certainly not alluring of visiting society within distance of three four mile there be none what be afforded by family of other east end clergyman then mr outhouse be somewhat singular man be very religious devoted to work most kind to poor be unfortunately strongly biased man at same time very obstinate withal have never allied very cordially with wife brother sir marmaduke allowing to be carried away by prejudice people living at west end who frequented club be connected in way with fashion must not be appropriate companion for very title sir marmaduke have acquired be repulsive to have induced to tell wife more than once sir sir must not be fitting associate for poor east end clergyman then wife niece have married man of fashion man supposed at st diddulph to be very closely allied to fashion mr outhouse have never be induced even to dine in house in curzon street when therefore heard that mr mr trevelyan be to be separated within two year of marriage must not be expected that must be very eager to lend to two sister use of rectory there have be interview between mr outhouse trevelyan between mr outhouse niece then there be interview between mr outhouse emily in be decided that mr trevelyan must not go to parsonage of st diddulph have be very outspoken to uncle declaring that by mean intended to carry a disgraced woman mr outhouse have quoted st paul to wife obey husband then have got up have spoken very angrily look for support from said a man who be nearest to till father will come can not support in what be wrong said clergyman then mr trevelyan have left room must not see uncle again carried thing altogether with high hand at time when old mr

curzon street have certain right believed spoke then said of pecuniary right not of other right husband be determined be doubt able to ignore did not really know what pecuniary right might be be careful to learn exact extent must thank mr bideawhile to see that thing be properly arranged of husband mr bideawhile might be quite sure must take nothing a favour must not go to uncle house declined to tell mr bideawhile why have so decided have decided be ready to listen to suggestion that husband might make a to residence must claim to have choice in matter a to sister of course intended to give nora home a long a such home might be wanted must be very sad for nora in existing circumstance such arrangement must be expedient must not go into detail a to expense husband be driving away from be for to say what proportion of income must choose to give for maintenance for hers for of child be not desirous of anything beyond mean of decent living of course must for present find home for sister a well a for herself when speaking of baby have striven hard so to speak that mr bideawhile must find trace of doubt in tone of voice yet have be full of doubt full of fear a mr bideawhile have uttered nothing antagonistic to wish in matter have seemed to agree that mother went thither child must go also mr trevelyan have considered to be successful in interview idea of residence at nuncombe putney have occurred first to trevelyan have spoken of to hugh stanbury there have be difficulty in because have snubbed stanbury grievously when friend have attempted to do work of gentle interference between wife when began conversation took trouble of stating in first instance that separation be thing fixed so that nothing might be urged on subject be to be will understand that said if think that mother must agree to arrangement must be satisfactory to might think be made pleasant to of course mother must be made to understand that only fault with wife be charged be that of indomitable disobedience to wish incompatibility of temper suggested stanbury may call that if please though must say for think have displayed temper to woman have right to object then have gone on to explain what be prepared to do about money must pay through stanbury hand so much for maintenance so much for house rent on understanding that money be not to go into wife hand will prefer said to make myself on behalf what disbursement may be necessary will take care that receives proper sum quarterly through mr bideawhile for own clothes for of poor boy then stanbury have told of clock house there have be agreement made between agreement be then of course subject to approval of lady at nuncombe putney when suggestion be made to mr trevelyan with proposition that clock house must be taken for one year that for year at least boy must remain with assented to did so with calmness that be able to assume in truth almost everything seemed to have be gained when found that be not to be separated from baby have objection to living in devonshire if mr trevelyan wish said in most stately manner certainly objection to living with mr stanbury mother then mr bideawhile explained to that nuncombe putney be not large town be in fact very small very remote village will make difference whatsoever a far a be concerned answered a for sister must put up with till father mother be here believe scenery at nuncombe putney be very pretty lovely said mr bideawhile who have general idea that devonshire be supposed to be picturesque county with life before a must lead continued mr trevelyan ugly neighbourhood one must have have interest for stranger must certainly have be additional sorrow so have be settled by end of july mr trevelyan with sister baby be established at clock house under protection of mr stanbury mr trevelyan have brought down own maid own nurse have found that arrangement made by husband have in truth be liberal house in curzon street have be given up furniture have be sent to warehouse mr trevelyan have gone into lodging there never be two young people so insane since world began said lady milborough to old friend mr fairfax when thing be done

go to devonshire after lady love said mr fairfax lady milborough again raised hand again shook head mr stanbury have given easy assent when son proposed to new mode of life priscilla have have doubt like woman thought that when man be to be separated from wife woman must be in wrong though must be doubtless comfortable to go from cottage to clock house must said with much prudence be very uncomfortable to go back from clock house to cottage hugh replied very cavalierly generously be rashly somewhat impetuously that must guarantee against such degradation want to be burden upon dear said mother must be great burden on replied if be living uncomfortably while be able to make comfortable mr stanbury be soon won over by mr trevelyan by nora especially by baby even priscilla after week two began to feel that liked company priscilla be young woman who read great deal even have gift of understanding what read borrowed book from clergyman paid penny week to landlady of stag antler for hire during day of weekly newspaper now there came box of book from exeter daily paper from london to improve new comer be able to talk with about thing read soon declared to mother that liked miss rowley much best of two mr trevelyan be too fond of having own way began to understand must say to mother that man might find difficult to live with mr trevelyan hardly ever yield about anything said priscilla a miss priscilla stanbury be also very fond of having own way be not surprising that must object to quality in lady who have come to live under same roof with country about nuncombe putney be perhaps a pretty a in england be beyond river teign between dartmoor be so lovely in variation of river rivulet broken ground hill dale old broken battered time worn timber green knoll rich pasture heathy common that wonder be that english lover of scenery know so little of at stag antler old mr crocket than whom old woman in public line be ever more generous more peppery more kind kept two clean bed room must cook leg of dartmoor mutton make apple pie against woman in devonshire drat fish must say when self indulgent exacting traveller must wish for more than accustomed viand cock up with dainty if ca eat victual without fish must go to exeter then will get stinking mayhap now priscilla stanbury mr crocket be great friend there have be time of deep want in mr crocket friendship have be very serviceable to lady at cottage three young woman have be to inn one morning to ask after conveyance from nuncombe putney to princetown have found that four wheeled open carriage with old horse very young driver must be hired there have never dreamed of such thing priscilla stanbury have said only time be at princetown walked there back so have called at stag antler mr crocket have told mind upon several matter what dear old woman said nora a came away having made bargain for open carriage think take quite enough upon know said mr trevelyan be dear old woman said priscilla not attending at to last word have be spoken be one of best friend have in world if be to say best out of own family perhaps must not be wrong us such very odd language for woman said mr trevelyan now mr crocket have certainly dratted darned boy who must come a fast a have wished have laughed at mr trevelyan very contemptuously when lady have suggested that urchin who be at last brought forth might not be safe charioteer down of hill suppose be used to said priscilla at rate know like like dare say be good sort of woman said mr trevelyan only be not saying anything about being good woman now said priscilla interrupting other with vehemence only that be friend liked of thing said nora have lived here always yes life house belonged to father to grandfather before think say have never slept out of dozen time in life husband be dead daughter be married away have great grief trouble of ne'er do well son be away now be alone then after pause continued dare say seems odd to mr trevelyan that must speak of innkeeper a dear friend must remember that have be poor among poorest be so indeed now only came into present house to receive be where used to live pointed to tiny cottage now that be dismantled desolate looked to be doubly poor there have be time when must have gone to bed very hungry if have not be for mr crocket later in day mr trevelyan finding priscilla alone have apologized for what have said about old woman be very thoughtless forgetful hope will not be angry with will be ever so fond of if will forgive very well said priscilla smiling on condition will forgive from time there sprang up something like feeling of friendship between priscilla mr trevelyan nevertheless priscilla be still of opinion that clock house arrangement be dangerous must never have be made mr stanbury always timid of own nature began to fear that must be so a soon a be removed from influence of son did not see much even of few neighbour who lived around fancied that people looked at in church a though have done that ought not to have done in taking to big comfortable house for sake of lending protection to lady who be separated from husband be not that believed that mr trevelyan have be wrong that knowing to be weak fancied that daughter must be enveloped in danger suspicion must not attach to lady condition instead of raising lady out of cloud a must have be case have be strong mr trevelyan who be sharpsighted clear witted soon saw that be so spoke to priscilla on subject before have be fortnight in house be afraid mother doe not like being here said how be to answer priscilla replied just tell truth truth be so uncivil at first did not like disliked very much why did give way did give way hugh talked mother over mamma doe what tell except when hugh tell something else be afraid because down here knowing nothing of world did wish that little people must be mixed up in quarrel disagreement of who be so much bigger know who be be big in matter be big at rate by comparison now must go on house have be taken fear be over a regard what observe in mamma be only effect not yet quite worn out of what said before came may be quite sure of that of believe word against position be very unfortunate one if can be remedied by staying here with pray stay with can not be remedied said emily must not be anywhere more comfortable than be here chapter xv what said about in close when miss stanbury in close at exeter be first told of arrangement have be made at nuncombe putney said very hard word a to thing have be done be quite sure that mr trevelyan be better than must be lady who be separated from husband never be better than must be what be to be thought of woman who when separated from husband must put under protection of such paladin a hugh stanbury heard tidings of course from dorothy spoke mind even to dorothy plainly enough be to martha that expressed with fullest vehemence always knew said that brother have married addle pated silly woman one of most unsuited to be mistress of clergyman house that ever man set eye on did think 'd allow to be led into stupid thing a suppose lady have done anything amiss more than combing husband hair like of said martha tell why by own story have got lover ai to come after down here suppose a for lover ma'be be told that most of 'em have 'em up in london mean much only just idle talking gallivanting when woman ca keep from idle talking with strange gentleman be very far gone on road to devil notion be everybody notion few year ago now what with divorce bill woman right penny paper false hair married woman being just like giggling girl giggling girl knowing just a much a married woman when woman have be married year two begin to think whether may have more fun for money by living apart from husband miss dorothy say oh bother what miss dorothy say miss dorothy only know what have suited that scamp brother to tell understand woman have come away because of lover if be so sister in law be very wrong to receive temptation of clock house have be too much for be not doing be that evening miss stanbury dorothy went out to tea at house of mr machugh there matter be very much discussed family of trevelyan be known by name in part fact of mr trevelyan having be sent to live in devonshire village with devonshire lady who have relation in exeter so well esteemed a miss stanbury of close be circumstance of sufficient to ensure considerable amount of prestige at city tea table for tidings of unfortunate family quarrel reticence be of course necessary because of presence of miss stanbury of dorothy to miss stanbury mr machugh mr crumbie of cronstadt house did not scruple to express very plainly to whisper question a to what be to be done must lover make appearance at nuncombe putney who spoke of matter before dorothy be at first more charitable at least more forbearing mr gibson who be one of minor canon two miss french from heavitree who have reputation of hunting unmarried clergyman in couple seemed to have heard about when mr machugh miss stanbury with mr mr crumbie have seated at whist table younger people be able to express opinion without danger of interruption of rebuke be known to exeter by time dorothy stanbury mother have gone to clock house that have done so in order that mr trevelyan might have home be not yet known whether anybody have called upon there be mr merton wife of present parson of nuncombe who have known stanburys for last twenty year there be mr ellison of lessboro ' who lived only four mile from nuncombe who kept pony carriage must be great thing to know how lady have behaved in so difficult embarrassing position mr trevelyan sister have now be at nuncombe putney for more than fortnight something in matter of calling must have be done have be left undone in answer to ingeniously framed question asked by camilla french dorothy at once set matter at rest mr merton said camilla french must find great thing to have two new lady come to village especially now that have lost miss stanbury mamma tell said dorothy that mr trevelyan miss rowley mean to know anybody have given out quite plainly so that there must be mistake dear dear said camilla french dare say be for best said arabella french who be elder who looked very meek soft miss french almost always looked meek soft be afraid will make very dull for mother not seeing old friend said mr gibson mamma wo feel at said dorothy mr stanbury suppose will see own friend at own house just same said camilla there must be great difficulty in when there be lady who be to remain unknown said arabella think so mr gibson mr gibson replied that perhaps there might be difficulty be sure difficulty thought might be got over if lady did not always occupy same room have never seen mr trevelyan have miss stanbury asked camilla never be not old family friend then anything of sort oh dear because said arabella be so odd how different people get together sometimes then dorothy explained that mr trevelyan brother hugh have long be friend oh of mr trevelyan said camilla then be have sent wife to nuncombe not have come there suppose there have be agreement said dorothy just so just so said arabella meek must like to see say that be very beautiful brother say that be handsome exceedingly lovely be told said camilla must like to see must mr gibson always like to see pretty woman said mr gibson with polite bow sister shared between suppose will go to church said camilla very likely not said arabella lady of sort very often go to church dare say will find that will never stir out of place at that not soul in nuncombe will ever see except gardener be such thing for woman to be separated from husband think so mr gibson of course be said with shake of head be intended to imply that censure of church must of course attend sundering of whom church have bound together implied also by absence from of intense clerical severity a separated wife be allowed to live with so very respectable lady a mr stanbury there must probably be mitigating circumstance attending special separation wonder what be like said camilla after pause who asked arabella gentleman said camilla what gentleman demanded arabella mean mr trevelyan said camilla believe there really be eh be there said mr gibson very timidly oh dear yes said arabella be afraid there be something of kind said camilla have heard that there be have heard name then whispered very closely into ear of mr gibson word colonel osborne a though lip be by far too pure to mention aloud sound so full of iniquity indeed said mr gibson be quite old man said dorothy knew father intimately before be born a far a can understand husband doe not suspect in least be only because there be misunderstanding between not at because of gentleman oh exclaimed camilla ah exclaimed arabella must make difference said mr gibson for married woman to have name mentioned at with gentleman be so bad be not mr gibson then arabella also have whisper into clergyman ear very closely be afraid there be not doubt about colonel be afraid not be indeed two by honour odd be deal said miss stanbury briskly sharp click with put marker down upon table be heard through room want anybody to tell said that when young woman be parted from husband chance be ten to one have be very foolish what be woman to do if husband beat said mr crumbie beat again said mr machugh husband will be sure to have worst of said mr crumbie well declare if have turned up honour again miss stanbury be wife that cut to mr crumbie then be again at once immersed in play name of trevelyan osborne be heard till miss stanbury be marking double under candlestick during pause in game conversation went back to same topic when rubber be over who have be playing lost for ten minute in allurement of interesting subject be so singular coincidence that lady must have gone to nuncombe putney of village in england to house of mr stanbury of lady in england then be innocent be guilty if guilty in what degree that have be allowed to bring baby with be considered to be great point in favour mr crumbie opinion be that be only few word mr crumbie be afraid that have be little light mr machugh said that there be never fire without smoke miss stanbury a took departure declared that young woman of present day did know what be after think that world must be frolic dancing have more idea of doing duty earning bread than boy home for holiday have of doing lesson then a went home with dorothy across close spoke word intended to be very serious mean to say anything against mother for what have done a yet somebody must take woman in perhaps be natural if colonel what be name make way down to nuncombe putney mother must send packing if have respect for herself for priscilla chapter xvi dartmoor illustration well weighed decision of miss stanbury respecting stanbury trevelyan arrangement at nuncombe putney have be communicated to dorothy a two walked home at night across close from mr machugh house be accepted by dorothy a being wise proper amounted to if mr trevelyan must behave with propriety in retirement at clock house further blame in matter must be attributed to mr stanbury for receiving at rate in dorothy hearing existing scheme whether wise foolish must be regarded a accepted scheme if mr trevelyan must be indiscreet if for instance colonel osborne must show at nuncombe putney then for sake of family miss stanbury must speak out must speak out very loudly dorothy understood must perceive that aunt have strong suspicion that there must be indiscretion never knew one like said miss stanbury who when 'd got away from one man did want to have dangling after week have hardly passed after party at mr machugh mr trevelyan have hardly be three week at nuncombe putney before tidings miss stanbury almost expected reached ear colonel be at clock house ma'be said martha now be quite understood in close by time that colonel meant colonel osborne be told have though ma'be for sure certain who say so giles hickbody be down at lessboro see 'd hisself portly middle aged man not one of young scampish like lover be man oh yes went over to nuncombe putney a sure a anything hired mr clegg chaise pair asked for mr trevelyan house a open a anything when giles asked in yard told a how be married lady young man 'd like to be at tail so must with mop handle said miss stanbury whose hatred for sin by comfort respectability of world be destroyed be not only sincere intense well what then came back slept at mr clegg night at least be what said must do miss stanbury however be not so precipitate uncharitable a to act strongly upon information such a before even said word to dorothy made further inquiry made very minute inquiry writing even to very old intimate friend mr ellison of lessboro ' writing to lady most cautious guarded letter at last became fact proved to mind that colonel osborne have be at clock house have be received there have remained there for hour have be allowed access to mr trevelyan have slept night at inn at lessboro ' thing be so terrible to miss stanbury mind that even false hair dr colenso penny newspaper did not account for will begin to believe that evil one have be allowed to come among in person because of sin said to martha meant in meantime mr trevelyan a may be remembered have hired mr crocket open carriage three young woman mr trevelyan nora priscilla made little excursion to princetown somewhat after fashion of picnic at princetown in middle of dartmoor about nine mile from nuncombe putney be prison establishment at be kept convict undergoing penal servitude be regarded by country round with great interest chiefly because prisoner now again escape then there come period of interesting excitement until escaped felon will have be again taken how can tell where may be whether may not suit to find rest in own cupboard under own bed then a escape without notice will of course be felon object to attain that will probably cut throat throat of everybody belonging to consideration give interest to princetown excite in heart of devonian of part strong affection for dartmoor prison of who visit princetown comparatively few effect entrance within wall of gaol look at gloomy place with mysterious interest feeling something akin to envy for prisoner who have enjoyed privilege of solving mystery of prison life who know how men feel when have hair cut short be free from moral responsibility for own conduct be moved about in gang treated like wild beast journey to princetown from side be approached have charm of wild beautiful scenery spot be ugly enough can go not thither without breathing sweetest freshest air encountering that delightful sense of romance moorland scenery always produce idea of three friend be to see moor rather than prison to learn something of country around to enjoy excitement of eating sandwich sitting on hillock in exchange for ordinary comfort of good dinner with chair table bottle of sherry water paper of sandwich contained whole banquet for lady though like good thing at picnic indeed at other time almost a well a men like very seldom prepare dainty for alone men be wiser more thoughtful be careful to have good thing even if be to be enjoyed without companionship mr crocket boy though be only about three foot high be miracle of skill discretion used machine a patent drag be called in going down hill with utmost care never forced beast beyond walk if there be slightest rise in ground a there be always rise journey be slow three lady enjoyed thoroughly mr trevelyan be in better spirit than have thought to be possible for in present condition most of have recognised fact that dram of spirit will create that so called nip of brandy will create hilarity at least alacrity that glass of sherry will often pick up set in order prostrate animal mental faculty of drinker be not sufficiently alive to fact that copious draught of fresh air of air fresh unaccustomed will have precisely same effect do know now again be very essential to change air generally consider to do with chance of advantage be necessary to go far afield think also that such change of air be only needful when sickness of body have come upon when threatens to come be seldom aware that may imbibe long potation of pleasure healthy excitement without perhaps going out of own county that such potation be within day journey of most of that be to be have for crown head expense told mr trevelyan probably did not know that cloud be lifted off mind load of sorrow made light to by special vigour of air of moor did know that be enjoying that world be pleasanter to than have be for month past when have sat upon hillock eaten sandwich regretting that basket of provision have not be bigger have drunk sherry water out of little horn mug mr crocket have lent nora started off across moorland alone horse have be left to be fed in princetown have walked back to bush under have rashly left basket of provender concealed happened however that on day there be escaped felon about to watch what have done food drink have be found secure nora have gone off a sister priscilla sat leaning against hillock with back to road must be seen standing now on one little eminence now on thinking doubtless a stood on one how good must be to be lady peterborough a stood on other how much better to be mr hugh stanbury only before must be mr hugh stanbury must be necessary that mr hugh stanbury must share opinion necessary also that must be able to maintain wife must never do to be very poor man wife said to herself remembered a said that in reference to prospect of being lady peterborough man who be to be lord peterborough be at rate ready to make wife on side there be none of difficulty about house money position stood in way of hugh stanbury side of question be not thought fit to be wife of very poor man conceived of herself that must do very well a future lady peterborough in drawing room of monkhams be so far vain a to fancy that must look speak move have being after fashion be approved for lady peterboroughs of world be not clear to that nature have not expressly intended to be lady peterborough whereas a far a must see nature have not intended to be mr hugh stanbury with precarious income of perhaps ten guinea week when journalism be doing well so moved on to little eminence to think of there be clear to that if must accept mr glascock must sell not give away have told score of time before that young woman must give away not sell must either give away keep to herself a circumstance might go have be quite sure that must never sell be lesson have taught when be very young before have come to understand world hard necessity nothing now told must be worse than to hang like mill stone round neck of poor man might be very good thing to give away for love must not be good thing to be mean of ruining man loved even if man be willing to be so ruined then thought that must also love that other man little must love sufficiently for comfortable domestic purpose must undoubtedly be very pleasant to have trouble of life settled for if be mr glascock known to world a future lady peterborough must not be within power to bring sister sister husband again together tribute of monkhams authority influence to sister side of question must be most salutary tried to make believe that in way must be doing good deed upon whole thought that if mr glascock must give chance must accept have distinctly promised that must give chance might be that unfortunate quarrel in trevelyan family must deter people wish to ally with family quarrel if chance came in way must accept have made up mind to when turned round from off last knoll on have stood to return to sister priscilla stanbury illustration nora try to make believe two have sat still under shade of thorn bush looking at nora a be wandering about talking together more freely than have ever done before on circumstance have brought together how pretty look priscilla have said a nora

though of course must be better for to go out know how girl be ever to get settled in world unless go out be always injury to be connected in way with woman who be separated from husband must be bad for wo hurt said priscilla nothing of kind can hurt mean that people say such ill natured thing stand alone can take care of myself said priscilla defy evil tongue of world to hurt personal care be limited to old gown bread cheese like pair of glove to go to church with be only remnant of prejudice world have so very little to give that be pretty nearly sure that will take nothing away be contented well ca say that be contented hardly think that anybody ought to be contented must mother die dorothy remain with aunt get married must be utterly alone in world providence call have made lady after fashion so ca live with plowman wife at same time have so used in other respect ca live with anybody else why must not get married a well a dorothy who must have if have husband must want good one man with head on shoulder heart even if be young good looking rich doubt whether must please a be be a likely to be taken bodily to heaven a to become man wife suppose most woman think so of at time yet be married be not fit to marry be often cross like own way have distaste for men never in life saw man whom wished even to make intimate friend must think man idiot who began to make soft speech to must tell so ah might find different when went on with think said priscilla that when woman be married there be nothing to must not submit on behalf of husband mean that for of course mean for how must not be thinking of living a be under same roof with be thinking of louey louey be baby what be to do when after year two father will send for to have under own care nothing will separate

trevelyan have gone through miserable task of breaking up establishment in curzon street have seen furniture packed including book picture pet italian ornament be necessary that must go live somewhere be very wretched at time so wretched that life be burden to be man who loved wife to whom child be very dear be one too to whom ordinary comfort of domestic life be attractive necessary there be men to whom release from constraint imposed by family tie will be at rate for time felt a release be not such man there be delight to in being able to dine at club being free to go whither pleased in evening a be pleased to go whither in evening morning be equally blank to went so often to mr bideawhile that poor old lawyer became quite tired of trevelyan family quarrel even lady milborough with power of sympathising began to feel that must almost prefer on morning that dear young friend louis trevelyan must not be announced nevertheless always saw when came administered comfort according to light of course must have wife back before long be only consolation be able to offer offered so often that began gradually to feel that something might be done towards bringing about so desirable event after what have occurred must not live again in curzon street even in london for awhile naples be open to lady milborough said so much to of advantage always came in such circumstance from going to naples that began to regard trip a almost natural conclusion of adventure then there came very difficult question what step must be first taken lady milborough proposed that must go boldly down to nuncombe putney make arrangement will only be too glad to jump into arm said lady milborough trevelyan thought that if went to nuncombe putney wife might perhaps jump into arm what must come after how must stand then in reference to authority must own that have be wrong must promise to behave better in future did not believe that be yet sufficiently broken in spirit to make such promise told again again that must be absurd in to allow to return to without such subjection after that have gone through in defence of marital right if be to write to long letter argumentative affectionate exhaustive might be better be inclined to believe of that be good at writing long affectionate argumentative exhaustive letter must not do even a yet have broken up house scattered domestic god to wind because have behaved badly to thing done be too important to allow of redress being found so easily so lived on wretched life in london must hardly endure to show at club fearing one must be talking of a man who be separated from wife perhaps a man of whose wife colonel osborne be dear friend doubt for day two there have be much of such conversation have died away from club long before consciousness have become callous at first have gone into lodging in mayfair have be for day two after that have taken set of furnished chamber in lincoln inn immediately under in stanbury lived thus came to pas that stanbury be very much thrown together a trevelyan must always talk of wife be rather bore friend bore with must even continue to instruct world through column of d r while trevelyan be descanting on peculiar cruelty of own position wish to be just even generous do love with heart said one afternoon when hugh be very hard at work 'it be very well for gentleman to call reformer hugh be writing 'but have gentleman ever realised to meaning of word think that have never done so a long a ' of course love said hugh with eye still on paper still leaning on pen finding by cessation of sound that trevelyan have paused therefore knowing that be necessary that must speak a much a ever said trevelyan with energy 'as long a follow leader in such cause into whichever lobby may choose to take ' exactly so exactly said stanbury just a much a ever be not listening to word said trevelyan have missed single expression have used said stanbury fellow have to do two thing at time when be on daily press beg pardon for interrupting said trevelyan angrily getting up taking hat stalking off to house of lady milborough in way became rather bore to friend must not divest mind of injury have accrued to from wife conduct must help talking of grief with mind be laden be troubled with sore suspicion a far a concerned wife have certainly not be merited have seemed to that have persisted in intimacy with colonel osborne in manner be not compatible with wife like indifference regarded a duty why have written to received letter from when husband have plainly told that such communication be objectionable have done so a far a trevelyan must remember word have plainly declared that must continue to do so have sent away into most remote retirement must find for post be open to have heard much of mr stanbury of priscilla from friend hugh thoroughly believed that wife be in respectable hand what be to prevent colonel osborne from going after if chose to do so if did so choose mr stanbury must not prevent meeting be racked with jealousy yet did not cease to declare to that knew wife too well to believe that must sin must not rid of jealousy tried with might to make man whom hated object of rather than woman whom loved hated colonel osborne with heart be regret to that day of duelling be over so that must not shoot man yet have duelling be possible to colonel osborne have done nothing must have justified in calling enemy out must even have enabled to do so with chance of inducing enemy to fight circumstance thought be cruel to beyond compare in must have be made to suffer so great torment without having of satisfaction of revenge even lady milborough with horror a to colonel must not tell that colonel be amenable to punishment be advised that must take wife away live at naples because of man that must banish entirely if chose to repossess of wife child yet nothing must be done to unprincipled rascal by whom wrong suffering be occasioned thinking very possible that colonel osborne must follow wife have watch set upon colonel have found retired policeman most discreet man a be assured who for consideration undertook management of interesting job of kind man be one bozzle who have not lived without certain reputation in police court in day of madness therefore took mr bozzle into pay after while got letter from bozzle with exeter post mark colonel osborne have left london with ticket for lessboro ' bozzle also have taken place by same train for small town letter be written in railway carriage a bozzle explained must be posted by a passed through exeter further communication must be made by next day post in letter mr bozzle proposed to address to z post office waterloo place on receiving first letter trevelyan be in agony of doubt a well a misery what must do must go to lady milborough to stanbury must at once follow colonel osborne mr bozzle to lessboro ' ended in resolving at last to wait for letter be to be addressed to z spent interval of horrible suspense of insane rage let law say what might must have man blood if found that man have even attempted to wrong then at last second letter reached colonel osborne mr bozzle have of spent day in neighbourhood of lessboro ' not exactly in other company very near to other colonel have ordered gig on day after arrival at lessboro ' for village of cockchaffington for mr bozzle knew colonel have gone to cockchaffington mr bozzle be ultimately inclined to think that colonel have really spent day in going to cockchaffington mr bozzle knowing wile of such men a colonel osborne thinking at first that journey to cockchaffington might only be deep ruse have walked over to nuncombe putney there have have pint of beer bread cheese at mr crocket house have asked various question to did not receive very satisfactory answer inspected clock house very minutely came to decided opinion a to point at must be attacked if burglary be object of assailant observed iron gate step shape of tree old pigeon house looking fabric in clock used to be placed there be knowing when information might be wanted what information might not be of use made tolerably sure that colonel osborne did not visit nuncombe putney on day then walked back to lessboro ' having done applied to little memorandum book in kept record of interesting duty entered claim against employer for conveyance to nuncombe putney back including driver ostler then wrote letter after that have hot supper with three glass of brandy water went to bed with thorough conviction that have earned bread on day letter to z did not give particular did explain that colonel osborne have gone off apparently to cockchaffington that bozzle have visited nuncombe putney hawk have be nigh dovecot a yet said mr bozzle in letter meaning to be mysterious facetious must be difficult to say whether wit mystery disgusted most have felt that be defiling with dirt when first went to mr bozzle knew that be having recourse to mean be base low must not be other than base low let circumstance be what might mr bozzle conversation have not be quite so bad a mr bozzle letter a may have be that mr bozzle successful activity be more insupportable than futile attempt nevertheless something must be done must not be that colonel osborne must have gone down to close neighbourhood of nuncombe putney without intention of seeing lady whom obtrusive pertinacity have driven to seclusion be terrible to trevelyan colonel osborne must be there not le terrible because one a mr bozzle be watching colonel on behalf must go to nuncombe putney if so when got to nuncombe putney what must do there at last in suspense grief resolved that must tell whole to hugh stanbury do mean said hugh that have put policeman on track man be policeman once what call private detective ca say think be right see that be necessary said trevelyan ca say that be necessary to speak out ca understand that wife must be worth watching who requires watching be man to hing then even now be not wife whom doubt a for colonel osborne if chooses to go to lessboro ' why must nothing that can do that bozzle can do can prevent have perfect right to go to lessboro ' have not right to go to wife if wife refuse to see having seen for man may force way in anywhere with little trouble if sends away with flea in ear a believe must be so frightfully indiscreet see what bozzle can do have found out at rate that osborne be there said trevelyan be not more fond of dealing with such fellow than be think be duty to know what be going on ought to do now must hing except dismiss bozzle know that be nonsense stanbury did must dismiss bozzle stanbury be now quite in earnest a repeated suggestion for dismissal of policeman pushed writing thing away from if ask opinion know must tell what think must get rid of bozzle a beginning if will only think of how can wife come back to if learns that have set detective to watch have set man to watch colonel osborne be nothing to except a be concerned with man be now down in neighbourhood if learns that how can help feeling a deep insult of course man watch a cat watch mouse what be to do ca write to man tell to come away osborne be down there must do something will go down to nuncombe putney let know truth after much debating of subject hugh stanbury said that must go down to nuncombe putney alone there be difficulty about d r must go to office of newspaper overcome how far presence of nora rowley at mother house may have assisted in bringing to undertake journey perhaps need not be accurately stated acknowledged to that claim of friendship be strong upon that a have loudly disapproved of bozzle arrangement ought to lend hand to other scheme of action moreover having professed conviction that improper visiting must possibly take place under mother roof felt bound to shew that be not afraid to trust to conviction declared that must be ready to proceed to nuncombe putney to morrow only on condition that might have plenary power to dismiss bozzle there can be reason why must take notice of man said trevelyan how can help noticing when find prowling about place of course will know who be see that need know

thought that be very necessary when stanbury have urged that measure seemed to imply suspicion have declared that in other way must truth be obtained trevelyan simply wanted to know fact a be occurring be fact that colonel osborne be down in neighbourhood of nuncombe putney at least have be ascertained might very possibly be case that must be refused admittance to clock house that lady there must combine to keep out so trevelyan urged truth on point be desired be essentially necessary to happiness that must know what be being done mother sister said can not be afraid of coming suddenly among stanbury so urged have found necessary to yield yet have felt that be almost acting like detective policeman in purposely falling down upon without word of announcement have chance

called upon to perform chapter xx shewing how colonel osborne went to cockchaffington together with miss stanbury first letter to sister in law letter have also be delivered to mr trevelyan nora rowley a sister have left room with in hand have expressed opinion that have come from trevelyan have in truth be written by colonel osborne when second letter from miss stanbury have be received at clock house that in in plain term begged pardon for accusation conveyed in first letter colonel osborne have started on deceitful little journey to cockchaffington mr bozzle ex policeman who have in hand have already asked way to nuncombe putney when colonel osborne learned that louis trevelyan have broken up establishment in curzon street have sent wife away into barbarous retirement in dartmoor for such be nature of information on subject be spread among trevelyan friend in london when be made aware also that be done on account because be so closely intimate with trevelyan wife because trevelyan wife be persisted in continuing to be so closely intimate with vanity be gratified although might be true doubt be true that said much to friend to of deep sorrow felt that trouble must befall old friend old friend daughter nevertheless a curled grey whisker before glass made most of such remnant of hair a be left on top of head a looked to padding of coat completed study of wrinkle beneath eye so that in conversation might be a little apparent a possible felt more of pleasure than of pain in regard to whole affair be very sad that must be so be human have be in power to set whole matter right by word must probably have spoken that word a be not possible a trevelyan have in opinion made gross fool of a emily trevelyan be very nice not le nice in certainly be fond of a great tyranny have be used towards a have still plea of old family friendship to protect conscience to protect conscience unless went so far a to make plea additional sting to conscience thought that a man must follow up matter here be young fashionable very pretty woman banished to wild of dartmoor for sake a far a must understand must not have be so banished have consented to say that must give up acquaintance with in such circumstance a be possible that must hing various idea ran through head began to think that if trevelyan be out of way might might perhaps be almost tempted to make woman wife be so nice that almost thought that might be rash enough for although knew well satisfaction of being bachelor a thought suggested to be well aware that be thinking of thing quite distant from reader be not to suppose that colonel osborne meditated making away with husband colonel be certainly not man for murder did even think of running away with friend daughter though told that must dispose of wrinkle satisfactorily still knew power sufficiently to be aware that be no longer fit to be hero of such romance a that acknowledged to that there be much labour to be gone through in running away with man wife that result in respect to personal comfort be not always happy what if mr trevelyan be to divorce from husband on score of husband cruelty various horror be related a to man treatment of wife by be said that be in prison on dartmoor if not actually in prison arrangement prison discipline might perhaps make difficult that be in custody of one of prison warder who possessed prim cottage grim wife just outside prison wall colonel osborne did not believe even so much a did believe that mr trevelyan have be banished to inhospitable region to dreary comfortless abode of a wife of man of fortune must have great ground to complain so thinking did not probably declare to that divorce must be obtained that in such event must marry lady idea came across mind in direction trevelyan be cruel bluebeard emily a be studious to call mr trevelyan be dear injured saint a for though acknowledged to that lumbago pinched now again so that must not rise from chair with alacrity of youth yet when walked along pall mall with coat properly buttoned must not observe that great many young woman looked at with admiring eye be thus with settled scheme that colonel went to work made inquiry ascertained mr trevelyan address in devonshire when learned thought that have done much though in truth there have be no secrecy in matter score of people knew mr trevelyan address besides newsvendor who supplied paper from whose boy colonel osborne servant obtained information when information have be obtained be expedient that must be used therefore colonel osborne wrote following letter acrobat club july dear emily twice colonel wrote dearest emily twice tore sheet on word be written longed to be ardent still be so necessary to be prudent be not quite sure of lady woman sometimes tell husband even when have quarrelled with although ardent expression in writing to pretty woman be pleasant to male writer be not pleasant for gentleman to be asked what on earth mean by sort of thing at time of life colonel gave hour to consideration then began letter dear emily if prudence be soul of valour may not be considered also very mainspring perhaps pivot of love dear emily need hardly tell with what dismay have heard of have taken place in curzon street fear that must have suffered much that be suffering now be inexpressible relief to to hear that have child with nora nevertheless to have home taken away from to be sent out of london to be banished from society for what manner in mind of men work be quite incomprehensible a for feel have lost company of friend whom indeed can very ill spare have thousand thing to say to among one two feel that must say ought to say a happens old schoolfellow of mine be vicar of cockchaffington village find by map be very near to nuncombe putney saw in town last spring then asked to pay visit there be something in church people go to see though understand church much will go see will run down on wednesday will sleep at inn at

parsonage on following day will get over to nuncombe putney hope that will see considering long friendship with great attachment to father mother think that strictest martinet must tell that need hesitate in matter have seen mr trevelyan twice at club have not spoken to under such circumstance must not of course speak to indeed may say that feeling towards just at present be of such nature a to preclude from doing so with appearance of cordiality dear emily believe now a always affectionate friend frederic osborne when read that letter over to second time felt quite sure that have not committed even if friend be to send letter to husband must not do harm be aware that might have dilated more on old friendship between sir marmaduke experienced certain distaste to mention of thing appertaining to year long past did not quite suit in present frame of mind to speak of regard in quasi paternal term must have used have satisfied to represent simply a father friend language therefore have be little doubtful so that lady might if be so minded look upon in tender light in husband have certainly chosen to regard when letter be handed to mr trevelyan at once took with up to own room so that might be alone when read handwriting be quite familiar to did not choose that even sister must see have told twenty time over while living at nuncombe putney be not living under guardianship of mr stanbury must consent to live under guardianship of one a husband did not choose to remain with protect have done no wrong must submit to other authority than of legal lord master according to view of own position be in power to depute authority to others have caused separation now must be sole judge of own action in correspondence between father old friend be in degree criminal even faulty there be reason moral social religious why old man over fifty who have known life must not write to yet must not say aloud before mr stanbury priscilla sister that have received letter from colonel osborne felt that colour have come to cheek that must not even walk out of room a though letter have be matter of indifference to must have be matter of indifference have there be nobody there to see mr trevelyan be certainly not in love with colonel osborne be not more so now than have be when father friend purposely dressed for occasion have kissed in vestry of church in be married have given blessing be then intended to be semi paternal a from old man to young woman be not in love with never must be never must be in love with reader may believe in so far a where be woman who when be neglected thrown over suspected by man that love will not feel desire of sympathy solicitude show of regard from man woman life too have not hitherto be of such nature that tranquillity of clock house at nuncombe putney afforded to that desired have be there now month be almost sick from want of excitement be full of wrath against husband why have sent there to break heart in disgraceful retirement when have never wronged from morning to night have employment amusement nothing to satisfy craving why be to be doomed to existence have declared that a long a must have boy with must be happy be allowed to have boy be anything happy when received colonel osborne letter while held in hand still unopened never for moment thought that must make happy there be in something of excitement painted man to herself in brighter colour now than have ever given to in former portrait cared for be gracious to appreciated talent beauty conduct knew that deserved treatment very different from accorded to by husband why must reject sympathy of father oldest friend because husband be madly jealous about old man husband have chosen to send away to leave so that must act on own judgment acting on own judgment read colonel be letter from first to last knew that be wrong to speak of coming to nuncombe putney yet thought that must see have dim perception that be standing on edge of precipice on broken ground might fall under without moment warning yet must not retreat from danger though colonel osborne be wrong very wrong in coming to see yet liked for coming though must be half afraid to tell news to mr stanbury more than half afraid to tell priscilla yet liked excitement of fear nora must scold be scolding thought must answer then be not fact that colonel osborne be coming down to devonshire to see be coming a far a lessboro ' to see friend at cockchaffington when at lessboro ' be likely that must leave neighbourhood without seeing daughter of old ally why must do so be to be unnatural in conduct uncivil unfriendly because mr trevelyan have be foolish suspicious insane so arguing with answered colonel be letter before have spoken on subject to one in house be answer dear colonel osborne must leave to own judgment to decide whether will come to nuncombe putney not there be reason must seem to make expedient that must stay away even though circumstance be bringing into immediate neighbourhood of reason will leave to be judge will never let be said that have have cause to dread visit of old friend nevertheless if stay away will understand why do so personally will be glad to see a have always be seems odd to that can not write in warmer tone to father mother oldest friend of course will understand that though will readily see if call can not ask

afraid to see why must be afraid of colonel osborne will not submit to acknowledge that there can be danger in colonel osborne be to do so must be repeating insult against if husband wished to guide in such matter why did not stay with then went out into village posted letter nora meanwhile be thinking whether must call in assistance of priscilla stanbury did not like to take such step in opposition to sister chapter xxi shewing how colonel osborne went to nuncombe putney colonel osborne be expected at nuncombe putney on friday be thursday evening before mr stanbury priscilla be told of coming emily have argued matter with nora declaring that must make communication that must make when pleased how pleased if mr stanbury think said that be going to be treated a prisoner will not

same thursday priscilla have written last defiant letter to aunt that letter in have cautioned aunt to make further accusation without being sure of fact to priscilla imagination that coming of lucifer in person of mr trevelyan have spoken must hardly have be worse than coming of colonel osborne when therefore mr trevelyan declared fact on thursday evening vainly endeavouring to speak of threatened visit in ordinary voice a of ordinary circumstance be a though thunderbolt have fallen upon colonel osborne coming here said priscilla mindful of stanbury correspondence mindful of evil tongue of world why not demanded mr trevelyan who have heard nothing of stanbury correspondence oh dear oh dear ejaculated mr stanbury who of course be aware of have passed between clock house house in close though letter have be written by daughter nora be determined to stand up for sister might be circumstance of case wish colonel osborne be not coming said because make foolish fuss can not understand how anybody can suppose to be wrong that emily must see papa very oldest friend in world why be coming demanded priscilla because want to see acquaintance at cockchaffington said mr trevelyan there be wonderful church door there church fiddlestick said priscilla matter be debated throughout evening at one time there be great quarrel between lady then there be reconciliation point on mr trevelyan stood with greatest firmness be that did not become a married woman whose conduct have always be good who be more careful a to than be even of name to be ashamed to meet man why must not see colonel osborne colonel anybody else who might call here with same justification for calling old friendship give priscilla endeavoured to explain to that husband known wish ought to hinder from doing so husband must have remained with to express wish mr trevelyan replied must mr stanbury must priscilla bring to say that man must not be admitted into house in course of debate in heat of anger mr trevelyan declared that be such threat held out to must leave house see colonel osborne in street at inn emily said nora will will not submit to be treated a guilty woman a prisoner may say what like wo be shut up one have tried to shut up said priscilla be afraid of old woman at exeter said mr trevelyan for by time fact of stanbury correspondence have be elicited in general conversation

known ever since be born if be nearly sixty priscilla said mr stanbury doe seem to make difference mr stanbury herself be only just sixty felt to be quite old woman may be devil at eighty said priscilla colonel osborne be not devil at said nora mamma be so foolish said priscilla man age doe not matter in least beg pardon dear said mr stanbury very humbly at time quarrel be raging afterwards came reconciliation have not be for stanbury correspondence fact of colonel osborne threatened visit must have be admitted a thing necessary a disagreeable necessity how be visit to be admitted passed over in teeth of correspondence priscilla felt very keenly peculiar cruelty of position of course aunt stanbury must hear of visit indeed secrecy in matter be not compatible with priscilla idea of honesty aunt have apologised humbly for having said that colonel osborne have be at nuncombe that apology doubtless have be due colonel osborne have not be at nuncombe when accusation have be made accusation have be unjust false coming have be spoken of by priscilla in own letter a occurrence be quite out of question anger against aunt have be for saying that man have come not for objecting to visit now man be coming aunt stanbury must know about how great how terrible how crushing must be aunt stanbury triumph must write tell said priscilla be sure will not object said mr trevelyan hugh must be told said mr stanbury may tell world if like said mr trevelyan in way be settled among colonel osborne be to be received on next morning friday morning colonel osborne doubtless having heard

driver however have caught glimpse of a be topping hill having seen about on previous day perceiving that be dressed in decent coat trouser nevertheless be not gentleman began to suspect that be somebody there be great deal said afterwards about bozzle in mr clegg yard at lessboro ' lessboro mind be never able to satisfy altogether respecting bozzle mission a to colonel osborne mission lessboro mind did satisfy with much certainty horse be hardly taken from out of colonel osborne fly in mr crocket yard when bozzle stepped into village by path have already discovered soon busied among tomb in churchyard now one corner of churchyard be immediately opposite to iron gate leading into clock house drat said wooden legged postman still sitting on donkey to mr crocket ostler if there be'ant chap a be here yesterday when be starting zeed 'un in lezbro ' street thick very morning be'ant arter good that 'un said ostler after close watch be kept upon watcher illustration wooden legged postman of nuncombe putney in meantime colonel osborne have ordered breakfast at stag antler have asked question a to position of clock house be altogether ignorant of mr bozzle although mr bozzle have be on track now for two day two night have determined a came on to nuncombe putney that must not be shame faced about visit to mr trevelyan be possible that be not so keen in matter a have be when planned journey in london may be that really tried to make believe that have come way to confines of dartmoor to see porch of cockchaffington church session in london be over be necessary for such man a colonel osborne that must do something with before went down to scotch grouse have long desired to see something of most picturesque county in england now a sat eating breakfast in mr crocket parlour almost looked upon dear emily a subsidiary attraction oh be clock house said to mr crocket have not pleasure of knowing mr stanbury very respectable lady so have heard widow of clergyman ah yes son up in london know always writing book be very clever dare say there be lady indeed two lady whom do know mr trevelyan be there think miss rowley be'ant muster trevelyan be said mr crocket looking at very hard be not mr trevelyan yet 'the colonel doo be talking about well yes be colonel know why anybody must talk about will just step out now however see friend be madam lover said mr crocket to herself a sure a egg be egg a said so colonel osborne boldly walked across village pulled bell at iron gate while bozzle crouching among tomb saw handle in hand there be said priscilla everybody in clock house have known that fly have seen have brought colonel into nuncombe putney everybody have known that have breakfasted at stag antler everybody now knew that be at gate ringing bell into drawing room said mr stanbury with fearful tremulous whisper to girl who went across little garden in front to open iron gate girl felt a though apollyon be there a though be called upon to admit apollyon mr stanbury having uttered whisper hurried away up stair priscilla held ground in parlour determined to be near scene of action if there might be need must be acknowledged that peeped from behind curtain anxious to catch glimpse of terrible man whose coming to nuncombe putney regarded a so severe misfortune plan of campaign have be arranged mr trevelyan nora together received colonel osborne in drawing room be understood that nora be to remain there during whole visit be horrible to think that precaution must be necessary mr trevelyan have said perhaps may be best there be knowing what malice of people may not invent dear girl said colonel be delighted to see gave hand to be not very cheerful here said mr trevelyan a may imagine scenery be beautiful said nora people be living with be kind nice be very glad of said colonel then there be pause seemed for moment two that none of knew how to begin general conversation colonel osborne be quite sure by time that have come down to devonshire with express object of seeing door of church at cockchaffington mr trevelyan be beginning to think that certainly have not come to see have heard from father since have be here asked colonel then there be explanation about sir marmaduke lady rowley mr trevelyan name be not mentioned mr trevelyan stated that have explained to mother painful circumstance of present life sir marmaduke a colonel osborne be aware be expected to be in england in spring lady rowley must of course come with nora thought that might probably now come before time mr trevelyan declared that be out of question that must do so be sure that father must not leave island except when did so in obedience to official order expense of doing so must be ruinous to what good must do in way there be great deal of family conversation in colonel osborne be able to take part not word be said about mr trevelyan did colonel find opportunity of expressing spark of sentiment for purpose of expressing have made journey to devonshire be not pleasant to make love in presence of third person even when love be fair above board be quite impracticable to do so to married lady when married lady sister be present no more futile visit than of colonel osborne to clock house be ever made yet though not word be spoken to mr trevelyan must have taken slightest exception visit futile a be must not do enormous deal of harm mr crocket have already guessed that fine gentleman down from london be lover of married lady at clock house who be separated from husband wooden legged postman ostler be not long in connecting man among tombstone with visitor to house trevelyan a be aware already knew that colonel osborne be in neighbourhood poor priscilla stanbury be now exposed to terrible necessity of owning truth to aunt colonel when have sat hour with young friend took leave a walked back to mr crocket ordered that fly might be got ready for mind be heavy with disagreeable feeling that have made as of whole affair have be failure though might be able to pas off porch at cockchaffington among friend must not be aware that have spent time trouble money for nothing became aware a returned to lessboro have intended to make pleasant use whatever of position in reference to mr trevelyan tone of letter whole mode of proceeding must have be le patriarchal must have contrived meeting without presence of nora rowley a soon a have left mr trevelyan went to own room nora at once rejoined priscilla be gone asked priscilla oh yes have gone what must have given that have never come yet said nora what harm have done wish have not come because of course people will talk nothing be more natural than that must come over to see when be so near nora what do mean believe in neighbourhood believe came on purpose to see sister think that be dastardly most ungentleman like thing to do be quite sure be wrong then altogether wrong said nora very well must have own opinion be glad can be so charitable must not have come here to house even though imperative business have brought into very village men in vanity never think of injury may do to woman name now must go write to aunt be not going to have said hereafter deceived then will write to hugh oh dear oh dear be afraid be great trouble to will not deceive because like be great trouble to have meant to be so prudent with prudence have not be able to keep clear of rock have be so indignant with aunt stanbury now must go eat humble pie then eat humble pie after following fashion dear aunt stanbury after what have passed between think right to tell that colonel osborne have be at nuncombe putney that called at clock house morning did not see mr trevelyan miss rowley together did see remained here perhaps hour must not have thought necessary to mention to matter being one in be not concerned be not for former correspondence when last wrote have idea that be coming have mamma when first wrote be not even expected by mr trevelyan man wrote about be gentleman a told before be most disagreeable tiresome must be quite nonsensical circumstance seem to make necessary a for colonel osborne wish have not be here coming must do harm only that will be talked about think will understand how be that feel constrained to write to do hope that will spare mamma who be disturbed harassed when get angry letter if have anything to say to mind truly priscilla stanbury clock house friday august wrote also to brother hugh hugh reached nuncombe putney before letter reached mr bozzle watched colonel out of house watched out of village when colonel be fairly started mr bozzle walked back to lessboro ' chapter xxii shewing how miss stanbury behaved to two niece illustration triumph of miss stanbury when received niece letter be certainly very great so great that in first flush must not restrain from exhibiting to dorothy well well what do think dolly about what aunt know who letter be from nobody writes to now so constant a sister priscilla letter be from priscilla colonel osborne have be at clock house after knew that must be there knew knew dorothy when heard be dumbfounded have rested defence of mother sister on impossibility of such visit being admitted according to light coming of colonel osborne after have be said must be like coming of lucifer colonel be to imagination horrible roaring lion have idea that erratic manoeuvre of such beast might be milder more innocent than wooing of turtle dove must have asked whether roaring lion have gone away again if so whether have taken prey with be not that be too much frightened at moment to ask question that mother sister must have be wilfully concerned in such iniquity be quite incredible to yet did not know how to defend be quite sure of aunt stanbury may there not be mistake mistake time think dear way priscilla say that be there now in there be mistake priscilla have said nothing of kind mean that be staying at clock house aunt stanbury know where be now be not keeper be glad to say be not lady keeper ah be bad business ca touch pitch not be defiled dear if mother wanted clock house must sooner have taken for myself than must have happened for family sake miss stanbury when be alone when have read niece three letter again again began to understand something of priscilla honesty began also to perceive that there might have be great difficulty respecting colonel for niece sister in law must fairly be held to be responsible be perhaps plainest characteristic of stanburys that be never wilfully dishonest ignorant prejudiced passionate might be in anger miss stanbury of exeter must be almost malicious niece at nuncombe putney be very like aunt must say most cruel thing most unjust thing when actuated by mistaken consciousness of perfect right on own side of must lie even by silence let error be brought home to of so a to be acknowledged at home error must be assuredly confessed aloud indeed with difference in shade hugh dorothy be of same nature be possessed of sweeter temper than aunt sister be filled with same eager readiness to believe to be right to own to others to be wrong when have be constrained to make such confession to chance of life something probably of inner nature have made dorothy mild obedient whereas in regard to hugh circumstance of life disposition have made obstinate reliant in be to be found same belief in self amounted almost to conceit same warmth of affection same love of justice when miss stanbury have again perused correspondence have come to see dimly how thing have gone at nuncombe putney when conviction came upon mind that priscilla have entertained horror a to coming of colonel equal to have felt when imagination painted to that niece have suffered heart be softened somewhat have declared to dorothy pitch if touched must certainly defile have at first intended to send same opinion couched in very forcible word to correspondent at clock house must not continue to go astray for want of being told that be going astray must be acknowledged too that there be certain amount of ignoble wrath in bosom of miss stanbury because sister in law have taken clock house have never be told have not even condescended to ask dorothy whether house be taken paid for by nephew on behalf of mother whether be paid for by mr trevelyan on behalf of wife in latter case mr stanbury must thought be little more than upper servant keeper a expressed to herself such arrangement appeared to to be quite disgraceful in stanbury yet believed that such must be existing arrangement a must not bring to conceive that hugh stanbury must keep establishment over mother head out of money earned by writing for penny newspaper there must be triumph of democracy in must vanquish altogether have therefore be anxious enough to trample on priscilla upon affair of clock house yet have be unable to ignore nobility of priscilla truth having acknowledged to herself found compelled to acknowledge aloud sat down to think in silence be not till have fortified herself by first draught of beer till have finished first portion of bread cheese that spoke have written to sister time said know that ever wrote line to before in life poor priscilla dorothy did not mean to be severe on aunt in regard to letter have not be written to one letter now have be written dorothy pitied sister whom felt to be in trouble well know about being so poor priscilla will be bound think a well of a of do 'd cut finger off before 'd mean to do wrong said dorothy what doe come to what be good of that be meaning to do right will save for aught know radical may mean to do right mr beales mean to do right perhaps aunt if everybody did best must tush dear be getting beyond depth there be such thing still thank god a spiritual pastor master entrust to do what think right now if aught be known in exeter of miss stanbury be known that if clergyman volunteered to give to unasked uninvited counsel ghostly bodily that clergyman must be sent from presence with wigging must not soon forget thing have be tried more than once wigging have be complete there be more attentive listener in church than miss stanbury must now again appeal to clergyman on knotty point for ordinary authority of spiritual pastor master shewed more of abstract reverence than of practical obedience be sure priscilla doe best can said dorothy going back to old subject ah well yes what want to say about priscilla be be thousand pity be so obstinate so pig headed so certain that can manage everything for better than anybody else can for miss stanbury be striving to say something good of niece found task to be difficult distasteful to have managed for mamma ever so many year since took have hardly ever be in debt said dorothy will do doubt suppose care much for ribbon false hair for herself who priscilla idea of priscilla with false hair dare say not dare say not think 'd spend mother money on thing of kind aunt stanbury know ah very well perhaps come dear be very hard upon very anxious to take sister part what be about have just written to a civil letter a one woman ever wrote to if have chosen must have must have h m m miss stanbury a hesitated for word in to complete sentence revelled in strength of vituperation must have poured upon niece head have chosen to write last letter about colonel osborne in severe strain if have written kindly to be so much obliged to said dorothy truth be priscilla have meant to be right meaning wo go for much when account be taken unless meaning come from proper source poor girl have done a well a have known how believe be be fault more than anybody else accusation be not pleasant to dorothy be too intent just now on priscilla case to defend brother that man never ought to have be there that woman never ought to have be there there can not be doubt about if priscilla be sitting there opposite to must own a much be sure must miss stanbury be quite right if meant to assert that priscilla have owned a much to herself because think so be willing to forgive part in matter to personally have always be rude most uncourteous unlike younger woman to older one aunt suppose be because hate oh aunt stanbury dear suppose be why else must treat in way do believe of that must rather eat honest dry crust than dishonest cake ale must rather starve than pick up crumb be dishonest said dorothy fairly bursting out into tear believe do believe there what more can say clock house indeed what matter what house live in so that can pay rent of honestly rent be paid honestly said dorothy amidst sob be paid doubt dare say woman husband brother see to among oh that boy hugh a used to be must have brought to there be knowing what wo

remembered there must be increased difficulty difficulty might be must be overcome when have told then allowed mind to settle on nora rowley hitherto have known miss rowley only a fashionable girl living with wife of intimate friend of own in london have never be staying in same house with circumstance have never given to opportunity of assuming manner of intimate friend justifying in giving advice authorising to assume that semi paternal tone be by far easiest preliminary to love making when man can tell young lady what ought to read what ought to do whom ought to know nothing can be easier than to assure that of duty first duty be to prefer to world young lady who have consented to receive lesson from teacher will generally be willing to receive special lesson among others stanbury have hitherto have such opportunity in london miss rowley have be fashionable young lady living in mayfair have be well anything fashionable young man nevertheless have seen often have sat by

well have just word about journey to devonshire well in way be about journey to devonshire be along of same job mr trewillian can speak before friend here said trevelyan bozzle have taken great dislike to hugh stanbury regarding barrister with correct instinct a one who be engaged for time in same service with who be rival in service when thus instigated to make a be party of three in delicate most confidential matter to take rival into confidence shook head slowly looked trevelyan hard in face mr stanbury be particular friend said trevelyan know well circumstance of unfortunate affair can say anything before bozzle shook head again 'd rayther not mr trewillian said indeed 'd rayther not be something very particular if take advice said stanbury will not hear be advice mr s

doubt have mr bozzle said stanbury have now if be that must speak before third party mr trewillian be ready ai that be way ashamed have done duty know how to do let counsel be ever so sharp never yet be so 'posed what must stand up hold own colonel mr trewillian got letter from lady morning believe said stanbury sharply very likely not mr s ai in power to say anything about believing not believing mr t lady have wrote letter colonel have received look after thing mr s know way of be business lady have wrote letter colonel why have received trevelyan have become white with rage when bozzle first mentioned continued correspondence between wife colonel osborne never occurred to to doubt correctness of policeman information regarded stanbury assertion of incredulity a being simply of piece with general obstinacy in matter at moment began to regret that have called in assistance of friend that have not left affair altogether in hand of much more satisfactory still more painful agent mr bozzle have again seated for moment two remained silent on chair ai fault mr trewillian continued bozzle if little matter ought never to have be mentioned before third party be of moment said trevelyan in low voice what doe signify who know now believe trevelyan said stanbury very well mr s very well just a like believe only be true be business to find thing out be business find out mr trewillian can do a like about if be right why then be right ai for to say nothing about there be fact lady have wrote letter colonel why have received there ai nothing wrong about post office if be to say what be inside of billydou why then must be proving what did know when came to standing up in court must be able to hold own a for letter lady wrote colonel received will do mr bozzle said trevelyan will call

well for mr s said bozzle lady ai wife can imagine anything more disgraceful than said stanbury nothing nothing nothing answered trevelyan be to keep stirring be on move again suggested bozzle who prudently required to be fortified by instruction before devoted time talent even to so agreeable pursuit a in have be engaged will hear from said trevelyan very well very well wish good day mr trewillian mr s yours most obedient there be one other point mr trewillian what point asked trevelyan angrily if lady be to join colonel will do mr bozzle said trevelyan again jumping up from chair will do so saying opened door bozzle with bow took departure what on earth be to do how be to save said wretched husband appealing to friend stanbury endeavoured with eloquence to prove that latter piece of information from spy must be incorrect if such letter have be written by mr trevelyan to colonel osborne must have be done while stanbury be staying at clock house seemed to to be impossible must hardly explain why must be impossible have written to man before have received when came to nuncombe putney why be even improbable that must have written to again nevertheless stanbury felt sure that have sent no such letter think understand feeling mind said if so such correspondence must be incompatible with previous conduct trevelyan only smiled at pretended to smile must not discus question believed implicitly what bozzle have told in spite of stanbury argument can say nothing further said stanbury dear fellow there be nothing further to be said except will have unfortunate wife removed from decent protection of mother roof with least possible delay feel that owe mr stanbury deepest apology for having sent such inmate to trouble repose nonsense be what feel say that be nonsense if have never sent that wretched blackguard down to fabricate lie at nuncombe putney mother repose must have be all right a be mr trevelyan can remain where be till after christmas there be not least necessity for removing at once only meant to say that arrangement must not be regarded a altogether permanent must go to work now good bye good bye stanbury stanbury paused at door then once more turned round suppose be of use saying anything further wish to understand fully that regard wife a woman much ill used think be punishing too with cruel severity for indiscretion of very slightest kind chapter xxvii mr trevelyan letter to wife trevelyan when be left alone sat for above couple of hour contemplating misery of position endeavouring to teach by thinking what ought to be future conduct never occurred to during thought that must be well that must at once take back wife a matter of duty of welfare for for have taught to believe that have disgraced though feeling of disgrace made so wretched that wished that be dead must allow to make attempt at questioning correctness of conviction though be to be shipwrecked for ever even that seemed to be preferable to supposing that have be wrong nevertheless loved wife dearly in white heat of anger endeavoured to be merciful to when stanbury accused of severity must not condescend to defend told then of great mercy be not a fond of own boy a other father have not allowed to take child because have felt that mother love be more imperious more craving in nature than love of father have that be severe have not resolved to allow comfort unfortunate position self imposed misfortune of position must allow to enjoy have come to without shilling yet bad a treatment of have be be willing to give enough not only to support sister also with comfort severe at least be undeserved accusation have be anything severe foolish might have be in taking wife from home in have be unable to learn discretion of matron too trusting have be too generous certainly not severe of course a said to young man like stanbury must take part of woman with whose sister be in love then turned thought upon bozzle there came over crushing feeling of ignominy shame moral dirt utter degradation a reconsidered dealing with ingenious gentleman be paying rogue to watch step of man whom hated to pry into home secret to read letter to bribe servant to record movement of rival successful rival in wife affection be filthy thing yet what must do gentleman of old own grandfather father must have taken fellow a colonel osborne by throat have caned afterwards must have shot have stood to be shot be changed now be not fault that be changed be willing enough to risk life must opportunity of risking in cause be obtained for be to cudgel colonel osborne must be simply arrested must then be told that have disgraced foully by striking man old enough to be father how be to have avoided employment of such man a bozzle have also employed gentleman friend stanbury be result fact be not altered even stanbury did not attempt to deny that there have be correspondence that there have be visit stanbury be so blind to impropriety pretended such blindness that defended that world agreed in condemning of what use have stanbury be to have wanted fact not advice stanbury have found out fact for bozzle either by fair mean foul did get at truth did not doubt that bozzle be right about letter written only yesterday received on very morning wife who have probably be complaining of wrong to stanbury must have retired from conversation to chamber immediately have written letter to lover with woman a what can be done in day otherwise than by aid of such one a bozzle must not confine wife in dungeon must not save from disgrace of misconduct by rigour of surveillance on own part a wife be managed now day must not forbid to use of post office must not hinder from seeing hypocritical scoundrel who carried on wickedness under false guise of family friendship have given chance to amend conduct if be resolved on disobedience have mean of enforcing obedience fact however be necessary that must know now what must do how must go to work to make understand that must not write even letter without knowing that if did either write to man see must immediately take child from provide for only in such fashion a law must demand from for for own life thought that have determined what must do be impossible that must continue to live in london be ashamed to enter club have hardly friend to whom be not agony to speak who knew knew also of disgrace longer asked to house for day past have eaten alone sat alone walked alone study be impossible to pursuit be open to spent time in thinking of wife of disgrace have brought upon life a knew be unmanly shameful be absolutely necessary for that must in way change must go out of england must travel if only must so dispose of wife that might be safe from possible communication with colonel osborne if must be effected nothing that money must do must be spared for if must not be effected must remain at home crush night before went to bed wrote letter to wife be a follows dear emily have learned beyond shadow of doubt that have corresponded with colonel osborne since have be at nuncombe putney also that have seen there have be done in direct opposition to expressed wish feel compelled to tell that such conduct be disgraceful to disgracing to be quite at loss to understand how can reconcile to so flagrant disobedience of instruction so perverse disregard to opinion of world at large write now for sake of finding fault with be too late for to have hope can do so with good effect a regard credit happiness nevertheless be duty to protect from further shame wish to tell be intention with view in first place warn that keep watch on doing so be very painful to be absolutely necessary can not see colonel osborne write to without knowing pledge word that in case be if correspond with see will at once take boy away from will not allow to remain even with mother who will so misconduct must colonel osborne address letter to desire that will put under envelope addressed to if obey command on head will leave boy with nine month out of year till will be six year old such at least be present idea though will not positively bind to adhere to will allow l per year for own maintenance that of sister be greatly grieved to find from friend mr stanbury that conduct in reference to colonel osborne have be such a to make necessary that must leave mr stanbury house wonder that must be so will immediately seek for future home for when have found one be suitable will have conveyed to must now further explain purpose must beg to remember that be driven to do so by direct disobedience to expressed wish must there be further communication between colonel osborne not only will take child away from will also limit allowance to be made to to bare sustenance in such case will put matter into hand of lawyer will probably feel driven to take step towards freeing from connection will be disgraceful to name for will live abroad during greater part of year london have become to uninhabitable english pleasure be distasteful yours affectionately louis trevelyan when have finished read twice believed that have written if not affectionate at rate considerate letter have bound to pity felt for in reference to injury be being done to thought that offer be making in respect to child money be such a to entitle to wife warmest gratitude hardly recognised force of language used when told that conduct be disgraceful that have disgraced name be quite unable to look at whole question between wife from point of view conceived possible that woman a wife must be told that conduct must be watched that must be threatened with divorce court with effect must upon whole be salutary there be men not bad men men uneducated unintelligent irrational in ordinary matter who seem to be absolutely unfitted by nature to have custody guardianship of others woman in hand of such man can hardly save from endless trouble may be that between one wife event will flow on so evenly that ruling constraint be necessary that even giving of advice be never called for by circumstance of day if man be happily forced to labour daily for living till be weary wife be laden with many ordinary care routine of life may run on without storm for such one if be without work management of wife will be task full of peril lesson may be learned at last may after year come to perceive how much how little of guidance partner of life requires at hand may be taught how guidance must be given in learning of lesson there will be sorrow gnashing of teeth be so now with man loved wife to certain extent still trusted did not believe that must be faithless to after fashion of woman who be faithless altogether be jealous of authority fearful of slight self conscious afraid of world utterly ignorant of nature of woman mind carried letter with in pocket throughout next morning in course of day called upon lady milborough though be obstinately bent on acting in accordance with own view yet be morbidly desirous of discussing grievousness of position with friend went to lady milborough asking for advice desirous simply of being encouraged by to do be resolved to do on own judgment down after to nuncombe putney said lady milborough holding up hand yes have be there have be weak enough to see dear louis take to naples

clenched fist a thought of old friend ignorance of very first law in married man code of law yet when be out in street did not post letter at once thought of throughout whole day trying to prove

mind be true that most ill natured thing have be said at lessboro at nuncombe putney about mr stanbury visitor at clock house that ill natured thing have spread to exeter mr ellison of lessboro ' who be not most good natured woman in world have told mr merton of nuncombe that have be told that colonel visit to lady have be made by express arrangement between colonel mr stanbury mr merton who be very good natured not wisest woman in world have declared that such conduct on part of mr stanbury be quite impossible what doe matter be priscilla mother mr ellison have said be fact mr trevelyan have be sent there to be out of way of colonel colonel immediately come down see at clock house when people be very poor do get driven to do almost anything mr merton not being very wise have conceived to be duty to repeat to priscilla mr ellison not being very good natured have conceived to be hers to repeat to mr machugh at exeter then bozzle coming have become known yes mr machugh policeman in mufti down at nuncombe wonder what friend in close here will think about have always said know that if wanted to keep thing straight at nuncombe must have opened purse string from may be understood that priscilla stanbury desire to go back to old way of living have not be without reason may be imagined that miss stanbury of close did not receive with equanimity report reached of course when discussed matter with martha with dorothy fell back upon own early appreciation of folly of clock house arrangement nevertheless have called mr ellison very bad name when learned from friend mr machugh what report be being spread by lady from lessboro mr ellison yes know mr ellison bitterest tongue in devonshire falsest there be people at lessboro ' who must be well pleased if paid

woman out of be that young man doing if have son of own 'd sooner follow to grave than hear call radical then on sudden there came to close news that mr trevelyan sister be gone on very monday on went priscilla sent note on to sister in special allusion be made to aunt stanbury be doubt written with intention that news must be communicated gone be a be past wishing that have come be best thing must do now who be to pay rent of house now have gone a be point on dorothy be not prepared to trouble at present made answer to question dorothy at time be in state of very great perturbation on own account reader may perhaps remember that have be much startled by proposition have be made to in reference to future life aunt have suggested to that must become mr gibson have not a yet given answer to proposition have indeed found to be quite impossible to speak about at there can be doubt that suggestion have opened out to altogether new view of life up to moment of aunt speech to idea of becoming married woman have never presented to in humility have not occurred to that must be counted a one among candidate for matrimony priscilla have taught to regard indeed have so regarded a born to eat drink a little a might be then to die now when be told that must if pleased become mr gibson be almost lost in whirl of new confused idea since aunt have spoken mr gibson have dropped hint two seemed to to indicate that also must be in secret there have be party with supper at mr crumbie at miss french have be present mr gibson have taken dorothy stanbury out to supper leaving camilla arabella behind in drawing room during quarter of hour afterwards in lady be alone while gentleman be eating drinking camilla arabella continued to wreak vengeance asked question about mr trevelyan suggested that mr gibson might be sent over to put thing right miss stanbury have heard have fallen upon with heavy hand there be good deal expected of mr gibson dear said seems to mr gibson be not inclined to perform be quite indifferent to what mr gibson may be inclined to perform said arabella be sure sha interfere with miss dorothy a be said quite out loud before other lady dorothy be overcome with shame aunt comforted when be again at home law dear what doe matter when be mr gibson will be proud of be then really written in book of fate that dorothy stanbury be to become mr gibson poor dorothy began to feel that be called upon to exercise amount of thought personal decision to have not be accustomed hitherto in thing have done left undone have received instruction must obey have mother priscilla told positively not to go to aunt house must have remained at nuncombe without complaint have aunt since coming given order a to mode of life enjoined for instance additional church attendance desired to perform menial service in house must have obeyed from custom without word when be told that be to marry gibson did seem to to be necessary to do something more than obey did love mr gibson tried hard to teach to think that might learn to love be nice looking man enough with sandy hair head rather bald with thin lip narrow nose who certainly did preach drawling sermon of whom everybody said that be very excellent clergyman have house income exeter have long since decided that be man who must certainly marry be one of men of whom may be said that have possible claim to remain unmarried be fair game unless surrendered to be bagged before long must subject to just loud complaint miss french have be aware of have thought to make sure of among be little hard upon that old maid of close a always called miss stanbury must interfere with when booty be almost won felt to be harder because dorothy stanbury be a thought so poor creature dorothy must have doubt a to accepting mr gibson be idea never occurred to dorothy have doubt when came to think of remembered that have never a yet spoken word to mr gibson beyond such little trifling remark a be made over tea table might learn to love did not think that loved a yet suppose will make difference to mr gibson said miss stanbury to niece on morning after receipt of priscilla note stating that trevelyan have left nuncombe dorothy always blushed when mr gibson name be mentioned blushed now did not at understand aunt allusion know what mean aunt said well know dear what say about mr trevelyan clock house be not very nice if mr gibson be to turn round say that connection be pleasant one must have right to complain faint customary blush on dorothy cheek mr gibson name have produced now covered whole face even up to root of hair if belief bad of mamma be sure aunt stanbury want to see again be very fine dear man have to think of know of course think of why must dare say think of more than do dorothy be fool good husband be to be caught day aunt stanbury want to catch man dorothy be fool must say suppose mr gibson think of least in world psha tell doe a for mamma priscilla never must like anybody for moment who must be ashamed of be most anxious to declare that a far a knew own wish at present entertained partiality for mr gibson feeling must become partiality even if mr gibson be to declare willing to accept mother sister with herself did not dare to say so there be instinct within made almost impossible to to express objection to suitor before suitor have declared to be one must speak out a touching mother sister a to own feeling must express assent dissent must like to have settled soon said miss stanbury in melancholy voice even to dorothy must make reply what did soon mean perhaps in course of year two if must be arranged by end of week must be great comfort to dorothy almost fell off chair be stricken altogether dumb told think that brooke burgess be coming here said be to come day be to be here on monday have seen for more than twelve year now be to be here next week dear dear when think sometimes of hard word have be spoken harder thought have be in people mind

elder nephew will have be not grateful why must be grateful do for special love of want gratitude anybody gratitude look at hugh did love be grateful aunt stanbury be dear then show by being good wife to mr gibson happy wife want to get everything settled while burgess be here if be to have why must keep out of whilst live wonder whether mr gibson must mind coming living here dolly thing be coming so near to that dorothy began to feel that must in truth make up mind let aunt know also how have be made up be sensible enough to perceive that if did not prepare for occasion must find hampered by engagement simply because aunt have presumed that be out of question that must not acquiesce must drift into marriage with mr gibson against will greatest difficulty be fact that aunt clearly have doubt on subject a for herself hitherto feeling did not on side go beyond doubt assuredly must be very good thing for to become mr gibson if only must create for attachment for man at present moment aunt said nothing more about mr gibson having mind much occupied with coming of mr brooke burgess remember twenty year ago more a nice boy a must wish to see father be fourth of brother dear dear

right hand there be room for seat only room for civil gentleman to take away full cup bring back empty dorothy be not sufficiently ready witted to see danger of position till mr gibson have seated in chair then did seem cruel to that must be thus besieged for rest of evening a have be also at dinner while tea be being consumed mr gibson assisted at service asking lady whether must have cake bread butter when be over dorothy be still in prison mr gibson be still jailer at gate soon perceived that everybody else be chatting laughing that brooke burgess be centre of little circle have formed quite at distance from seat once twice thrice meditated escape have not courage to make attempt did not know how to manage be conscious that aunt eye be upon that aunt must expect to listen to mr gibson at last gave up hope of moving be anxious simply that mr gibson must confine to dirt of path noble prospect from haldon hill think will have more rain before be done with said twice before

be anything so gay before since have be in exeter now be hemmed up in corner away from by mr gibson mr burgess seems to be different from other burgess said mr gibson think must be very clever said dorothy well yes in sort of way what people call merry andrew like people who make laugh laugh said dorothy quite agree with that laughter be very good thing in place be not at one of who must make world altogether grave there be serious thing there must be serious moment of course said dorothy think that serious conversation upon whole have more allurement than conversation when come to examine be found to mean nothing suppose everybody must mean something when talk just so that be exactly idea said mr gibson on such subject a must be so sorry if did not agree really must then paused dorothy be so confounded by what conceived to be danger of coming moment that be unable even to think what ought to say heard be clear sharp merry voice heard aunt tone of pretended anger heard sir peter continued laughter brooke burgess a continued telling of story own trouble be too great to allow of attending to what be going on at other end of room there be nothing a to be so anxious a that must agree about serious thing said mr gibson suppose do agree about going to church said dorothy knew that must have made speech more stupid more senseless more inefficacious what be to say in answer to assurance hope so said mr gibson think so aunt be most excellent woman opinion have very great weight with on subject even a to matter of church discipline doctrine in a clergyman be of course presumed to be more at home aunt be woman among thousand of course think be very good be so right about young man property think so quite right mr gibson because know to of course being near relative one have singled out a recipient of kindness might have be cause for discontent discontent to mr gibson be quite sure feeling be what ought to be for if ever be be to say supposing must be in way interested perhaps be premature to make suggestion on head at present at understand what mean mr gibson thought that perhaps might take opportunity of expressing after levity of moment be hardly in accordance with sentiment must wish to express think ought to go to aunt now mr gibson a perhaps might want something then did push back chair stand upon leg mr gibson after pausing for moment allowed

in making chimney of going about smelling so that one can bear to come near brooke merely laughed at went way smoked pipe out in close while martha sat up to let in when have finished then dorothy escaped at once to room fearful of being questioned by aunt about mr gibson have thought now quite made up mind there be nothing in mr gibson that liked be by mean so sure a have be when be talking to sister that must prefer clergyman to one else have formed no strong idea on subject of love making did think that man who really cared for must find other way of expressing love than mr gibson have adopted then mr gibson have spoken to about aunt money in way be distasteful to thought that be quite sure that if must ask must not accept be nearly undressed nearly safe for night when there came knock at door aunt entered room have come in said miss stanbury suppose have have pipe then wish did smoke do wish did smoke suppose old woman like be only making fool to care about such thing if do ca prevent seems to be very nice young man in other thing doe not dolly very nice indeed aunt stanbury have done very well in office a for saying that must smoke like great deal better than doing on sly think mr burgess must do anything on sly aunt think must dear be not at like what fancied everybody seemed to like very much did never saw sir peter so much taken there be quite flirtation between mr machugh now dear tell about mr gibson there be nothing to tell aunt stanbury be there from what saw going on thought there must be something to tell be talking to whole evening a happened be

told have not told must begin by telling know then must pray that will think about again have imagined what great thing for must be to be established for life so that must never have more trouble again about home about money anything answer now dorothy think of seemed to that be doing such excellent thing for of so saying miss stanbury left room dorothy be enabled to obey at rate in one matter

also be full of anxiety for hour after hour must not sleep a remembered fruitlessness of effort on behalf of nephew niece have never occurred to when have first proposed to herself that dorothy must become mr gibson dorothy must have objection to step in life fear have be that dorothy must have become over radiant with triumph at idea of having husband going to husband with fortune of own that mr gibson might hesitate have thought very likely be thus in general that woman regard feeling desire aspiration of other woman will hardly ever meet elderly lady who will not speak of junior a living in state of breathless anxiety to catch husband elder lady will speak of younger a though kind of choice in such catching be quite disregarded man must be gentleman at least gentlemanlike there must be bread let thing be given what girl wo jump into what man arm female reader be not thus that elder of sex speak of younger when old mr stanbury heard nora rowley have refused mr glascock thing be to unintelligible be now quite unintelligible to miss stanbury that dorothy must prefer single life to matrimony with mr gibson must be acknowledged on aunt stanbury behalf that dorothy be one of yielding hesitating submissive young woman trusting others doubting ever of a to whom be natural that stronger friend must find expedient to decide for miss stanbury be almost justified in thinking that unless be to find husband for niece niece must never find one for herself dorothy must drift into being old maid like priscilla simply because must never assert never put best foot foremost aunt stanbury have therefore taken upon to put out foot having carefully found that mr gibson be willing have conceived that difficulty be over must be enabled to do duty by niece establish comfortably in life at rate one of brother child now dorothy be taking upon herself to say that did not like gentleman such conduct be almost equal to writing for penny newspaper on following morning after breakfast when brooke burgess be gone out to call upon uncle insisted upon doing openly not under rose in spite of miss stanbury great gravity on occasion there be very serious conversation poor dorothy have found to be almost silenced did argue for time argument seemed even to herself to amount to so little why must love mr gibson be question found impossible to answer though did not actually yield though did not say that must accept man still when be told that three day be to be allowed to for consideration that then offer must be made to in form felt that a regarded anti gibson interest have

all be settled for in way then aunt stanbury be so clever at settling thing sat next to almost evening yesterday did say anything about except that hoped agreed with about going to church suppose do be quite sure that if be to be clergyman wife must endeavour to do husband thought right about religion one ought to try to do so even if clergyman be not one husband mr burgess have come be so very amusing evening perhaps be reason mr gibson said so little mr burgess be very nice man think aunt stanbury be more fond of than of anybody be not at sort of person expected if mr gibson doe come on

written before early dinner so priscilla went into garden sat down under old cedar that might discus matter with in bearing felt that woman must be called upon to write letter must be of more importance whole welfare in life of person who be dearest to must probably depend upon weight upon be so great that thought for while must take counsel with mother felt sure that mother must recommend marriage that if afterwards must find bound to oppose then mother must be miserable woman there must be no use to in taking counsel with mother because mother mind be known to beforehand responsibility be thrown upon alone must bear tried hard to persuade to write at once tell sister to marry man knew sister heart so well a to be sure that dorothy must learn to love man who be husband be almost impossible that dorothy must not love with whom lived then sister be so well adapted to be wife mother temper be so sweet be so pure so unselfish so devoted so healthy withal be so happy

affair a question a to whether must must not give in marriage to suitor who must not speak of even to own sister without blush who felt confused almost confounded when receiving aunt admonition instigation on subject must not have endured to hear brooke burgess speak on matter dorothy did feel that person easier to know than brooke have never come in way have already said a much to a have spoken to mr gibson in three month that have made acquaintance have talked about exeter about mr machugh cathedral tennyson poem london theatre uncle barty family quarrel have become quite confidential with other on matter on heavy subject of mr gibson proposal of marriage not word have be said when brooke once mentioned gibson on thursday morning dorothy within minute have taken opportunity of escaping from room circumstance did give opportunity of speaking to mr gibson on wednesday afternoon mr gibson be invited to drink tea at mr french house on evening such invitation at exeter be wont to be given at short date gentleman have said that must go then arabella french have called in close have asked miss stanbury dorothy be well understood by arabella that miss stanbury must not drink tea at heavitree may be that dorothy company be not in truth desired lady declined stay at home for dear miss stanbury said to niece dorothy have not be out without aunt since have be at exeter understood perfectly that must not be wise to commence practice at house of french mr brooke be coming miss stanbury mr gibson miss french said miss stanbury have thought that there be triumph in tone mr brooke can go where plea dear miss stanbury replied a for mr gibson be not keeper tone in miss stanbury spoke must have implied great imprudence have not two lady understood other so thoroughly have not known that be so there be accustomed set of people in mr french drawing room crumbies wright apjohns mr machugh came also knowing that there must be rubber naked shoulder hurt mr machugh said when friend almost scolded for going to house be not young man care what do to might say a much if went naked altogether miss stanbury have replied in anger if nobody else complained must said mr machugh mr machugh got rubber a have gone for rubber on distinct promise that there must be rubber a there be rubber felt that have right to say ill natured thing what doe matter to said mr machugh how nasty be be not going to be wife ugh exclaimed miss stanbury shaking head in anger disgust camilla french be by mean so bad a be painted by miss stanbury brooke burgess rather liked than otherwise seemed to that mr gibson did not at dislike arabella felt repugnance at lady noddle shoulder now that be removed from miss stanbury influence be clear enough also that arabella have not given up attempt although must have admitted to herself that claim of dorothy stanbury be very strong on evening seemed to have be specially permitted to arabella who be elder sister to take into own hand management of case beholder of game have hitherto declared that mr gibson safety be secured by constant coupling of sister must allow other to hunt alone common sense of common danger have made special strategy necessary camilla hardly spoke word to mr gibson during evening let hope that found temporary consolation in presence of stranger hope be going to stay with ever so long mr burgess said camilla month be ever so long be why mean to see devonshire within time feel already that know exeter thoroughly everybody in be sure be very much flattered a for miss french have heard so much about life felt that knew before came here who can have spoken to about forget how many relative have in city do think uncle barty never writes to not about doe not do suppose hear from miss stanbury hate know do hate indeed have greatest respect for be little odd be now mr burgess like ever so much have known ever so long six seven year since be quite young thing have such queer notion about girl what sort of notion 'd like to dress just like think that must never talk to young men if be here 'd say be flirting with because be sitting together be not be of course be not wish must said brooke must know how to begin must indeed know what flirting mean know who doe know when young lady gentleman go out suppose be intended to talk to other very often know call stupid said camilla yet when do old maid say that girl be flirting will tell one thing mr burgess care what old maid say about always talk to people that like if choose to call flirt may be opinion that still water run deepest doubt noisy stream be very willow said brooke may call willow stream if like mr burgess meant nothing of kind what do call dorothy stanbury be what call still water run deep enough quietest young lady ever saw in life exactly so quiet so clever what do think of mr gibson everybody be asking what think of mr gibson know what say say be to marry dorothy stanbury poor man think own consent have ever be asked yet nevertheless be settled just at present seems to to be what will say ought to say flirting with sister ought miss stanbury must say so if be here doubt fact be mr burgess have known almost since be infant of course take interest in welfare there have never be anything more than arabella be nothing more to than be once indeed however doe not signify must be nothing to if really liked dorothy stanbury a far a can see do see good deal of there be such feeling on part of course have asked must not think of thing mr gibson may do just a like for be not quite sure that dorothy stanbury be just girl must make good wife of course when have known person seven eight year do get anxious about happiness do know think perhaps little sly in meantime mr gibson be completely subject to individual charm of arabella camilla have be quite correct in part of description of intimacy sister have known mr gibson for seven eight year nevertheless intimacy must not with truth be said to have commenced during infancy of young lady even if word be used in legal sense seven eight year however be long acquaintance there be perhaps something of real grievance in stanbury intervention if be recognised fact in society that young lady be in want of husband that effort on part towards matrimony be not altogether impossible must be recognised also failure will be disagreeable interference regarded with animosity miss stanbury elder be undoubtedly interfering between mr gibson french be manly womanly to submit to interference with one dearest prospect may perhaps be admitted that miss french have shown too much open ardour in pursuit of mr gibson perhaps there must have be ardour pursuit may be that theory of womanhood be right forbids to woman such attempt teach that must ever be pursued never pursuer a to that there will be discourse at present must be granted that whenever pursuit have be attempted be not in human nature to abandon without effort that french girl must be very angry with miss stanbury that must put head together with intention of thwarting that must think evil thing of poor dorothy that must half despise mr gibson yet resolve to keep hold upon a chattel thing of value be almost own be not perhaps much to discredit be good deal at house in close now said arabella in lowest voice in voice so low that be almost melancholy well yes miss stanbury know have always be staunch friend of mine take interest in little church people say that girl be sly men can be sly too sometimes seems that have taken so much away from mr gibson know why must say that miss french perhaps be wrong one be apt to be sensitive about one friend seem to have known so well there be nobody else in exeter mamma regard a doe of course if be happy with miss stanbury be everything be speaking of old lady said mr gibson who in spite of slyness be here thrown little off guard be speaking of old lady too said arabella of whom else must be speaking of course not of course continued arabella hear what people say about niece one can not help what one hears know mr gibson believe that can assure a said looked into face a though waiting for answer mr gibson have answer ready then arabella told that if anything be to be done must be done at once what use be there in beating round bush when only chance of getting game be to be have by dashing at once into thicket own must be glad said turning eye away from if must hear from own mouth that be not true mr gibson position be one not to be envied be willing to tell very secret of soul to miss french with utmost candour must not answer question one way other be not willing to tell of secret be certainly fact too that there have be tender passage between arabella now when there have be such passage gentleman be cross examined by lady a mr gibson be being cross examined at present moment gentleman usually teach to think that little falsehood be permissible gentleman can hardly tell lady that have become tired of have changed mind feel matter perhaps more keenly even than doe though at other time may be very paladin in cause of truth in such strait a doe allow latitude be only joking of course said indeed be not joking can assure mr gibson that welfare of friend whom really love can never be matter of joke to mr crumbie say that positively be engaged to marry dorothy stanbury what doe mr crumbie know about dare say nothing be not so be certainly not there be nothing in be there wonder why people make report said mr gibson prevaricating illustration wonder why people make report be fabrication from beginning to end then said arabella pressing matter quite home at time be very close to though word be severe glance from eye be soft scent from hair be not objectionable to a must have be to miss stanbury mode of head dress be not displeasing to fold of dress a fell across knee be welcome to feeling knew that be a one under temptation be not strong enough to bid tempter avaunt say that be so mr gibson of course be not so said mr gibson lying be so glad for of course mr gibson when heard thought great deal about man happiness depends so much on whom marries doe clergyman more than anybody else did think be quite sort of woman that must like see have have advantage poor thing have be shut up in little country cottage life just labourer hovel no more though be fault of course pitied be so glad when miss stanbury brought to close still know though one be very glad of a acquaintance yet know a wife for such dear dear friend went on said many other thing with equal enthusiasm then wiped eye then smiled laughed after that declared that be quite happy so happy so left poor man after falsehood have be extracted from said nothing more sat in patience listening to rapture enthusiasm of friend knew that have disgraced knew also that disgrace must be known if dorothy stanbury must accept offer on morrow yet how hardly have be used what answer must have given compatible with truth with own personal dignity about hour afterwards be walking back to exeter with brooke burgess then brooke did ask question two nice girl french think said brooke very nice said mr gibson how miss stanbury doe hate say brooke not hate hope said mr gibson doe love doe well a for love yes in one sense hope doe miss stanbury know be woman who express strongly what must say if be told that be going to marry two girl be favourite know dear what very odd supposition said mr gibson for part think will said brooke suppose will either said mr gibson with gravity be intended to convey smattering of rebuke fellow might do worse know said brooke for part rather like girl with chignon sort of get up worst of be one ca marry two at time must be bigamy said mr gibson just so said brooke chapter xxxvi miss stanbury wrath punctually at eleven o'clock on friday morning mr gibson knocked at door of house in close reader must not imagine that have ever wavered in intention with regard to dorothy stanbury because have be driven into corner by pertinacious ingenuity of miss french never for moment thought of being false to miss stanbury elder falseness of nature must have be ruinous to must have made marked man in city day must probably have reached even to bishop ear be neither bad enough audacious enough foolish enough for such perjury a moreover though wile of arabella

at time mr fell grand project of carrying line of rail over top of mountain be only in preparation journey from st michael to susa be still made by diligence dear old continental coach be now nearly a extinct a own did not deserve death so fully a did abominable vehicle coupe of diligence better still banquette be luxurious mode of travelling a compared with anything that coach offered there used indeed to be certain halo of glory round occupant of box of mail coach man who have secured that seat be supposed to know something about world to be such one passenger sitting behind must be proud to be allowed to talk to prestige of position be greater than comfort night on box of mail coach be bad time night inside mail coach be night in purgatory whereas seat up above on banquette of diligence passing over alp with room for foot support for back with plenty of rug plenty of tobacco used to be on mont cenis still be on other mountain pass very comfortable mode of seeing mountain route for desirous of occupying coupe three front seat of body of vehicle must be admitted that difficulty frequently arose that such difficulty be very common at st michael there must be two three of enormous vehicle preparing to start for mountain whereas must appear that twelve fifteen passenger have come down from paris armed with ticket assuring that preferable mode of travelling must be theirs then assertion must be made somewhat recklessly by official to effect that diligence be coupe must generally be case that middle aged englishman who must not speak french must go to wall together with wife middle aged englishman with wife who ca speak french can nevertheless be very angry threaten loudly when suppose to be ill treated middle aged englishman though ca speak word of french wo believe french official who tell that diligence be coupe when find with unfortunate partner in roundabout place behind with two priest dirty man who look like brigand sick maid servant three agricultural labourer attempt however be frequently made thus there used to be occasionally little noise round bureau at st michael on morning of be speaking two englishman have just made good claim independently of other without having heard seen other when two american lady coming up very tardily endeavoured to prove right lady be without other companion be not fluent with french be clearly entitled to seat be told that conveyance be coupe perversely must not believe statement official shrugged shoulder signified that ultimatum have be pronounced what can official do in such circumstance when more coupe passenger be sent to than coupe at command will hold have paid for coupe said elder american lady with considerable indignation though french be imperfect for american lady understand right bah yes have paid will go what must have must have what have paid for said american lady then official rose from stool shrugged shoulder again made motion with hand intended to shew that thing be finished be robbery said elder american lady to younger must not mind only be so unwell will not kill dare say said younger then one of english gentleman declared that place be very much at service of invalid

toilet a must make there grumbled furiously must take post horse over mountain not from love of solitary grandeur in order that might make company pay for iniquity be soon apparent to that have ground of complaint a everybody be very civil a seat in banquette over head of american lady be provided for a man from bureau came apologised consented to be pacified ended of course by tipping dozen of servant about yard mr glascock have man of own with who be very nearly being put on to same seat with master a extra civility inconvenience be at last avoided having settled little difficulty went into breakfast in buffet there must be no better breakfast than used to be given in buffet at railway terminus at st michael company might occasionally be led into error about question of coupe seat in reference to provision set example might be of great use to here in england be probably case breakfast for traveller be not so frequently needed here a be on continent still there be often to be found crowd of people ready to eat if only wherewithal be there be often told in newspaper that england be disgraced by by by unreadiness of army by unfitness of navy by irrationality of law by immobility of prejudice what not real disgrace of england be railway sandwich whited sepulchre fair enough outside so meagre poor spiritless within thing of shred paring such dab of food telling that poor bone whence be scraped have be made utterly bare before be sent into kitchen for soup pot in france one doe get food at railway station at st michael breakfast be unexceptional two friend seated near to american lady be of course thanked for politeness american woman be taught by habit of country to think that men must give way to more absolutely than be in accordance with practice of life in europe seat in public conveyance in state when merely occupied by man used to be regarded by woman a being at service a completely a though be vacant one woman indicating place to must point with equal freedom to man space be said that be little altered now that european view on subject be spreading two lady however who be pretty clever looking attractive even after night journey be manifestly more impressed with villainy of french official than be with kindness of english neighbour nothing can be done to punish said younger of to mr glascock nothing must think said nothing will at rate will not get back money said elder who though elder be probably not much above twenty well time be money say must take thrice value of time in money then one must probably fail have done very well for suppose there be difficulty must have taken place in country said younger lady same be very much obliged to must not have be nice for to have to go up into banquette must have put into interior must have be worse hate being put anywhere a if be sheep seems so odd to that here must be so tame do mean english french world in general on side of atlantic mean european said younger lady who be better after breakfast then think that french have something of compensation in manner way of life climate beauty of city general management of thing be very great in many way doubt said mr glascock do understand living better than do said elder everything be so much brighter with said younger contrive to give grace to day existence said elder there be such welcome among for stranger said younger particularly in reference to place taken in coupe said trevelyan who have hardly spoken before ah be affair of honesty said elder if want honesty believe must go back to star stripe mr glascock looked up from plate almost aghast said nothing however called for waiter paid for breakfast nevertheless there be considerable amount of travelling friendship engendered between lady two friend before diligence have left railway yard be two miss spaldings going on to florence at place have uncle who be minister from state to kingdom of italy be not at unwilling to receive such little civility a gentleman can give to lady when travelling whole party intended to sleep at turin night be altogether on good term with other when started on journey from st michael clever woman said mr glascock a soon a have arranged leg arm in banquette yes indeed american woman always be clever be almost always pretty like said trevelyan who in day be in mood to like nothing be exigeant then be so hard want weakness that woman ought to have come from what must call insular prejudice be accustomed to le self assertion on part of woman than be customary with prefer woman to rule by seeming to yield in state a take woman never yield men have to fight own battle with other tactic know what tactic be keep distance men live much by a though knew must not have chance in presence of wife daughter nevertheless manage thing badly very rarely hear of american being separated from wife word be sooner out of mouth than mr glascock knew remembered felt what have said there be occasion in man sin so deeply against fitness circumstance of hour that becomes impossible for to slur over sin a though have not be committed there be certain little peccadillo in society one can manage to throw behind one perhaps with difficulty awkwardness still be put aside conversation go on though with hitch there be graver offence gravity of strike offender so seriously that becomes impossible for to seem even to ignore own iniquity ash must be eaten publicly sackcloth worn before eye of men be so now with poor mr glascock thought about for moment whether be possible that must continue remark about american lady without betraying own consciousness of thing that have done found that be quite impossible knew that be red up to hair hot that blood tingled blush indeed must not be seen in seclusion of banquette must not overcome heat tingling there be silence for about three minute then felt that must be best for to confess own fault trevelyan said be very sorry for allusion that made ought to have be le awkward beg pardon doe not matter said trevelyan of course know that everybody be talking of behind back be not to expect that people will be silent because be unhappy nevertheless beg pardon said other there be little further conversation between till reached lanslebourg at foot of mountain at place occupied with getting coffee for two american lady miss spaldings took coffee almost with a much grace a though have be handed to by frenchman indeed be very gracious a be nature of american lady in spite of hardness of trevelyan have complained assume intimacy readily with appearance of impropriety be at ease easily when therefore be handed out of carriage by mr glascock bystander at lanslebourg might have thought that whole party have be travelling together from new york what must have done if have taken pity on said elder lady think must have climbed up into high place look at crowd have come out of interior man have advantage after be quite in dark a to what be said mr glascock can give up place to lady can climb up into banquette can be member of congress said younger 'd sooner be senator from massachusetts than be queen of england so must said mr glascock be glad can agree about one thing two gentleman agreed to walk up mountain together with trouble induced conductor to permit to do so why conductor of diligence must object to such relief to horse ordinary englishman can hardly understand in truth feel so deeply responsibility attache to shepherding of sheep that be always fearing lest poor lamb must go astray on mountain side though road be broad very plainly marked conductor never feel secure that passenger will find way safely to summit like to know that of flock be in right place disapproves altogether of erratic spirit mr glascock at last prevailed two men started together up mountain when permission have be once obtained walker may be sure that guide shepherd will not desert of course know said trevelyan when third twist up mountain have be overcome that people talk about wife be part of punishment for mistake one make be sad affair altogether saddest in world lady milborough have doubt spoken to about well yes have how must help be not such fool a to suppose that people be to hold tongue about more than do about others intimate a be with of course have spoken to be in hope that something might have be done by time nothing have be done sometimes think will put end to myself make so wretched then why agree to forget forgive have done with be so easily said so easily said after walked on in silence for considerable distance mr glascock be not anxious to talk about trevelyan wife did wish to ask question two about mr trevelyan sister if only must be done without telling too much of own secret there be nothing

destitute of honest subterfuge subterfuge honest in such position of dozen must have be at once at command of woman with one of sufficient for moment most men must have be able to arm indeed yes said

proper shepherd carried down to susa at pace must give english coachman concussion of brain why passenger for turin who reach susa dusty tired sleepy must be detained at place for hour half instead of being forwarded to bed in great city be never made very apparent travelling official on continent of europe be very slow in manipulation of luggage a be equally correct will find excuse for tardiness in latter quality hour half however be necessity be very grievous on occasion two miss spaldings ate supper two gentleman waited on lady have learned to regard at rate mr glascock a own property received service graciously indeed quite a matter of course when be sent from peculiar corner of big dirty refreshment room to supper table to fetch apple then desired to change because one have brought be spotted rather liked when sat down with knee near to theirs actually trying to eat large italian apple simply because have eaten one discussed with passage over mont cenis began to think that susa be after place in hour half might be whiled away without much cause for complaint only stay one night at turin said caroline spalding elder will have to start at ten to get through to

town be very cold in cold weather very hot in hot weather now that have be robbed of life a capital be a dull uninteresting a though be german english there be armoury river po good hotel what be thing to man who be forced to live alone in place for four day perhaps week trevelyan be bound to remain at turin till must hear from bozzle one bozzle knew address must hing till bozzle must have communicated to tidings of what be being done at st diddulph there be perhaps great social question so imperfectly understood among at present day a refers to line divide sanity from insanity that man be sane that other unfortunately mad do know well enough know also that one man may be subject to various hallucination may fancy to be teapot what not yet be in such condition of mind a to call for intervention either on behalf of friend of law while may be in possession of intellectual faculty capable of lucid exertion for highest purpose yet be so mad that bodily restraint upon be indispensable know that sane man be responsible for what doe that insane man be irresponsible know only guess wildly at state of mind of who now again act like madman though court council of expert have declared to be mad bias of public mind be to press heavily on such men till law attempt to touch a though be thoroughly responsible then when law interferes to screen a though be altogether irresponsible same juryman who must find man mad who have murdered young woman must in private life express desire that same young man must be hung crucified skinned alive if have moodily without reason broken faith to young woman in lieu of killing now trevelyan be in truth mad on subject of wife alleged infidelity have abandoned everything that valued in world have made wretched in affair of life because must not submit to acknowledge to possibility of error on own part for in truth be condition of mind have never hitherto believed that have be false to vow have sinned against irredeemably have thought that in regard for man have slighted so thinking have subjected to severity of rebuke high spirited woman must have borne wife have not tried to bear in indignation have not striven to cure evil then have come resolution that must submit part from having so resolved nothing must shake though friend possessed be now against including even lady milborough be certain that be right have not wife sworn to obey be not whole conduct one tissue of disobedience must not man who submitted to find driven to submit to thing worse let own fault let submit then must come back to have not considered when resolution to effect be first forming that separation between man wife once effected can not be annulled a be cured so a to leave cicatrice behind gradually a spent day after day in thinking on one subject came to feel that even be wife to submit to own fault humbly to come back to very coming back must in be new wound must go out again with wife on arm to house of who knew that have repudiated because of friendship with man must open again house in curzon street let thing go on quietly a have gone before told that be impossible that be ineffably disgraced that if reunited must live buried out of sight in remote distance told also that must never be with again night day without thinking of separation happiness have be shipwrecked then have put into hand of mr bozzle mr bozzle have taught that woman very often do go astray mr bozzle idea of female virtue be not high have opportunity of implanting idea on client mind trevelyan hated man be filled with disgust by bozzle word be made miserable by bozzle presence yet came gradually to believe in bozzle bozzle alone believed in there be none bozzle who did not bid to submit to disobedient wife then a came to believe in bozzle grew to be more more assured that one bozzle must tell fact chivalry love sense of woman honour with something of manly pride on own part so told have taught to believe to be impossible that wife must have sinned bozzle who knew world thought otherwise bozzle who have interest in matter one way other must find out fact what if chivalry love manly pride have deceived there be woman who sinned then prayed that wife might not be such woman got up from prayer almost convinced that be sinner mind be at work upon always must be that be so base a so vile thing so abject such dirt pollution filth there be such case nay be not almost numberless found reading in paper record of such thing from day to day thought that in doing so be simply acquiring experience necessary for if be so have indeed done well to separate from thing so infamous if be not so how must be that man have gone to in devonshire have received from wife hand short note addressed to man in man be desired by not to go to to write to again because of husband command have shown to bozzle bozzle have smiled be just sort of thing doe bozzle have said then writes by post have consulted bozzle a to sending on of letter bozzle have be strongly of opinion that must be forwarded copy having be duly taken attested by might be very pretty evidence by by if letter be not forwarded bozzle thought that omission to do so might be given in evidence against employer bozzle be very careful full of evidence letter therefore be sent on to colonel osborne if there be billy dous going between will nobble 'em said bozzle trevelyan tore hair in despair believed that there must be billy dous came to believe everything though prayed fervently that wife might not be led astray that might be saved at rate from utter vice yet almost came to hope that might be otherwise not indeed with hope of sane man who desire that tell to be for advantage with hope of insane man who love to feed grievance even though grief must be death who understand that man may be brought to hope that of thing be most grievous to have not observed with sufficient closeness perversity of human mind trevelyan must have given that have to save wife must even now have cut tongue out before must have expressed to anyone save to bozzle suspicion that must in truth have be guilty be continually telling that further life must be impossible to if child of theirs must be thus disgraced yet expected believed after fashion almost hoped be to wait at turin till tidings must come from bozzle after that must go on to venice must not move from turin till must have received first communication from england when have be three day at turin came to among other letter in bozzle packet there be letter addressed in wife handwriting letter be simply directed to bozzle house in what possible way must wife have found out ought of dealing with bozzle where bozzle lived must have learned that letter intended for must be sent to man own residence before however inspect content of mr bozzle dispatch will go back see how mr trevelyan have discovered manner of forwarding letter to husband matter of address be indeed very simple letter for trevelyan be to be redirected from house in curzon street from chamber in lincoln inn to acrobat club to porter of acrobat club have be confided secret not of bozzle name of bozzle private address stony walk union street borough thus letter reaching acrobat be duly sent to mr bozzle house may be remembered that hugh stanbury on occasion of last visit to parsonage of st diddulph be informed that mr trevelyan have letter from father for husband that knew not whither to send may well be have matter assumed other interest in stanbury eye than given to by mr trevelyan very moderate anxiety to have letter forwarded must have thought nothing about having resolved a sat upon knife board of omnibus reader will at rate remember resolution made on top of omnibus while hugh be smoking pipe having resolved that deed must be done at st diddulph resolved also that must be done at once must not allow heat of purpose to be cooled by delay must go to st diddulph at once with heart in hand might thought be a well that must have excuse for visit so called upon porter at acrobat be successful in learning mr trevelyan address stony walk union street borough said to wondering then occurred to that bozzle bozzle only among trevelyan friend must live at stony walk in borough thus armed set out for st diddulph a one of effect of visit to east sir marmaduke note be forwarded to louis trevelyan at turin chapter xxxix miss nora rowley be maltreated hugh stanbury when reached parsonage found difficulty in making way into joint presence of mr outhouse mr trevelyan nora be recognised by st diddulph party a one who have come over to side a friend of trevelyan who have found constrained to condemn friend in spite of friendship be consequently very welcome there be difficulty about giving address lady wondered how came to pas mr trevelyan letter must be sent to locality hugh expressed surprise also thought discreet to withhold suspicion about mr bozzle simply expressed conviction that letter sent in accordance with direction given by club porter must reach destination then boy be brought down be very confidential very unhappy together mr trevelyan must see end to cruelty of position declared that father anger against husband be so great that anticipated coming with almost more of fear than of hope mr outhouse expressed opinion that mr trevelyan must surely be mad nora suggested that possibility of such perversity on part of man made almost unwise in woman to trust to power of husband there be not many like thank god said mr outhouse bridling in wrath thus be very friendly together hugh be allowed to feel that stood upon comfortable term in parsonage did not a yet see how be to carry out project for present day at last mr trevelyan went away with child hugh felt that ought to go stayed courageously thought must perceive that nora suspected cause of assiduity be quite evident that mr outhouse did not do so mr outhouse having reconciled to young man be by mean averse to presence went on talking about wickedness of trevelyan brother anger fate of little boy till at last little boy mother came back into room then mr outhouse went must excuse for few minute said if only must have gone few minute sooner how well absence might have be excused nora understood now though became almost breathless be not surprised when hugh got up from chair asked sister to go away mr trevelyan said want to speak few word to sister hope will give opportunity nora exclaimed mr trevelyan know nothing about said hugh be to go said mr trevelyan to

locked up be what ought be hard became harder when gentleman whom mr outhouse certainly did not wish to see called upon about latter end of september mr outhouse be sitting alone in gloomy parlour of parsonage for own study have be given up to other thing since great inroad have be made upon family be sitting alone on one saturday morning preparing for duty of next day with various manuscript sermon lying on table around when be told that gentleman have called to see have mr outhouse be incumbent at west end of london have maid be west end servant in probability gentleman name must have be demanded mr outhouse be man who be not very ready in foreseeing preventing misfortune girl who opened door be not trained to discreet usage in such matter a announced fact that there be gentleman pointed to door to show that gentleman be there before mr outhouse have be able to think whether must be prudent for to make preliminary inquiry colonel osborne be in room now a happened two men have never hitherto met other though one be brother in law of sir marmaduke rowley other have be very old friend name mr outhouse be colonel osborne said visitor coming forward with hand out clergyman of course took hand asked to be seated have known other name very long continued colonel though think have ever yet have opportunity of becoming acquainted illustration at st diddulph said mr outhouse have never be acquainted believe might have added that have desire to make such acquaintance manner over have control did almost say a much indeed coming to house of suspected lover of niece appeared to to be heavy addition to trouble for although be disposed to take niece part against husband to possible length even to locking up of husband a madman if be possible nevertheless have almost a great horror of colonel a though husband allegation a to lover have be true a gospel because trevelyan have be wrong altogether colonel osborne be not le wrong because trevelyan suspicion be to mr outhouse wicked groundless did not le regard presumed lover to be iniquitous roaring lion going about seeking whom might devour elderly unmarried men of fashion generally especially colonel major member of parliament such like be to a black sheep roaring lion be fruges consumere nati men who stood on club doorstep talking naughtily doing nothing wearing sleek clothing for very often did not pay never going to church seemed to in ignorance that such men have none of burden of world upon shoulder therefore stood in great peril of burden of next be doubtless special duty to deal with men in such peril wicked one with whom be concerned be whom must reach now colonel osborne of earth be not to be got at by clergyman a far a mr outhouse must see by mean of grace that story of rich man camel seemed to to be specially applicable to such people how be such one a colonel osborne to be shewn way through eye of needle to mr outhouse own brother in law sir marmaduke be almost of same class for frequented club when in london played whist talked of thing of world such a derby levee west end dinner party a though be in to to be sure be weighted with so large family that there might be hope for eye of needle must not be closed against a rich man savoured of west end be worldly consorted with such men a colonel osborne when colonel osborne introduced to mr outhouse be almost a though apollyon have made way into parsonage of st diddulph mr outhouse said colonel have thought best to come to very moment that got back to town from scotland mr outhouse bowed be bethinking slowly what manner of speech must adopt leave town again to morrow for dorsetshire be going down to friend brambers for partridge shooting mr outhouse knitted thick brow in further inward condemnation partridge shooting yes be september partridge shooting must be probable care occupation of such man at time man without duty in world perhaps added to there be feeling whereas colonel osborne must shoot scotch grouse in august dorsetshire partridge in september go about throughout whole year like roaring lion mr outhouse be forced to remain at st diddulph in east from january to december with exception of one small parson week spent at margate for benefit of wife health if there be such thought rather such feeling who will say that be not natural must not go through london without seeing continued colonel be most frightful infatuation of trevelyan very frightful indeed said mr outhouse on honour a gentleman not slightest cause in world be old enough to be lady father said mr outhouse managing in to get one blow at gallant colonel just so god bless soul mr outhouse shrunk visibly at profane allusion to colonel soul why have known father ever so many year a say might almost be father a far a age went such certainly might have be case for colonel be older than sir marmaduke look here mr outhouse here be letter got from emily from mr trevelyan yes from mr trevelyan a well a can understand must have be sent to by trevelyan did ever hear of thing now be told have gone away nobody know where have left here have gone away nobody know where of course ask to see must be imprudent colonel osborne must not be permitted in house ask have known emily trevelyan since be infant have always loved be godfather for aught know though one forgets thing of sort mr outhouse again knit eyebrow shuddered visibly have be fast friend why not of course ca interfere if ask colonel osborne must say that can hing in matter except to remain away from when sir marmaduke be in england can see if please see of course will see by george louis trevelyan will have to see too must like to have to stand up before rowley if have treated daughter of in fashion know rowley of course oh yes know be not sort of man to bear sort of thing will about tear trevelyan in piece if get hold of god bless soul eyebrow went to work again never heard of such thing in life doe pay anything for mr outhouse be dreadful to poor clergyman be subject surely need not discus said then remembered that such speech on part be like to subterfuge found necessary to put right be repaid for maintenance here of niece little boy attendant know why question must be asked such be fact then be here by agreement between sir be not there be such agreement like interrogative from stranger a to matter must be private can not wonder at interest mr outhouse have better restrain sir till sir marmaduke arrives will then wash hand of affair be pretty well emily mean mr trevelyan health be good pray tell though must not might not ask to see came to inquire after first moment be in london pray tell how much feel for will know that when sir marmaduke be here of course will meet when be once more under father wing need not be restrained by absurd command from husband who have deserted at present of course ask to see of course colonel osborne give love to nora dear little nora there can be reason why must not shake hand must prefer that must not be so in house said clergyman who be now standing in expectation that unwelcome guest must go very well so be will understand must not be in london without coming asking after then colonel at last took leave mr outhouse be left to solitude sermon mr outhouse be very angry when heard of visit men of sort said think fine thing talk about believe poor girl be a innocent a be be innocent like 'it be easier ' said mr outhouse solemnly 'for camel to go through eye of needle than for rich man to enter kingdom of god ' know that be rich man said mr outhouse must have come here if have be honest mr trevelyan be told of visit simply said that of course be out of question that must have seen colonel osborne nevertheless seemed to think quite natural that must have called defended with energy when aunt declared that have be much to blame be not bound to obey mr trevelyan because be said emily be bound to abstain from evil doing said mr outhouse ought to have come there let that be enough dear uncle doe wish to have talked about nevertheless be talked about between two sister nora be of opinion that colonel osborne have be wrong whereas emily defended seems to to have be most natural thing in life said have colonel osborne made visit a sir marmaduke friend feeling to be old man might have be natural when man have come to regard a being on score of age about a fit to be young lady lover a though be old woman instead of old man men will do when be younger even than be colonel osborne be justified in throwing behind a utterly absurd suspicion of other people colonel osborne can not be defended altogether on plea chapter xlii miss stanbury mr gibson become two there came to be very gloomy fortnight at miss stanbury house in close for two three day after mr gibson dismissal at hand of miss stanbury brooke burgess be still in house presence saved dorothy from full weight of aunt displeasure there be necessity of looking after brooke scolding of praising to martha of dispraising of seeing that have enough to eat of watching whether smoked in house of quarrelling with about everything under sun together so employed miss stanbury that satisfied with glance at dorothy be felt to be full of charge of ingratitude dorothy be thankful that must be so bore glance with abject submission then there be great comfort to in brooke friendship on second day after mr gibson have gone found talking to brooke quite openly upon subject fact be mr burgess did really care for know be very good of course aunt stanbury meant for best must have done if must must brooke patted on back not in flesh in spirit told that be quite right expressed opinion too that be not expedient to yield too much to aunt stanbury must yield to in anything be possible to said dorothy wo said think must do good if did like like money like well enough to sell for price great part too of quarrelling went on from day to day between brooke miss stanbury be due to difference of opinion respecting dorothy suitor believe put up to said aunt stanbury put up down think that be quite right have robbed of husband will never have chance after what have done ought to take will be ready to morrow said brooke how can tell lie said aunt stanbury after two three day brooke be gone to make journey through distant part of county see beauty of devonshire be to be away for fortnight then come back for day two before returned to london during fortnight thing did not go well with poor dorothy at exeter suppose know own business best aunt said to one morning dorothy uttered word of reply felt to be equally impossible to suggest that did that did not know own business best there may be reason understand exclaimed aunt stanbury must like to know what be expect why must expect anything aunt stanbury be nonsense everybody expects something expect to have dinner by by suppose will said dorothy to whom occurred at moment that such expectation be justified by fact that on day of life hitherto sort of dinner have come in way yes think come from heaven suppose come by god goodness bounty aunt stanbury how will come when be dead how will come if thing must go in such way ca stay here longer ever think of must go back to mamma priscilla psha a if two mouth be not enough to eat meal there be in tub if there be word to say against man must ask to have if drank smoked be gentleman be too poor anything like there be nothing be very well to tell love why love like girl to go throw at man head a french have done when everything have be prepared for made proper seems to to be like turning away from good victual dorothy must only offer to go home if have offended aunt then miss stanbury scolded for making offer a kind of thing went on at house in close for fortnight during there be going out society at home dorothy began to be rather tired of at end of fortnight on morning of day on brooke burgess be expected back dorothy slowly moving into sitting room with usual melancholy air found mr gibson talking to aunt there be said miss stanbury jumping up briskly now can speak to of course have authority none in least know what wish be having so spoken miss stanbury left room will be remembered that hitherto word of affection have be whispered by mr gibson into dorothy ear when came before to press suit have be made aware of coming have fled leaving answer with aunt mr gibson have then expressed a somewhat injured in opportunity of pouring forth own eloquence have be permitted to on occasion miss stanbury being in snubbing humour have snubbed have in truth scolded almost a much a have scolded dorothy telling that went about business in hand a though butter must melt in mouth be stiff a chair back have said to with few other compliment amenity have for while made regard establishment at heavitree a being at rate pleasanter than in close since cool reflection have come proposal be not that must marry miss stanbury senior who certainly must be severe on occasion miss stanbury junior whose temper be a sweet a primrose in march that must have to take from miss stanbury senior be certain sum of money a to promise be a good a bond in world thing have come to pas with in exeter from hint of friend prebend from word two have come to from dean from certain family arrangement proposed to by mother sister thing have come to pas that be of mind that have better marry one have a be three string to bow there be two french string there be dorothy have not breadth of genius enough to suggest to that yet woman might be found there be difficulty on french score even about miss stanbury be clear to that failing be due to one of two miss french now be not only that miss french be empty handed be beginning to think that be not a nice a might have be in reference to arrangement of head gear therefore having given much thought to matter remembering that have never yet have play for own eloquence with dorothy have come to miss stanbury asking that might have chance have be borne in upon that have perhaps hitherto regarded dorothy a too certainly own since have be offered to by aunt a being prize required eloquence in winning thought that if must have opportunity of amending that fault might even yet be well with suit so prepared asked permission now found alone with young lady when last be in house miss stanbury began be not fortunate enough to be allowed opportunity of pleading cause to yourself then paused dorothy be left to consider how best might answer that aunt have said to have not be thrown away upon call upon slender meal tub at home knew be quite sufficient mr gibson be believed good man how better must dispose of herself in life what be that must scorn love of honest gentleman must take thought if must then there came upon unconsciously without work of thought by instinct rather than by intelligence feeling of closeness of wife to husband looking at in general must not deny that must be very proper that must become mr gibson when there came upon remembrance that must be called upon for demonstration of love that must embrace hold to heart kiss revolted shuddered believed that did not want to marry man that state of thing must not be good for dear young lady continued mr gibson will let now make up for loss then experienced thought be better not to give trouble said dorothy trouble miss stanbury how must be trouble labour delight in physic pain to go back to subject matter hope doubt that affection for be true honest genuine want to doubt anything mr gibson need dearest miss stanbury indeed need if must read heart must see written there true love very plainly very plainly do not think duty people must marry may be surmised that have here forgotten connecting link must have joined without abruptness declaration of own love social view a to general expediency of matrimony dorothy did not discover hiatus certainly when like other if friend think proper friend think proper miss stanbury may say dorothy of can assure that on side will be welcomed by mother sister only too anxious to receive with open arm a regard own relation need hardly allude to revered aunt a to own mother

have gone over to nuncombe to see dorothy did not consider entitled to believe that on morning of last day brooke went over to uncle office have come to say good bye uncle barty said good bye boy take care of mean to try have quarrelled with old woman have said uncle barty not yet be to say not to knife still believe that be to have money believe nothing one way other may be sure of will never count mine till have got will never make so sure of a to break heart because get suppose have got a good right to a anybody else see why must take if come in way think ever will said old man after pause will be none worse said brooke yes will will be broken hearted man mean to break heart doe on purpose have more idea of leaving money than have why must simply because take fancy fancy believe there be very little fancy about there be one of name must ruin if must 'd break heart if must get at look at position be little more than clerk in concern by god be not so well off a senior clerk in many bank if there came bad time must lose a others must lose clerk never loses share in business be almost nothing be just nothing compared to what must have be only for brooke have known that uncle be disappointed at least discontented man have never known much of old man circumstance certainly have not expected to hear speak in strain that have now used have heard often that uncle barty disliked miss stanbury have not be surprised at former sharp biting little word spoken in reference to lady character have not expected tirade of abuse a banker have now poured out of course know nothing about bank said did not suppose that have have anything to do with where do think money came from that have got did ever hear that have anything of own never have penny never penny came out of house be capital on business be founded on ought to be carried on to day brother have thrown off by heaven yes have thrown off have found out what be have got rid of left money yes got near when be dying did leave money money money father money must have given nothing uncle barty be own of course be true be true in one way might say same of man who be cozened into leaving shilling away from own child be in exeter when will be made none of be here be here when came to see die there found have have revenge upon mean to have on of believe will ever leave shilling brooke will find out yet will talk of to nephew a do to brooke made ordinary answer to bade uncle adieu have allowed to entertain half chivalrous idea that must produce reconciliation between miss stanbury uncle barty since have be at exeter have said word first to one then to other hinting at subject hint have certainly not be successful a walked from bank into high street must not fail to ask whether there be ground for terrible accusation have just heard from uncle lip something of same kind though in form much le violent have be repeated to very often by others of family though have a boy known miss stanbury well have be taught to regard a ogress burgess have regarded miss stanbury a ogress since unfortunate will have come to light be ogress from whom something might be gained ogress have still persisted in saying that burgess must be heir have therefore come to pas that brooke have be brought up half to revere half to abhor be dreadful woman said branch of family who will not scruple at anything evil a seems that may probably reap advantage of evil that doe will become to put up with iniquity a have become old enough to understand nature of position have determined to judge for judgment hitherto simply amounted to miss stanbury be very singular old woman with kind heart good instinct so capricious withal that sensible man must risk happiness on expectation formed on promise guided by opinion have resolved to be attentive to after certain fashion submissive certainly not to become slave have thrown over nephew be constantly complaining to of niece now again must say very bitter word to about when have left exeter on little excursion one be so much in favour with a mr gibson on return found that mr gibson have be altogether discarded be spoken of in term of almost insolent abuse if be ever so humble to have said to must do good there be nothing hate so much a humility have thus determined to take good god provided must ever come to pas that such godlike provision be laid before out of miss stanbury coffer not to alter mode of life put out of way in obedience to behest a man might be expected to do who be destined to receive so rich legacy upon idea have acted still believing old woman to be good believing at same time that be very capricious now have heard what uncle bartholomew burgess have have to say upon matter must not refrain from asking whether uncle accusation be true in narrow passage between high street close met mr gibson there have come to be sort of intimacy between two men grows from closeness of position rather than from social desire on side be natural that burgess must say word of farewell on previous evening miss stanbury have relieved mind by turning mr gibson into ridicule in description to brooke of manner in clergyman have carried on love affair have at same time declared that mr gibson have be most violently impertinent to herself knew therefore that miss stanbury mr gibson have become two must on occasion have passed on without word relative to old lady have mr gibson allowed to do so mr gibson spoke mind freely off to morrow be said good bye hope may meet again not in same house mr burgess there anywhere will be very happy said brooke not there certainly while be absent miss stanbury treated in way that will certainly never put foot in house again dear thought that be such great friend knew very well of course respected be good churchwoman be charitable in city have got tongue in head that there be bearing when doe what call giving bit of mind have be indulgent to have not given much of time will come have doubt continued mr gibson everybody have always told that must be so even oldest friend knew ask mr machugh mr french at heavitree mr french said brooke laughing must hardly be fair evidence why not know better judge of character in exeter than mr french miss stanbury have be intimate life ask uncle at bank uncle miss stanbury never be friend said brooke ask hugh stanbury what think of suppose want to say word against must for world do thing only a have met there thought best to let know that have treated in way have be altogether so violent that never will go there again so saying mr gibson passed on be of opinion that have spoken with great generosity of old woman who have treated so badly in afternoon brooke burgess went over to further end of close called on mr machugh from thence walked across to heavitree called on french may be doubted whether must have be so well behaved to lady have not be appealed to by mr gibson a witness to character of miss stanbury got very little from mr machugh lady be kind cordial expressed many wish that might see again in exeter when said few word about mr gibson mr machugh only laughed declared that gentleman must soon find plaister for sore there be more fish than one in sea said be afraid have quarrelled mr machugh so tell what must have to talk about here if somebody did quarrel sometimes ought to get up quarrel for good of public only know that never can quarrel with anybody never see anybody interesting enough to quarrel with mr machugh said nothing about miss stanbury except sent over message with reference to rubber of whist for next night one found two french girl sitting with mother expressed great gratitude to for coming to say good bye before went be so very nice of mr burgess said camilla particularly just at present yes indeed said arabella because know thing have be so unpleasant dear never mind about said mr french miss stanbury have meant everything for best be over now know what mean by being over mamma said camilla a far a can understand have never be begun dear least said soonest mended said mr french be of course mamma said camilla yet one ca hold one tongue altogether city be talking about dare say mr burgess have heard a much a anybody else have heard nothing at said brooke oh yes have continued camilla arabella conceived at moment to be situated in so delicate position that be best that sister must talk about that must hold tongue with exception perhaps of hint here there might be of assistance for arabella completely understood that prize be now to be hers if prize must be rescued out of stanbury clutch be aware one better aware how sister have interfered with early hope be sure in own mind that disappointment have come from fratricidal rivalry on part of camilla have never however be open to to quarrel with camilla there be linked together together must fight battle a two pig may be seen at same trough striving to take delicacy of banquet from other yet enjoying always warmth of same dunghill in amicable contiguity so have young lady lived in sisterly friendship while be striving to take husband from other have understood position though for year back have talked about mr gibson have never quarrelled now in latter day of stanbury interference there have come tacitly to be something of understanding between that if fighting be still possible on subject one must be put forward other must yield there have be no spoken agreement arabella quite understood that be to be put forward be for to take up running to win if possible against stanbury filly be view be inclined to give camilla credit for acting in accordance with with honesty zeal felt therefore that word on present occasion ought to be few sat back in corner of sofa be intent on work shewed by pensiveness of brow that there be thought within bosom of be not disposed to speak must have heard great deal said camilla laughing must know how poor mr gibson have be abused because must camilla be foolish said mr french because must what asked brooke what ought to have done that did do know anything about ought said camilla be matter of taste altogether be worst hand in world at riddle said brooke how sly be continued camilla laughing a if dear aunt stanbury have confided hope to camilla dear said arabella when gentleman be hunted ca be caught think ought to be abused to face who hunted who abused asked brooke mind mean to say word against miss stanbury mr burgess have known loved life have mamma respected said arabella quite so continued camilla know mr burgess that like own way know anybody doe not said brooke when be disappointed show there be doubt be disappointed now mr burgess what be good of going on camilla said mr french arabella sat silent in corner with conscious glow of satisfaction a reflected that joint disappointment of elder younger miss stanbury have be caused by tender remembrance of own charm have not dear mr gibson told in glowing language of truth that there be nothing further from thought than idea of taking dorothy stanbury for wife well know continued camilla think that when person make attempt come by worst of that person must put up with defeat not say manner of ill natured thing everybody know that certain gentleman be very intimate in house dear said arabella in whisper yes will said camilla know why people must hold tongue when other people talk so loudly care bit what anybody say about gentleman have known for ever so many year mamma be very fond of indeed be camilla said mr french for matter of so be very said camilla laughing bravely care who know be so silly child said arabella camilla be certainly doing best arabella be grateful care what people may say continued camilla again of course heard a everybody else heard too that certain gentleman be to be married to certain lady be nothing to whether be married not nothing at said arabella never spoke ill of young lady did not interfere if gentleman liked young lady be quite at liberty to marry a far a be concerned have be in habit of seeing here almost a brother perhaps might feel that connection with particular young lady must take from never hinted so much even a to to anyone else why must be nothing to now turn out that gentleman never meant anything of kind whereupon be pretty nearly kicked out of house manner of ill natured thing be said about everywhere by time camilla have become quite excited be speaking with much animation how can be so foolish camilla said arabella perhaps be foolish said camilla to care what anybody say what can be to mr burgess said mr french only that a like mr burgess a be almost one of family in close think ought to know why be not quite so cordial a used to be now that matter be over have doubt thing will get right again a for young lady be sure feel for think be aunt who be indiscreet then have tongue said arabella friend brooke of course knew whole truth knew nature of mr gibson failure knew also how dorothy have acted in affair be inclined moreover to believe that lady who be now talking to be a well instructed on subject a be have heard too of ambition of two young lady now before believed that ambition be not yet dead did not think incumbent on to fight battle even on behalf of dorothy might have declared that dorothy at least have not be disappointed thought better to be silent about dorothy yes said miss stanbury have tongue think speaks a much good a doe evil perhaps be great deal to say for lady tongue never speak evil of anybody said camilla never be rule with then brooke took leave three lady be cordial almost affectionate in farewell greeting brooke be to start on following morning before anybody must be up except martha miss stanbury be very melancholy during evening will miss very much

with freedom must hardly understand told how thoroughly believed aunt to be good woman how sure be that aunt be at rate honest a for said dorothy know have displeased about mr gibson must go away only that think must be so desolate then brooke begged never to allow idea of leaving miss stanbury to enter head because miss stanbury be capricious said not on account must caprice be indulged permitted be doctrine respecting miss stanbury declared that a regarded must never be either disrespectful to submissive be great mistake said to think that anybody be angel devil when dorothy expressed opinion

refused yours in deep indignation oliphant outhouse trevelyan have also written two other letter to england one to mr bideawhile other to bozzle in former acquainted lawyer that have discovered that

understanding accurately extent of power with regard to own child mean whereby might exercise be anxious to obtain assistance from bozzle also on point have doubt that bozzle knew about have great confidence in bozzle still did not like to consult ex policeman knew that became to have regard for own dignity therefore put matter very astutely to bozzle asking question alluding to difficulty in way must enable bozzle to offer advice where be to get woman to take charge of child if lady milborough must do how great must be comfort be almost sure that lady milborough must not do all friend have turned against lady milborough among number there be nobody left to bozzle must entrust bozzle to find woman for who must take adequate charge of little fellow till must see to child education did not put question to bozzle in plain term be very astute wrote in such fashion that bozzle must make proposal if proposal be within power answer from mr outhouse came first to mr trevelyan paid very little attention be just what expected of course mr outhouse assurance about colonel osborne went for nothing man who must permit intercourse in house between married lady lover must not scruple to deny that have permitted then came mr bideawhile answer be very short mr bideawhile said that nothing must be done about child till mr trevelyan must return to england that must give opinion a to what must be done then till knew more of circumstance be quite clear to trevelyan that must employ other lawyer mr bideawhile have probably be corrupted by colonel osborne must bozzle recommend lawyer from bozzle there came other immediate reply than duty that must make further inquiry chapter xlvi american minister in second week in october mr glascock returned to florence intending to remain

on part then awkward not knowing how to take trouble when trouble be necessary a to matter of abusive language turning out of house miss stanbury be quite convinced that be sinned against not herself sinner declared to martha more than once that mr gibson have used such language to that coming out of clergyman mouth have quite dismayed martha who knew mistress probably felt that mr gibson have at least received a good a gave have made attempt to set mistress right on point cause of miss stanbury sharpest anger be not to be found in mr gibson conduct before dorothy refusal of offer on occasion of being turned out of house base rumour be spread about city dorothy stanbury have be offered to mr gibson that mr gibson have civilly declined offer that hence have arisen wrath of juno of close now

nothing of sort dare say not said mr machugh be sure care mr gibson have be going to marry one of french girl for last ten year think ought to make up mind do at last can assure be quite welcome a far a dorothy be concerned said miss stanbury without doubt opinion did prevail throughout exeter mr gibson who have be regarded time out of mind a property of miss french have be angled for by lady in close that have nearly be caught that have slipped hook out of mouth be now about to subside quietly into net have be originally prepared for arabella french have not spoken loudly on subject camilla have declared in more than one house that have most direct authority for stating that gentleman have never dreamed of offering to young lady why must not do so if plea know said camilla only fact be

might possibly become own a burden in one sense might be called upon to bear a domestic utensil might be called upon to inspect perhaps to aid shifting on shifting off did begin to think that side of scylla gulf ought to be avoided if possible probably propensity on part feeling that must like to reconsider matter dispassionately before gave up for good to old love may have be increased by camilla

miss noel of doddiscombe leigh miss stanbury have be engaged to be married at same time to man of fortune one match have be completed in ordinary course of match have be course of other already know

of scandal on young woman name must be stopped at once antique pure minded anxious self sacrificing matron be mr clifford very dear to heart of miss stanbury after lunch be over on day in question mr clifford got miss stanbury into closet retirement there spoke mind a to thing be being said have be asserted in presence by camilla french that camilla be authorised by mr gibson to declare that have never thought of proposing to dorothy stanbury that miss stanbury have be labouring under strange misapprehension in matter now dear care very much for young lady in question said mr clifford alluding to camilla french very little indeed must think said miss stanbury with shake of head quite true dear doe not make word out of mouth le efficacious for evil clearly insinuated that have endeavoured to make up match between gentleman niece that have failed so much be at least true miss stanbury felt felt also that must not explain truth even to dear old friend in midst of divine wrath have acknowledged to herself that have brought mr gibson into difficulty that must not become to tell one of failure in matter did not accuse mr gibson believed that lie originated with camilla french be against camilla that wrath raged fiercest be poor mean disappointed thing said miss stanbury very probably think must ask to hold tongue about miss dorothy said mr clifford consultation in closet be carried on for about hour then miss stanbury put on bonnet shawl descended into mr clifford carriage carriage took heavitree road deposited miss stanbury at door of mr french house walk home from heavitree must be nothing mr clifford proceeded on way having given little help in counsel conveyance to friend mr french be at home miss stanbury be shown up into room in three lady be sitting illustration miss stanbury visit french reader will doubtless remember promise arabella have made to mr gibson that promise have already fulfilled to amazement of mother sister when miss stanbury entered room elder daughter of family be seen without accustomed head gear if truth be to be owned miss stanbury gave poor young woman credit for new simplicity put down deficiency to charge of domestic slatternliness be unjust enough to declare afterwards that have found arabella french only half dressed at between three four o'clock in afternoon from lesson may surely be learned that though way down avernus may be customarily be made with great celerity return journey if made at must be made slowly young woman may commence in chignon by attaching amount of edifice to head reduction must be made by degree arabella edifice have in miss stanbury eye be ugliest thing in art that have known now absence offended most untruly declared that have come upon young woman in middle of day just out of bed room almost in dressing gown whole french family suffered diminution of power from strange phantasy have come upon arabella felt in sight of enemy that have to certain degree lowered flag one of ship at least have shown sign of striking element of weakness made felt through whole fleet arabella when saw miss stanbury be painfully conscious of head wished that have postponed operation till evening smiled with faint watery smile be aware that something ailed greeting at first be civil very formal a be between nation be nominally at peace be waiting for sign at may spring at other throat in instance juno from close have come quite prepared to declare casus belli a complete to fling down gauntlet unless enemy must at once yield to everything demanded with abject submission mr french said have called to day for particular purpose must address chiefly to miss camilla oh certainly said mr french will be delighted to hear anything from miss stanbury said camilla not without air of bravado arabella said nothing put hand up almost convulsively to back of head have be told to day by friend of mine miss camilla began miss stanbury that declared in presence authorised by mr gibson to make statement about niece dorothy may ask who be friend demanded mr french be mr clifford of course said camilla there be nobody else must try to make difficulty there need be difficulty at miss camilla said miss stanbury if will promise that will not repeat statement ca be true be true said camilla what be true asked miss stanbury surprised by audacity of girl be true that mr gibson authorised to state what did state when mr clifford heard what be that only that people have be saying about exeter that be going to be married to young lady that a report be incorrect a have never have remotest idea in mind of making young lady wife camilla a said spoke with great deal of emphasis putting forward chin shaking head a thought be uncomfortable for young lady for a there be nothing in least in world nothing at glimmer of foundation for report must be better to have denied everywhere be what said have authority from gentleman arabella can say same so can mamma only mamma did not hear have camilla heard that incident did not mention circumstance be in miss stanbury judgment becoming very remarkable did not for moment believe camilla did not believe that mr gibson have given to of french justification for statement just made camilla have be so much more audacious than miss stanbury have expected that lady be for moment struck dumb be sure miss stanbury said mr french want to give offence to niece very far from niece doe care about two straw said miss stanbury be that care care very much thing have be said have be altogether false how false miss stanbury asked camilla altogether false a false a can be mr gibson must know own mind said camilla dear there be little disappointment said miss french signify there be disappointment at said miss stanbury doe signify very much now that have begun will go to bottom of if say that mr gibson told to make statement will go to mr gibson will have out somehow may have what like out for miss stanbury said camilla believe mr gibson said anything of kind be civil said camilla why must asked arabella there be report know said mr french why must deny when there be word of truth in continued camilla for part think gentleman be bound for lady sake to declare that there be nothing in when there be nothing in be more than miss stanbury must bear enemy have seemed to have best of camilla be firing broadside after broadside a though be assured of victory even mr french be becoming courageous arabella be forgetting place where chignon ought to have be really know what else there be for to say remarked camilla with toss of head air of impudence that almost drove poor miss stanbury frantic be on tongue to declare whole truth refrained have schooled on subject vigorously must not betray mr gibson have known truth have believed camilla french version of story there must have be betrayal looking at matter with such knowledge a have at present did not even yet feel justified in declaring that mr gibson have offered hand to niece have be refused be however sorely tempted very well lady said will now see mr gibson ask whether did give authority to make such statement a have be spreading abroad everywhere then door of room be opened in moment mr gibson be among be true to promise have come to see arabella with altered head dress have come at hour thinking that escape in morning must be easier quicker than might have be in evening mind have be full of arabella head dress even up to moment of knocking at door be driven out of brain at once when saw miss stanbury here be mr gibson said mr french how do do mr gibson said miss stanbury with very stately courtesy have never met since day on have be a stated turned out of miss stanbury house now bowed to there be friendly greeting french be able to congratulate on apparent loyalty to of gentleman who stood among have come here mr gibson continued miss stanbury to put small matter right in be concerned seems to to be most insignificant thing in world said camilla very likely said miss stanbury be not insignificant to miss camilla french have asserted publicly that have authorised to make statement about niece dorothy mr gibson looked into camilla face doubtingly inquisitively almost piteously have better let go on said camilla will make great many mistake doubt have better let go on to end have made mistake a yet miss camilla so asserted mr gibson in hearing of friend of mine repeated assertion here in room to just before came in say that have authorised to declare that have better speak out plainly at once much better said camilla that never entertained idea of offering hand to niece miss stanbury paused mr gibson jaw fell visibly be not expected to speak a yet miss stanbury continued accusation beyond want to mention niece name if can be avoided ca be avoided said camilla if please will continue mr gibson will understand will not if can help mention niece name again mr gibson still have confidence in that think that must have made statement in reference to young lady unless be young lady who have absolutely thrown at head in saying paused looked very hard at camilla be just what dorothy stanbury have be doing said camilla have be doing nothing of kind know have said miss stanbury raising arm a though be going to strike opponent be quite sure mr gibson that never must have authorised young lady to make such assertion publicly on behalf whatever there may have be of misunderstanding between ca believe that of then paused for reply if will be good enough to set right on point will be obliged to mr gibson position be one of great discomfort have given authority to one to make such statement have said nothing about dorothy stanbury to camilla have told arabella when hard pressed by lady that did not mean to propose to dorothy must not satisfy miss stanbury because feared arabella must not satisfy french because feared miss stanbury really think said that ought to talk about young lady in way opinion too said camilla miss stanbury will exactly so miss stanbury will said that lady mr gibson insist upon that tell whether did give such authority to miss camilla french to miss french must answer if be said camilla really think can do good said mr french be so very harassing to nerve said arabella nerve pooh exclaimed miss stanbury now mr gibson be waiting for answer dear miss stanbury really think better situation be so peculiar upon word hardly know how not to give offence must do for world do mean to tell that wo answer question demanded miss stanbury really think that have better hold tongue pleaded mr gibson be quite right mr gibson said camilla indeed be wisest said mr french see what else can do said arabella then be miss stanbury driven altogether beyond power of endurance if be so said must speak out though must have preferred to hold tongue mr gibson did offer to week before last twice be refused by niece dorothy took into head that did not like upon word think be right must have said nothing about not word when false assertion be made on mr gibson alleged authority mr gibson wo deny must tell truth then there be silence among for few second mr gibson struggled hard vainly to clothe face in pleasant smile mr gibson be that true said miss stanbury mr gibson made reply be a true a heaven said miss stanbury striking hand upon table now have better of hold tongue about niece will hold tongue about a for mr gibson anybody who want after be welcome to for good morning mr french good morning young lady so stalked out of room out of house walked back to house in close mamma said arabella a soon a enemy be gone have got such headache think will go up stair will go with dear said camilla mr gibson before left house confided secret to maternal ear of mr french certainly have be allured into making offer to dorothy stanbury be ready to atone for crime by marrying daughter camilla a soon a might be convenient be certainly driven to make declaration by intense cowardice not to excuse for in there must be excuse how else must dare to suggest that might a well leave house will tell dear girl asked

poor dolly must ultimately have enjoyment of chapter l camilla triumphant illustration be now new year day there be grief perhaps more excitement in exeter for be rumoured that miss stanbury lay very ill at house in close in order that somewhat uneven story may run a smoothly a may be made to do little history of french family for intervening month will be told in chapter in order that may be understood how matter be with when tidings of miss stanbury severe illness first reached house at heavitree after terrible scene in miss stanbury have so dreadfully confounded mr gibson by declaring manner in have be rebuffed by dorothy unfortunate clergyman have endeavoured to make peace with french family by assuring mother that in very truth be dearest wish of heart to make daughter camilla wife mr french who have ever be disposed to favour arabella ambition well knowing priority ancient right who of late have be taught to consider even camilla have consented to waive claim that might have once possessed must not refrain from expression of surprise that must be recovered at out of stanbury clutch be very much to mr french be so much that have time be given for consideration must have acknowledged to herself readily that property have best be secured at once to family without incurring amount of risk must unquestionably attend attempt on part to direct mr gibson purpose hither thither proposition came so suddenly that time be not allowed to to be altogether wise thought be poor bella said with something of piteous whine in voice at moment mr gibson be so humble that be half inclined to give way even on head felt to have be brought so low in market by terrible story of miss stanbury have be unable to contradict to explain that there be little power of fighting left in be however just able to speak word for that sufficed hope there have be mistake said really be camilla have heart mr french made rejoinder to be so much to to know mr gibson heart be among at after what have occurred in close that acknowledged to herself after moment of reflection that arabella must be sacrificed for good of family interest poor dear loving misguided spiritless mother must have given blood out of bosom to get husband for daughter though be not of own experience that have learned that of worldly good husband be best be possession have from earliest year thought of acquiring first expected for have then hoped afterwards worked schemed striven with energy a to have at last almost despaired now arabella fire have be rekindled with new spark ala be to be quenched so suddenly be to tell asked mr french with tremor in voice to however mr gibson demurred said that for certain reason must like fortnight grace at end of fortnight must be prepared to speak interval be granted without further question mr gibson be allowed to leave house after mr french be not very comfortable at home a soon a mr gibson have departed camilla at once returned to mother desired to know what have taken place be true that perjured man have proposed to young woman in close mr french be not clever at keeping secret must not keep by own aid told happened to camilla between agreed that arabella must be kept in ignorance till fatal fortnight must have passed when camilla be interrogated a to own purpose said must like day to think of took twenty four hour then made following confession of passion to mother see mamma always liked mr gibson always so did arabella dear before thought of such thing dare say may be true mamma be not fault came here among on such sweetly intimate term that feeling grew up with before knew what meant a to idea of cutting out arabella conscience be quite clear if thought there have be anything really between must have gone anywhere to top of mountain rather than rob sister of heart belonged to have be so slow about said mr french know about said camilla gentleman have to be slow suppose when think of income only got st peter cum pumpkin three year ago did know for first year whether must hold minor canonry together of course gentleman have to think of thing before come forward dear have be very backward if be to be mr gibson mamma beg may hear anything said against then there came about young woman when saw that arabella took on so must say be very absurd be sure put out of way entirely if 'd buried under ground must have done more be belief that what have said for arabella sake have put old woman into rage that have made quarrel between niece otherwise must be off believe word of refusing never will be in course of thing mamma mr french shook head of course not then when question very properly say that be devoted to poor if be to refuse must put up with bella suppose not said mr french hate bella have known along though must say so if be to sacrifice ever so must be of good sha do in way matter be arranged at end of fortnight however mr gibson did not come at end of three week inquiry have of course be made be ascertained that have gone into cornwall for parson holiday of thirteen day might be very well man might want recruiting vigour of change of air after such scene a mr gibson have gone through with stanburys before proposed encounter with new peril be man so tied by leg that escape must not be for long time be back on appointed sunday on wednesday mr french under camilla instruction wrote to pretty little note replied that must be with on saturday must then be nearly four week after great day with miss stanbury one must be inclined to quarrel with so short delay a arabella in meantime have become fidgety unhappy seemed to understand that something be expected being quite unable to guess what that something might be be true throughout day to simplicity of head gear mr gibson have recommended to seemed in question to mother to camilla to be more fearful of dorothy stanbury than of other enemy mamma think ought to tell said camilla more than once have not be told when mr gibson came on saturday may truly be said that poor mother pleasure in prospect of one daughter be altogether destroyed by anticipation of other daughter misery have mr gibson made dorothy stanbury wife must have comforted together by heat of joint animosity came on saturday be so managed that be closeted with camilla before arabella knew that be in house there be quarter of hour during work be easy perhaps pleasant when began to explain intention camilla with utmost frankness informed that mother have told about then turned face on one side put hand in got arm round waist gave kiss thing be done camilla be fully resolved that after betrothal must not be undone have behaved with sisterly forbearance must not now lose reward of virtue not word be said of arabella at interview till be pressed to come drink tea with night hesitated moment then camilla declared with something perhaps of imperious roughness in manner that have better face at once mamma will tell will understand said camilla hesitated again at last promised that must come whilst be yet in house mr french have told whole story to poor elder daughter what be doing with camilla arabella have asked with feverish excitement bella darling know said mother know nothing everybody keep in dark be badly used what be that be doing then mr french tried to take poor young woman in arm arabella must not submit to be embraced exclaimed leave alone nobody like care bit about why be cammy with there alone suppose be asking to be wife then arabella threw in despair upon bed wept without further attempt at control over feeling be death blow to last hope world a looked upon world then be over for if must have arranged other way know must said mother mamma said arabella jumping up sha do have right a for oh that must treat in way did tell other night when drank tea here with alone what did tell bella never mind nothing will ever make speak to again not if married three time over to be nasty sly good for nothing thing bella talk to mamma there never be such thing done before since people be people at have be doing time know have nevertheless arabella did sit down to tea with two lover night there be terrible scene between camilla camilla held own arabella being weaker of two be vanquished by expenditure of own small energy camilla argued that a sister chance be gone a prize have come in own way there be good reason why must be lost to family altogether because arabella must not win when arabella called treacherous vixen heartless profligate hussy spoke out freely said that be going to be abused gentleman to whom be attached have asked for hand have given if arabella chose to make fool might what must be effect simply that world must know that arabella be disappointed poor bella at last gave way put on discarded chignon came down to tea mr gibson be already in room when entered arabella said getting up to greet hope will congratulate have planned little speech manner of making have wisely decided that in way might best get over difficulty oh yes of course said with little giggle then sob then flood of tear dear bella feel thing so strongly said mr french have never be parted yet said camilla then arabella tapped head of sofa three four time sharply with knuckle be only protest against reading of scene camilla have given of be capable at moment after mr french gave out tea arabella curled upon sofa a though be asleep two lover settled down to proper lover like conversation reader may be sure that camilla be not slow in making fact of engagement notorious through city be not probably true that tidings of success have anything to do with miss stanbury illness be reported by many that such be case be in november that arrangement be made certainly be true that miss stanbury be rather ill about same time know naughty lothario that did give ground to hope that might dispose of unfortunate niece said camilla playfully to own one when illness be discussed between be caught now wing be clipped be never to be naughty lothario again clerical don juan bore awkwardly indeed with good humour declared that trouble of sort be over now for ever nevertheless did not name day camilla began to feel that there might be occasion for little more of imperious roughness have at command november be nearly over nothing have be fixed about day arabella never condescended to speak to sister on subject on more than one occasion made inquiry of mother came to perceive to think that perceived that mother be still anxious on subject must wonder if be off day now said at last to mother say anything so

to mr outhouse did not say word to indicate that child must be given up muttered something indeed about impotent nonsense seemed to imply that threat must be of avail there be none of reassurance to be obtained from positive promise on part to hold bairn against comer must have given mr outhouse told niece more than once that child must be given to messenger even did not give assurance with energy mother must have liked will drag away from by force if do take said mother gnashing teeth oh if father must come for week did not let boy out of sight when messenger have presented by christmas

anything that bozzle be much impressed in favour of mr outhouse must have be glad to have done gentleman kindness have opportunity come in way what doe want uncle oliphant said mr trevelyan at foot of

that niece be kept here away from husband that lover come to see about policeman will be known now of course only say be hard that be wife did that must to comfort reminding that sir marmaduke must be home soon that then burden must be taken from shoulder be forced to admit that be very hard chapter liii hugh stanbury be shewn to be conjuror illustration many week have now passed since hugh stanbury have paid visit to st diddulph nora rowley be beginning to believe that rejection of lover have be so firm decided that must never see hear from more have long since confessed to herself that if did not see hear from soon life must not be worth straw to to of single treasure count for much more when outward circumstance of life be dull unvaried melancholy than doe when day be full of pleasure excitement even of business with nora rowley at st diddulph life at present be very melancholy there be little society to enliven sister be sick at heart becoming ill in health under burden of trouble mr outhouse be moody wretched mr outhouse though did best to make house comfortable to unwelcome inmate must not make appear that presence there be pleasure to nora understood better than did sister how distasteful present arrangement be to uncle be consequently very uncomfortable on score in midst of unhappiness of course told that be young woman miserable unfortunate altogether be always so with heart when be burdened though may have ample strength to bear burden loses buoyancy doubt own power be like spring of carriage be pressed flat by superincumbent weight because spring be good weight be carried safely be better afterwards for required purpose because of trial to have be subjected nora have sent lover away now at end of three month from day of dismissal have taught to believe that must never come again amidst sadness of life at st diddulph confidence in lover expected to come again must have done much to cheer more thought of hugh stanbury more fully became convinced that be man who a lover a husband a companion must just suit taste endowed liberally with hundred good gift in disposal of nature have be much more sparing made for mental portrait of more gracious in flattery than ever be canvas coming from hand of court limner gave gift of manliness honesty truth energy felt regarding that be paladin such a paladin be in age that be indomitable sure of success fitted in respect to take high position must certainly win for did not presume to be endowed with constancy a must make come to seek hand again have nora at time of life be living at west end of london going out to party three four time week must have be quite easy about coming spring must not have be weighted so heavily heart must have be elastic doubt have forgotten many of circumstance of visit of departure immediately on going have told sister that must certainly come again have said at same time that coming must be of use be so poor man though poorer than have be so little accustomed to poverty of life that have then acknowledged to herself that be not fit to be wife gradually a slow week went by there have come change in idea now thought that never must come again that if did must confess to that own view about life be changed must tell frankly must eat crust with in garret in london be said to herself never to sister emily mr outhouse have determined together that must be wise to abstain from mention of hugh stanbury name nora have felt that sister have so abstained reticence have assisted in producing despair have come upon hugh when have left have certainly given encouragement to expect that must return have be sure then that must return have be sure of though have told that must be useless now when sad week have slowly crept over head when during long hour of long day have thought of continually telling that be impossible that must ever become wife of man if did not become assured that have seen heard last of must surely have forgotten hot word that daring embrace then there came letter to question of management of letter for young lady be handled very differently in different house in establishment post be a free to young lady a be to reverend senior of household in others be considered to be quite matter of course that experienced discretion must sit in judgment on correspondence of daughter of family when nora rowley be living with sister in curzon street must have be very indignant indeed have be suggested to that there be authority over letter vested in sister now circumstanced a be at st diddulph did understand that letter must reach without aunt knowing that have come be distasteful to a be indeed detail of life at st diddulph must not help have aunt told that must never be allowed to receive letter at must have submitted till mother have come to relief letter reached now be put into hand by sister have be given to mr trevelyan by mr outhouse nora said mr trevelyan here be letter for think be from mr stanbury give said nora greedily of course will give hope intend to correspond with if have written to will answer of course said nora holding treasure aunt mary think that must not do so till papa mamma have arrived if aunt mary be afraid of let tell so will contrive to go somewhere else poor nora knew that threat be futile there be house to must take be not afraid of at nora only say that think must not write to mr stanbury then nora escaped to cold solitary seclusion of bed room there read letter reader may remember that hugh stanbury when last left st diddulph have not be oppressed by of gloomy revery of despairing lover have spoken mind freely to nora have felt justified in believing that have not spoken in vain have have her in arm have found impossible to say that did not love then have be quite firm in purpose to give encouragement that must avoid have said word must justify in considering that there be engagement between moreover have be warned not to come to house by mistress from day to day thought of now telling that there be nothing to be done to trust in fidelity till must be in position to offer fitting home then reflecting that must not expect such girl a nora rowley to wait for unless must succeed in making understand that at rate intended to wait for on one day must think that good faith proper consideration for nora herself required to keep silent on next must tell that such maudlin chivalry a be proposing to be sure to go to wall be neither rewarded recognised so at last sat down wrote following letter lincoln inn field january dearest nora ever since last saw at st diddulph have be trying to teach ought to do in reference to sometimes think that because be poor ought to hold tongue at others feel sure ought to speak out loud because love so dearly may presume just at moment latter opinion be in ascendant a do write mean to be very bold so bold that if be wrong will be thoroughly disgusted with will never willingly see again think best to be true to say what think do believe that love according to precedent ought not to say so do believe ever since be at st diddulph belief have made happy though there have be moment of doubt if

quite unable to rally talk on subject with spirit confidence when interrogated must simply reply that sir peter said sir peter said that thus add to rather than diminish doubt excitement varied opinion prevailed through city on one morning be absolutely asserted within limit of close miss stanbury be dying be believed for day at bank that be then lying in articulo mortis there have got about too report that portion of property have only be left to miss stanbury for life that burgess must be able to reclaim house in city that will have be made altogether in favour of dorothy cutting out even brooke from share in inheritance thus exeter have good deal to say respecting affair state of health of old friend miss stanbury illness however be true enough be much too ill to hear anything of what be going on too ill to allow martha to talk to at about outside public when invalid herself must ask question about affair of world martha must be very discreet turn away from subject miss stanbury for instance ill a be exhibited most mundane interest not exactly in camilla french marriage in delay marriage seemed destined to encounter dare say will slip out of yet said sick lady to confidential servant then martha have thought right to change subject feeling to be wrong that old lady on death bed must be taking joy in disappointment of young neighbour martha changed subject first to jelly then to psalm of day miss stanbury be too weak to resist last verse of last psalm of evening have hardly be finished before remarked that must never believe till saw be in hand of a be on high mum said martha turning eye up to ceiling closing book at same time with look strongly indicative of displeasure miss stanbury understood a well a though be in perfect health knew own failing be conscious of worldly tendency perceived that old servant be thinking of then sundry odd thought half digested thought idea too difficult for present strength crossed brain have be wicked of when be well to hope that scheming woman must not succeed in betraying man by scheme into ill assorted marriage if not wicked then be wicked now because be ill from thought mind travelled on to ordinary practice of death bed piety must assumed devotion be of use to now such devotion a martha be enjoining upon from hour to hour in pure affectionate solicitude for soul have spoken one evening of game of card saying that game of cribbage must have consoled then martha with shudder have suggested hymn have have recourse at once to sleeping draught miss stanbury have submitted have understood if card be wicked have indeed be terrible sinner what hope must there be now on death bed for one so sinful must not repent of card must not try to repent of not seeing evil of if be innocent why must not have consolation now when so much wanted yet knew that whole household even dorothy must be in arm against be to suggest thing took hymn sleeping draught telling that must be best for to banish such idea from mind pastor master have laid down for mode of living have followed indifferently perhaps still with intention of obedience have also laid down mode of dying must be well that must follow that a closely a possible must say nothing more about card must think nothing more of camilla french a so resolved with intellect half asleep with mind wandering between fact dream be unconsciously comfortable with assurance that if mr gibson did marry camilla french camilla french must lead very devil of life during three day dorothy went about house a quiet a mouse sitting nightly at aunt bedside tending sick woman with closest care too have be now again somewhat startled by seeming worldliness of aunt in illness aunt talked to about rent gave message for brooke burgess on subject seemed to dorothy to be profane when spoken of on might perhaps be death bed struck more strongly because have matter of own on must have much wished to ascertain aunt opinion if have not thought that must have be exceedingly wrong of to trouble aunt mind at time by such matter hitherto have said not word of brooke proposal to living being at present be secret with secret so big that almost caused bosom to burst with load that bore must not thought write to priscilla till have told aunt if be to write word on subject to one must not fail to make manifest extreme longing of own heart must not have written brooke name on paper in reference to word to herself without covering with epithet of love must be known to one if love be to be of avail to have idea that aunt must not wish brooke to marry must think that brooke must do better be quite clear that in such matter a aunt wish must be law have not aunt power of disinheriting brooke altogether what then if aunt must die must die now leaving brooke at liberty to do a pleased there be something so distasteful to in view of matter that must not look at must not allow to think of success might possibly accrue to herself by reason of aunt death intense a be longing in heart for permission from in authority over to give to brooke burgess perfect a be earthly paradise appeared to be open to when thought of good thing have befallen in matter conceived that must be guilty of grossest ingratitude be in degree to curtail even own estimate of aunt prohibitory power because of aunt illness remembrance of word brooke have spoken to be with quite perfect be entirely conscious of joy must be hers if might accept word a properly sanctioned be creature in aunt hand according to own idea of own duty while aunt be ill must not even learn what might be behest must be called on to obey be sitting one evening alone thinking of having left martha with aunt be trying to reconcile circumstance of life a now existed with circumstance a have be with in old day at nuncombe putney wondering at in must have lover trying to convince that for little episode of romance must mean nothing serious when martha crept down into room to of late day alteration might perhaps be dated from rejection of mr gibson martha who have always be very kind have become more respectful in manner to dorothy than have heretofore be usual with dorothy be quite aware of be not unconscious of certain rise in world be thereby indicated if please miss said martha who do think be here there be nobody with aunt said dorothy be sleeping like babby came down just for moment mr gibson be here miss in house asked for aunt when of course must not see asked for dorothy for few minute be utterly disconcerted at last consented to see mr gibson think be best said martha because be bad to be fighting missus so ill 'blessed be peace maker miss 'for will be called child of god ' convinced by argument by working of own mind dorothy directed that mr gibson might be shewn into room when came found unable to address remembered last time in have seen be lost in wonder that must be there shook hand with went through form of greeting in word be uttered hope will not think have done wrong said in calling to ask after old friend state of health oh dear said dorothy quite bewildered have known for so very long miss dorothy now in hour of distress perhaps mortal malady can not stop to remember few harsh word that spoke to lately never mean to be harsh mr gibson ah well perhaps not at rate have learned to forgive forget be afraid aunt be very ill miss dorothy be ill certainly mr gibson dear dear be a grass of field miss dorothy here to day gone to morrow a spark fly upwards just fit to be cut down cast into oven mr jennings have be with believe mr jennings be other minor canon come three time week mr gibson be excellent young man very good young man have be great comfort to to have jennings with be very young miss dorothy be dorothy muttered something purporting to declare that be not acquainted with exact circumstance of mr jennings age must be so glad to come if old friend must allow said mr gibson almost with sigh dorothy be clearly of opinion that change at present must be bad for aunt did not know how to express opinion so stood silent looked at there need be word spoken know about lady at heavitree said mr gibson oh dear said dorothy yet knew well that there must be such word spoken if mr gibson be to make way into aunt room aunt be constantly alluding to lady at heavitree in spite of effort of old servant to restrain there be little misunderstanding said mr gibson must be over now intended for best miss dorothy be sure nobody here can say be sincere dorothy though must not bring to answer mr gibson plainly must not be induced to assent to proposition muttered something about aunt weakness great attention mr jennings shewed aunt have become very fond of mr jennings did at last express opinion with clearness that aunt must not be disturbed by change at present after must not think of pressing miss dorothy said mr gibson still do hope that may have privilege of seeing yet once again in flesh touching approaching marriage miss dorothy paused dorothy felt that be blushing up to root of hair touching marriage continued mr gibson however will not be solemnized till end of march be manifest that regarded a point must in household be regarded a argument in favour do hope that will look upon in most favourable light excellent aunt also if be spared to be sure hope that will be happy mr gibson what be to do miss dorothy know have be very much blamed so unfairly have never meant to be untrue to mouse miss dorothy dorothy did not at understand whether be mouse camilla french arabella be so hard to find one be ill spoken of because thing have gone little amiss be quite impossible that dorothy must make answer to at last mr gibson left assuring with last word that nothing must give so much pleasure a to be called upon once more to see old friend in last moment though miss stanbury have be described a sleeping like babby have heard footstep of strange man in house have made martha tell whose footstep be a soon a dorothy went to darted upon subject with old keenness what did want here dolly said must like to see aunt when be little better know spoke good deal of old friendship respect must have thought of before how be to see people now when be better aunt how do know that will ever be better be off with people at heavitree be hope not aunt psha poor weak insufficient creature be what be mr jennings be worth twenty of dorothy though put question again in most alluring form of christian charity forgiveness must not induce aunt to say that must see mr gibson how can see when know that sir peter have forbidden to see anybody except mr clifford mr jennings two day afterwards there be uncomfortable little scene at heavitree must no doubt have be case that same train of circumstance have produced mr gibson visit to close produced also scene in question be suggested by who be attending closely to matter mr gibson have already come to repent engagement with camilla french indeed there be who pretended to believe that be induced by prospect of miss stanbury demise to transfer allegiance yet again to bestow hand upon dorothy at last there be many in city who must never be persuaded that dorothy have refused being for most part lady in whose estimation value of husband be counted so great beneficed clergyman so valuable among suitor that be to thinking impossible that dorothy stanbury must in sound sens have rejected offer believe bit of said mr crumbie to mr apjohn be likely ear of french family be keenly alive to rumour to rumour of rumour report of opinion respecting mr gibson reached heavitree have effect a long a mr gibson be behaving well a suitor be inoperative there what did matter to how prize might have be struggled for might still be struggled for elsewhere while enjoyed consciousness of possession when consciousness of possession became marred by cankerous doubt such rumour be very important camilla heard of visit in close swore that must have justice done gave mother to understand that if trick be played upon diocese must be made to ring of in fashion must astonish from bishop downwards whereupon mr french putting much faith in daughter threat sent for mr gibson truth be mr gibson said mr french when civility of first greeting have be completed poor child be pining pining mr french yes pining mr gibson be afraid that little understand how

accusation must have make peace with poor dying sister pleaded mr gibson after what have occurred said mr french shaking head at while thing be just a be now must be more like honest man of to stay away of course camilla feel feel very much wo put up with think be cruellest cruellest thing ever heard said mr gibson be be cruel sir then wretched man turned at bay tell what be mr french if be treated in way wo stand wo indeed will go away be not going to be suspected yet blown up think have behaved handsomely at rate to camilla quite so mr gibson if must come see on evening said mr french who be falling back into usual state of timidity if be to be treated in way will go away have thought of a be have be already invited to go to natal if hear anything more of accusation will certainly

have be said to carry spalding about conquest have made uncle aunt sister great friend miss petrie poetess republican browning a be called have spoken to about frequently have declared conviction that thing be to be miss petrie have with considerable eloquence explained to friend that english title be clatter of sounding brass must be regarded a drawback rather than a advantage mr spalding who be poetess must undoubtedly have welcomed mr glascock a niece husband with aunt energy when told by miss petrie old lord peterborough be tinkling cymbal snapped angrily at gifted countrywoman be too honest woman too conscious also of niece strength to say word to urge on mr spalding a american minister with full power at court of european sovereign felt that have full a much to give a to receive be well inclined to do must have be much pleased to talk about nephew lord peterborough loved niece dearly by middle of february be beginning to think that matter have be long enough in training if honourable glascock meant anything why did not speak out mind plainly american minister in such matter be accustomed to fewer ambage than be common in circle among mr glascock have lived in meantime caroline spalding be suffering have allowed to think that mr glascock intended to propose to have acknowledged to herself be to do so must certainly accept that have seen of since day on have be

place trust in english aristocrat country carry be game played out while be still breasting hill with young lung full of air carry spalding be proud of intimacy with republican browning nevertheless liked mr glascock when mr glascock have be ten day in florence on third visit to city have be four five time at embassy without expressing intention in proper form carry spalding began to think that have better save from heartbreak while salvation might be within reach perceived that uncle be gloomy almost angry when spoke of mr glascock that aunt be fretful with disappointment republican browning have uttered almost note of triumph have not be that olivia persisted carry spalding must have consented to go away with miss petrie to rome old stone be rotten too said poetess dust tell lie well known piece of hers ancient marble while ye crumble be written at time contained occult reference to mr glascock friend livy spalding clung to alliance probably knew sister heart better than did others perhaps also have clearer insight into mr glascock character be at rate clearly of opinion that there must be running away do like if do what be to get by going to rome said livy will get quit of doubt trouble call that cowardice must never run away from man carry aunt sophie forgets that manage thing in england just a do know why there must be difference do only that there be have read so many of novel a have who must ever think of learning to live out of english novel said carry be not saying that may teach to live how like afterwards if have anything to do with people must be well to know what manner be think richer sort of people in england slide into thing more gradually than do stand ground carry hold own take good god provide though caroline spalding opposed sister argument be particularly hard upon allusion to richer sort of people a knew miss petrie must have regarded a evidence of reverence for sounding brass tinkling cymbal nevertheless loved livy dearly for what said kissed sweet counsellor resolved that must for present decline invitation of poetess then be miss petrie somewhat indignant with friend threw out scorn in line have be mentioned american minister hardly knew how to behave when met mr glascock even when be called upon to speak of florence doubt be large city be now capital of great kingdom still people meet in florence much more frequently than do in paris in london may almost be said that whose habit be to go into society whose circumstance bring into same circle will see other day now american minister delighted to see to be seen in place frequented by person of certain rank position in florence having considered matter much have convinced that must thus best do duty a minister from great republic of free state to newest a called free est of european kingdom minister from france be marquis from england be earl from spain have come count so on in domestic privacy of embassy mr spalding must be severe enough upon sounding brass tinkling cymbal be quite content to be honourable jonas g spalding honourable because selected by country for post of honour liked to be heard among cymbal seen among brass to feel that position be a high a theirs mr glascock also be frequently in same circle thus came to pas that two gentleman saw other almost daily that mr spalding knew well how to bear in high place one must doubt did not quite know how to carry before mr glascock at home at boston must have be more completely master of situation thought too that began to perceive mr glascock avoided though must hear on return home that gentleman have be at embassy have be walking in cascine with niece that young lady must walk in public place with unmarried gentleman be nothing to american father guardian american young lady be accustomed to choose own companion minister be tormented by doubt a to way of englishman a to phase in english habit might most properly exhibit in italy knew that people be talking about mr glascock niece why then did mr glascock avoid be perhaps natural that mr spalding must have omitted to observe mr glascock be not delighted by lecture on american constitution formed so large part of ordinary conversation with englishman happened one afternoon that be thrown together so closely for nearly hour that must avoid other be at old palace in italian parliament be held be kept waiting during long delay in ceremony of place be seated next to other during such delay there be nothing for to talk on other side of of be stranger not to talk in such circumstance must be to quarrel mr glascock began by asking after lady be quite well sir thank said minister hope that lord peterborough be pretty well when last heard from naples mr glascock mr glascock explained that father condition be not much altered then there be silence for moment niece will remain with through spring suppose said mr glascock such be intention sir seem to like florence think yes yes think do like florence see capital sir perhaps under more favourable circumstance than be accorded to most of countrywoman republican simplicity mr glascock have drawback away from home subject somewhat to cold shade of unobserved obscurity that posse merit much more than compensate for trifling evil must be last man in europe to deny be to be observed that american citizen be always prone to talk of europe affords best counterpoise know to other term america america united state be of course same to speak of france of england a weighing equally against own country seems to american to be absurdity almost insult to with europe can compare even be done generally in style of republican browning when addressed ancient marble undoubtedly said mr glascock family of minister abroad have great advantage in seeing country to be accredited that be meaning sir a be remarking carry with a people external symbol of standing at home wife daughter sir of most honoured of citizen have nomenclature different from belongs to least noted among be perhaps consequence of european who be accustomed in social intercourse to assistance of title will not always trouble to inquire who be american citizen who may sit opposite to at table have known mr glascock wife daughter of gentleman who have be thrice sent a senator from native state to washington to remain a disregarded in intercourse of european city a though have formed part of family of grocer from russell square let miss spaldings go where will said mr glascock will not fare in way miss spaldings sir be very much obliged to said minister with bow regard a one of luckiest chance of life be thrown in with at st michael a be said mr glascock with something like warmth be sure sir will never forget courtesy displayed by on occasion said minister bowing again be matter of course friend must have done same for grocer wife daughter of whom spoke little service such a come from appreciation of merit be simply payment of debt due by men to woman such be certainly rule of living in country sir said mr spalding chance be continued englishman that further observation follows payment of such debt have be thing of course delight to think so mr glascock in own city in instance have given rise to one of pleasantest a hope most enduring friendship have ever formed said mr glascock with enthusiasm what must american minister do bow again three time what other meaning must attach to such word than so many of friend have be attributing to mr glascock for week past have occurred to mr spalding even since have be sitting in present close proximity to mr glascock that might possibly be duty a uncle having to deal with englishman to ask gentleman what be intention must do duty let be what might asking of such question must be very disagreeable to for present satisfied with inviting neighbour to come drink tea with mr spalding on next evening one girl will be delighted be sure said thinking to be justified in friendly familiarity by mr glascock enthusiasm for mr spalding be clearly of opinion let value of republican simplicity be what might alliance with crumbling marble of europe must in niece circumstance be not inexpedient mr glascock accepted invitation with alacrity minister when be closeted with wife that evening declared opinion that after britisher meant fighting aunt told girl mr glascock be coming in order that might not seem that net be being specially spread for others be invited to join party miss petrie consented to be there italian count buonarosci to whose presence though must not speak to mr spalding be becoming accustomed be painful to to feel that must not communicate with around for reason must have avoided italian have idea that must not thoroughly realise advantage of foreign travel unless lived with foreigner therefore be glad to become intimate at rate with outside of count buonarosci think uncle be wrong dear said miss petrie early in day to friend why have done nothing more than what be just civil if mr glascock kept store in broadway must not have thought necessary to shew same civility yes if liked mr glascock who kept store caroline said poetess with severe

learned to decorate with name of tenant caroline spalding have spirit of own have already made up mind that must not be talked down by miss petrie uncle jonas said asks because like must do so too if kept store in broadway if did keep store perhaps must not like trow not said miss petrie livy be much more comfortable in tactic without consulting anybody sent for hairdresser be very well for wallachia said livy miss petrie name be wallachia know nice sort of man when see way of world be not to be altered because wally writes poetry when mr glascock be announced mr spalding handsome room be almost filled a room in florence be filled obstruction in avenue crowd in corner block at doorway not being among custom of place mr spalding immediately caught intercepting between passage lady engaged at once in conversation john s mill be great man said minister tell so said mr glascock read what writes acknowledgment seemed to minister to be almost disgraceful yet have never read word of mr mill writing be far seeing man continued minister be one of few european who can look forward see how river of civilization be running on have understood that woman must at last be put upon equality with men can manage that men will have baby said mr glascock thinking to escape by attempt at playfulness minister be down upon at once have by lappet of coat though knew how important be for dear niece that must allow mr glascock to amuse evening after fashion have answer ready sir for difficulty said step aside with for moment question be important must be glad if must communicate idea to great philosopher nature sir have laid down certain law be immutable against mr glascock have not come to florence for there be circumstance in present position made feel that must be gratified in escaping even at cost of seeming incivility must go in to lady at once said will never get word with there came across minister brow momentary frown of displeasure a though felt that be being robbed of be justly own for instant grasp fixed more tightly to coat be quite within scope of courage to hold struggling listener by physical strength remembered that there be purpose relaxed hold will take opportunity said minister a have raised that somewhat trite objection of bearing of child in country sir have altogether got over must put in possession of view on subject will find occasion then mr glascock began to reflect whether american lady married in england must probably want to see much of uncle in adopted country mr spalding be smile when guest reached did not mean to have crowd of people said whispering know how one thing lead to people here really like short invitation then minister wife bowed very low to italian lady for moment wished in beacon street be great trouble to that must not pluck up courage to speak word in italian know more about than be glib enough must say to niece livy tuscan be so particular with bocca toscana be almost spiteful on part of miss petrie manner in on evening remained close to friend caroline spalding be hardly possible to believe that came altogether from high principle from determination to save friend from impending danger one friend have right to decide for one what be what be not dangerous mr glascock after awhile found seated on fixed couch that ran along wall between carry spalding miss petrie miss petrie be almost a bad to a have be minister be afraid said looking up into face with severity rushing upon subject with audacity that work of browning have not be received in country with veneration to be entitled do mean mr mr browning asked mr glascock perhaps with mistaken idea that lady be out of depth did not know difference for be one same indivisible spirit germ of be so reflected in outcome of other that one see only result of so perfect combination one be tempted to acknowledge that here there marriage may have be arranged in heaven think that in country have perceived mr glascock be not quite sure that have said mr glascock yours be not altogether inglorious mission continued miss petrie have got mission said mr glascock from foreign office from own inner conviction miss petrie laughed with scornful laugh spoke sir of mission of small speck on earth broad surface of think so much call great britain do think good deal of said mr glascock have be more thought of than other speck of same size said carry spalding true said miss petrie sharply because of iron coal mission spoke of be put forth hand with artistic motion a spoke utters prophecy though can not read sends forth truth though can not understand though own ear be deaf a adder be nursery of poet who sing not for own countryman for higher sensibility newer intelligence of land in philanthropy have made education a common a air be breathed wally said olivia coming up to poetess in anger be almost apparent want to take introduce to marchesa pulti miss petrie doubt knew that eldest son of english lord be at least a good a italian marchesa let come here said poetess with grandest smile chapter lvi withered grass illustration when caroline spalding perceived how direct attempt have be made by sister to take poetess away in order that might thus be left alone with mr glascock spirit revolted against manoeuvre took away amidst crowd if mr glascock must wish to find again must do so there came across mind something of half formed idea that perhaps after friend wallachia be right be man ready to take ready to be taken must such arrangement be happy one for of high born wealthy friend might very probably despise be quite possible that also might despise to be lady peterborough have spending of large fortune must not suffice for happiness be sure of that must be leap in dark such leap must need be dangerous therefore must be avoided did like man friend be untrue to cruel in allusion to tinkling cymbal might be well for to get over liking to think more of one who be to foreigner stranger of whose way of living in own home knew so little whose people might be antipathetic to enemy instead of friend among whom life must be one long misery be not on ground that miss petrie have recommended to start for rome a soon a mr glascock have reached florence there be reason said to herself why must not marry man if like even though be lord of must not be least afraid be woman fear then called to mind that have ever heard of english countess duchess thought that knew that be generally cold proud very little given to receive outsider graciously within rank mr glascock have aunt who be duchess sister who must be countess caroline spalding felt how back must rise against new relation if must come to pas that must look unkindly upon when be taken to own home how must fight with giving scorn for scorn how unutterably miserable must be how must long to be back among own equal in spite even of love for husband how grand thing be said to be equal with whom love yet be to extent allured by social position of man must perceive that have charm of manner countryman lacked have read perhaps le than uncle knew perhaps le than most of men with whom have be wont to associate in own city life at home be not braver more virtuous more self denying than there be softness ease in manner be palatable to absence of too visible effort of intellect be so apt to mark mar conversation of american almost wished that have be english in order that man home friend might have suited be thinking of a stood pretending to talk to american lady who be very eloquent on delight of florence in meantime olivia mr glascock have moved away together miss petrie be left alone be injury to miss petrie a mind at once set to work on sonnet touching frivolity of modern social gathering when complained afterwards to caroline that be curse of mode of life that moment must be allowed for thought in referred specially to few word mr gore have addressed to at moment of meditation be not wilfully hypocrite be painfully turning second set of rhyme really believed that have be subjected to hardship in meantime olivia mr glascock be discussing at distance be being put through facing mr glascock olivia have said well yes dear friend miss petrie be rather stern examiner be carry ally not mine said olivia then remembered that by saying might be doing sister injury mr glascock might object to bosom friend for wife be to say of course be intimate with just at moment carry be most in favour be very clever be quite sure said oh yes be genius must not doubt that on peril of making american in italy enemy be poet be not mr glascock have said anything wrong asked do mean to look in face tell that be not acquainted with work that know page of by heart that sleep with under pillow travel about with in dressing bag be afraid have mistaken mr glascock be so great sin if will own up honestly will tell something in whisper have not read word of poem not word have be horrible perhaps if heard tennyson talking day must read tennyson familiarity doe breed contempt doe then poor dear wallachia be such bore sometimes wonder when english people be listening to whether think that american girl generally talk like not perhaps with perfected eloquence dare say do continued olivia craftily be just way in people form opinion about foreigner specially self asserting american speaks mind louder than other people then say that american be self asserting be little way given miss spalding because be always called upon to answer accusation against expressed unexpressed think bit better than if truth be known half a good be always struggling to be a polished easy a french a sensible dignified a english when defect be thrown in teeth who throw in teeth miss spalding look of if speak out do assume superiority mr glascock that can not endure feel that assume anything said mr glascock meekly if three gentleman be together englishman frenchman american be not american obliged to be on mettle to prove that be somebody among three admit that be always claiming to be first doe so only that may not be too evidently last if knew mr glascock must find to be very mild humble nice good clever kind charitable beautiful in short finest people have a yet be created on broad face of god smiling earth last word pronounced with nasal twang in tone of voice almost seemed to to be direct mimicry of american minister upshot of conversation however be that disgust against american to certain degree have be excited in mr glascock mind by united effort of mr spalding poetess have be almost entirely dispelled from of reader ought to understand miss olivia spalding be very clever young woman nevertheless mr glascock have not quite made up mind to ask elder sister to be wife be one of men to whom love making doe not come very easy although be never so much at ease a when be in company with lady be sorely in want of wife be aware that at different period during last fifteen year have be angled for a fish mother in england have tried to catch of such mother have come to have strongest possible detestation have seen hook perhaps have fancied that saw when be not there lady janes lady sarah have be hard upon till learned to buckle into triple armour when went amongst yet wanted wife man more sorely wanted one reader will perhaps remember how went down to nuncombe putney in quest of wife in vain lady in case have be so explicit with that must not hope for more favourable answer indeed must not have cared to marry girl who have told that preferred man to even if have be possible for to do so now have met lady very different from with whom have hitherto associated not le manifestly lady caroline spalding be bright pleasant attractive very easy to talk to yet quite able to hold own american minister be bore miss petrie be unbearable have often told that in matter of marrying wife must please altogether that must allow to be tied down by consideration of family pride that must consult nothing own heart feeling a for rank must give to wife a for money have plenty of also wanted woman be not blasee with world be not fool who must respect more thought of more sure be that have seen none who pleased so well a caroline spalding yet be little afraid of taking step must be irrevocable perhaps american minister might express wish to end day at monkhams might think desirable to have miss petrie always with a private secretary in poetry between mr glascock spark of sympathy doe not pas with strong flash said voice in ear a turned round rapidly to face foe be quite sure for moment under possible circumstance must ever take american woman to bosom a wife said rather think that agree with antipathy be one continued miss petrie have be common on face of earth since clown first trod upon courtier heel be instinct of fallen man to hate equality to desire ascendancy to crush to oppress to tyrannise to enslave then when slave be at last free in freedom demand equality man be not great enough to take enfranchised brother to bosom mean negro said mr glascock looking round planning for mode of escape not negro only not enslaved black who be now enslaved no more rising nation of white men wherever be to be seen english have sympathy with people who claim to be at least equal clown have trod upon courtier heel till clown be clown no longer courtier have hardly court in may dangle sword knot if so clown might a well spare courtier not meaning rebuke word implied ah h clown will not spare courtier mr glascock understand gibe tell that courtier will be spared no longer because be useless will be cut down together with withered grass thrown into oven there will be end of then turned round to appeal to american gentleman who have joined mr glascock made escape hold to be holiest duty owe to country never to spare one of when meet be very well in way said american gentleman down with down with exclaimed poetess with beautiful enthusiasm in meantime mr glascock have made up mind that must not dare to ask caroline spalding to be wife there be certain form of american female so dreadful that wise man must wilfully come in contact with miss petrie ferocity be distressing to eloquence enthusiasm be worse even than ferocity personal incivility of have be guilty in calling withered grass be distasteful to a being opposed to idea of custom of society what must be fate if wife chosen friend must be for ever dinning denunciation of withered grass into ear be still thinking of when be accosted by mr spalding be going to dear lady banbury to morrow asked lady banbury be wife of english minister suppose will be there in course of evening how very nice be be not do like lady banbury so soft gentle kind one of pleasantest old lady know said mr glascock doe not strike so much a doe said mr spalding with one of sweetest smile truth be value what have not got there be lady banburys in country therefore think more of when meet here be talking of going to rome for carnival have asked caroline to go with be so pleased to find that dear girl be such favourite mr glascock immediately told that saw hook if be to be fished for by american aunt a have be fished for by english mother pleasure in society of caroline spalding must be at once over must be too much indeed if in american household be to find old vice of aristocracy superadded to young republican sin nevertheless lady banbury be a knew well person whose opinion about young people be supposed to be very good noticed only who be worthy of notice to have be taken by hand by lady banbury be acknowledged to be passport into good society if caroline spalding be in truth going to rome with lady banbury that fact be in great confirmation of mr glascock good opinion of mr spalding have perhaps understood have not understood that having just hinted that be so must have abstained from saying word more about dear girl clever well practised must indeed be hand of fisherwoman in matrimonial water who be able to throw fly without showing glimpse of hook to fish for whom angle poor mr spalding though with kindly instinct towards niece did on occasion make slight attempt at angling be innocent of concerted plan seemed to to be so natural to say good word in praise of niece to man whom believed to be in love with niece caroline mr glascock did not meet other again till late in evening just a be about to take leave a came together of involuntarily looked round to see whether miss petrie be near have be there nothing must have be said beyond shortest farewell greeting miss petrie be afar off electrifying italian by vehemence of sentiment audacious volubility of language in arbitrary restriction be ignored be going asked well believe be since saw last have encountered miss petrie again be rather depressed ah know if did must laugh at laugh at indeed do when be told that be to be thrown into oven burned because be such worn out old institution mean to say that mind that not much when come up in ordinary course of conversation pall upon one when be asserted for fourth fifth time in evening ala ala exclaimed miss spalding with mock energy why ala because be so impossible to make oil vinegar of old world of new mix together suit other think be impossible miss spalding fear so be so terribly tender be always pinching on most tender spot never meet without treading on gouty toe think toe be gouty said apologise to own individually mr glascock must assert that nationally be subject to gout be when be told over over again that be to be cut down thrown into oven never mind oven now mr glascock if friend have be over zealous will beg pardon for doe seem to indeed doe with reverence partiality have for everything european word european be offence to shewed that be so by countenance that idiosyncrasy of of be so radically different that can not be made to amalgamate sympathise with other thoroughly paused for second before answered be so evident by manner that be going to speak that must neither leave interrupt have thought that might have be otherwise said at last tone of voice be so changed a to make know that be in earnest did not change voice by single note be afraid can not be so said speaking after old fashion half in earnest half in banter may make up mind to be very civil to other when meet threat of oven may doubt be dropped on side may abstain from expressing in word sense of inferiority never expressed anything of kind said quite in anger be taking simply a sample englishman not a mr glascock who helped sister over mountain such of a have to meet in society may agree to be very courteous courtesy cordiality be not only not same be incompatible why so courtesy be effort cordiality be free must be allowed to contradict friend love assent too often falsely to what be said to by passing acquaintance in spite of what scripture say think be one of greatest privilege of brother that may call brother fool will desire to call husband fool husband will suppose be at least a dear to a brother never have brother sister then be same suppose if be to have husband hope must be dearest to of unless be so certainly must not be husband between man wife there doe not spring up playful violent intimacy admitting of liberty come from early nursery association then there be difference of sex must not like wife to call fool said hope may never have occasion to do so mr glascock english wife in own class a of course will then will be safe have set heart fast on marrying american wife said then ca tell what may befall be like enough if do that that may be called by name will think hard to bear will think better of like must pair with like mr glascock if be to marry one of young woman must lose in dignity a much a must lose in comfort then parted went off to say farewell to other guest manner in have answered what have said to have certainly be of nature to stop further speech of same kind have be gentle with then must certainly have told that be american woman whom desired to take with to home in england chapter lvii dorothy fate towards end of february sir peter mancrudy declared miss

priscilla must by mean admit knew priscilla mind in matter be sure that priscilla advice whatever might be must be given without regard to aunt view then dorothy be altogether ignorant of aunt view aunt have be very anxious that must marry mr gibson have clearly never admitted into mind idea that might possibly marry brooke burgess seemed to that must be dishonest to aunt to lover if be to bind man to herself without aunt knowledge be to be aunt heir be maintained by aunt liberality thinking of at last resolved that must take bull by horn tell aunt felt that task must be one almost beyond strength thrice went into aunt room intending to make clean breast thrice courage failed left room with tale untold excusing on various pretext aunt have seemed to be not quite so well have declared to be tired have be little cross else martha have come in at nick of time there be brooke burgess letter unanswered letter be read night morning be never for instant out of mind have demanded reply

be wife illustration brooke want to be wife what can not be more surprised than have be aunt stanbury there have be fault of mine believe said old woman now may read letter said dorothy standing up be quite prepared to be obedient felt that aunt manner of receiving information be almost insult must be fool said miss stanbury be hard to bear colour went came rapidly across dorothy cheek a gave few moment to prepare answer already perceived that aunt must be altogether adverse to marriage that therefore marriage must never take place have never for moment allowed to think otherwise nevertheless blow be heavy on know how constantly hope expectation will rise high within own bosom in opposition to own judgment how become sanguine in regard to event almost know can never come to pas so have be with dorothy heart have be almost in flutter of happiness since have have brooke letter in possession yet never ceased to declare to herself own conviction that letter must lead to good result in regard to own wish on subject have never asked single question a have be quite beyond power to bring to endure idea of marrying mr gibson so have be quite impossible to not to long to be brooke wife from moment in suggestion to effect have fallen from lip be state of thing so certain so much matter of course that though have not spoken word to in owned love have never for moment doubted that knew truth that everybody else concerned must know too did not suppose that wish must go for anything with aunt brooke burgess be to become rich man a aunt heir aunt must of course have own idea about brooke advancement in life be quite prepared to submit without quarrelling when aunt must tell that idea must not be entertained order might be given prohibition might be pronounced without insult to own feeling a woman must be fool miss stanbury have said dorothy took time to collect thought before must reply in meantime aunt finished reading of letter may be foolish in dorothy said think must call fool will call what please suppose be going on at time when refused gibson nothing be going on nothing have gone on at said dorothy with a much indignation a be able to assume how can tell that be untruth be not untruth said dorothy almost sobbing driven at same time to much anger do mean to say that be first ever heard of held out letter shaking in thin hand have never said so aunt stanbury yes did said that nothing be going on when mr gibson be if choose to suspect aunt stanbury will go away wo stay here if suspect when brooke spoke to told must like of course like gave reason why did not like there be nothing more till letter came must help writing to be fault psha if be angry be very sorry have right to be angry go on dorothy go on be so weak that can hardly stir be first moment have be out of bed for week of course can say what please know what will be will have to take to bed again then in very little time can both make fool of yourselves just a like be argument against dorothy of course found to be quite impossible to make continued combat must only shuffle letter back into pocket be if possible more assiduous than ever in attention to invalid knew that have be treated most unjustly there must be question to be answered a soon a aunt must be well a to possibility of remaining in close subject to such injustice let aunt say what might do what might dorothy must not leave for present miss stanbury sat for considerable time quite motionless with eye closed did not stir make sign of life till dorothy touched arm asking whether must not take broth have be prepared for where martha why doe not martha come said miss stanbury be hard blow from moment dorothy believed that must be expedient that must return to nuncombe putney broth however be taken while dorothy sat by in silence only one word further be said that evening by miss stanbury about brooke love affair there must be nothing more about dorothy remember that nothing at wo have dorothy made reply brooke letter be in pocket must be answered that night on following day must let aunt know what have said to brooke aunt must not see letter must be made acquainted with purport in reference to brooke proposal of marriage wo have have be aunt command what right have aunt to give command upon matter then crossed dorothy mind a thought of glimmering of idea that one can be entitled to issue command who can not enforce obedience if brooke chose to become man wife by mutual consent how must aunt prohibit marriage then there followed idea that command be enforced by threatening if necessary by enforcement of penalty aunt have within hand penalty of dorothy be afraid on own behalf have power of inflicting terrible punishment on brooke burgess now dorothy conceived that must be meanest creature alive if be actuated by fear a to money in acceptance rejection of man whom loved a did brooke burgess brooke have income of own seemed to to be ample for purpose must have be sordid in did not seem to to have stain of sordidness for be man be bound to be rich if must moreover what have to offer in poor thing a be to make compensation to for loss of fortune aunt must inflict penalty therefore power be hers power must be obeyed must write to brooke in manner must convey to firm decision not le on account must let aunt know that thought to have be ill used be insult to most ill natured insult that telling that brooke have be fool for loving then accusation against of having be false of having given one reason for refusing mr gibson while there be reason in heart of having be cunning then untrue be not to be endured what must aunt think of if be to bear such allegation without indignant protest must write letter speak mind to aunt a soon a aunt must be well enough to hear a have resolved wrote letter night before went to bed wrote with flood of tear bitterness of heart almost conquered too have heard of love have be taught to feel that success failure of woman life depended upon that whether did whether did not by such gift a god might have given to attract to herself man strong enough good enough loving enough to make straight for path to bear for burden to be father of child staff on might lean wall against might grow feeling sunshine sheltered from wind have ever estimated own value so lowly a to have told often that such success must never come in way from earliest year have regarded a outside pale within such joy be to be found have so strictly taught to look forward to blank existence that have learned to do so without active misery not le did know where happiness lay when good thing came almost within reach when seemed that god have given gift might have sufficed when man have sought hand whose nature be such that must have leaned on with true worship must have grown against a against wall with perfect confidence must have lain with head upon bosom have felt that of spot in world be most fitting for when be grasped must yet be abandoned there came upon spirit agony so bitter that have not before known how great might be depth of human disappointment letter be at last written when finished be a follows close exeter march dear brooke there have be many doubt about at last be conquered name be written have shown letter to aunt a be sure will think be best must have answered before only that thought that be not quite well enough to talk about say a be sure must that what propose be quite out of question be aware that be bound to obey a think that also ought to do so will think more of what have said to have written be quite impossible now even if might have be possible under other circumstance will always remember great kindness to perhaps ought to say that be very grateful for compliment have paid will think of always till die believe to be very sincere friend dorothy stanbury next day miss stanbury again came out of room on third day be manifestly becoming stronger dorothy have a yet not spoken of letter be prepared to do so a soon a thought that fitting opportunity have come have word two to say for must not again subject to being told that be taking will of aunt because aunt be too ill to defend on third day miss stanbury asked question have written anything to brooke asked have answered letter aunt stanbury what have said to have told that disapproved of that nothing more must be said about yes of course made out to be ogre know what mean by aunt be sure that told truth may see letter have gone have kept copy said miss stanbury yes have got copy replied dorothy must rather not shew

what young woman in day have come to continued miss stanbury there be respect subjection obedience too often modesty doe that mean aunt stanbury asked dorothy to tell truth dorothy think ought to have be receiving love letter from brooke burgess when be lying ill in bed did expect of tell fairly did expect of then dorothy spoke out mind a think that aunt stanbury have better go away if please will when be well enough to spare pray think of at said aunt a for love letter mr burgess have written to once think that there can be anything immodest in opening letter when come by post a soon a have determined to shew to a for what happened before when mr burgess spoke to be long long after about mr gibson be over told that must be so thought there must be no more about be so ill must not tell now know have not seen letter to will never shew to anybody have said thing aunt stanbury be very cruel of course everything say be wrong have told that be telling untruth have called immodest be terrible word must deserve then never have deserved wo bear wo if hugh heard called that word believe 'd tear house down hugh indeed be to be brought in between be be brother of course be obliged to think of if please will go home a soon a be well enough to spare quickly after there be very many letter coming going between house in close lady at nuncombe putney hugh stanbury brooke burgess correspondent of brooke burgess be of course miss stanbury letter to hugh to nuncombe putney be written by dorothy of former need be told nothing at present moment upshot of poor dolly letter be that on tenth of march be to return home to nuncombe putney share once more sister bed mother poverty abandon comfort of close before became definite arrangement miss stanbury have given way in certain small degree have acknowledged that dorothy have intended no harm be not enough for dorothy who be conscious of harm either done intended did not specify term require specifically that aunt must make apology for word immodest at least withdraw resolved that must go unless be most absolutely declared to have be applied to without slightest reason felt moreover that aunt house ought to be open to brooke burgess that must not be open to so went having resided under aunt roof between nine ten month good bye aunt stanbury said dorothy kissing aunt with tear in eye sob in throat good bye dear good bye miss stanbury a pressed niece hand left in bank note be much obliged aunt be indeed 'd rather not bank note be left on parlour table chapter lviii dorothy at home dorothy be received at home with so much affection such expression of esteem a to afford much consolation in misery mother sister approved of conduct mr stanbury approval be indeed accompanied by many expression of regret a to good thing lost be fully alive to fact that life in close at exeter be better for daughter than life in little cottage at nuncombe putney outward appearance dorothy bore on return home be proof of clothes set of hair very gesture motion have framed on town idea faded wildered washed out look uncertain purposeless bearing have come from secluded life subjection to sister have vanished from have lived among people have learned something of gait carriage money know will do almost everything doubt money have have much to do with be very pretty to talk of alluring simplicity of clean calico gown poverty will shew to be meagre dowdy draggled in woman dress let woman be ever so simple ever so neat ever so independent ever so high hearted mr stanbury be quite alive to that younger daughter be losing have not received two offer of marriage while be at exeter there be possibility that offer of marriage must be made in cottage at nuncombe putney man within wall of cottage must have be considered a much out of place a wild bull have be matter of deep regret to mr stanbury that daughter must not have found able to marry mr gibson knew that there be matter for reproach in be misfortune great misfortune in mother breast there have be sad unrepressed feeling of regret that young people must so often lose chance in world through over fancifulness ignorance a to own good now when heard story of brooke burgess must not think that have dorothy remained at exeter enduring patiently such hard word a aunt might speak love affair might have be brought at future time to happy conclusion did not say there came on silent melancholy made expressive by constant little shaking of head continued reproachful sadness of demeanour be quite a intelligible to priscilla a must have be spoken word priscilla approval of sister conduct be clear outspoken satisfactory have be quite sure that sister have be right about mr gibson be equally sure that be now right about brooke burgess priscilla have in mind idea that if b b a called be half a good a sister represented to be for indeed dorothy endowed with virtue consistent with humanity must not be deterred from pursuit by dolly letter by aunt stanbury command of thought wise to say nothing paid dolly warm hitherto unaccustomed compliment of equality assuming to regard sister judgment persistent independence to be equally strong with own a knew well must not have gone further than never will agree with about aunt stanbury said to seems to be so imperious so exacting also so unjust a to be unbearable be affectionate said dolly so be dog bite for aught know horse kick be ill living with biting dog kicking horse matter little a be still own mistress how strange nine month have be with in exeter while have be at clock house here be together again in old way just a though nothing have happened dorothy knew well that great deal have happened that life must never be a have be heretofore very tone in sister spoke to be proof of have infinitely greater possession in herself than have belonged to before residence at exeter possession be so heavily mortgaged so burthened a to make believe that change be to be regretted at end of first week there came letter from aunt stanbury to dorothy began by saying that dolly have left behind certain small property have now be made up in parcel sent by railway carriage paid be mine at said dolly alluding to certain book in have taken delight mean to give to said priscilla think must take shawl be more mine than be yours though wore two three time in winter priscilla be of opinion that shawl must be taken also then letter spoke of writer health at last fell into strain of confidential gossip mr stanbury when read must not understand that there have be quarrel martha say that saw camilla french in street to day guy in new finery a never be seen before except on may day then in postscript dorothy be enjoined to answer letter quickly none of short scrap dear said aunt stanbury must mean to go back to said mr stanbury doubt doe said priscilla dolly need not go because aunt mean be not creature dorothy answered aunt letter in spirit in have be written asked after aunt health thanked aunt for gift of book in of name have be clearly written protested about shawl sent love to martha kind regard to jane expressed hope that c f enjoyed new clothes described cottage be funny about cabbage stump in garden at last succeeded in concocting long epistle suppose there will be regular correspondence said priscilla two day afterwards however correspondence took altogether form cottage in now lived be supposed to be beyond beat of wooden legged postman therefore be necessary that must call at post office for letter on morning in question priscilla obtained thick letter from exeter for mother knew that have come from aunt aunt must hardly have found necessary to correspond with dorothy mother so soon after letter to dorothy have be written have there not arisen very peculiar cause priscilla after much meditation thought better that letter must be opened in dorothy absence in dorothy absence following letter be read by priscilla mother close march dear sister stanbury after much consideration think best to send under cover to enclosed letter from mr brooke burgess intended for daughter dorothy will see have opened read a be clearly entitled to do letter having be addressed to niece while be supposed to be under care like to destroy letter though perhaps must be best must advise to do so if be possible without shewing to dorothy have told mr brooke burgess what have done have also told can not sanction marriage between daughter there be many reason of old date not to speak of present reason also must make such marriage highly inexpedient mr brooke burgess be of course own master daughter understands completely how matter stand yours truly jemima stanbury what wicked old woman said priscilla then there arose question whether must read brooke letter whether must give unread to dorothy priscilla denounced aunt in strongest language must use for having broken seal 'clearly entitled ' because dorothy have be living with exclaimed priscilla can have proper conception of honour of honesty have more right to open dorothy letter than have to take money mr stanbury be very anxious to read brooke letter alleging that must then be able to judge whether must be handed over to dorothy priscilla sense of right must not admit of dorothy must receive letter from lover with further stain from unauthorised eye than to have be already subjected be called in therefore from kitchen whole packet be given to aunt have read enclosure dolly have not opened dorothy took packet without word sat down first read aunt letter very slowly understand perfectly said folding up almost listlessly while brooke letter lay still unopened on lap then took up held awhile in hand while mother priscilla watched priscilla said do read first priscilla be immediately at side kissing darling said be for to read then dorothy took precious content from envelope opened fold of paper when have read dozen word eye be so suffused with tear that must hardly make herself mistress of content of letter knew that contained renewed assurance of lover love assurance on part that must take refusal from based on other ground than of own indifference to have written to miss stanbury to same effect have not thought necessary to explain to dorothy did miss stanbury in letter tell that have received communication from will read now said priscilla a soon a dorothy again allowed letter to fall into lap priscilla mr stanbury read for awhile sat with two letter among without much speech about mr stanbury be endeavouring to make believe that sister in law opposition might be overcome that then dorothy might be married priscilla be inquiring of whether must be well that dorothy must defy aunt so much at rate must be well marry man even to deprivation of old woman fortune priscilla have doubt about being very strong in idea of self denial that sister must put up with bitterest disappointment rather than injure man loved be right then must also be so extremely right to defy aunt stanbury to teeth dorothy in whose character be mixed with mother softness much of old stanbury strength have doubt in mind be very sweet to be so loved what gratitude did not owe to man who be so true to what be that must stand in way to lay down might be crushed in path be more than owed to mr stanbury be first to speak suppose be very good young man said be sure be noble true hearted man said priscilla why must marry whom plea a long a be respectable said mr stanbury in people eye poverty be more disreputable than vice said priscilla aunt have be so fond of dorothy pleaded mr stanbury just a be of servant said priscilla dorothy said nothing heart be too full to enable to defend aunt at present moment be strong enough to make mother understand that hope be to be entertained in course of day walked out with sister on road towards ridleigh there standing among rock fern looking down upon river with buzz of little mill within ear explained feeling of heart many thought with flow of word stronger a priscilla thought than have ever used before be not what must suffer now pris what must feel what must feel ten twenty year hence when must know that child must have be provided for have not lost fortune by marrying must be only judge whether prefers to old woman money said priscilla dear not only judge be that pris not like

sir marmaduke lady rowley be to reach england about end of march beginning of april mr trevelyan nora rowley be almost sick for arrival uncle aunt have done very much for have be true to in need have submitted to endless discomfort in order that niece might have respectable shelter in great need nevertheless conduct have not be of kind to produce love friendship of sister felt that have be much better off at nuncombe putney that weakness of mr stanbury hardness of priscilla be preferable to repulsive forbearance of clerical host did not scold never threw in mr trevelyan teeth that have be separated from husband by own fault did not tell of own discomfort showed in gesture spoke of in tone of voice so that mr trevelyan must not refrain from apologising for misfortune of presence dear said thing ca be pleasant unpleasant at same time be quite right to come here be glad for sake that sir marmaduke will be with so soon have almost given up in mind hope that have long cherished that might day be able to live again with husband step now took in reference to seemed to be prompted by so bitter hostility that must not believe that be hateful to how be possible that husband wife must again come together when there have be between emissary a detective policeman mr trevelyan have gradually come to learn that bozzle have be at nuncombe putney watching to be aware that be still under surveillance of eye for month past now have seen colonel osborne heard from have certainly by folly done much to produce ruin have fallen upon never occurred to to blame indeed did not know that be liable to blame mr outhouse always spoke of with indignant scorn nora have learned to think that much of misery be due to imprudence mr trevelyan must not see not seeing be more widely separated from husband than must have be have acknowledged that excuse for misconduct have be afforded by vanity folly of other man lady rowley have written to have furnished house taken for from first of april house have be secured in manchester street situation in question be not one be of very charming be supposed to be in high degree fashionable nora looked forward to escape from st diddulph to manchester street a though paradise be to be re opened to a soon a must be there with father mother be quite clear now a to course about hugh stanbury did not doubt that must so argue matter a to get consent of father mother felt to be altogether altered in view of life since experience have come upon first at nuncombe putney after much more heavily seriously at st diddulph looked back a though to childish dream to idea have prevailed with when have told a used to do so frequently that be unfit to be poor man wife why must be more unfit for position than of course there be many thought in mind much of memory if nothing of regret in regard to mr glascock splendour have be offered to have have chance of being rich man wife have rejected have rejected twice with eye open reader will say that if loved hugh stanbury with heart there must be nothing of regret in reflection be perhaps accustomed in judging for ourselves of others to draw line too sharply to say that on side lie vice folly heartlessness greed on other honour love truth wisdom good bad in own domain good bad mix so thoroughly in thought even in aspiration that must look for excellence rather in overcoming evil than in freeing from influence there have be many moment of regret with nora none of remorse at very moment in have sent mr glascock away from have felt that have now be sent away for always have be full of regret since that there have be many hour in have thought of own self lesson of teaching by have striven to convince that must never fitly become poor man wife upshot of be healthy pride in what have done strong resolution that must make shirt hem towel for husband if required have be given to choose have chosen have found unable to tell man that loved when did not love equally unable to conceal love did feel if wheeled barrow of turnip about street 'd marry to morrow said to sister one afternoon a be sitting together in room ought to have be uncle study if wheeled big barrow 'd have to wheel little one said sister then 'd do must mind there have be advantage in st diddulph that nothing can be triste nothing dull nothing ugly after may be so with nora be in imagination what mean be that living here have taught much that never must have learned in curzon street used to think fine young woman upon word think finer one now quite know what mean quite know nearly know do know have made up own mind about what mean to do will change dear when mamma be here thing be comfortable again be belief that mr glascock must come to again to morrow if must let mr trevelyan be naturally in complete ignorance of experience of transatlantic excellence mr glascock have encountered in italy certainly must not let how must be possible after what wrote to hugh might pas away said mr trevelyan slowly after long pause what might pas away have not given distinct promise have not told that loved sworn must be true to can that be made to pas away even if one wished of course can nothing need be fixed for till have stood at altar with man be made wife may choose still can never choose again never will at rate said nora then there be pause seems strange to nora said elder sister after what have seen must be so keen to be married to one be girl to do better drown than do a have done only think what there be before have gone through be nothing to of course must go back to island where else be to live who else will take come to said nora nora who be in way must be possible papa will be here perhaps for six month nora thought quite possible that might have home of own before six month be passed even though might be wheeling smaller barrow must not say so by time everything must be decided suppose must of course papa mamma must go back said mr trevelyan papa might take pension be entitled to pension now will never do that a long a can have employment will go back must go with who else must take in know who must take in emily darling be romance a for myself must not care where went if be even to remain here must bear must not said nora decisively be so different with dear suppose be possible must take boy with to island how be to go anywhere without then broke down fell into paroxysm of sob be in very truth broken hearted woman nora be silent for minute at last spoke why do not go back to emily how be to go back to what be to do to make take back at very moment trevelyan be in house did not know write to said nora what be to say in very truth do believe that be mad if write to must defend accuse dozen time have striven to write letter not might send that might find what must say must ever wish to send be impossible can only tell how unjust have be how cruel how mad how wicked must not say to simply 'let be together wherever may be let bygone be bygone while be watching with policeman while be still thinking that entertain lover while belief that be base thing that have dared to think have never believed then how can be such villain a to treat like must not go to nora not unless went to a one who be known to be mad over whom in wretched condition must be duty to keep watch in other way must overcome abhorrence of outrage to have subjected for child sake emily ah yes if be simply to grovel in dust before must be done if humiliation must suffice self abasement be possible to must be false if said that look forward to such possibility how can wish to have back again after what have said done be wife have disgraced before men by own word what have done must not have done what left undone on behalf must have done be hard that foolish working of weak man mind must be able so completely to ruin prospect of woman life nora be beginning to answer by attempting to shew that husband madness be perhaps only temporary when there came knock at door mr outhouse be at once in room will be well that reader must know what have taken place at parsonage while two sister have be together up stair so that nature of mr outhouse mission to may explain mr outhouse have be in closet down stair when maid servant brought word to that mr trevelyan be in parlour be desirous of seeing mr trevelyan said unfortunate clergyman holding up hand servant understood tragic importance of occasion quite a well a did master simply shook head have mistress seen said master girl again shook head ask mistress to come to said clergyman then girl disappeared in few minute mr outhouse equally imbued with tragic element of day be with husband mr outhouse began by declaring that consideration must induce to see trevelyan commissioned wife to go to man tell that must leave house when unfortunate woman expressed opinion that trevelyan have legal right upon might probably insist mr outhouse asserted roundly that must have legal right to remain in parsonage against will of rector if want to claim wife child must do by law not by force thank god sir marmaduke will be here before can do ca make go said mr outhouse tell that will send for policeman said clergyman have come to pas that there have be message backwards forward between visitor master of house carried by unfortunate lady trevelyan did not demand that wife child must be given up to did not even on occasion demand that boy must be surrendered to now at once did say very repeatedly that of course must have boy seemed to imply under certain circumstance must be willing to take wife to live with again appeared to mr outhouse to be so manifestly one thing be desirable to be only solution of difficulty must be admitted a solution at that went to work on hint ventured to entertain hope that reconciliation might be effected implored husband to lend hand to work by intended to imply that must not only see trevelyan consent to meet sinner on friendly term mr outhouse be on occasion even more than customarily obstinate wife might do what liked must neither meddle make must not willingly see mr trevelyan in own house unless indeed mr trevelyan must attempt to force way up into nursery then said that left doubt on wife mind must violence be attempted husband must manfully join melee soon became evident that such attempt be to be made on day trevelyan be lachrymose heartbroken sight pitiable to behold when mr outhouse loudly asserted that wife have not sinned against in least not in tittle mr trevelyan repeated over over again began to assert declaring that have seen man in devonshire corresponded with since have be at st diddulph when lady have declared that latter assertion be untrue have shaken head have told that perhaps did not know misery of man have effect upon at last proposed to be bearer of message to wife have demanded to see child offering to promise that must not attempt to take boy by force on occasion saying also that claim by law be so good that force must be necessary be proposed by mr outhouse that must first see mother to at last assented how blessed thing must be if two person must be induced to forget trouble of last twelve month once more to love trust other sir said mr outhouse putting hand upon arm must not upbraid for will not bear know nothing of what be due to husband said trevelyan gloomily task be not hopeful nevertheless poor woman resolved to do best now mr outhouse be in niece room asking to go down see husband little louis have at time be with nurse very moment that mother heard that child father be in house jumped up rushed away to get possession of treasure have come for baby nora asked in dismay then mr outhouse anxious to obtain convert to present view boldly declared that mr trevelyan have such intention mr trevelyan came back at once with boy then listened to aunt argument will not take baby with said at last be decided that must go down alone that child must afterwards be taken to father in drawing room mr outhouse pledging that whole household must combine in defence if mr trevelyan must attempt to take child out of room what be to say to asked say a little a possible said mr outhouse except to make understand that have be in error in imputing fault to will never understand said mr trevelyan considerable time elapsed after before must bring to descend stair now that husband be so near that aunt have assured that might reinstate in position if must only abstain from saying hard word to wished that be away from again in italy knew that must not refrain from hard word how be possible that must vindicate own honour without asserting with strength that have be ill used to speak truth on matter love for man have once be true eager have be quelled by treatment have received have clung to love in shape in spite of accusation made against till have heard that policeman have be set upon heel must be possible that woman must love man at least that wife must love husband after such usage a at last crept gently down stair stood at parlour door listened must hear step a paced backwards forward through room looked back must see face of servant peering round from kitchen stair must not endure to be watched in misery thus driven opened parlour door louis said walking into room aunt mary have desired to come to emily exclaimed ran to embraced did not seek to stop did not return kiss

parsonage at st diddulph saying that sir marmaduke lady rowley have reached england on evening of day be to lodge at small family hotel in baker street mr trevelyan nora be to be with leave taking at parsonage be painful a on side there existed feeling affection sympathy be wanting uncle aunt have done duty mr trevelyan nora felt that ought to have be demonstrative cordial in gratitude found impossible to become so rector must not pretend that be glad to be rid of guest there be too last word about money to be spoken be grievous thorn in poor man flesh two bank note however be put upon table knew that unless took must not pay for provision unwelcome visitor have consumed surely there never be man so cruelly ill used a have be mr outhouse in matter such winter a must put in grave said when wife tried to comfort after be gone know that have be very good to said mr trevelyan a sister together with child nurse hurried away towards baker street in cab have never for moment felt that be glad to have how must have be glad to have added afterwards when brought such trouble with to whom be going now must receive with joy must make welcome with load of sorrow must give to sympathy be impossible that must receive from others though might not be happy now for in truth how must be ever really happy again there must be joy to in placing child in mother arm in receiving father warm caress that father must be very vehement in anger against husband knew well for sir marmaduke be vehement man there must be support for in very violence of wrath at moment be such support that most needed a journeyed together in cab married sister seemed to be in higher spirit of two be sure at rate to whom be going must place on side nora have own story to tell about hugh stanbury be by mean so sure that tale must be received with cordial agreement let tell whispered to sister not to night because will have so much to say to will tell mamma to morrow train by rowleys be to reach london be due at station at pm two sister timed despatch from st diddulph so a to enable to reach hotel at eight will be there now before mamma said nora because will have so much luggage so many thing train be always late when started from door of parsonage mr outhouse gave direction to cabman gregg hotel baker street then at once began to console in that be gone be long drive from st diddulph in east to marylebone in west of london none of party in cab knew anything of region through passed cabman took line by back of bank finsbury square city road thinking best probably to avoid crush at holborn hill though at expense of something of circuit of mr trevelyan nora knew nothing have way taken along piccadilly through mayfair across grosvenor square must have known where be at present be not thinking of once much loved locality cab passed angel up down hill at pentonville by king cross station through euston square then turned up gower street surely man must have gone on along new road now that have come so far out of way of two lady knew nothing did nurse be dark windy night lamp in street have given light so that have not noticed night did notice now a street became narrower darker be hardly thinking that journey be yet at end mother be in act of covering boy face a lay asleep on nurse lap when cab be stopped nora looking out through window saw word hotel over doorway be satisfied will take child ma'be said man in black child be handed out nora be first to follow then perceived that door of hotel be not open mr trevelyan followed then looked round child be gone heard rattle of cab a be carried away at gallop round distant corner then inkling of what have happened came upon father have succeeded in getting possession of child be narrow dark street very quiet having about certain air of poor respectability obscure noiseless street without even sign of life unfortunate one have endeavoured here to keep hotel there be hotel kept there now there have be much craft in selecting place in child have be taken from a looked around perceiving terrible misfortune have befallen there be not human being near save cabman who be occupied in unchaining pretending to unchain heavy mass of luggage on roof window of house before be stopping be closed nora perceived at once that hotel be not inhabited cabman must have perceived also a for man who have taken child nurse must only say that be dressed in black like waiter that have napkin under arm hat on head have taken boy tenderly in arm then have seen nothing further first thing nora have seen a stood on pavement be other cab moving off rapidly mr trevelyan have staggered against railing be soon screaming in wretchedness before long there be small crowd around comprising three four woman few boy old man two policeman to policeman nora have soon told whole story cabman be of course attacked cabman played part very well declared that have done just what have be told to do be indeed sure that have heard uncle desire to drive to gregg hotel in baker street cabman in answer to declared that have not clearly heard old gentleman direction that man whom have conceived to be servant have very plainly told to drive to parker hotel mowbray street gower street comed ever so far out of way said cabman to avoid rumpus with homnibuses at hill cause lady thing be so heavy 'd never got up if 'orse have once jibbed though have nothing to do with matter seemed to impress policeman with idea that cabman if not true man be going to be too clever for on occasion crafty cabman went on to declare that horse be so tired with load that must not go on to baker street must get cab take number of course must take number there be number fare be four six be if lady must pay anything extra for terrible load meant to have must be sixpence more if kept there many minute longer number be taken cab be got luggage be transferred money be paid while unhappy mother be still screaming in hysteric against railing have be done be soon clear enough to around nora have told policeman have told one of woman thinking to obtain sympathy assistance be kid dada a have taken said one man there ai nothing to be done there be nothing to be done nothing at rate then there nora have be very eager that cabman must be arrested policeman assured that arrest be out of question must have be useless have be possible man must be forthcoming if presence must be again desired have probably so said policeman really be desired to drive to mowbray street know where to find if want only must be paid time said cabman confidently policeman be of opinion that a boy have be kidnapped on behalf of father legal step must be taken for recovery of child for punishment of perpetrator of act got up however on box of cab accompanied party to hotel in baker street reached almost exactly at same time with sir marmaduke lady rowley reader must imagine confusion anguish disappointment of meeting mr trevelyan be hardly in possession of sens when reached mother must not be induced to be tranquil even when be assured by father that son must suffer immediate evil by being transferred to father hand in frenzy declared that must never see little one again seemed to think that father might not improbably destroy child be mad papa doe not know what doe do mean to say that madman may do a plea that may rob child from in street that may take out of very arm in way be almost angry with father because attempt be made that night to recover boy sir marmaduke who be not good lawyer have be closeted with policeman for quarter of hour have learned policeman view of course father of child be person who have done deed whether cabman have be in plot not be not matter of much consequence there must be doubt that one have told man to go to parker hotel a cab be starting must probably be impossible to punish in teeth of such instruction sir marmaduke however must doubtless have cabman summoned a for absolute abduction of child policeman be of opinion that father must not be punished for obtaining possession of son by stratagem unless custody of child have be made over to mother by court of law policeman indeed seemed to think that nothing must be done sir marmaduke be inclined to agree with when be explained to mr trevelyan by mother again became hysterical in agony must hardly be restrained from going forth to look for lost treasure need hardly be further explained that trevelyan have planned stratagem in concert with mr bozzle bozzle though strongly cautioned by wife to keep out of danger in matter be sorely tempted by employer offer of hundred pound positively refused to be party to attempt at violence at st diddulph when learned a did learn that mr trevelyan with sister baby be to be transferred from st diddulph in cab to baker street that journey be luckily to be made during shade of evening active mind went to work arranged plan there be many difficulty even pecuniary difficulty bargained that must have hundred pound clear of deduction for expense then attendant expense be not insignificant be necessary that there must be four men in service good true men require to be well paid for such goodness truth there be man ex policeman who gave instruction to first cabman a be starting cabman must not undertake job at unless be so instructed on spot asserting that in way must be able to prove that order obeyed came from lady husband there be crafty pseudo waiter with napkin hat who have carried boy to cab in father be sitting there be two cabman bozzle planned with difficulty arranged preliminary how successful be scheme have seen bozzle for month be able to assume superiority over wife that honest woman found to be very disagreeable there ai fraudulent abduction in at bozzle exclaimed because wife ai got right again husband not in such matter a mr bozzle implied that if husband be to take child away from without leave 'd let know something about a husband have in possession note for hundred pound realized mr bozzle have not much to say in support of view of case on morning after occurrence while sir marmaduke be waiting with solicitor upon magistrate to find whether anything must be done following letter be brought to mr trevelyan at gregg hotel child be safe with will remain so if care to obtain legal advice will find that a father have right to keep under protection will do so will allow to see a soon a will have received full guarantee that have idea of withdrawing from charge home for with be still open to on condition that will give promise have demanded from a long a will not hear that again see communicate with person to whose acquaintance object while remain away from will cause to be paid l month a wish that must be burden on others payment will depend also on not seeing holding communication with person to whom have alluded affectionate offended husband louis trevelyan letter addressed to acrobat club will reach sir rowley came home dispirited unhappy must not give much comfort to daughter magistrate have told that though cabman might probably be punished for taking lady otherwise than a directed if direction to baker street must be proved nothing must be done to punish father magistrate explained that under certain act of parliament mother might apply to court of chancery for custody of child under seven year of age that court must probably grant such custody unless be shewn that wife have left husband without sufficient cause magistrate must not undertake to say whether sufficient cause have here be given whether husband be in fault wife be however clear that nothing must be done without application to court of chancery appeared so said magistrate that husband have offered home to wife that in offering have attempted to impose condition must be shown to be cruel before judge magistrate thought that mr trevelyan have done nothing illegal in taking child from cab sir marmaduke on hearing be of opinion that nothing must be gained by legal interference private desire be to get hold of trevelyan pull limb from limb lady rowley thought that daughter have better go back to husband let future consequence be what might poor desolate mother have almost brought to offer to do so having in brain idea that must after while be able to escape with boy a for love for husband certainly there be none now left in bosom must teach to think possible that must ever live with again on friendly term must submit to anything with object of getting back boy three four letter be written to mr trevelyan in a many day from wife from lady rowley from nora in various overture be made trevelyan wrote once again to wife knew said already term on might come back term be still open to a for boy certainly must not leave father meeting might be planned on condition that trevelyan be provided with written assurance from wife that must not endeavour to remove boy that must be present at meeting thus first week be passed after sir marmaduke return most wretched time be for party at gregg hotel chapter lxii lady rowley make attempt illustration nothing must be more uncomfortable than state of sir marmaduke rowley family for first ten day after arrival in london of governor of mandarin island lady rowley have brought with two of girl third fourth a know have be joined by two eldest so that there be large family of lady gathered together house have be taken in manchester street to have intended to transfer after single night passed at gregg hotel trouble sorrow inflicted upon by abduction of mr trevelyan child consequent labour thrust upon sir marmaduke shoulder have be so heavy that have slept six night at hotel before be able to move into house prepared for by time idea have be abandoned of recovering child by legal mean to be taken a consequence of illegality of abduction boy be with father lawyer seemed to think that father right be paramount a have offered home to wife without condition court of law must adjudge to be cruel if must shew that have driven to live apart from by own bad conduct then probably custody of boy might be awarded to until child must be seven year old when circumstance of case be explained to sir marmaduke lawyer by lady rowley gentleman shook head mr trevelyan have said case with must go into court then by degree there be word whispered a to husband madness lawyer said that be matter for doctor if certain amount of medical evidence must be obtained to shew that husband be in truth mad wife must no doubt obtain custody of child when be reported to mr trevelyan declared that conduct such a husband must suffice to prove man to be mad at sir marmaduke shook head lady rowley sat sadly silent with daughter hand within own must not dare to tell that must regain child by plea during ten day did not learn whither boy have be carried did know even where father might be found sir marmaduke followed up address a given in letter learned from porter at acrobat that gentleman letter be sent to stony walk union street borough to uncomfortable locality sir marmaduke travelled more than once thrice went thither intent on finding son in law residence on two first occasion saw one mr bozzle discretion of lady in declining to give information be most admirable trewillian yes have heard name certainly might be that husband have business engagement with gent of name must not say even for certain a be not custom ever to make inquiry a to husband business engagement husband business engagement be said much too important for like of to know anything about when be bozzle likely to be at home bozzle be never likely to be at home according to showing bozzle be of husband most erratic might perhaps come in for hour two in middle of day on wednesday perhaps must take cup of tea at home on friday evening anything so fitful uncertain a be bozzle appearance in bosom of family be not to be conceived in mind of woman sir marmaduke then called in middle of day on wednesday bozzle be reported to be away in province wife have idea in of province be at moment engaged persevering governor from island called again on friday evening then by chance bozzle be found at home sir marmaduke succeeded in gaining very little information even from bozzle man acknowledged that be employed by mr trevelyan letter parcel left with for mr trevelyan must be duly sent to gentleman if sir marmaduke wanted mr trevelyan address must write to mr trevelyan ask for if mr trevelyan declined to give be likely that bozzle must betray sir marmaduke explained who be at length bozzle with smile assured governor that knew very well who be let drop few word to show that be intimately acquainted with whole course of sir marmaduke family affair knew about mandarin colonel osborne gregg hotel not that said anything about parker hotel colonial office spoke of miss nora even knew name of other two young lady miss sophia miss lucy be weakness with bozzle that of displaying information must have much liked to be able to startle sir marmaduke by describing government house in island by telling something of old carriage horse of such information a sir marmaduke desired sir marmaduke got none there be other trouble fell very heavily upon poor governor who have come home a be for holiday who be man hating work naturally who from circumstance of life have never be called on to do much work man may govern mandarin yet live in comparative idleness to do such governing work well man must have good presence flow of word must mean nothing excellent temper love of hospitality with attribute sir rowley be endowed for though disposition be by nature hot for governing purpose have be brought by practice under good control have now be summoned home through machination of dangerous old friend colonel osborne in order that might give result of experience in governing before committee of house of common in coming to england on business have thought much more of holiday of wife child of daughter at home of allowance per day while be to be away from government of salary to be paid to entire during absence instead of being halved a must be if be away on leave have thought much more in coming home on easy pleasant matter than did on work be to be required from when arrived then came to pas that felt almost injured when colonial office demanded presence from day to day when clerk bothered with question a to expected ready reply in replying to sir marmaduke be by mean ready working men at colonial office have not quite thought that sir marmaduke be most fitting man for job in hand there be certain mr thomas smith at set of island in quite part of world who be supposed by working men at home to be very paragon of governor if have be have home so said working men committee of house must have be able to make anything of might have asked question week after week must have answered fluently must have committed nobody knew in out of governing did mr thomas smith be match for sharpest committee that ever sat at westminster poor sir marmaduke be man of very different sort of be known by working men parliamentary interest have be too strong here be sir marmaduke at home working men be not disposed to make matter so pleasant for sir marmaduke a sir marmaduke have expected committee must not examine sir marmaduke till after easter in middle of april be expected of that must read blue book without number be so catechised by working men that almost began to wish back at mandarin in way new establishment in manchester street be not at first in happy even in contented condition at last after about ten day lady rowley did succeed in obtaining interview with meeting be arranged through bozzle took place in very dark gloomy room at inn in city why bozzle must have selected bremen coffee house in poulter alley for meeting fit reason can surely be given unless be that conceived bound to select most dreary locality within knowledge on so melancholy occasion poulter alley be narrow dark passage somewhere behind mansion house bremen coffee house why so called one can now tell be one of strange house of public resort in city at guest seem never to eat never to drink never to sleep to come in out after mysterious almost ghostly fashion seeing friend perhaps enemy in nook corner carrying on conference in low melancholy whisper there be aged waiter at bremen coffee house there be certainly one private sitting room up stair be dingy ill furnished room with old large mahogany table old horse hair sofa six horse hair chair two old round mirror old mahogany press in corner be chamber so sad in appearance that wholesome useful work must have be done within must men have eaten there with appetite have drained flowing bowl with touch of joviality be generally used for such purpose a to be now appropriated doubt have be taken by bozzle on more than one previous occasion here lady rowley arrived precisely at hour fixed be told that gentleman be waiting up stair for there have of course be many family consultation a to manner in meeting must be arranged must sir marmaduke accompany wife perhaps must sir marmaduke go alone lady rowley have be very much in favour of meeting mr trevelyan without one to assist in conference a for sir marmaduke meeting must be concluded between son in law without personal probably violent quarrel of lady rowley have be quite sure sir marmaduke since have be home have in midst of various trouble be driven into so vehement state of indignation against son in law a to be unable to speak of wretched man without strongest term of opprobrium nothing be too bad to be said by of one who have ill treated dearest daughter must be admitted that sir marmaduke have heard only one side of question have questioned daughter have constantly seen old friend osborne colonel journey down to devonshire have be made to appear most natural proceeding in world correspondence of trevelyan thought so much have be shown to consist of such note a might pas between old gentleman young woman promise trevelyan have endeavoured to exact mr trevelyan have declined to give appeared to angry father to be monstrous insult knew that colonel be older man than emily be still to only young girl be incredible to that anybody must have regarded old comrade a daughter lover did not believe that anybody have in truth so regarded man tale have be monstrous invention on part of husband got up because have become tired of young wife according to sir marmaduke way of thinking trevelyan must either be thrashed within inch of life else locked up in mad house colonel osborne shook head expressed conviction that poor man be mad lady rowley be more hopeful though be a confident about daughter a be father be le confident about old friend probably be alive to fact that man of fifty might put on air assume character of young lover acting on suspicion entertaining also hope bad a matter now be might be mended have taken care that colonel osborne mr trevelyan must not be brought together sir marmaduke have fumed lady rowley have be firm if think so mamma mr trevelyan have said with something of scorn in tone of course let be so lady rowley have said that must be better so two have not seen other since memorable visit to nuncombe putney now lady rowley be about to meet son in law with slight hope that might arrange affair be quite aware that present indignation though certainly gratification might be indulged in at much too great cost must be better for reason emily must go back to husband home that trevelyan must be forgiven for iniquity bozzle be at tavern during interview be not seen by lady rowley remained seated down stair in one of dingy corner ready to give assistance to patron must assistance be needed when lady rowley be shown into gloomy sitting room by old waiter found trevelyan alone standing in middle of room waiting for be sad occasion said a advanced to give hand very sad occasion louis know what may have heard of what have occurred lady rowley be natural however to suppose that must have heard spoken of with censure think child have be ill used louis replied of course do must not expect that must be otherwise when be arranged must meet here be quite aware that must have taken side against before have heard story be have be ill used cruelly misused expect that must believe wish to do must not for world separate mother from daughter why have separated own wife from child because be duty what be father not to have charge of own son have done nothing lady rowley to justify separation be contrary to law of nature where be boy louis ah be just what be not prepared to tell one who have taken wife side till know that wife have consented to pay to that obedience a husband have right to demand if emily will do a request of a command a trevelyan said spoke in tone be intended to give highest possible idea of own authority dignity then may see child without delay what be request of daughter obedience simply submission to will be surely wife duty let beg pardon for what have occurred can not do louis solemnly promise continued trevelyan not deigning to notice lady rowley interruption that will hold further intercourse with snake in grass who wormed way into house let be humble penitent affectionate then will be restored to husband to child said walking up down room waving hand a though be making speech be intended to be eloquent a though have conceived that be to overcome mother in law by weight of word magnificence of demeanour yet demeanour be ridiculous word must have have weight have not tended to show lady rowley how little prospect there be that must be able to heal breach too be so altered in appearance since have last seen bright with hope of young married happiness that must hardly have recognised have met in street be thin pale haggard mean a stalked up down room seemed to that very character of man be changed have not previously known to be pompous unreasonable absurd did not answer at once a perceived that have not finished address after moment pause continued lady rowley there be nothing must not have done for daughter for wife have be hers did not dictate to mode of life required from sacrifice subjected to caprice be determined to be master in own house think louis have ever denied right to be master to be master in own house to be paramount in influence over so much have right to demand who have denied right have submitted to counsel to influence of man who have endeavoured to undermine in affection in saying that make accusation a light against a be possible might make much heavier yet not sin against truth be illusion louis ah well doubt becomes to defend child be illusion when went to devonshire be illusion when corresponded with contrary to express order before after unhallowed journey lady rowley there must be no more such illusion if wife mean to come back to to have child in own hand must be penitent a regard past obedient a regard future there be wicked bitterness in word penitent almost maddened lady rowley have come to meeting believing that trevelyan must be rejoiced to take back wife if detail must be arranged for doing so must not subject to necessity of cry peccavi found speaking of wife a though must be doing greatest possible favour in allowing to come back to dressed in sackcloth with ash on head must understand from what have heard that tone manner be much changed since obtained possession of child that now conceived that have wife within power that must become tyrant because have power to tyrannise be not in accordance with former conception of man character then be so changed that felt that knew nothing of man who now stood before can not acknowledge that daughter have done anything requires penitence said lady rowley dare say not view be different can not admit to be wrong when know to be right must not have confess to fault very idea of have always be abhorrent to must be crushed in spirit lady rowley before can again become pure happy woman be more than can bear said lady rowley now at last worked up to fever of indignation daughter sir be a pure woman a have ever known be likely to know who must have protected against world will day take blame to a remember that have so cruelly maligned then walked away to door must not listen to word be hurling after went down stair out of house at end of poulter alley found cab be waiting for trevelyan a soon a be alone rang bell sent for bozzle while waiter be coming to until myrmidon have appeared continued to stalk up down room waving hand in air a though be continuing speech bozzle said a soon a man have closed door have changed mind a how mr trewillian will make further attempt have done man can do have done in vain father mother uphold in conduct be lost to for ever boy mr t have child yes have child poor infant bozzle look to to see that none of learn retreat a for mr trewillian why fact be to be come at by one party pretty well a much a by now suppose thing be changed wicey warsey a be hacting for colonel party d colonel exclaimed trevelyan just so mr trewillian if be hacting for other party said to 'bozzle where be boy why in three day 'd be down on fact fact be open mr trewillian if know where to look for will take abroad at once think twice of mr t boy be so young see mother 'art be softer lovinger than anything 'd think twice of mr t before kept apart be line of thought mr bozzle conscience have not forced to entertain to prejudice of professional arrangement now a conversed with employer became by degree aware of failure of trevelyan mind shade of remorse came upon made say word on behalf of other party be not always thinking of what else have left to think of will do for to day have better come down to to morrow afternoon bozzle promised obedience to instruction a soon a patron have started paid bill took home lady rowley a travelled back to house in manchester street almost made up mind that separation between daughter son in law have better be continued be very sad conclusion to to come must not believe that high spirited woman must long continue to submit to caprice of man so unreasonable dictatorial a to whom have just be listening be not for boy there must felt be doubt upon matter now a matter stood thought that must be great object to regain possession of child then endeavoured to calculate what must be result to daughter if in very truth must be found that wretched man be mad to hope for such result seemed to to be very wicked yet hardly knew how not to hope for well mamma said emily trevelyan with faint attempt at smile saw yes dearest saw can only say that be most unreasonable man must tell nothing of louey dear not word chapter lxiii sir marmaduke at home nora rowley have told lover that there be to be further communication between till father mother must be in england in telling so have so frankly confessed own affection for have so sturdily promised to be true to that lover must have be reasonably aggrieved by such interdiction nora be quite conscious of be aware that hugh stanbury have received such encouragement a ought at rate to bring to new rowley establishment a soon a must learn where have fixed when at end of ten day have not shown began to feel doubt must be that have changed mind that be unwilling to encounter refusal from father that have found on looking into own affair more closely that must be absurd for to propose to take wife to while mean be so poor so precarious sir marmaduke during time have be so unhappy so fretful so indignant so much worried that nora have become almost afraid of without much reasoning on matter have taught to believe that hugh might be actuated by similar fear have intended to tell mother of what have occurred between stanbury first moment that lady rowley be together then there have fallen upon terrible incident of loss of child whole family have become at once so wrapped up in agony of bereaved mother so full of rage against unreasonable father that there seemed to nora to be possible opportunity for telling of own love story emily appeared to have forgotten in midst of own misery have not mentioned hugh stanbury name since have be in manchester street have felt how on occasion own hope fear nay almost own individuality become absorbed in obliterated by more pressing care louder voice of around nora hardly dared to allude to while sister grief be still so prominent while father be daily complaining of own personal annoyance at colonial office seemed to at moment must not introduce new matter for dispute perhaps new subject of dismay nevertheless a day passed by a saw nothing of hugh stanbury heart became sore spirit vexed seemed to that if be now deserted by world must be over for glascock episode in life have passed by episode might have be history might have be history so prosperous so magnificent probably so happy a thought of herself of circumstance a have happened to of resolution have made a to own career when first came to london of way in have thrown resolution away in spite of wonderful success have come in path must not refrain from thinking that have brought to shipwreck by own indecision must not be imagined that regretted what have done knew very well that to have acted otherwise than did when mr glascock came to at nuncombe putney must have proved to be heartless selfish unwomanly long before time have determined that be duty to marry rich man if possible man in high position one have come to one endowed with good thing of world beyond most sanguine expectation have rejected knew that have be right because have allowed to love other man did not repent what have done circumstance being a be almost regretted that have be so soft in heart so susceptible of weakness of love so little able to do a pleased with herself of what use to be that loved man with strength of affection when never came to although time at have be told that might come be now ten day past be sitting one afternoon in drawing room listlessly reading pretending to read novel when on sudden hugh stanbury be announced circumstance of moment be most unfortunate for such visit sir marmaduke who have be down at whitehall in morning from thence have made journey to st diddulph in east back be exceedingly cross out of temper have told at office that feared must not suffice to carry through purpose for have be brought home brother in law parson have expressed to opinion that be in great part responsible for misfortune of daughter by encouragement have given to man a colonel osborne sir marmaduke have in consequence quarrelled with chief clerk with mr outhouse have come home surly discontented lady rowley eldest daughter be away closeted at moment with lady milborough with whom be endeavouring to arrange plan by boy might at rate be given back poor emily trevelyan be humble enough now to lady milborough be prepared to be humble to one in circumstance so that must not be required to acknowledge that have entertained colonel osborne a lover two younger girl sophy lucy be in room when stanbury be announced a be also sir marmaduke who at very moment be uttering angry growl at obstinacy want of reason with have be treated by mr outhouse now sir marmaduke have not so much a heard name of hugh stanbury a yet nora though listlessness be at end at once felt how impossible must be to explain of circumstance of case in such interview a while however hugh dear step be heard upon stair feminine mind at once went to work to ascertain in what best mode with what most attractive reason for presence might introduce young man to father have not girl be then present thought that might have be expedient to leave hugh to tell own story to sir marmaduke have opportunity of sending sister away unless chance must remove must not be done be son of lady be with at nuncombe putney whispered to father a got up to move across room to welcome lover now sir marmaduke have expressed great disapproval of retreat to dartmoor have only understood respecting that have be arranged between trevelyan family in whose custody two daughter have be sent away into banishment be not therefore specially disposed to welcome hugh stanbury in consequence of mode of introduction hugh who have asked for lady rowley mr trevelyan have learned that be out before have mentioned miss rowley name be almost prepared to take sweetheart into arm in half minute have taught to expect that must meet alone have altogether forgotten sir marmaduke young men when call at four o'clock in day never expect to find papa at home of sophia lucy have heard nothing have forgotten what have heard repressed however in time did not commit nora by very vehement demonstration of affection did hold hand longer than must have done sir marmaduke saw that did so be papa said nora papa be friend mr hugh stanbury introduction be made in manner almost absurdly formal poor nora difficulty lay heavy upon sir marmaduke muttered something be little more than grunt mamma emily be out continued nora dare say will be in soon sir marmaduke looked round sharply at man why be to be encouraged to stay till lady rowley must return lady rowley did not want to see seemed to sir marmaduke in midst of trouble that be time to be making new acquaintance be sister mr stanbury continued nora be sophia be lucy sophia lucy must have be thoroughly willing to receive sister lover with genial kindness if have be properly instructed if time have be opportune a be have nothing to say also must only mutter little sound intended to be more courteous than father grunt poor nora hope be comfortable here said hugh house be very well said nora like neighbourhood hugh also felt that conversation be difficult have soon come to perceive before have be in room minute that atmosphere be not favourable to mission there be to be embracing permission for embracing on present occasion have be left alone with sir marmaduke must probably have told business plainly let sir marmaduke manner to have be what might be impossible for to do with three young lady in room with seeing that nora be embarrassed by difficulty nora father be cross silent endeavoured to talk to other girl asked concerning journey ship in have come be very up hill work lucy sophy must talk a glibly a young lady home from colony higher degree of fluency can be expressed now be cowed elder sister be shamefully most undeservedly disgraced man have have something knew not what to do with be priscilla quite well nora asked at last quite well heard from yesterday know have left clock house have not heard oh yes be living in small cottage just outside village what else do think have happened nothing bad hope mr stanbury sister dorothy have left aunt be living with again at nuncombe have there be quarrel mr stanbury well yes after fashion there have suppose be long story must not interest sir marmaduke wonder be that dorothy must have be able to stay so long with aunt will tell day sir marmaduke must not understand why long story about man aunt sister must be told to daughter forgot a men always do in such circumstance forget that while be living in mandarin daughter living in england must of course pick up new interest become intimate with new history did not forget that pressure of hand have seen determined that daughter nora must not have worse lover than friend of elder daughter husband stanbury have just determined that must go that there be possibility for to say do anything to promote cause at present moment when circumstance be changed by return home of lady rowley mr trevelyan lady rowley knew have for day known much more of stanbury than have come to ear of sir marmaduke understood in first place that stanburys have be very good to daughter be aware that hugh stanbury have thoroughly taken daughter part against old friend trevelyan must therefore have be prepared to receive kindly have not on very morning be subject of special conversation between emily a have happened mr trevelyan have very day told lady rowley whole story of nora love elder sister have not intended to be treacherous to younger in thorough confidence mutual grief close conference have created between mother daughter everything have at last come out lady rowley have learned story not only of hugh stanbury courtship of rich offer have be made by heir to barony of peterborough must be acknowledged that lady rowley be greatly grieved thoroughly dismayed be not only that mr glascock be eldest son of peer that be represented by poor suffering wife of ill tempered man to be man blessed with disposition sweet a angel must have liked emily have said if have not be for unfortunate young man lady rowley be not worse than be other mother not more ambitious more heartless more worldly be good mother loving child thoroughly anxious for welfare must have liked to be mother in law of lord peterborough must have liked dearly to see second daughter removed from danger of rock against eldest child have be shipwrecked when asked after hugh stanbury mean of maintaining wife statement mr trevelyan made be not comforting writes for penny newspaper believe writes very well mr trevelyan have said for penny newspaper be that respectable aunt miss stanbury seemed to think not suppose men of education do write for such thing now say that be very precarious a employment must be precarious emily have got nothing not penny of own said mr trevelyan then lady rowley have thought again of mr glascock of family title of monkhams thought of present trouble of mandarin state of sir marmaduke balance at banker of other girl of there be before to do here have be very apollo among suitor kneeling at child foot foolish girl have sent away for sake of young man who wrote for penny newspaper be worth while of woman to bring up daughter with such result lady rowley therefore when be first introduced to hugh stanbury be not prepared to receive with open arm on occasion task of introducing fell to mr trevelyan be done with much graciousness emily knew that hugh stanbury be friend must sympathise with respecting child have heard have happened to said stanbury however have heard nothing of kidnapping of child though to rowleys seemed that deed of iniquity done in middle of london must have be known to world have not a yet be told of now story be given to mr trevelyan told with many tear agony of fresh grief still told a to one whom regarded a sure friend from whom knew that must receive sympathy sir marmaduke sat by while still gloomy out of humour why be family sorrow to be laid bare to stranger be cruellest thing ever heard said hugh dastardly deed said lady rowley feel that for time can hardly know what doe said nora where be child stanbury asked have not slightest idea said lady rowley have seen refuse to tell did say that daughter must see boy now

come in subject of taking of boy have be mooted have sat there a perfect stranger thought that be manifest enough that nora have told secret to one seemed to that mr trevelyan must have forgotten that

when be married must tell camilla talked great deal said thing be very severe mr gibson did not enjoy morning endured upbraiding of fair one with more firmness than might perhaps have be expected from left talking to camilla when got up to leave th of april have be fixed with sort of assent from a day on be really to become mr gibson when left room again met mr french on landing place hesitated moment waiting to see whether door must be shut door must not be shut a camilla be standing in entrance mr gibson said mr french in voice be scarcely whisper must mind stepping in seeing poor bella

going to be bella brother in law be also clergyman camilla in heart believed that half clerical aspect mother have given to request be false hypocritical there be special reason why bella must not have wished to see mr gibson in bedroom at rate till mr gibson have become brother in law expression of such wish at present moment be almost indecent will be there with said camilla mr gibson blushed up to ear a heard suggestion of course will be there with mamma dear think not fancy wish to read to something of sort then mr gibson without speaking word still blushing up to ear be taken to arabella room camilla flouncing into drawing room banged door behind have hitherto fought battle with considerable skill with great courage very success have made imprudent have become so imperious in great position have reached that must not control temper wait till power be confirmed banging of door be heard through whole house one knew why be banged threw on to sofa then instantly rising again paced room with quick step must be possible that there be treachery be on card that weak poor creature bella be intriguing once again to defraud of husband there be different thing that now remembered arabella in moment of bliss in have conceived to be engaged to mr gibson have discarded chignon then have resumed in monstrous proportion since that have be lessened by degree brought down through various interesting abnormal shape to size must hardly have drawn forth anathema from miss stanbury now on very morning arabella have put on clean nightcap with muslin frill be perhaps not unnatural that sick lady preparing to receive clergyman in bedroom must put on clean nightcap to suspicious eye small cause suffice to create alarm if there be such hideous wickedness in wind have arabella colleague in villainy must be that mother be plotting against daughter happiness respectability camilla be well aware that mamma must at first have preferred to give arabella to mr gibson have choice in matter be left to now when thing have be settled before world must not such treatment on mother part be equal to infanticide then a to mr gibson camilla be not prone to think little of own charm have be unable not to perceive that lover have become negligent in personal attention to accepted lover who deserves to have be accepted must devote hour at command to mistress mr gibson have of late be so chary of presence at heavitree that camilla must not have known that took delight in coming thither have acknowledged to herself have consoled with reflection that marriage must make right mr gibson be not man to stray from wife must trust to obtain sufficient hold upon husband hereafter partly by strength of tongue partly by ascendency of spirit partly also by comfort must provide for have not doubted that must be well when must be married how if even now there must be marriage for camilla french have never heard of creusa of jason a paced mother drawing room that morning be medea in spirit if plot of kind must be in wind must do such thing that devonshire must hear of wrong of revenge in meantime mr gibson be sitting by arabella bedside while mr french be trying to make busy in own chamber next door there have be reading of chapter of bible of portion of chapter mr gibson a read arabella a listened have endeavoured to take to heart to make use of word heard poor young

dictating to be man of course must judge for will say must do anything just because be easiest suppose must live after indeed must not signify to suppose that man be ever before in such terrible position since world began be difficult be sure of thomas have meant to be so true fancy sometimes that mysterious agency interferes with affair of man drive on on on almost till doe know where drive a said in voice be quite sepulchral in tone felt consolation in conviction that mysterious agency must not affect man without embuing with certain amount of grandeur very uncomfortable indeed in nature still having considerable value a counterpoise pride must bear pain pain be recompensed by pride be so strong thomas that can put up with anything said arabella in whisper strong yes said with shudder be strong enough a for love talk about said getting up from chair talk about will drive frantic know what feeling be thomas have always known there have be change since be young thing first knew a spoke just touched hand with hers did not seem to notice sitting with elbow on arm of chair forehead on hand in reply to what said to merely shook head not intending to imply thereby doubt of

defend must go said mr gibson jumping up from chair must go bella can not stand longer be too much for will pray may decide aright god bless then kissed brow a lay in bed hurried out of room have hoped to go from house without further converse with of inmate for mind be disturbed longed to be at rest be not allowed to escape so easily camilla met at dining room door accosted with smile there have be time for much meditation during last half hour camilla have meditated how do find thomas asked seems weak believe be better have be reading to come in thomas will not be bad for to stand talking on stair dear thomas let be so cold to other have alternative to put arm round waist kiss thinking a did so of mysterious agency afflicted tell that love thomas said of course love question be not pleasant one when put by lady to gentleman whose affection towards be not strong requires very good actor to produce efficient answer hope do thomas must be sad indeed if did not be not weary of camilla be for moment there came upon idea that must confess that be weary of found at once that effort be beyond power how can ask question said because come to camilla a spoke laid head upon shoulder wept now have be five minute with nearly hour with bella wanted to read to said mr gibson hated thoroughly a said now want to get away a fast a can continued camilla because of morning

torn soiled can not be right that must be left like will tell papa when get home said lady rowley who be beginning to be somewhat frightened by what have seen be very well to declare that friend be mad when one simply desire to justify one self in opposition to friend matter becomes much more serious when evidence of friend insanity becomes true circumstantial certainly think that physician must see continued lady rowley on return home sir marmaduke be told of what have occurred there be long family discussion in be decided that lady milborough must be consulted a being oldest friend of louis trevelyan with whom be acquainted trevelyan have relative of own name living in cornwall mr trevelyan have never even met one of branch of family sir marmaduke however resolved that must go out see son in law too have called trevelyan mad did not believe that madness be of such nature a to interfere with own duty in punishing man who have ill used daughter must at rate see trevelyan of said nothing either to wife to child chapter lxviii major magruder committee illustration sir marmaduke must not go out to willesden on morning after lady rowley return from river cottage because on day be summoned to attend at twelve o'clock before committee of house of common to give evidence fruit of experience a to government of british colony generally a went down to house in cab from manchester street thoroughly wished that friend colonel osborne have not be so efficacious in bringing home task before be one thoroughly disliked of be afraid dreaded inquisitor before whom be to appear felt though be called there to speak a master of art of governing must in truth be examined a servant probably a servant who did not know business have sojourn at home be in other respect happy might have be able to balance advantage against inquiry there be such balancing for now moreover expense of own house in manchester street be so large that journey in pecuniary point of view must be of little service to so went down to house in unhappy mood when shook hand in one of passage with friend osborne who be on committee there be very little cordiality in manner be most ungrateful thing ever knew said colonel to have almost disgraced by having fellow brought home now quarrel with because idiot son in law have quarrelled with wife colonel osborne really did feel that be martyr to ingratitude of friend committee have be convoked by house in compliance with eager desire of certain ancient pundit of constitution who have be for many year member who have be known a stern critic of colonial mode of government to certainly seemed that everything be be bad a regarded national dependency be so usually state of mind of parliamentary critic be so much matter of course that member who take up army navy gun india relation with spain workhouse management must find everything to be bad rotten dishonest that wrath of member for killicrankie against colonial peculation idleness be not thought much of in open house have be at work for year colonial office be so used to that rather liked have made free of office clerk be always glad to see be understood that said bitter thing in house be major magruder line of business must be quite pleasant when be asking question of private secretary telling news of day to senior clerk a be now between seventy eighty have be at work for at least twenty year most of concerned have allowed to think that must ride hobby harmlessly to day of parliamentary death drop from house corner will hollow stone by constancy major magruder at last persuaded house to grant committee of inquiry then there came to be serious face at colonial office little pleasantry of friendly opposition be at end be felt that battle must now become real fight secretary under secretary girded up loin major magruder be chairman of own committee being man of laborious turn of mind much given to blue book very patient thoroughly conversant with house imbued with strong belief in efficacy of parliamentary questioning to carry point if not to elicit fact have happy time of during session be man who always attended house from pm to time of breaking up who never missed division slight additional task of sitting four hour in committee room three day week be only delight more especially a during four hour must occupy post of chairman who knew major magruder well did not doubt that committee must sit for many week that whole theory of colonial government rather of imperial control supervising such government must be tested to very utmost men who have heard old major maunder on for year past on pet subject hardly knew how much vitality must be found in when maundering have succeeded in giving committee governor from one of greater colony have already be under question for nearly week be generally thought to have come out of fire unscathed by flame of major criticism governor have be picked man have made appear that control of downing street be never more harsh seldom le refreshing beautifying than spring shower in april other land under sun be so blest in way of government a be colony with have be acquainted a natural consequence devotion loyalty to mother country be quite passion with now major have be long of mind one two colony have better simply be given up to other nation be more fully able to look after than be england three four more must be allowed to go clear costing england nothing owing england nothing well chosen governor who have now be before committee have rather staggered major thing altogether be supposed to be looking up for colonial office now have come day of sir marmaduke martyrdom be first requested with most urbane politeness to explain exact nature of government exercised in mandarin now certainly be case that manner in legislative executive authority be intermingled in affair of island did create complication be difficult for man to understand very difficult indeed for man to explain to others there be court of chancery so called sir marmaduke described a little parliament when be asked whether court exercised legislative executive function said at first that exercised then that exercised knew that consisted of nine men of whom five be appointed by colony four by crown yet declared that crown have control of court in fact be true enough doubt a five open member be not perhaps of immaculate patriot on matter poor sir marmaduke be very obscure when asked who exercised patronage of crown in nominating four member declared that four member exercised did appoint never appointed anybody consulted court of chancery for everything at last came out that chief justice of island three other officer always sat in court whether be required by constitution of island that must be so sir marmaduke did not know have worked well be to say everybody have complained of sir marmaduke must not recommend change what thought best be that colonial secretary must send out order that people in colony must mind business grow coffee when asked what must be effect upon island under scheme of government if incoming colonial secretary must change policy of predecessor said that did think must much matter if people did not know anything about in way major have field day poor sir marmaduke be much discomfited there be present on committee young parliamentary under secretary who with much attention have studied subject of court of chancery in mandarin who have acknowledged to superior in office that certainly be of legislative assembly most awkward complicated did what must by question judiciously put to pull sir marmaduke through difficulty unfortunate governor have more than once lost temper in answering chairman in heavy confusion be past power of under secretary let be ever so clever to pull through colonel osborne sat by while asked question have be put on committee a respectable dummy there be not member sitting there who did not know that sir marmaduke have be brought home a friend of doubt have whispered that bringing home of sir marmaduke be part of payment made by colonel for smile of governor daughter one alluded openly to inefficiency of evidence given one asked why governor so incompetent have be sent to one suggested that job have be done there be certain thing of opposition member of parliament complain loudly there be certain other thing a to be silent line between thing be well known must ill conditioned pig headed underbred ignorant member not understand line transgress by asking question must not be asked be soon put down from treasury bench to great delight of whole house sir marmaduke after having be questioned for entire afternoon left house with extreme disgust be so convinced of own failure that felt that career a colonial governor must be over surely must never let go back to island after such exposition a have made of own ignorance hurried off into cab be ashamed to be seen of men member of committee thought little nothing about major who sided with have be anxious to entrap witness into contradiction absurdity for furtherance of own object for furtherance of theirs under secretary from office supporter of government have endeavoured to defend man when affair be over if special admiration have be elicited for sir marmaduke be there expressed special reprobation major carried on committee over six week succeeded in having blue book printed a matter of course nothing further came of court of chancery in mandarin island still continues to hold own to do work in spite of absurdity displayed in construction major magruder have have day of success now feel that othello occupation be gone go no more to colonial office life among friend on memory of committee not always to gratification be beginning to think that a work be done may a well resign killicrankie to younger politician poor sir marmaduke remembered defeat with soreness long after have be forgotten by others who have be present be astonished when found that journal of day though did in curt fashion report proceeding of committee never uttered word of censure against a have not before uttered word of praise for pearl of governor who have be examined before on following morning went to colonial office by appointment then saw young irish under secretary whom have so much dreaded nothing must be more civil than be young irish under secretary who told that have better of course stay in town till committee be over though be not probable that must be wanted again when committee have done work must be allowed to remain six week on service to prepare for journey back if wanted more time after that must ask for leave of absence so sir marmaduke left colonial office with great weight off mind blessed that young irish secretary a went chapter lxix sir marmaduke at willesden on next day sir marmaduke purposed going to willesden be in great doubt whether must first consult very eminent man dr trite turbury a to possibility if possible a to expediency of placing mr trevelyan under control sir marmaduke though must repeatedly declare that son in law be mad did not really believe in madness did not be believe that trevelyan be so mad a to be fairly exempt from penalty of responsibility be therefore desirous of speaking own mind out fully to man a be of having own personal revenge before might be deterred by interposition of medical advice resolved therefore that must not see sir trite turbury at rate till have come back from willesden also went down in cab left cab at public house at corner of road walked to cottage when asked whether mr trevelyan be at home woman of house hesitated then said that lodger be out particularly wish to see said sir marmaduke feeling that woman be lying to ai to be seen sir said woman know be at home said sir marmaduke argument be soon cut short by appearance of trevelyan behind woman shoulder be here sir marmaduke rowley said trevelyan if wish to see may come in will not say that be welcome can come in then woman retired sir marmaduke followed trevelyan into room in lady rowley emily have be received child be not now in chamber be charge hear against daughter said sir marmaduke rushing at once into midst of indignation know what charge have heard have put away in strict accuracy be not correct sir marmaduke be put away be in house now because have house of own for be not that so when came home be staying with uncle because have put away be meaning of being sent down into devonshire what have done be father expect to have answer will have answer certainly true one will have hocus pocus humbug no jesuitry have come here to insult sir marmaduke because if so there will be end to interview at once there will not be end by g no not till have heard what be meaning of do know what people be saying of that be mad that must be locked up child taken away from property who be people say so perhaps lady rowley doe wife say so doe think that be mad did not think so on thursday when prayed that might be allowed to come back live with must not let come pardon said trevelyan must wish that must come must be on certain condition what want to know be why be turned out of house be not turned out what have done that must be punished urged sir marmaduke who be unable to arrange question with happiness have distinguished major magruder insist upon knowing what be that lay to charge be father have right to know have be barbarously shamefully ill used by g will know have come here to bully sir marmaduke rowley have come here sir to do duty of parent to child to protect poor girl against cruelty of husband who in unfortunate hour be allowed to take from home will know reason why daughter have be treated a though a though a though listen to for minute said trevelyan be listening will tell nothing will answer not word will not answer not when come to in fashion wife be wife claim to be nearer closer than be yours who be father be mother of child only being in world except child whom love do think that with such motif on part for tenderness towards for loving care for most anxious solicitude can be made more anxious more tender more loving by coarse epithet from be most miserable being under sun because happiness have be interrupted be likely that such misery must be cured by violent word gesture if heart be wrung for so be mine if be much to be more to came here other day almost a stranger thought that heart must have burst beneath weight of woe what can do can add ounce to burden bear may a well leave at least be quiet sir marmaduke have stood listened to too be so struck by altered appearance of man that violence of indignation be lessened by pity must not suppress when trevelyan spoke of wretchedness be impossible not to believe be a wretched being to look at a might have be possible to find contracted cheek lip always open eye glowing in sunken cavern told tale even sir marmaduke who be not of nature quick in deciphering such story must not fail to read then twitching motion of man hand restless shuffling of foot produced nervous feeling that if remedy be not applied quickly alleviation given to misery of suffering wretch human power must be strained too far man must break to piece else mind of man sir marmaduke during journey in cab have resolved that old a be must take sinner by throat brute who have striven to stain daughter name must make there then acknowledge own brutality be now very manifest to sir marmaduke that there must be taking by throat in case must not have brought to touch poor weak passionate creature before indeed even fury of word be stayed after last appeal stormed no more what be to be end of said who can tell who can say can tell can put end to have to say word will devote life to that word must be spoken a said dashed hand upon table looked up with air must have be comic with assumed magnificence have not be for true tragedy of occasion have better at rate let have child for present boy will go with may go too if plea boy will certainly go with if have put from a said just now might have be otherwise will be a welcome to a flower in may a flower in may will be a welcome to a music of heaven sir marmaduke felt that have nothing more to urge have altogether abandoned that idea of having revenge at cost of man throat be quite convinced that reason must have power with be already thinking that must go away straight to lawyer so that step might be taken at once to stop if possible taking away of boy to america when lock of door be gently turned landlady entered room will excuse sir said woman if be anything to gentleman mr fuller leave room said trevelyan gentleman be engaged see be engaged do beg pardon ai one a must intrude wilful a for listening like of scorn if gentleman be anything to mr trevelyan be wife father said sir marmaduke like enough be thinking perhaps so lady be down here on thursday a sweet lady a gentleman need wish to stretch by side mr fuller said trevelyan marching up towards will not have desire that will retire from room mr fuller escaped round table must not be banished got round table came closely opposite to sir marmaduke want to say nothing out of place sir said something ought to be done ai fit to be left to hisself not alone not a be at present ai indeed must be doing duty if did say so have sweat at night a 'd be enough to kill man eats nothing hing a for poor little boy a be now in own bed upstairs if be that bessy be fond of child know what must become of boy trevelyan finding impossible to get rid of have stood quietly while listened to have be good to child said acknowledge a for have not be well be true be told that travel will set on foot again change of air will do not long since have be urging wretchedness of own bodily health a reason why wife must yield to now when sickness be brought a charge against be adduced a reason why friend must interfere look after concern in affair saw at once that be necessary that must make little of ailment must not be best trevelyan that must come with to doctor said sir marmaduke have own doctor be know course must follow place though be good for boy have disagreed with life have not be altogether pleasant may say by mean pleasant trouble have told upon change of air will mend wish must come with at once to london will come back know will not detain thank will not trouble will do mr fuller have intended to do duty doubt now can go whereupon mr fuller did go be obliged for care sir marmaduke can really do very well without troubling can not suppose trevelyan that can allow thing to go on like what do mean to do well will take advice will go to lawyer to doctor perhaps to lord chancellor kind of thing ca let thing go on like can do a please said trevelyan a have threatened must ask to leave sir marmaduke must do more must say more took leave shaking hand with man speaking to with courtesy astonished be impossible to maintain strength of indignation against poor creature who be so manifestly unable to guide when be in london drove at once to house of dr trite turbury remained there till doctor returned from round of visit according to great authority there be much still to be done before even child must be rescued out of father hand ca act without lawyer said dr turbury explained to sir marmaduke what step must be taken in such matter trevelyan in mean time clearly understanding that hostile measure must now be taken against set mind to work to think how best might escape at once to america with boy chapter lxx shewing what nora rowley thought about carriage sir marmaduke on return home from dr turbury house found that have other domestic trouble on hand over above arising from elder daughter position mr hugh stanbury have be in manchester street during absence have asked for finding that be away from home have told story to lady rowley when have be shown up stair four daughter have be with mother have said word two signifying desire to speak to lady rowley three girl have left room in way came to pas that have to plead cause before nora mother elder sister have pleaded well lady rowley heart have be well disposed towards when asked of house home answer have be hardly more satisfactory than of alan dale there be little that must call own beyond blue vault of heaven have saved money not shilling be to say a expressed nothing must be called money have few pound by just to go on with what be income well last year have made four hundred pound year hoped to make something more thought must see way plainly to five hundred year be permanent if not on what did depend believed to be a permanent a most other professional income be obliged to confess that a regarded source from whence be drawn at present moment might be brought to abrupt end day by disagreement between editor of d r did think that be fixed income did think that if editor of d r be to fall out must come across other editor who must gladly employ must feel safe in giving own sister to man with such income in answer to question started rather bold doctrine on subject of matrimony in general asserting that safety be not desirable that energy patience mutual confidence must be increased by excitement of risk that in opinion behoved young men young woman to come together get married even though there might be not remote danger of distress before admitted that starvation must be disagreeable especially for child in eye of parent alleged child a rule be not starved quoted scripture to prove honest laborious men be not to be seen begging bread in street be very eloquent eloquence be against lady rowley mr trevelyan be afraid of such advanced opinion although everything be of course to be left nominally to decision of sir marmaduke declared that must not recommend sir marmaduke to consent lady rowley said word a to expediency of taking nora back with to mandarin pointing out what appeared to then to be necessity of taking mr trevelyan with also in saying hinted that if nora be disposed to stand by engagement mr stanbury equally so disposed there might be possibility of marriage at future period only in such case there must be correspondence in answer to hugh declared that regarded scheme a being altogether bad mandarin be so very far distant that might a well be engaged to angel in heaven nora if be to go away now must perhaps never come back again if did come back must be old woman with hollow cheek in replying to proposition let fall opinion that nora be old enough to judge for herself said nothing about actual age did not venture to plead that young lady have legal right to do a liked with made manifest that such idea be in mind in answer to lady rowley asserted that nora be good girl must do a father told did not venture to assert that nora must give up engagement lady rowley at last undertook to speak to sir rowley to speak also to daughter hugh be asked for address gave that of office of d r be always to be found there between three five after four time week in reporter gallery of house of common then be at pain to explain to lady rowley that though attended reporter gallery did not report be duty to write leading political article to enable to do so attended debate before went mr trevelyan thanked most cordially for trouble have taken in procuring for address at willesden gave account of journey mother have made to river cottage argued with of that unfortunate man must now be regarded a being altogether out of mind something be said a to great wisdom experience of dr trite turbury then hugh stanbury took leave even lady rowley bade adieu with kind cordiality wonder mamma that nora must like said mr trevelyan be very well dear doubt be pleasant manly really must be almost like marrying beggar for myself said mr trevelyan if must begin life again think that temptation must induce to place in man power sir marmaduke be told of on return home asked many question a to nature of stanbury work when be explained to lady rowley repeating a nearly a must all that hugh have said about expressed opinion that writing for penny newspaper be hardly more safe a source of income than betting on horse race see that be wrong said mr trevelyan say nothing about wrong simply assert that be uncertain very existence of such periodical must in be most insecure sir marmaduke amidst care of government at mandarin have perhaps have better opportunity of watching what be going on in world of letter than have fallen to lot of miss stanbury at exeter think papa be right said lady rowley of course be right be out of question so nora must be told have a yet heard nothing about mr glascock have that misfortune be communicated to cup must indeed have be filled with sorrow to overflowing in evening nora be closeted with father nora dear must understand once for that can not be said sir marmaduke governor when be not disturbed by outward circumstance must assume good deal of personal dignity must speak especially to child with air of indisputable authority what ca be papa said nora sir marmaduke perceived at once that there be indication of obedience in daughter voice prepared for battle conceived to be very strong thought that objection be so well founded that one must deny truth that daughter have not leg to stand on that mamma tell of about mr stanbury do know dear that have not shilling in world know that have fortune papa if mean that profession either nothing can be called profession wish to argue dear because there be room for argument whole thing be preposterous can not think ill of for having proposed to for must have known must have known that young man without income can not be accepted a fitting suitor for gentleman daughter a for yourself can only hope that will get little idea out of head very quickly mamma will speak to about what want to understand from be that there must be end to nora listened to speech in perfect silence standing before father waiting patiently till last word of must be pronounced even when have finished still paused before answered papa said at last hesitated again before went on well dear can not give up must give up illustration must give up said sir marmaduke papa must do anything must for mamma be impossible why be impossible because love so dearly be nonsense be what girl say when choose to run against parent tell that will be given up will not have here forbid to see be quite out of question that must marry man do hope nora be not going to add to

suitor a be mr glascock have accepted pearl of men with position with manner beauty appearance such connection must have be a good a assured marriage for one of sir marmaduke numerous daughter be just woman to look like great lady lady of high rank lady a must almost command men to come throw at unmarried sister foot sir marmaduke have believed in daughter nora have looked forward to see do much for family when crash have come upon trevelyan household have thought almost a much of injured prospect a have of misfortune of sister now seemed that more than good thing of what have dreamed have be

more to than rest can not help if be ever so papa must be angry with pray pray pray say that horrid word again be end of interview sir marmaduke found that have nothing further to say nora when reached last prayer to father referring to curse with have threatened be in tear be leaning on with head against shoulder of course did not say word must be understood a sanctioning engagement with stanbury be a strongly determined a ever that be duty to save from peril of such marriage a nevertheless be so far overcome by a to be softened in manner towards kissed a left told to go to mother then went out thought of felt a though paradise have be opened to child have refused to enter gate chapter lxxi shewing what hugh stanbury thought about duty of man in conference took place between sir marmaduke wife after interview between nora be idea that nothing further must be done at suppose man will come here if be told not said sir marmaduke if doe nora of course will not see then suggested that nora must of course go back with to mandarin when once there must not be able to see stanbury more there must be correspondence anything of sort so thing will die away lady rowley declared that must not quite suffice mr stanbury have made offer in due form must be held to be entitled to answer sir marmaduke therefore wrote following letter to penny liner mitigating asperity of language in compliance with wife counsel manchester street april th dear sir lady rowley have told of proposal to daughter nora have told also what learned from a to circumstance in life need hardly point out to that father must be justified in giving daughter to gentleman upon so small income upon income so very insecure be obliged to refuse consent must therefore ask to abstain from visiting from communicating with daughter yours faithfully marmaduke rowley hugh stanbury esq letter be directed to stanbury at office of d r sir marmaduke a wrote pernicious address felt injured in be compelled to write about daughter to man so circumstanced stanbury when got letter read hastily then threw aside knew what must contain before opened have heard enough from lady rowley to be aware that sir marmaduke must not welcome a son in law indeed have never expected such welcome be half ashamed of own suit because of lowliness of position half regretful that must have induced girl a nora rowley to give up for sake hope of magnificence splendour sir marmaduke letter did not add anything to feeling read again smiled a told that father must certainly be very weak in hand of daughter then went to work again at article with persistent resolve so small trifle a such note must have effect upon daily work of course sir marmaduke must refuse consent of course must be for stanbury to marry girl loved in opposition to father father indeed if nora chose to take a to that be very doubtful a to nora wisdom if nora must take be father opposition to wanted nothing from nora father be not looking for money with wife for fashion countenance bohemian be that must be quite satisfied if girl must walk out to become wife with morning gown on with old hat might come readiest to hand wanted card breakfast carriage fine clothes if nora must choose to come to a be having have previous necessary arrangement duly made such a calling of banns procuring of licence if possible thought that father opposition must almost add something to pleasure of occasion so pitched letter on one side went on with article finished article may be doubted whether be completed with full strength pith needed for moving pulse of national mind a must be moved by leading article in d r a be writing be thinking of nora thinking of letter nora father have sent to trivial a be letter must not keep from repeating word of to 'need hardly point out oh need then why doe refusing consent wonder what old buffer think be meaning of consent when be speaking of daughter old enough to manage for abstain from visiting communicating with if visit communicates with what then ca force way into house can force way out doe imagine that can be locked up in nursery put into corner so argued with by such argument brought to conviction that must be well for to answer sir marmaduke letter did at once before leaving office of d r fleet street th april dear sir marmaduke rowley have just received letter be indeed sorry that content must be so little favourable to hope understand that objection to be simply in regard to smallness insecurity of income on first point may say have fair hope that may be at once increased a to second believe may assert that be a sure at least a income of other professional men such a barrister merchant doctor can not promise to say will not see daughter if desire to do so of course will be guided by view wish that might be allowed opportunity of seeing a think must reverse at least mitigate of objection feel to marriage yours most faithfully hugh stanbury on next day one sir marmaduke came to be sitting at office of d r in very small dirty room at back of house sir marmaduke found way thither through confused crowd of compositor pressman printer boy thought that have never before be in place so foul so dark so crowded so comfortless be accustomed to do work out in island with many of appanage of vice royalty around have secretary private secretary inner room waiting room not unfrequently have honour of dusky sentinel walking before door through be to be approached have idea that gentleman at work have comfortable appurtenance around such a carpet dispatch box unlimited stationery easy chair for temporary leisure big table space small world of book around to give at least look of erudition to pursuit there be nothing of kind in miserably dark room occupied by stanbury be sitting at wretched little table on there be nothing morsel of blotting paper small ink bottle paper on be scribbling there be carpet there dispatch box only book in room be little dog eared dictionary sir marmaduke be so much obliged to for coming said hugh fear will find place little rough will be alone place mr stanbury will not signify think not in least if mind got letter know sir marmaduke have have reply have come to because have expressed wish for interview see that will do good be very kind for coming indeed sir marmaduke very kind thought might explain something to about income can tell that have permanent income go on regularly from month to month sir marmaduke did not feel slightest respect for income be paid monthly according to idea gentleman income must be paid quarterly perhaps yearly according to view monthly salary be only one degree better than weekly wage suppose be permanence said hugh stanbury can not say that so regard barrister get know very irregularly there be saying when may have barrister profession be recognised a profession among gentleman mr stanbury be not ours recognised of barrister men of literature have most effect on world at large who be most thought of in london sir marmaduke lord chancellor editor of 'jupiter lord chancellor great deal said sir marmaduke quite dismayed by audacity of question by mean sir marmaduke said stanbury throwing out hand before so a to give energy of action to word have higher rank will admit must think so said sir marmaduke larger income very much larger must say said sir marmaduke with smile wear wig yes wear wig said sir marmaduke hardly knowing in what spirit to accept assertion nobody care one brass button for opinion said stanbury bringing down hand heavily on little table for sake of emphasis what sir if will think of be so nobody care for lord chancellor certainly be fact that gentleman living in mandarin island do think more of lord chancellor lord mayor lord lieutenant lord chamberlain than whose sphere of life bring into closer contact with august functionary presume mr stanbury that connection with penny newspaper make such opinion a almost necessity quite necessity sir marmaduke man can hold own in print now day unless can see difference between tinsel gold lord chancellor of course be tinsel say so may be great lawyer very useful lordship wig woolsack be tinsel in comparison with real power possessed by editor of leading newspaper if lord chancellor be to go to bed for month must be much missed know sir be not in secret of cabinet must think must about a much a grandmother if editor of 'jupiter be to be taken ill must work quite commotion for must be glad on public ground because like mode of business must have effect because be leading man see what lead to mr stanbury only to that who write for press think that calling be recognised must be recognised a profession talk of permanence sir marmaduke be not newspaper permanent come out regularly day more of still more of be always coming out expect collapse among there will be plenty of newspaper doubt more than plenty perhaps somebody must write writer will be paid anybody must write most of must say wish must try sir marmaduke just try hand at leading article to night read to morrow morning have great deal too much to do mr stanbury just so have doubt affair of government to look to be so apt to ignore work of neighbour seems to must go over govern mandarin without slightest trouble in world doubt be mistaken just a be about writing for newspaper know said sir marmaduke rising from chair with dignity called here to discus such matter a a happens mr stanbury be not governor of mandarin have not honour to write for column of penny newspaper with be associated be therefore useless to discus what of might do in position held by other altogether useless sir marmaduke except just for fun of thing see fun mr stanbury came here at request to hear what might have to urge against decision expressed to in reference to daughter a seems that have nothing to urge will not take up time further have great deal to urge have urged great deal have indeed have complained that work be not permanent have shewn that be so permanent that there be possibility of coming to end there must be newspaper people trained to write must be employed have be at now about two year know what earn must have got so far in so short time a lawyer doctor clergyman soldier sailor government clerk in of employment choose to call profession think be urging great deal think be urging everything very well mr stanbury have listened to in certain degree admire zeal ingenuity will say did mean to call for admiration sir marmaduke suppose say good sense discrimination let pas must permit to remark that position be not such a to justify in trusting daughter to care a mind on matter be quite made up a be that also of lady rowley must ask to give promise that suit to daughter will be discontinued what doe say about sir marmaduke what have said to have be for ear not for yours what say be for ear for yours for mother ear for ear of who may choose to hear will never give up suit to daughter till be forced to do so by full conviction that have given up be best to be plain sir marmaduke of course understand mr stanbury mean to be quite clear have always thought that when gentleman be told by head of family that must not be made welcome in family be considered to be duty of gentleman a gentleman to abandon vain pursuit have be brought up with idea sir marmaduke have be brought up in idea that when man have won affection of woman be duty of man a man to stick to through thick thin mean to do duty according to idea then sir have nothing further to say to take leave must only caution not to enter door a passage be dark intricate be necessary that stanbury must shew sir out did in silence when parted of lifted hat not word more be said that same night there be note put into nora hand a be following mother out of one of theatre in confusion did not even see messenger who have handed to sister lucy saw that have taken note questioned about

ladder dear have nothing of lydia about do like own way like especially when be at end of path be quite out of question that must go back to island think be justified in already assuming enough of husband to declare that such going back must not be held for moment in question proposition be that must authorise to make such arrangement a may be needed in regard to licence banns else that must then simply walk from house to church marry be of age can do a please father mother can have right to stop doubt that mother must accompany if be fully satisfied of purpose write to to d r own ever ever always h s will try get given to a leave theatre if must fall into other hand much care be not in least ashamed of what be doing hope that be not chapter lxxii delivery of lamb illustration be hoped that certain quarter of lamb will not have be forgotten quarter of lamb be sent a peace offering from exeter to nuncombe putney by hand of miss stanbury martha not with purpose of corruption not intended to buy back allegiance of dorothy folded delicately temptingly in one of best table napkin with idea of bribery sent a present used to be sent of old in train of great ambassador a sign of friendship mark of true respect miss stanbury be doubt most anxious that niece must return to be not low spirited enough to conceive that quarter of lamb must be efficacious in procuring such return if might be that dorothy heart must be touched by mention of weariness of aunt solitary life if therefore must return must be very well must not be well so unless offer must come from dorothy of martha have be made to understand by mistress considerable ingenuity having be exercised in matter on side on arrival at lessboro martha have hired fly be driven out to nuncombe putney felt knew not why dislike to be taken in carriage to door of cottage be put down in middle of village from whence walked out to mr stanbury abode with basket upon arm be good half mile lamb be heavy for miss stanbury have suggested that bottle of sherry must be put in under napkin martha be becoming tired of burden when whom must see on road before brooke burgess a said afterwards immediately occurred to that fat be in fire here have young man come down passing through exeter without even visit to miss stanbury have clandestinely sought out young woman whom be to marry here be young woman flying in aunt face when one scratch of pen might ruin martha entertained sacred awful overcoming feeling about mistress will that be to have something supposed anxiety be not on that score have heard so much about have realised so fully great power miss stanbury possessed have have own feeling so rudely invaded by alteration in miss stanbury plan that have come to entertain idea that person around must continually bear will in memory hugh have undoubtedly be favourite must martha have dictated will herself must still have made hugh heir have realised resolution of mistress so far a to confess that bulk of property be to go back to burgess there be very many burgess here be one who have be selected flying in very face of testatrix what be to be done be to go back not tell mistress that have seen brooke burgess at nuncombe then must fact be found out must devoted anger of miss stanbury fall upon own head must be absolutely necessary that must tell story let consequence be what might consequence probably must be very dreadful mr brooke be not said a came up to putting basket down in middle of dusty road then who can be said brooke giving hand to shake what do bring here mr brooke goodness what will missus say will make that straight be going back to exeter to morrow then there be many question many answer be sojourning at mr crocket have be there for last two day dear dear

talked of church porch at cockchaffington beauty of country mr brooke ought to be ashamed of said martha ai least in world said brooke then martha took up basket went on to cottage have be close in sight during conversation in road felt angry with dorothy in such matter woman be always angry with woman who have probably be quite passive rarely with man who be ever real transgressor having man down after at nuncombe putney have never struck martha a very horrible that brooke burgess must fall in love with dorothy in city meeting in remoteness of country out of sight even of village be almost indecent too with miss stanbury will just a one might say on balance dorothy ought to have buried rather than have allowed brooke to see at nuncombe putney dorothy mother priscilla must be worse trudged on however with lamb soon found in presence of three lady what martha said dorothy yes miss here be 'd have be here hour ago amost if have be stopped on road who stopped asked priscilla

mr brooke must congratulate be settled now mamma sister know about martha when be thus asked directly for congratulation hardly knew at once how to express being fully aware of miss stanbury objection to marriage must not venture to express approbation of be very improper in martha mind that young woman must have follower when missus did approve of understood well enough that in matter of follower privilege be allowed to young lady be not accorded to maid servant young lady may do thing have young men to walk talk with to dance with embrace perhaps even more than when for so much young woman must be turned into street without character martha knew knew also that miss dorothy though mother lived in very little cottage be not altogether debarred in matter of follower from privilege of lady yet miss dorothy position be so very peculiar look at will rather at embryo will might be made day now probably must be made might affect so terribly people who have not got money must not fly in face of who have such at least be martha opinion very strongly how must congratulate miss dorothy under existing circumstance do hope will be happy miss that know said martha in difficulty now ma'be miss

said arabella must be cruel replied camilla think that even miss stanbury be so false a thing be going very badly at heavitree there be war there almost everlastingly though such little playful conversation a above shewed that there might be occasional lull in battle mr gibson be not doing duty be clear enough even mr french when be appealed to with almost frantic energy by younger daughter must not acknowledge that be very remiss a lover camilla in fury be very imprudent that very frantic energy induced to appeal to mother be in proof of imprudence knew that be foolish must not control passion twice have detected arabella in receiving note from mr gibson did not see of have be intended that must know nothing once when spent night away at ottery st mary with friend visit be specially prefatory to marriage made in reference to bridesmaid dress arabella have have so at least camilla be made to believe secret meeting with mr gibson in of lane lead down from heavitree to topsham road happened to meet spoke two word to said arabella must have cut will tell what be bella if there be underhand game going on understand exeter will be on fire before will carry out bella made answer to shrugged shoulder camilla be almost at loss to guess what might be truth must not sister so accused on occasion rebut accusation with awful wrath arabella simply shrugged shoulder went way be now th of april there wanted one short fortnight to marriage man have not courage to jilt felt sure that have not heart enough to do deed of such audacity sister too be weak coward must lack power to stand on leg declare to be perpetrator of such villany mother a knew well must always have preferred that elder daughter must be bride mother be not woman to have hardihood now in eleventh hour to favour intrigue let wish be what might must not be strong enough to carry through accomplishment of must know that threat of hers of setting exeter on fire must be carried out after fashion must not be inadequate to occasion sister mother promised lover false so damnably cruelly false be impossible history novel of most sensational interest wonderful villany have ever be wrought into prose poetry must have be equal to be impossible told so score of time day yet circumstance be so terribly suspicious mr gibson conduct a lover be simply disgraceful to a man clergyman be full of excuse knew to be false must never come near if must help when be with be a cold a archbishop in word in action nothing must tempt to outward manifestation of affection must talk of nothing poor woman of st peter cum pumpkin in city fraudulent idleness of certain colleague in cathedral service who be always shirking work made present never walked with be always gloomy have indeed so behaved in public that people be beginning to talk of poor mr gibson yet must meet arabella on sly in lane send note to by green grocer boy poor mr gibson indeed let once get well over th of april people of exeter might talk about poor mr gibson if pleased bella conduct be more wonderful almost than of mr gibson with cowardice still held up head held perhaps little higher than be usual with when grievous accusation be made against made repeated accusation very thought sound of must almost have annihilated have there be decent feeling in bosom must simply shrug shoulder walk away camilla have once said will drive that man mad before have done what be to how drive camilla have answered in fury then arabella have again shrugged shoulder walked away between camilla mother too there have come to be almost internecine quarrel on collateral point camilla be still carrying on vast arrangement called preparation of trousseau mr french bella regarded a spoliation of domestic nest for proud purpose of one of younger bird have grown so fearfully that in two different place mr french have found compelled to request that further article might be supplied to miss camilla bride elect have rebelled alleging that a fortune be to be provided for have right to take with such thing a must carry away in trunk box money must be have at bank said after be fifty pound more le on occasion a then went into calculation to prove that mother sister must be made so much richer by absence that be doing so much for by marriage that nothing must be more mean in than that must hesitate to supply with such thing a desired to make entrance into mr gibson house respectable mr french be obdurate mr gibson be desired to speak to mr gibson in fear trembling told that ought to repress spirit of extravagance camilla at once foresaw that must avail of plea against must find possible at time to avail of plea became ferocious turning upon told to mind own business be not for that be doing be not said disposed to submit to control in such matter from till have assumed legal right to by standing with before altar came however to be known over exeter miss camilla expenditure have be checked that in spite of joy naturally incidental to wedding thing be not going well with lady at heavitree at last blow came camilla be aware that on certain morning mother have be to mr gibson house have held long conference with must learn nothing of what took place there for at moment have taken upon to place on non speaking term with mother in consequence of disgraceful order have be given to tradesman bella have not be at mr gibson house at time camilla though presumed that own conduct have be discussed in manner very injurious to herself did not believe that step be being then arranged must be positively antagonistic to own view day fixed be now so very near that there must felt be escape for victim be wrong mr gibson have be found by mr french in very excited state on occasion have wept pulled hair torn open waistcoat have spoken of a wretch pleading however at same time that be more sinned against than sinning have paced about room with hand dashing against brow at last have flung prostrate on ground meaning of be that have tried very hard have found at last that must do be ready to submit said to verdict that may pronounce against must deceive deceive if did say at once ca do went on to explain since have unfortunately entered into present engagement with camilla of whose position spoke in quite touching manner since have found what be condition of own heart feeling have consulted friend who if merely human being be capable of advising might be implicitly trusted for advice in such matter that friend have told that be bound to give up marriage let consequence to to others be what might although sky must fall on can not stand at hymeneal altar with lie in mouth said mr gibson immediately upon rising from prostrate condition on floor in position a mother fury must surely be very great mr french be hardly furious cried begged to think better of assured that camilla when must be calmed down by matrimony must not be so bad a seemed be not furious truth be mr gibson said through tear that after like bella best mr gibson owned that did like bella best although bargain be made between then there such making of bargain then there must hardly have be practicable be understood that mr french must not proceed to extremity if mr gibson must still make forthcoming a husband for advantage of one of daughter of family so far mr gibson have progressed towards partial liberation from thraldom with considerable amount of courage be well aware that great act of daring still remained to be done have suggested to mr french that must settle matter with camilla mr french have altogether declined to do must said come from if be to do must sympathise with child such sympathy must be obstructive of future arrangement be still to be made always knew that liked bella best said mr gibson still sobbing still tearing hair still pacing room with waistcoat torn open must not advise to tell said mr french then mr french went home early on following morning be thought good by arabella that also must pay visit at ottery st mary good bye cammy said arabella a went bella said camilla wonder whether be serpent think can be so base serpent a declare cammy do say such odd thing that one can understand what mean so went on that morning mr gibson be walking at early hour along road from exeter to cowley contemplating position striving to arrange plan what be to do how be to do be prepared to throw up living to abandon cathedral to leave diocese to make sacrifice rather than take camilla to bosom within last six week have learned to regard with almost holy horror must not understand by what miracle of self neglect have fallen into so perilous abyss have long known camilla temper in day in have be beaten like shuttlecock between stanburys french have lost head have done knew not what whom god chooses to destroy first maddens said mr gibson to of throwing back upon early erudition pagan philosophy then looked across to river exe thought that there be hardly water enough there to cover multiplicity of sorrow something must be done have proceeded so far in forming resolution a reached st david church on return homewards sagacious friend have told that a soon a have altered mind be bound to let lady know of without delay must remember said sagacious friend that will owe much very much mr gibson be perplexed in mind when reflected how much might possibly be made to owe if must decide on appealing to jury of countryman for justice anything must be better than home at st peter cum pumpkin with camilla sitting opposite to a wife be there not distant land in clergyman unfortunate still energetic might find work to do be there not america be there not australia new zealand natal open to must not missionary career among chinese be better for than st peter cum pumpkin with camilla french for wife by time have reached home mind be made up must write letter to camilla at once must marry arabella at once on day might be fixed on condition that camilla must submit to defeat without legal redress if legal redress must be demanded must put in evidence fact that own mother have be compelled to caution tradesman of city in regard to extravagance did write letter in agony of spirit sit down camilla with sad heart reluctant hand said to communicate to fatal truth truth must be made to prevail there be nothing in man so cowardly so detrimental so unmanly a concealment have looked into have inquired of have assured be to become husband must not make happy must be of use for now to dilate on reason have convinced be convinced consider duty to inform so at once have be closeted with mother have made understand that be so have not word to say in own justification be sure be acting honestly in telling truth must not wish to say word animadverting on if there must be blame in matter be willing to take on own shoulder thing have be done of late word have be spoken habit have displayed must not be sure conduce to mutual comfort in world to assistance to other in struggle to reach happiness of world to come think that will agree with camilla that when man woman have fallen into such mistake a have now made be best that must be acknowledged know well that change of arrangement a now propose will be regarded most unfavourably will not anything be better than binding of matrimonial knot can not be again unloosed must regret know that need add anything further what can add further only that be inflexible having resolved to take step to bear evil thing may be said of for happiness for own tranquility will not now relinquish resolution ask to forgive doubt much whether will ever be quite able to forgive mistake have made be one must not have be committed ask to forgive do ask to pray may be forgiven yours with feeling of truest friendship thomas gibson letter have be very difficult be rather proud of than otherwise when be completed have felt that be writing letter not improbably might become public property be necessary that must be firm that must accuse little in order that might excuse much that must hint at cause might justify rupture though must so veil a not to appear to defend own delinquency by ungenerous counter accusation when have completed letter thought that have done rather well sent despatch off to heavitree by clerk of st peter church with something of feeling of expressible relief attends final conquest over fatal insuperable misfortune thought that be sure now that must not have to marry camilla on th of month there must probably be period of hour before must be called upon to hear read camilla reply camilla be alone when received letter rushed at once to mother there said there knew that be coming mr french took paper into hand gasped gazed at daughter without speaking knew of yesterday when told knew of bella know not word of doe be sure doe be nothing will not accept can not treat so will drag there will come ca make dear will make must help mamma if have spirit what

special mission of great importance on second day went out to call at embassy to leave card have be able to learn whether be here asked lady rowley of husband in whisper a soon a be alone who trevelyan did not suppose must learn about because must be hiding be mr glascock here forgot to ask said sir marmaduke lady rowley did not reproach be impossible that father must altogether share mother anxiety in regard to marriage of daughter what thing must be lady rowley thought that must compound for misfortune in other respect if must have daughter married to future lord peterborough have be told in england that be faultless not very clever not very active not likely to be very famous a husband simply faultless be very rich very good natured easily managed more likely to be proud of wife than of addicted to jealousy afflicted by vice so respectable in way that be sure to become great a english nobleman by very weight of virtue have be represented also to lady rowley that paragon among men have be passionately attached to daughter perhaps magnified little romance of story seemed to that greatly endowed lover have rushed away from country in despair because daughter nora must not smile upon now be a hoped in same city with be indispensable to success that must not seem to be running after to nora not word have be said of prospect of meeting mr glascock at

moment of unbelief that rumour have be set afloat by english minister wife with express intention of turning mr glascock into ridicule have never occurred to to doubt that wallachia be eldest of family of niece must be possible that man who have known nora who have undoubtedly loved nora who have travelled way from london to nuncombe putney to ask nora to be wife must within twelve month of time have resolved to marry woman whom must have selected simply a being most opposite to nora of female human being that must find be not credible to if be not true there might still be hope nora have met have spoken to have seemed that for moment two have spoken a friend lady rowley when talking to mr spalding have watched closely have seen that nora eye have be bright that there have be something between be pleasant suddenly found close to wallachia thought that must trust to word have be long in florence asked lady rowley in softest voice pretty considerable time ma'be be since fall

circumstance of society around be oppressive to spirit when war be raging around be light spirited a lark mount through morning sky must have thought be very dreadful said lady rowley full of dread of awe of horror be fiery day of indiscriminate slaughter be not day of desolation because hope be always there by side there be hope in soul must trust trusting soul be ever light buoyant dare say be said lady rowley apathy serfdom kinghood dominion drain fountain of living spring soul becomes like plummet of lead whose only tendency be to hide in subaqueous mud unsavoury slush subaqueous mud unsavoury slush lady rowley repeated word to herself a made good escape again expressed to herself conviction that must not possibly be so subaqueous mud unsavoury slush with have gone before about soul be altogether unintelligible to knew that be american buncom of high order of eloquence told again again that must not be so continued to keep eye upon mr glascock soon saw again talking to nora be hardly possible thought that nora must speak to with so much animation to unless there be feeling between if properly handled might lead to renewal of old tenderness went up to nora having collected other girl said that carriage be then waiting for mr glascock immediately offered lady rowley arm took down to hall must be that be leaning upon future son in law there be something in thought made lay weight upon with freedom must not otherwise have used oh that nora must live to be lady peterborough be apt to abuse mother for wanting high husband for daughter can there be point in true maternal instinct can shew with more affectionate enthusiasm poor mother wanted nothing for herself from mr glascock knew very well that be fate to go back to mandarin probably to die there knew also that such men a mr glascock when marry beneath in rank fortune will not ordinarily trouble much with mother in law there be nothing desired for be match accomplished might perhaps indulge in talking among planter wife of daughter coronet at present moment there be idea even of in mind be of nora of nora sister that be thinking for that be plotting that one might be rich splendid others

marriage must be even inappropriate have withstood gallantly expression of father displeasure with such spirit a nora might be easier to prevail by silence than by many word lady rowley be quite sure of that must be far better to say nothing further of hugh stanbury let cure come if might be possible from absence from daughter good sense only question be whether must be wise to say word about mr glascock in carriage be not only forbearing flattering in manner to nora caressed girl hand spoke to a mother know how to speak when want to make much of girl to have understood that girl be behaving

feeling in engaging to marry young lady creature said lady rowley with emphasis british minister wife noticed simply by shaking head caroline spalding be undoubtedly pretty girl a british minister

delighted at sister success heard with rapture description of monkhams came to second hand through sister be already settled that be to spend next christmas at monkhams perhaps there might be idea in mind that there be other eldest son of old lord who must like american bride everything around caroline spalding be pleasant except word of wallachia petrie everything around be pleasant till there came to touch of suspicion that marriage mr glascock be going to make must be detrimental to intended husband in own country there be many in florence who be saying besides wife of english minister lady rowley of course caroline spalding be last to hear to idea be brought by wallachia petrie wish must think must make happy wallachia have said croaking why must fail to make happy because be not

utter nothing be not true opinion a best knew how to express sympathy must have prompted to give such answer a must at once have made caroline happy in mind must have be delighted to have be able to declare that doubt be utterly groundless hesitation needle conceived that owed a duty from one woman to to speak truth a conceived on so momentous occasion be not sure mr glascock must be considered by friend in england to be doing badly in marrying american girl what did not remember be that very hesitation be in fact answer answer a be most unwilling to give see that must be so said caroline

effort have be made to give air of italian luxury window be thrown open down to ground table be decorated with fruit three four long necked bottle trevelyan waved with hand towards arm chair mr glascock have alternative to seat felt that be sitting down to breakfast with madman if did not sit down madman might perhaps break out into madness then trevelyan went to door called aloud for catarina in remote place said have to do without civilisation of bell perhaps one gain a much in quiet a one loses in comfort then catarina came with hot meat fried potato mr glascock be compelled to help be bad trencherman said trevelyan will lament misfortune doubly if must interfere with appetite then got up poured out wine into mr glascock glass tell that come from baron vineyard said

mother must have left must not go to casalunga if husband must not give entrance if did go must be safe for to take boy with be to remain in florence must be hardly nearer to for useful purpose than in england even must pitch tent at siena occupying there desolate set of huge apartment in deserted palace of what use must be to must stay there if desired to go be probable that must be willing that

eleventh hour hatred be pleasant excitement to abuse of miss stanbury be chosen recreation unuttered daily curse a looked over to door be relief to nevertheless must go a brooke have said harm must come of going must go at least listen to proposition about seven in evening knock be heard at door miss stanbury be sitting in small up stair parlour dressed in second best gown be prepared with considerable stiffness state for occasion dorothy be with be desired in quick voice to hurry away moment knock be heard a though old barty must have jumped from hall door into room at bound dorothy collected with little start went without word have heard much of barty burgess have never spoken to be subject to feeling of great awe when must remember that grim old man of whom have heard so much evil must soon be uncle according to arrangement mr burgess be shewn up stair by nephew barty burgess have be born in very house have not be inside wall of for more than thirty year also be somewhat awed by occasion followed nephew without word brooke be to remain at hand so that might be summoned must be wanted have be decided by miss stanbury that must not be present at interview a soon a visitor entered room rose in stately way curtseyed propping with one hand upon table a did so looked full in face meanwhile curtseying second time asked to seat in chair have be prepared for did very well may be surmised that have rehearsed little scene perhaps more than once when nobody be looking at bowed walked round to chair seated finding that be so placed that must not see neighbour face moved chair be not going to fight duel a with disadvantage of sun in eye illustration barty burgess hitherto there have hardly be word spoken miss stanbury have muttered something a be curtseying barty burgess have made return then began mr burgess said be indebted to for complaisance in coming here at request to bowed again must not have ventured thus to trouble be not that year be dealing more hardly with than be with must not have ventured to discus matter of deep interest otherwise than in own room be room now certainly by law barty burgess remembered when be mother room when used to give meal there now so many many year ago bowed again said not word knew well that must sooner be brought to point by silence than by speech be long time coming to point before must do so be forced to allude to time long past to subject found very difficult to touch without saying that must either belie seem to be severe upon though have prepared must hardly get word spoken be greatly impeded by obstinacy of silence at last proposition be made to told that nephew brooke be about to be married to niece dorothy that be intention to make brooke heir in bulk of property have received under will of late mr brooke burgess indeed said received at brother hand will go back to brother family unimpaired only bowed must not say word then went on to say that have at first be matter to of deep regret that brooke must have set affection upon niece a there have be in mind strong desire that none of own people must enjoy reversion of wealth have always regarded a being hers only for term of life that have found that young people have be so much in earnest that own feeling have be so near akin to prejudice that have yielded when be said barty smiled instead of bowing miss stanbury felt that there might be something worse even than silence smile told that believed to be lying nevertheless went on be not fool enough to suppose that whole nature of man be to be changed by few word from so went on marriage be thing fixed be thinking of settlement have be talking to lawyer about new will know can help said barty finding that longer pause than usual made word from absolutely necessary be going on to regret that story must detain so long mr burgess did go on have said made saving out of income be not going to trouble mr burgess with matter only that might explain to that what must at once give to young couple what must settle on dorothy after own death must come from such saving such gift bequest must not diminish family property barty again smiled a heard miss stanbury in heart likened to devil in person still went on be very desirous that brooke burgess must come live at exeter property must be in town neighbourhood must be seemly thing such be word that must occupy house have belonged to grandfather great grandfather then moreover acknowledged that spoke selfishly dreaded idea of being left alone for remainder of own year proposition at last be uttered be simply barty burgess must give to nephew brooke share in bank be damned if do said barty burgess rising up from chair before have left room have agreed to consider proposition miss stanbury have of course known that such suggestion coming from without adequate reason assigned must have be mere idle wind be prepared with such adequate reason if mr burgess must see way to make proposed transfer of share of bank business miss stanbury must hand over to for life certain proportion of burgess property lay in city income of must exceed that drawn by from business must at time of life take that for doing nothing now got for working hard be meaning of then too a far a portion of property went extended to house owned by miss stanbury on bank side of close must belong altogether to barty burgess for life will simply be mr burgess that brooke will be heir a must be natural know that must be at natural said must prefer to choose own heir doubt mr burgess in respect to own property said miss stanbury at last said that must think of consult partner then got up to take leave for myself said miss stanbury must wish that animosity might be buried can say that be buried said grim old man nobody will believe what matter if must believe suppose did believe that much good can come from talking of such thing miss stanbury have grown too old to swear friendship will think of thing if find that can be

manner in at first seemed to entertain proposition indeed for couple of hour thought that scheme must be abandoned be pointed out to that mr barty burgess life must probably be short that barty have small part of business at disposal gradually way to term be seen not quite so simple a miss stanbury have suggested brooke when left exeter did believe possible that after might become family

word two about trevelyan being oldest friend have in world even if there be nothing else sir marmaduke felt ashamed of without cause indeed for offer be natural said nothing further about appeared to

know more will divulge more in quarter of hour of properest mode of getting from city in europe to other city more than fifty mile distant than can be learned in first city in single morning with aid of courier carriage pair of horse temper that ordinary tourist posse bradshaw be have out be at last discovered that nothing must be gained in journey from london to siena by starting in morning

carry letter of introduction to mr spalding be who wrote sir marmaduke have not foregathered very closely with english minister nothing be said of assistance must be peculiarly british then at last about three four in morning came moment for parting sir marmaduke have suggested that stanbury must dine with on next day before started hugh have declined alleging that a day be at command must be devoted to work of providing for absence in truth sir marmaduke have given invitation with surly voice hugh though be ready to go to north pole for others of family be at moment in aggressive mood of mind towards sir marmaduke will send message directly get there said holding lady rowley by hand will write fully to immediately god bless dear friend said lady rowley cry good night sir marmaduke said hugh good night mr stanbury then gave hand to two girl of whom a took sobbed looked away from nora nora be standing away from by away from door holding on to chair with hand clasped together have prepared nothing not word attitude not thought for farewell have felt that be coming have known that must trust to for cue for own demeanour if must say adieu with quiet voice simply with touch of hand then must do same endeavour to think worse of have prepared anything when moment came must not leave after fashion stood moment hesitating not approaching merely called by name nora for moment be still for moment held by chair then rushed into arm did not much care for father now kissed hair forehead held closely to bosom own own nora be necessary that sir marmaduke must say something there be at first little scene between woman during arranged deportment mr stanbury said let be so must wish for child sake also for own that mean of living be le precarious hugh accepted simply a authority

there for four five hour went to inn dressed washed have meal be then driven to mr spalding house found american minister at home be received with cordiality mr spalding must tell little nothing about trevelyan went up to mr spalding room hugh be told by that have seen mr trevelyan once since niece marriage that then have represented husband a being very feeble hugh in midst of trouble be amused by

thereby that knew about hugh stanbury relation to nora rowley from in accordance with teaching got ala now many year ago from great master on subject must conclude that poor dear mr spalding be snob nevertheless with deference to memory of great master think that mr spalding allusion to success in life achieved by niece be natural altogether pardonable reticence on subject calculated determination to abstain from mentioning triumph must have be very dear to must have betrayed on whole condition of mind lower than exhibited while rank wealth money be held to be good thing by around let be acknowledged a such be natural that mother must be a proud when daughter marries earl heir a when son becomes senior wrangler when meet lady in mr spalding condition who purposely abstains from mentioning name of titled daughter will be disposed to judge harshly of secret working of lady thought on subject prefer exhibition feel to be natural mr spalding got friend by button hole be making

sister with when nora first heard of almost screamed with surprise if truth must be told with disappointment also never liked mamma then be so much more good natured want to go to merely because be good natured enough to receive person dislike know be very good know must sacrifice for anything thought right mamma be such bore lady rowley must not be talked down even by nora in fashion nora be somewhat touched with idea that must be fine independent thing to live alone if be only for week two just because other young lady never lived alone perhaps there be half formed notion in mind that permission to do so be part of reward due to for having refused to marry lord stanbury be in respect bohemian must become thought to have little practice in bohemian line have indeed declined bohemian marriage feeling strongly averse to encounter loud displeasure of father mother a long a everything be quite proper a long a there must be running away subjection of name to scandal considered that little independence must be useful agreeable have looked forward to sitting up at night alone by single tallow candle to stretching beefsteak so a to last for two day dinner perhaps to making own bed now there must not be slightest touch of romance in visit to lady milborough house in eccleston square at end of july lady rowley however be of different opinion spoke mind plainly nora dear be fool

on return home that something will turn up will make going back to same banishment unnecessary what governor of hong kong what minister to bogota what general of force at gold coast ever left scene of official military labour without hope be almost expectation that grateful country must do something better for before period of return must have arrived grateful country be doing nothing better for

make necessary that law must interfere to take care of man so argued doctor need not be mad because be jealous even though jealousy be ever so absurd trevelyan in jealousy have done nothing cruel nothing wasteful nothing infamous in nora be very little inclined to agree with doctor thought nothing must be more infamous than trevelyan conduct at present moment unless indeed must be screened from infamy by plea of madness then there be more behind trevelyan have be so wasted by kind of life have led possessed by nature stamen so insufficient to resist such debility that be very doubtful

sad nora when left cottage be still very bitter against brother in law quoting doctor opinion a to sanity expressing own a to conduct under supposition also believed that must rally in health be therefore on account le inclined to pity than be wife emily trevelyan of course saw more of than did sister understood better how possible be that man might be in such condition a to be neither mad
