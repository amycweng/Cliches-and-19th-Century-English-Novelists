heard from one that must be made le fatiguing for baby than other route baby have be carried down in litter strapped on to mule back guide at mule head must be necessary be when once in boat baby must be a well a in cradle what purpose can not woman gain by perseverance purpose in instance mr arkwright did at last gain by persevering then preparation for journey went on with much flurrying hot haste to at home who live feel life day manufacture of endless baby linen packing of mountain of clothes doe not give idea of much pleasurable excitement at san jos where there be scarcely motion enough in existence to prevent water from becoming foul with stagnation packing of baby linen be delightful for month so day went by with happy wing by degree report began to reach arkwright wife a to new route made uneasy wet season have be prolonged even though might not be deluged by rain path must be in such state of mud a to render labour incessant one two people declared that road be unfit at time for womanand then river must be much swollen tidings did not reach arkwright wife together at rate not till late amidst preparation change might still have be made a be after entreaty mr arkwright did not like to ask again to alter plan having altered once be averse to change again so thing went on till mule boat have be hired thing have gone so far that change must then be made without much cost trouble during last ten day of sojourn at san jos mr arkwright have lost appearance of joy have cheered up sweet face during last few month terror at terrible journey obliterated in mind happiness have arisen from hope of being soon at home be thoroughly cowed by danger to be encountered must gladly have gone down to punt arena have be now possible that must so arrange rained

not given to much talking silent thoughtful man stern withal in outward bearing tender hearted loving in nature sweet young wife who have left come with out to dull distant place be very dear to himdearer than be aware in day be thinking much of coming trouble why have given way to foolish prayer ah why indeed thus last few day of sojourn in san jos passed away from once twice during day did speak out expressing fear feeling be too much for must not restrain poor mamma said will never see then again harry know will never reach home alive fanny darling be nonsense in order that spoken word might not sound stern to took in arm kissed must behave well fanny said to day before started though heart be then very low within promised that must do best then made great resolution though must be dying on road must not complain beyond absolute necessity of nature fully recognised thoughtful tender kindness for though thus cautioned never told that danger feared be result of own choice never threw in teeth prayer have made in yielding to knew that have be weak then came morning of departure party of traveller consisted of four besides baby there be mr arkwright wife english nurse who be

settled must hope for best on morning on started sun shone fairly accepted a omen of good baby seemed to lay comfortably on pile of blanket on mule back face of tall indian guide who took place at mule head pleased anxious mother not leave ever said in spanish laying hand on cord be fastened to beast head not for one moment did leave charge though labour of sticking close to be very great have four attendant guide of whom made journey on foot that be men of mixed race be probable three of must have be called spaniard spaniard be of costa rica other must be called indian one of spaniard be leader chief man of party others seemed to stand on equal footing with other indeed place of greatest care have be given to indian for first four five mile route lay along high road lead from san jos to punt arena so far group of acquaintance followed mounted on mule here where way forked road leading through great forest to atlantic separated many tear be shed on side what might be future life of arkwrights have not be absolutely fixed there be strong hope on part that might never be forced to return to costa rica from whom now parted have not seemed to be dear to in especial degree while lived together in same small town seeing other day by day nownow that might never meet again certain love sprang up for old familiar face woman kissed other who hitherto have hardly cared to enter others house then party of arkwrights again started steady work began in whole of first day way beneath foot be tolerably good weather continued fine be one long gradual ascent from plain where road parted there be real labour in travelling mr arkwright rode beside baby mule at head of indian always walked two men went together in front husband have found that wife must prefer a long a road allowed of such arrangement heart be too full to admit of much speaking so went on in silence first night be passed in hut by roadside seemed to be deserteda hut rancho a be called in country food have of course brought with here by common consent endeavoured in sort to make merry fanny arkwright said to be not so bad after eh darling answered only that mule tire one so will all day be a long a that have not heart to tell that a regarded hour of work first day must of necessity be shortest have risen to considerable altitude night be very cold baby be enveloped among pile of coloured blanket thing did not go very badly with only that when fanny arkwright rose from hard bed limb be more weary much more stiff than have be when arkwright have lifted from mule on second morning mounted before day have quite broken in order that might breakfast on summit of ridge separate two ocean at spot good road come to end forest track begin here also must in truth enter forest though path have for time be among straggling tree bush now again rode two two up to place of halting arkwright ring well knowing that from hence labour must in truth commence poor mr arkwright when reached resting place must fain have remained there for rest of day one word in low plaintive voice said asking whether might not sleep in large shed stand there be manifestly impossible at pace must never reach greytown spoke further word when told that must go on at about noon that day file of traveller formed into line afterwards kept during whole of journey then started by narrow path into forest first walked leader of guide then man following abel ring came next behind maid servant then baby mule with indian ever at head close at heel followed mr arkwright so that mother eye might be always on child after husband then guide on foot completed number of traveller in way went on on day after day till reached bank of serapiqui never once varying place in procession a started in morning so went on till noon day rest so again made evening march in journey there be idea of variety searching after pleasure of scenery attempt at conversation with object of interest amusement what word be spoken be simply needful produced by sympathy for suffering so journeyed always in same place with one exception began work with two guide leading before first day be over one of have fallen back to side of mr arkwright for be unable to sit on mule without daily work be divided into two stage so a to give hour for rest in middle of day have be arranged that distance for day must not be longshould be very short a be thought by when talked over at san jos now hour passed in saddle seemed to be endless descent began from ridge of have spoken have sooner turned face down upon mountain slope looking towards atlantic than passage of mud began to there be cessation till found on bank of serapiqui river doubt whether be possible to convey in word adequate idea of labour of riding over path be not that active exertion be necessarythat there be anything requires doing traveller have before simple task of sitting on mule from hour to hour of seeing that knee get jammed against tree at step beast ride have to drag leg out from deep clinging mud body of rider never know one moment of ease why mule die on road can not say live through appear to suffer have own way in everything for exertion on rider part will make walk faster slower than be wont on day on entered forestthat being second of journeymrs arkwright have asked for mercy for permission to escape that second stage on next allowed to be lifted into saddle after mid day rest without word have tried to sleep in vain have sat within little hut looking out upon desolate scene before with baby in lap have one comfort that of traveller baby suffered least have now left high ground heat be becoming great though not a yet intense then indian guide looking out slowly over forest saw that rain be not yet over spoke word two to one of companion in low voice in patois mr arkwright did not understand then going after husband told that heaven be threatening have only two league said arkwright may perhaps hold up will begin in hour said indian two league be four hour to morrow asked arkwright to morrow to morrow to morrow will still rain said guide looking a spoke up over huge primeval forest then have better start at once said arkwright before first falling drop frighten woman so mule be brought out lifted uncomplaining wife on to blanket formed pillion file again formed slowly wound way out from small enclosure by hut be surroundedout from enclosure on to rough scrap of undrained pasture ground from tree have be cleared in few minute be once more struggling through mud name of spot traveller have just left be carablanco there found woman living alone husband be away told at san jos must be back to when dry weather came to look up young cattle be straying in forest what life for woman nevertheless in talking with mr arkwright made complaint of own lot have done what little must to comfort poor lady who be so little able to bear fatigue of journey be road very bad mr arkwright asked in whisper ah yes be bad road when will be at river took four day said woman then will never see mother again a spoke mr arkwright pressed baby to bosom immediately after husband came in started path now led away across slope of mountain seemed to fall from very top of central ridge in unbroken descent down to valley at foot hitherto since have entered forest have have nothing before eye tree bush grew close around now prospect of unrivalled grandeur be opened before if only have be able to enjoy at bottom of valley ran river so great be depth looked like moving silver cord on other side of there arose mountain steep unbroken like be passingunbroken so that eye must stretch from river up to very summit not spot on mountain side on side be left uncovered by thick forest have stood there untouched by man since nature first produced be nothing to traveller be clang of macaw anything roaring of little congo ape nothing be gained by from beautiful scenery be there fear from beast of prey immediate pain of step of journey drove other feeling from thought be bounded by intense desire for evening halt then a guide have prophesied rain began at first came in such small soft drop that be found to be refreshing cloud soon gathered poured forth collected water a though have not rained for month among mountain not that came in big drop with violence wind can give beating hither thither breaking branch from tree rising up again a pattered against ground there be violence in rain fell softly in long continuous noiseless stream sinking into everything that touched converting deep rich earth on side into mud not word be said by of a came on indian covered baby with blanket closer than be covered before guide who walked by mr arkwrights side drew cloak around knee such effort be in vain there be rain will penetrate everything such be rain fell upon now nevertheless a have said hardly word be spoken poor woman finding that heat of cloak increased suffering threw open again fanny said husband have better let protect a well a can answered merely by impatient wave of hand intending to signify that must not speak in matter must have way after husband made further attempt to control must see however ever again must have slipped forward from mule fallen have not man by side steadied with hand at tree protected knee foot though there be hardly room for to move between beast bank against be thrust then at last that day work be also over fanny arkwright slipped from pillion down into husband arm at door of rancho in forest here there lived large family adding from year to year to patch of ground have rescued from wood valiantly doing part in extension of civilisation party be few step from door when left mule mr arkwright did not now a heretofore hasten to receive baby in arm when placed upon ground still leaned against mule husband saw that must carry into hut did then wet mud laden dishevelled a be laid down upon plank be to form bed there stretched out arm for infant on evening undressed tended like child then when be alone with husband repeated to sad foreboding harry said will never see mother again oh yes fanny will see talk over trouble with pleasure be very bad know will live through yet will of course will take baby home to face without darling three more day riding rather two half will bring to river then trouble will be over will be easy after ah harry know do know that be very bad girl must cheer up will be laughing at in month time on following morning allowed to be lifted up speaking word of remonstrance indeed be like child in hand having dropped dignity authority of woman demeanour rained again during whole of day heat be becoming oppressive a hour be descending nearer nearer to sea level during first stage hardly word be spoken by one when be again taken from mule be in tear poor servant girl too be almost prostrate with fatigue absolutely unable to wait upon mistress even to do anything for nevertheless did make second stage seeing that mid day resting place have be under tree of forest have there be hut there must have remained for night on following day rested altogether though place at remained have few attraction be forest hut inhabited by old spanish couple who be by mean willing to give room although paid for accommodation at exorbitant rate be one singularity of place strange out of way like such forest track a that money in small sum be hardly valued dollar there be not appreciated a sixpence be in rich country there stayed for day guide employed in making litter with long pole so that might carry mr arkwright over portion of ground poor fellow when once have thus changed mode of conveyance never again be lifted on to mule there be strong reason against day delay be to go down serapiqui along with post must overtake on bank if post must pas before got there must not wait then must be deprived of best canoe on water then also be possible if encountered further delay that steamer might sail from greytown without month residence at frightful place be thus made necessary day rest apparently did little to relieve mr arkwrights suffering on following day allowed to be put upon mule after first hour beast be stopped be taken off during hour have travelled hardly over league at time so sobbed moaned that arkwright absolutely feared that must perish in forest implored guide to use pole have prepared have declared to over over again that felt sure that must die delirious with weariness suffering have begged to leave at last hut have not yet come to flat ground over litter might be carried with comparative ease nevertheless men yielded be placed in recumbent position upon blanket supported by bough of tree in way went through day with somewhat le of suffering than before without necessity for self exertion have be worse to than suffering there be place between river at one must have said that be impossible that litter must be carried even impossible that mule must walk with load on back still went on men carried burden without complaining not word be said about money extra paynot word at least by when arkwright be profuse in offer leader told that must not have done for money for poor suffering seora must make exertion money must have bought from on next day about noon post did pas consisting of three strong men carrying great weight on back suspended by band from forehead travelled much quicker than friend must reach bank of river that evening in ordinary course must start down river close upon daybreak on following day after consultation with guide agreed to wait till noon poor mr arkwright knew nothing of hour of such arrangement now husband greatly doubted power of catching mail despatch however did not much depend on exertion that afternoon resting place be marked out for must not go beyond unless indeed must make whole journey be impossible towards evening matter seemed to improve with have now got on to ground be more open men who carried litter must walk with greater ease mr arkwright also complained le when reached resting place on night said nothing of wish to be left there to fate be place called padregal cacao plantation have be cleared in forest with much labour there be house here containing three room forty fifty acre round have be stripped of forest tree nevertheless adventure have not be prosperous one for place be at time deserted there be cacao plant there be one to pick cacao there be certain melancholy beauty about place few grand tree have be left standing near house grass around be rich park like be deserted nothing be heard roaring of congo ah indeed be melancholy place a be seen by of party afterwards on following morning be astir very early mr arkwright be so much better that offered to sit again upon mule men however declared that must finish task be placed again upon litter then with slow weary step did make way to river bank be not yet noon when saw mud fort stand there a drew into enclosure round small house stand close by river side saw three postman still busy about package thank god said arkwright thank god indeed said brother will be right with now well fanny said husband a took very gently from litter seated on bench stood outside door be over nowis not answered by shower of tear be tear brought relief be aware of therefore stood by still holding by hand while head rested against side will find motion of boat very gentle said indeed there will be motion baby will sleep way down to greytown did not answer in word looked up into face must see that spirit be recovering there be almost crowd of people collected on spot preparatory to departure of canoe in first place there be commandant of fort to whom small house belonged be looking to passport of friend with due diligence endeavouring to make something of occasion by discovering fatal legal impediment to further prosecution of voyage impediment must disappear on payment of certain dollar then there be dozen costa rican soldier men with coloured cap old musket ready to support dignity authority of commandant there be guide taking payment from abel ring for past work postman preparing boat for further journey then there be certain german there with german servant to whom boat belonged also be very busy preparing for river voyage be not going down with be business to see well started singular looking man be with huge shaggy beard shaggy uncombed hair with bright blue eye gave to face remarkable look of sweetness be uncouth man to eye yet child must have trusted with in forest at place remained two hour coffee be prepared here mr arkwright refreshed child washed arranged clothes when stepped down steep bank clinging to husband arm a made way towards boat smiled upon a looked at be over nowis not girlhe said encouraging oh harry talk about answered shuddering want to say word to to let know that be better be bettermuch better will see mother again will not give baby to to made immediate answer for be on level with river canoe be close at foot then have to bid farewell to brother be now unfortunate one of party for destiny required that must go back to san jos alonego back remain there perhaps ten year longer before might look for happiness of home god bless dearest abel said kissing sobbing a spoke good bye fanny said let forget in england be great comfort to think that worst of trouble be over ohshes right now said arkwright good bye old boyand two brother in law grasped others hand heartily keep up spirit well have home before long oh im right said other from tone of voice be clear that poor ring be despondent at thought of coming solitude that arkwright be already triumphing in emancipation then with much care fanny arkwright be stowed away in boat there be great contest about baby at last be arranged that at rate for first few hour must be placed in boat with servant mother be told that by plan must feel at liberty to sleep during heat of day then might hope to have strength to look to child when must be on shore during night in way therefore prepared to start while abel ring stood on bank looking at with wishful eye in first boat be two indian paddling third man steering with paddle in middle there be much luggage near luggage so a to be under shade be baby soft bed if nothing evil happened to boat child must not be more safe in best cradle be ever rocked with be maid servant stranger who be also going down to greytown in second boat be same number of men to paddle indian guide being one of there be mail placed then there be seat arranged with blanket

do think will see mamma again said wife thats right old girlof course will see now thenwe be ready with little assistance from german on bank first boat be pushed off into stream river in place be rapid because full course of water be somewhat impeded by bank of earth jutting out from opposite side of river into stream be not so rapid a to make recognised danger in embarkation below bank be opposite to spot at boat be entered there be four five broken tree in water of shattered bough of showed above surface be called snag be very dangerous if be met with in course of stream in instance danger be apprehended from a lay considerably to left of passage boat must take first canoe be pushed off by german went rapidly away water be strong with rain be pretty to see with what velocity boat be carried on hundred of yard in advance of other by force of first effort of paddle german however from bank holloaed to first men in spanish bidding relax effort for awhile then said word two of caution to who be now on point of starting boat then be pushed steadily forward man at stern keeping with paddle little farther away from bank at have embarked be close under land that stream ran fastest in obedience to direction given to made course somewhat nearer to sunken tree be one turn of hand gave light boat direction that turn of hand be too strong have anxious master of canoe be thought le anxious might have be well a be prow of boat be caught by slight hidden branch impeded course turned round in rapid river whole length of canoe be thus brought against sunken tree in minute five occupant of boat be struggling in stream abel ring german be standing on bank close to water when happened for moment looked into others face stand where be shouted german so that may assist from shore will go in then throwing from boot coat plunged into river canoe have be swept round so a to be brought by force of water absolutely in among upturned root broken stump of tree impeded river thus when party be upset be at first to be seen scrambling among branch unfortunately there be much more wood below water than above force of stream be so great that who caught hold of timber be not able to support by above surface arkwright be soon to be seen forty yard down having be carried clear of tree here got out of river on farther bank distance to be not above forty yard from nature of ground must not get up towards wife unless must have forced way against stream indian who have have charge of baby rose quickly to surface be carried once round in eddy with head high above water then be seen to throw among broken wood have seen dress of poor woman made effort to save other two men be so caught by fragment of bough that must not extricate so a to make exertion ultimately however also got out on further bank mr arkwright have sunk at once on being precipitated into water buoyancy of clothes have brought for moment again to surface have risen for moment then have again gone down immediately below forked trunk of huge treehad gone down ala ala never to rise again with life within bosom poor indian made two attempt to save then came up incapable of further effort be then that german owner of canoe who have fought way with great effort across violence of water indeed up against stream for few yard made effort to save life of poor frail creature have watched spot at have gone down even while struggling across river have seen how indian have followed have failed be now turn life be in hand be prepared to throw away in attempt having succeeded in placing little above large tree turned face towards bottom of river dived down among branch also after be never again seen with life blood flowing round heart when sun set night two swollen corps be lying in commandant hut abel ring arkwright be sitting beside arkwright have baby sleeping in arm sat there for hoursinto middle of long nightwithout speaking word to one harry said brother at last come away
