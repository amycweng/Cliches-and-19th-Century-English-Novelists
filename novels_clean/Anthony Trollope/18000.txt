old irish peer earl of tulla have be sitting for last twenty year fine high minded representative of thorough going orange protestant feeling of ireland earl of tulla to whom almost loughshane belonged at rate land about loughshane be one of father staunchest friend loughshane be in county galway earl of tulla usually lived at seat in county clare not more than ten mile from killaloe always confided gouty foot weak nerve of old countess stomach of domestic to care of dr finn how be possible that phineas must stand for loughshane from whence be money to come for such contest be beautiful dream grand idea lifting phineas almost off earth by glory when proposition be first made to in smoking room at reform club by friend erle be aware that blushed like girl that be unable at moment to express plainly so great be astonishment so great gratification before ten minute have passed by while barrington erle be still sitting over shoulder on club sofa before blush have altogether vanished have seen improbability of scheme have explained to friend that thing must not be done to increased astonishment friend made nothing of difficulty loughshane according to barrington erle be so small place that expense must be very little there be altogether no more than registered elector inhabitant be so far removed from world be so ignorant of world good thing that knew nothing about bribery hon george morris who have sat for last twenty year be very unpopular have not be near borough since last election have hardly done more than show in parliament have given shilling in town got place under government for single son of loughshane have quarrelled with brother said barrington erle devil have said phineas thought always swore by other be at other swear now said barrington george have asked earl for more money earl have cut up rusty then negotiator went on to explain that expense of election must be defrayed out of certain fund collected for such purpose loughshane have be chosen a cheap place that phineas finn have be chosen a safe promising young man a for qualification if question be raised must be made right irish candidate be wanted roman catholic so much loughshaners must require on own account when instigated to dismiss from service that thorough going protestant hon george morris then party by barrington erle probably meant great man in whose service have become politician required that candidate must be safe man one who must support party not cantankerous red hot semi fenian running about to meeting at rotunda such like with view of own about tenant right irish church have view of own said phineas blushing again of course have dear boy said barrington clapping on back must come to unless have view view ours be same be just lad for galway might have such opening again in life of course will stand for loughshane then conversation be over private secretary went away to arrange other little matter of kind phineas finn be left alone to consider proposition have be made to to become member of british parliament in hot contest at two debating club to have belonged have be ambition have moved for after to what purpose of own have empty debate ever tended three four others who have called liberal have be pitted against four five who have called conservative night after night have discussed ponderous subject without idea that one must ever persuade that talking must ever conduce to action to result of combatant have felt without daring to announce hope on subject among that present arena be only trial ground for possible greater amphitheatre for future debating club in debate must lead to action in eloquence must have power even though persuasion might be out of question phineas certainly have never dared to speak even to of hope labour of bar have to be encountered before dawn of hope must come to have gradually learned to feel that prospect at bar be not a yet very promising a regarded professional work have be idle how then must have hope now thing regarded a being of thing in world most honourable have come to at once be possibly within reach if must believe barrington erle have only to lift up hand might be in parliament within two month who be to be believed on subject if not barrington erle be erle special business man must not have come to on subject have not be in earnest have not believed in success there be opening ready opening to great glory if only might be possible for to fill must father say father must of course oppose plan if opposed father father must of course stop income income a be must be that man must sit in parliament live upon hundred fifty pound year since payment of debt have become again embarrassed to slight amount owed tailor trifle bootmaker trifle something to man who sold glove shirt yet have done best to keep out of debt with more than irish pertinacity living very closely breakfasting upon tea roll dining frequently for shilling at luncheon house up court near lincoln inn where must dine if loughshaners elected to parliament then painted to not untrue picture of probable misery of man who begin life too high up on ladder who succeeds in mounting before have learned how to hold on when be aloft for phineas finn be young man not without sense not entirely windbag if did thing probability be that might become utterly castaway go entirely to dog before be thirty have heard of penniless men who have got into parliament to whom have come fate be able to name to man two whose bark carrying more sail than must bear have gone to piece among early breaker in way then must not be better to go to piece early than never to carry sail at there be at rate chance of success be already barrister there be so many thing open to barrister with seat in parliament a knew of men who have be utterly ruined by such early mounting so also did know of others whose fortune have be made by happy audacity when be young almost thought that must die happy if have once taken seat in parliament if have received one letter with grand initial written after name on address young men in battle be called upon to lead forlorn hope three fall perhaps to one who get through one who get through will have victoria cross to carry for rest of life be forlorn hope a have be invited to undertake work must not turn from danger on following morning again saw barrington erle by appointment then wrote following letter to father reform club feb dear father be afraid that purport of letter will startle hope that when have finished will think that be right in decision a to what be going to do be doubt aware that dissolution of parliament will take place at once that will be in turmoil of general election by middle of march have be invited to stand for loughshane have consented proposition have be made to by friend barrington erle mr mildmay private secretary have be made on behalf of political committee of reform club need hardly say must not have thought of such thing with le thorough promise of support than give must think of now have not be assured that none of expense of election must fall upon of course must not have asked to pay for to proposition so made have felt that must be cowardly to give refusal can not regard such selection a great honour own be fond of politics have taken great delight in study stupid young fool father said to a read have be dream for year past to have seat in parliament at future time dream yes wonder whether have ever dreamed what be to live upon chance have now come to much earlier than have looked for think that must on account be thrown away looking to profession find that many thing be open to barrister with seat in parliament that house need not interfere much with man practice not if have got to top of tree said doctor chief doubt arose from fact of old friendship with lord tulla whose brother have filled seat for know how many year seems that george morris must go at least that must be opposed by liberal candidate if stand one else will must think that lord tulla will be too much of man to make personal quarrel on subject if be to lose borough why must not have a well a can fancy dear father that will say a to imprudence quite confess have not word to answer have told more than once since last night that will probably ruin wonder whether have ever told that will probably ruin also said doctor be prepared to ruin in cause have one dependent on a long a hing to disgrace name may dispose of a please if decide on stopping allowance will have feeling of anger against how very considerate said doctor in case will endeavour to support by pen have already done little for magazine give best love to mother sister if will receive during time of election will see soon perhaps will be best for to say have positively decided on making attempt be to say if club committee be a good a promise have weighed matter round regard prize a being so great that be prepared to run risk to obtain indeed to with view about politics running of risk be more than duty can not keep hand from work now that work have come in way of hand will be most anxious to get line from in answer to most affectionate son phineas finn question whether dr finn when read letter did not feel more of pride than of anger whether be not rather gratified than displeased in spite of that common sense told on subject wife daughter when heard news be clearly on side of young man mr finn immediately expressed opinion parliament must be making of son that everybody must be sure to employ so distinguished barrister girl declared that phineas ought at rate to have chance almost asserted that must be brutal in father to stand in brother way be in vain that doctor tried to explain that going into parliament must not help young barrister might do for one thoroughly established in profession that phineas if successful at loughshane must at once abandon idea of earning income that proposition coming from so poor man be monstrosity that opposition to morris family coming from son of must be gross ingratitude to lord tulla mr finn girl talked down doctor be almost carried away by something like vanity in regard to son future position nevertheless wrote letter strongly advising phineas to abandon project be aware that letter wrote be not one from success must be expected advised son did not command made threat a to stopping income did not tell phineas in so many word that be proposing to make as of argued very prudently against plan phineas when received father letter of course felt that be tantamount to paternal permission to proceed with matter on next day got letter from mother full of affection full of pride not exactly telling to stand for loughshane by mean for mr finn be not woman to run openly counter to husband in advice given by to son giving encouragement motherly affection motherly pride must bestow of course will come to said if do make up mind to be member for loughshane will of be so delighted to have phineas who have fallen into sea of doubt after writing to father who have demanded week from barrington erle to consider matter be elated to positive certainty by joint effect of two letter from home understood mother sister be altogether in favour of audacity even father be not disposed to quarrel with on subject will take at word said to barrington erle at club that evening what word said erle who have too many iron in fire to be thinking always of loughshane phineas finn who at rate did not choose to let anxiety on subject be seen about loughshane all right old fellow will be sure to carry through irish writ will be out on third of march sooner be there better chapter ii phineas finn be elected for loughshane one great difficulty about borough vanished in very wonderful way at first touch dr finn who be man stout at heart by mean afraid of great friend drove over to castlemorris to tell news to earl a soon a got second letter from son declaring intention of proceeding with business let result be what might lord tulla be passionate old man doctor expected that there must be quarrel be prepared to face that be under special debt of gratitude to lord having given a much a have taken in long intercourse have existed between agreed with son in thinking that if there be to be liberal candidate at loughshane consideration of old pill box gallipots must deter son phineas from standing other consideration might very probably deter not that earl probably must be of different opinion doctor felt to be incumbent on to break news to lord tulla devil be said earl when doctor have told story then will tell what finn will support support lord tulla yes why must support suppose be not so bad with in country support will rob of chance will tell one thing for certain wo support george morris lord well go on have never taken much part in politics a know boy phineas be on other side care for side what have party done for look at cousin dick morris there be not clergyman in ireland stauncher to than have be now have given deanery of kilfenora to man never have father though condescended to ask for for cousin let wait till ask for anything again dr finn who knew about dick morris debt who have heard of mode of preaching be not surprised at decision of conservative bestower of irish church patronage on subject said nothing a for george continued earl will never lift hand again for standing for loughshane must be quite out of question own tenant must vote for if be to ask peter blake mr peter blake be lord agent told only week ago that must be useless whole thing be gone for part wish 'd disenfranchise borough wish 'd disenfranchise whole country send military governor what be use of such member a send there be one gentleman among ten of son be welcome for what support can give will have be much suppose have better come see doctor promised that son must ride over to castlemorris then took leave not specially flattered a felt that be son to be returned earl must not regard a one gentleman among ten whom county might send to leaven remainder of member aware that greatest impediment in son way be already removed certainly have not gone to castlemorris with idea of canvassing for son yet have canvassed for most satisfactorily when got home did not know how to speak of matter otherwise than triumphantly to wife daughter though desired to curse mouth must speak blessing before evening be over prospect of phineas at loughshane be spoken of with open enthusiasm before doctor by next day post letter be written to by matilda informing that earl be prepared to receive with open arm papa have be over there managed said matilda be told george morris be going to stand said barrington erle to phineas night before departure brother wo support brother mean to support said phineas can hardly be so tell be father have known earl twenty year have managed say finn be not going to play trick be said mr erle with something like dismay in voice what sort of trick be not coming out on other side not if know said phineas proudly let assure must change view in politics for for earl though of carried seat in breech pocket if go into parliament will go there a sound liberal not to support party to do best can for country tell so will tell earl same barrington erle turned away in disgust such language be to simply disgusting fell upon ear a false maudlin sentiment fall on ear of ordinary honest man of world barrington erle be man ordinarily honest must not have be untrue to mother brother william mildmay great whig minister of day for earthly consideration be ready to work with wage without wage be really zealous in cause not asking very much for have undefined belief that be much better for country mr mildmay must be in power than lord de terrier must be there be convinced that liberal politics be good for englishman liberal politics mildmay party be one same thing must be unfair to barrington erle to deny to praise for patriotism hated very name of independence in parliament when be told of man that man intended to look to measure not to men regarded that man a being unstable a water dishonest a wind good must possibly come from such one much evil might probably must come such politician be greek to barrington erle from whose hand feared to accept even gift of vote parliamentary hermit be distasteful to dweller in political cave be regarded by with aversion a being knavish impractical with good conservative opponent must shake hand almost a readily a with good whig ally man who be flesh fowl be odious to according to theory of parliamentary government house of common must be divided by marked line member must be required to stand on one side of on other if not with at rate be against must have said to representative of people in name of great leader whom followed thought that debate be good because of people outside because served to create that public opinion be hereafter to be used in creating future house of common did not think possible that vote must be given on great question way that a result of debate be certainly assured in own opinion that such changing of vote must be dangerous revolutionary almost unparliamentary member vote except on small crotchety open question thrown out for amusement of crotchety member be due to leader of member party such be mr erle idea of english system of parliament lending semi official assistance a did frequently to introduction of candidate into house be naturally anxious that candidate must be candidate after own heart when therefore phineas finn talked of measure not men barrington erle turned away in open disgust remembered youth extreme rawness of lad remembered also career of other men barrington erle be forty experience have taught something after few second brought to think mildly of young man vanity a of vanity of plunging colt who resents liberty even of touch by end of first session thong will be cracked over head a patiently assist in pulling coach up hill without producing from even flick of tail said barrington erle to old parliamentary friend if be to come out after on wrong side said parliamentary friend erle admitted that trick a must be unpleasant thought that old lord tulla be hardly equal to so clever stratagem phineas went to ireland walked over course at loughshane called upon lord tulla heard that venerable nobleman talk great deal of nonsense to tell truth of phineas must confess that wished to talk nonsense earl must not hear put down very quickly wo discus politics if please mr finn because a have already said be throwing aside political consideration phineas therefore be not allowed to express view on government of country in earl sitting room at castlemorris there be however good time coming so for present allowed earl to ramble on about sin of brother george want of proper pedigree on part of new dean of kilfenora conference ended with assurance on part of lord tulla that if loughshaners chose to elect mr phineas finn must not be in least offended elector did elect mr phineas finn perhaps for reason given by one of dublin conservative paper declared that be fault of carlton club in not sending proper candidate there be great deal said about matter in london dublin blame be supposed to fall on

serious almost solemn thought on journey towards london be sorry must assure female reader very few of have reference to mary flood jones have however very carefully packed up tress must bring out for proper act of erotic worship at season in mind might be le engaged with affair of state than be at present must make failure of great matter have taken in hand must not tell that chance be twenty to one against now that looked nearer at difficulty loomed larger than ever reward seemed to be le more difficult of approach more evanescent how many member be there who must never get hearing how many who only spoke to fail how many who spoke well who must speak to effect a far a own worldly prospect be concerned have already known many member of parliament to whom outward respect sign of honour be ever given by one seemed to a thought over that irish member of parliament be generally treated with more indifference than others there be o b o ' c o 'd for whom one cared straw who must hardly get men to dine with at club yet be genuine member of parliament why must ever be better than o ' b o ' c o 'd in what way must begin to be better have idea of fashion after must be duty to strive that might excel gentleman did not give of credit for much earnestness in country behalf be minded to be very earnest must go to work honestly conscientiously determined to do duty a best might let result to be what must be noble resolution might have be pleasant to have not remembered that smile of derision have come over friend erle face when declared intention of doing duty to country a liberal not of supporting party o b o ' c o 'd be keen enough to support party only be sometimes little astray at knowing be party for nonce knew that erle such men must despise if did not fall into regular groove if barrington erles despised what must then be left for moody thought be somewhat dissipated when found one laurence fitzgibbon honourable laurence fitzgibbon special friend of own very clever fellow on board boat a steamed out of kingston harbour laurence fitzgibbon have also just be over about election have be returned a matter of course for father county laurence fitzgibbon have sat in house for last fifteen year be yet well nigh a young man a in be man altogether different from o b s o ' c s o 'd s laurence fitzgibbon must always get ear of house if chose to speak friend declared that might have be high up in office long since if must have taken trouble to work be welcome guest at house of very best people be friend of whom one might be proud have for two year be feather in cap of phineas that knew laurence fitzgibbon yet people said that laurence fitzgibbon have nothing of own men wondered how lived be youngest son of lord claddagh irish peer with large family who must hing for laurence favourite child beyond finding seat in parliament well finn boy said laurence shaking hand with young member on board steamer so have made right at loughshane then phineas be beginning to tell story wonderful story of george morris earl of tulla how men of loughshane have elected without opposition how have be supported by conservative a well a liberal how unanimous loughshane have be in electing phineas finn a representative mr fitzgibbon seemed to care very little about went so far a to declare that thing be accident fell out sometimes one way sometimes be altogether independent of merit demerit on part of candidate be marvellous almost painful to phineas that friend fitzgibbon must accept fact of membership with so little of congratulation with absolutely blowing of trumpet have be elected member of municipal corporation of loughshane instead of representative in british parliament laurence fitzgibbon must not have made le fuss about phineas be disappointed took cue from friend too quickly to show disappointment when hour after meeting fitzgibbon have to be reminded that companion be not in house during last session phineas be able to

taken to mean assent to proposition a to wednesday dinner then stood perfectly still with two hand fixed on top of umbrella gazed at great monkey cage be clear that be not looking at special monkey for eye never wandered did ever see such contrast in life said miss fitzgibbon to phineas hardly in whisper between what said phineas between mr kennedy monkey monkey have so much to say for be so delightfully wicked suppose mr kennedy ever did anything wrong in life mr kennedy be man who have very little temptation to do anything wrong be possessed of over million half of money be mistaken enough to suppose have made whereas may be doubted whether have ever earned penny father uncle have created business in glasgow that business now belonged to father uncle who have toiled through long

be ambitious man looking forward to entering parliament at future time when exigency of life of labour might enable to do so be prudent given to close calculation resolved to make ground sure beneath foot in step that took forward when first heard that finn intended to stand for loughshane be stricken with dismay strongly dissuaded elector may probably reject be only chance now mr low have said to wife when found that phineas be a thought foolhardy elector of loughshane have not rejected mr low pupil mr low be now called upon to advise what phineas must do in present circumstance there be nothing to prevent work of chancery barrister being done by member of parliament indeed most successful barrister be member of parliament phineas finn be beginning at wrong end mr low knew that good must come of only think of being in parliament mr finn said mr low be wonderful be said phineas took so much by surprise said mr low a rule one never hears of barrister going into parliament till after be forty be only twenty five do feel that have disgraced do indeed mr low have not disgraced mr finn only question be whether be prudent hope will all turn out for best most heartily mr low be very matter of fact lady four five year older than husband who have have little money of own be possessed of virtue under sun nevertheless did not quite like idea of husband pupil having got into parliament if husband phineas finn be dining anywhere together phineas who have come to quite boy must walk out of room before husband must hardly be right nevertheless helped phineas to nicest bit of fish must find have be ill must have nursed with greatest care after dinner when mr low have gone up stair there came great discussion between tutor pupil for sake of little dinner have be given when phineas have last be with mr low on occasion of showing at tutor chamber after return from ireland have not made up mind so thoroughly on certain point a have done since have seen lady laura discussion must hardly be of avail now must not be avoided well phineas what do mean to do said mr low everybody who knew hero nearly everybody called by christian name there be men who seem to be so treated by general consent in society even mr low who be very prosaic unlikely to be familiar in mode of address have fallen into way of doing before election have dropped when phineas whom used to know became member of parliament be question be said phineas of course will stick to work what to bar yes to bar be not thinking of giving up permanently giving up said mr low raising hand in surprise if give up how do intend to live men be not paid for being member of parliament not exactly a said before be not thinking of giving up permanently must give up at not for day be if ever mean to do good there think that perhaps may be wrong low how can be wrong did period of idleness ever help man in profession be not acknowledged by who know anything about continuous labour be more necessary in profession than in other mean to be idle what be do mean phineas why simply here be in parliament must take that a fact doubt fact if be misfortune must make best of even must advise to apply for chiltern hundred at once must to morrow dear fellow though like to give pain if come to can only tell what think advice to be to give up to morrow men must laugh at for few week be better than being ruined for life ca do said phineas sadly very well then let go on said mr low if wo give up seat next best thing will be to take care that will interfere a little a possible with work suppose must sit upon committee idea be will give up one year to learning practice of house hing nothing why thing be study in a for learning in year be out of question be convinced that if man intends to be useful member of parliament must make study of how do mean to live in meantime mr low who be energetic man have assumed almost angry tone of voice phineas for awhile sat silent not that felt to be without word for reply that be thinking in what fewest word might best convey idea have very modest allowance from father on have never be able to keep free from debt continued mr low have increased will satisfy to live here in what will turn out to be parliamentary club idleness on saving of industrious life think will find unhappy if do that phineas dear fellow a far a have a yet be able to see world men begin very good very bad have generally good aspiration with infirm purpose a may say strong body with weak leg to carry then because leg be weak drift into idleness ruin during drifting be wretched when have thoroughly drifted be still wretched agony of old disappointment still cling to in nine case out of ten be one small unfortunate event put man astray at first see woman loses with be taken to racecourse unluckily win money devil in shape of friend lure to tobacco brandy temptation have come in shape of accursed seat in parliament mr low have never said soft word in life to woman wife of bosom have never seen racehorse always confined to two glass of port after dinner looked upon smoking a darkest of vice have made up mind then that mean to be idle have made up mind that time will be wholly unprofitable if do a say intend to do know plan just listen to then mr low did listen phineas explained plan saying of course nothing of love for lady laura giving mr low to understand that intended to assist in turning out existing government to mount up to seat humble seat at first on treasury bench by help of exalted friend by use of own gift of eloquence mr low heard without word of course said phineas after first year time will not be fully employed unless succeed if fail totally for of course may fail altogether be possible said mr low if be resolved to turn against must not say word said phineas with anger turn against must turn way so might save from sort of life be preparing for see nothing in can satisfy manly heart even if be successful what be to become will be creature of minister not colleague be to make way up ladder by pretending to agree whenever agreement be demanded from by voting whether agree what be to be reward few precarious hundred year lasting just so long a party may remain in power can retain seat in parliament be at best slavery degradation even if be lucky enough to achieve slavery hope to go into parliament join ministry day said phineas mr low be not quick to answer did answer at last be true though have never told so indeed be hardly true to say that hope have dream sometimes dare to tell that may possibly become waking fact if ever sit on treasury bench will sit there by special invitation having be summoned to take high place because of professional success be dream after must not have repeat what have said to one have intention to talk about be sure that will succeed said phineas yes will succeed be succeeding live upon what earn like gentleman can already afford to be indifferent to work dislike after other part of that of dream be unnecessary adjunct gilding on gingerbread be inclined to think that cake be more wholesome without phineas did not go up stair into mr low drawing room on evening did stay very late with mr low have heard enough of counsel to make very unhappy to shake from much of audacity have acquired for during morning walk to make almost doubt whether after chiltern hundred must not be for safest escape from difficulty in case must never venture to see lady laura standish again chapter vi lord brentford dinner no in such case a must resolve upon taking advice of old friend mr low phineas finn must make up mind never to see lady laura standish again be in love with lady laura standish for aught knew lady laura standish might be in love with a walked home from mr low house in bedford square be by mean triumphant man there have be much more said between mr low than must be laid before reader in last chapter mr low have urged again again have prevailed so far that phineas before left house have promised to consider suicidal expedient of chiltern hundred what by word must become if be to give up parliament having sat there for about week such immediate giving up be one of necessity of mr low programme according to mr low teaching single year passed amidst miasma of house of common must be altogether fatal to chance of professional success mr low have at rate succeeded in making phineas believe that be right in lesson there be profession a to mr low assured that success be within reach there be parliament on other side a to knew that chance be against in spite of advantage of seat that must not combine two beginning with parliament did believe must be be question tried to decide a walked home from bedford square to great marlborough street must not answer question satisfactorily went to bed unhappy man must at rate go to lord brentford dinner on wednesday to enable to join in conversation there must attend debate on monday tuesday reader may perhaps be best made to understand how terrible be hero state of doubt by being told that for awhile thought of absenting from debate a being likely to weaken purpose of withdrawing altogether from house be not very often that so strong fury rage between party party at commencement of session that division be taken upon address be customary for leader of opposition on such occasion to express opinion in most courteous language that right honourable friend sitting opposite to on treasury bench have be be will be wrong in everything that think say doe in public life that a anything like factious opposition be never adopted on side of house address to queen in answer to most fatuous speech have be put into majesty gracious mouth will be allowed to pas unquestioned then leader of house thanks adversary for consideration explains to men how happy country ought to be that government have not fallen into disgracefully incapable hand of right honourable friend opposite after that address be carried amidst universal serenity such be not order of day on present occasion mr mildmay veteran leader of liberal side of house have moved amendment to address have urged upon house in very strong language expediency of showing at very commencement of session that country have returned to parliament strong majority determined not to put up with conservative inactivity conceive to be duty mr mildmay have said at once to assume that country be unwilling that right honourable gentleman opposite must keep seat on bench upon sit in performance of duty be called upon to divide house upon address to majesty if mr mildmay used strong language reader may be sure that mr mildmay follower used language much stronger mr daubeny who be present leader of house representative there of ministry lord de terrier premier sitting in house of lord be not man to allow amenity to pas by without adequate reply friend be very strong in sarcasm if failed in argument lacked nothing for word though might perhaps be proved that be short in number be considered that speech in mr daubeny reviewed long political life of mr mildmay showed that mr mildmay have be at one time bugbear then nightmare latterly simply fungus be one of severest attack if not most severe have be heard in house since reform bill mr mildmay while be sitting with hat low down over eye many men said that did not like speech be not made till after dinner at lord brentford of short account must be given have not be for overwhelming interest of doings in parliament at commencement of session phineas might have perhaps abstained from attending in spite of charm of novelty for in truth mr low word have moved much if be to be fate to be member of parliament only for ten day surely must be well that must take advantage of time to hear such debate a must be thing to talk of to child in twenty year time to grandchild in fifty must be essentially necessary that must be able to talk of to lady laura standish did therefore sit in house till one on monday night till two on tuesday night heard debate adjourned till thursday on thursday mr daubeny be to make great speech then division must come when phineas entered lady laura drawing room on wednesday before dinner found other guest assembled why men must have be earlier in keeping dinner engagement on day than on other did not

of filling perhaps higher office in government a hoped be soon to be called into existence there be five gentleman besides phineas finn mr bonteen mr kennedy mr fitzgibbon barrington erle who have be caught in spite of lady laura have said a to difficulty of such operation lord brentford phineas be quick to observe male guest be in parliament to tell that must not have be there unless also have have seat be here now said earl ringing bell hope have not kept waiting said phineas not at said lady laura know why be in such hurry how many do say will be mr finn seventeen suppose said phineas more likely twenty two said mr bonteen there be colcleugh so ill ca possibly bring up young rochester be at vienna gunning be sulking about something moody have lost eldest son by george pressed to

near to lady laura in drawing room that lady laura have said few word to be more determined than ever that must hate mr kennedy must probably have be moody unhappy throughout whole dinner have not lady laura called to chair at left hand be very generous of more so a mr kennedy have in half hesitating manner prepared to seat in very place a be phineas mr kennedy be neighbour phineas have place of honour suppose will not speak during debate said lady laura who certainly not in first place must not get hearing in next place must not think of commencing on occasion know that will ever speak at indeed will be just sort of man who will succeed with house what doubt be whether will do a well in office wish might have chance of course can have chance if try for beginning so early being on right side if will allow to say so among right set there can be doubt that may take office if will be not sure that will be tractable can not begin know by being prime minister have seen enough to realise already said phineas if will only keep little fact steadily before eye there be nothing may not reach in official life pitt be prime minister at four twenty precedent have ruined young politician have not affected lady laura a far a can see there be great difficulty in government man must learn to have word at command when be on leg in house of common in same way a must if be talking to own servant must keep temper must be very patient a far a have seen cabinet minister be not more clever than other people think there be generally one two men of ability in cabinet yes of fair ability mr mildmay be good specimen there be not never be anything brilliant in be not eloquent a far a be aware did ever create anything have always be steady honest persevering man circumstance have made politics come easy to think of momentous question have be called upon to decide said phineas question so handled by have be decided rightly according to own party wrongly according to party opposite political leader be so sure of support so sure of attack that be hardly necessary for to be even anxious to be right for country sake must have official under who know routine of business think very badly then of politics a profession think of very highly must be better to deal with repeal of law than defending of criminal be papa wisdom not mine papa have never be in cabinet yet therefore of course be little caustic think be quite right said barrington erle stoutly spoke so stoutly that everybody at table listened to exactly see necessity for such internecine war just at present said lord brentford must say do said other lord de terrier took office knowing that be in minority have fair majority of nearly thirty when came in then how very soft must have be to go out said miss fitzgibbon not in least soft continued barrington erle must not command men be bound to go out for aught knew score of might have chosen to support lord de terrier then must have owned ourselves beaten for time be beaten hollow said miss fitzgibbon then why did lord de terrier dissolve prime minister be quite right to dissolve in position said lord brentford must do so for queen sake be only chance just so be a say only chance be right very possession of power will give near score of vote if think that have chance let try maintain that have chance that must have known that have none that if must not get on with late house certainly must not get on with new house let have own way a far a must in february have failed last summer if must get along be welcome must not get along must say think be right to dissolve said lady laura be right to force consequence upon a quickly a can practically lost nine seat by dissolution look at loughshane yes look at loughshane said miss fitzgibbon country at rate have gained something there be ill wind blow nobody good mr finn said earl what on earth be to become of poor george said mr fitzgibbon wonder whether one know where be george be bad sort of fellow roby used to think that be very bad fellow said mr bonteen roby used to swear that be hopeless trying to catch may be a well to explain that mr roby be conservative gentleman of great fame who have for year acted a whip under mr daubeny who now filled high office of patronage secretary to treasury believe in heart continued mr bonteen that roby be rejoiced that poor george morris must be out in cold if seat be halveable must share mine for sake of auld lang syne said laurence fitzgibbon not to morrow night said barrington erle division to morrow will be thing not to be joked with upon word think be right about old moody private consideration must give way a for gunning 'd have up 'd know reason why will have defaulter barrington asked lady laura be not going to boast know of one for whom need blush sir everard powell be so bad with gout that ca even bear one to look at ratler say that will bring up mr ratler be in day whip on liberal side of house unfortunate wretch said miss fitzgibbon worst of be that scream in paroxysm said mr bonteen mean to say that will take into lobby said lady laura undoubtedly said barrington erle why not have business with seat if ca vote sir everard be good man will be there if laudanum bath chair make possible same kind of conversation went on during whole of dinner became if anything more animated when three lady have left room mr kennedy made one remark then observed that a far a must see majority of nineteen must be a serviceable a majority of twenty said in very mild voice in tone be intended to be expressive of doubt in spite of humility barrington erle flew at almost savagely a though liberal member of house of common be disgraced by so mean spirit phineas found despising man for want of zeal if be to beat let beat well said phineas let there be doubt about said barrington erle must like to see man with seat polled said bonteen poor sir everard said lord brentford will kill doubt suppose seat be safe oh yes llanwrwsth be quite safe said barrington in eagerness omitting to catch lord brentford grim joke phineas went up into drawing room for few minute after dinner be eagerly desirous of saying few more word knew not what word to lady laura mr kennedy mr bonteen have left dining room first phineas again found mr kennedy standing close to lady laura shoulder must be possible that there be anything in mr kennedy be unmarried man with immense fortune magnificent place seat in parliament be not perhaps above forty year of age there must be reason why must not ask lady laura to be wife except indeed that did not seem to have sufficient word at command to ask anybody for anything must be that woman a lady laura must accept man a mr kennedy because of wealth because of fine place man who have not word to throw to dog who did not seem to be possessed of idea who hardly looked like gentleman so phineas told in truth mr kennedy though be plain unattractive man with nothing in personal appearance to call for remark be not unlike gentleman in usual demeanour phineas may be here said be six foot high very handsome with bright blue eye brown wavy hair light silken beard mr low have told husband more than once that be much too handsome to do good mr low however have replied that young finn have never shown to be conscious of own personal advantage will learn soon enough said mr low woman will tell then will be spoilt think that phineas depended much a yet on own good look felt that mr kennedy ought to be despised by one a lady laura standish because look be not good must despise must not be that woman so full of life must be willing to put up with man who absolutely seemed to have life within yet why be there why be allowed to hang about just over shoulder phineas finn began to feel to be injured man lady laura have power of dispelling instantly sense of injury have done effectually in dining room by calling to seat by side to express exclusion of millionaire did again now by walking away from mr kennedy to spot on phineas have placed somewhat sulkily of course will be at club on friday morning after division said doubt when leave come tell be impression what think of mr daubeny speech there will be nothing done in house before four will be able to run up to certainly will have asked mr kennedy to come mr fitzgibbon be so anxious about want to hear what different people say know perhaps that papa be to be in cabinet if there be change be indeed oh yes will come up of course will do expect to hear much of opinion from mr kennedy yes do quite know mr kennedy yet must remember that will say more to than will to be not quick know a be have enthusiasm on subject have opinion sound opinion too phineas felt that lady laura be in slight degree scolding for disrespectful manner in have spoken of mr kennedy felt also that have committed that have shown to be sore that have seen understood soreness truth be know said trying to correct blunder no not a yet hope that may day a be one of men who be useful estimable know can use said phineas if wish will endeavour to esteem wish to do will come in due time think probable that in early autumn there will be great gathering of real whig liberal at loughlinter of mean who have heart in be at same time gentleman if be so must be sorry that must not be there need not mention mr kennedy have just said word about to papa word from always mean so much well good night mind come up on friday be going to club now of course envy men club more than do house though feel that woman life be only life a can not have seat in parliament then phineas went away walked down to pall mall with laurence fitzgibbon must have preferred to take walk alone must not get rid of affectionate countryman wanted to think over what have taken place during evening indeed did so in spite of friend conversation lady laura when first saw after return to london have told how anxious father be to congratulate on seat earl have not spoken word to on subject earl have be courteous a host customarily be have be in way specially kind to then mr kennedy a to going to loughlinter must not do thing not though success of liberal party be to depend on declared to that there be thing man must not do although be not altogether satisfied with what have occurred in portman square felt a walked down arm in arm with fitzgibbon mr low mr low counsel must be scattered to wind have thrown die in consenting to stand for loughshane must stand hazard of cast bedad phin boy think be listening to at said laurence fitzgibbon be listening to word say said phineas if have to go down to ould country again session will go with if can will that boy be that hope will have chance what be good of turning fellow out if one be to get something for one trouble chapter vii mr mr bunce be three o'clock on thursday night before mr daubeny speech be finished think that there be truth in allegation made at time that continued on leg hour longer than necessity of speech required in order five six very ancient whig might be wearied out shrink to bed let whig have be ever so ancient ever so weary must not have be allowed to depart from westminster hall night sir everard powell be there in bath chair at twelve with doctor on one side of friend on other in purlieu of house did duty like fine old briton a be that speech of mr daubeny will never be forgotten by one who heard studied bitterness have perhaps never be equalled yet not word be uttered for saying of must be accused of going beyond limit of parliamentary antagonism be true that personality must not have be closer that accusation of political dishonesty of almost worse than political cowardice falsehood must not have be clearer that word in language must have attributed meaner motif more unscrupulous conduct nevertheless mr daubeny in that said be parliamentary showed to be gladiator thoroughly well trained for arena in have descended to combat arrow be poisoned lance be barbed shot be heated red because such thing be allowed did not poison enemy well use greek fire because thing be not allowed knew exactly rule of combat mr mildmay sat heard without once raising hat from brow speaking word to neighbour men on side of house said that mr mildmay suffered terribly a mr mildmay uttered word of complaint to one be quite ready to take mr daubeny by hand next time met in company know that one be able to form true idea of mr mildmay feeling mr mildmay be impassive man who rarely spoke of own feeling doubt sat with hat low down over eye in order that man might judge of on occasion by impression on feature if must have left off hour earlier must have be perfect a attack said barrington erle in criticising mr daubeny speech allowed to sink into comparative weakness glory of be over before end then came division liberal have vote to for conservative therefore counted majority of be said that so large number of member have never before voted at division own be disappointed said barrington erle to mr ratler thought there must be twenty said mr ratler never went beyond knew must have old moody up thought gunning must have be too hard for say have promised peerage yes if remain in know be going out must go with majority against said barrington erle of course must said mr ratler lord de terrier want nothing better be rather hard upon poor daubeny never saw such unfortunate old tantalus get good drop of real water now again pity in least be clever of course have made own way have always feeling that have business where be suppose will know about at brook by one o'clock to morrow phineas though have be past five before went to bed for there have be much triumphant talking to be done among liberal member after division be up at breakfast at mr bunce lodging by nine there be matter be called upon to settle immediately in mr bunce be much interested respecting have promised to give answer on very morning set of very dingy chamber up two pair of stair at old square lincoln inn to mr low have recommended to transfer belonging be waiting occupation must resolve upon occupying if intended to commence operation a barrister must be necessary that must have chamber clerk before have left mr low house on sunday evening have almost given that gentleman authority to secure for room at whether remain in parliament must make beginning mr low have said how be even to pretend to begin if have chamber mr low hoped that might be able to wean phineas away from parliament bauble that might induce young barrister to give up madness if not session next at rate before third year have commenced mr low be persistent man liking very much when did like loving very strongly when did love must have many tug for phineas finn before must allow false westminster satan to carry off prey a altogether own if must only get phineas into dingy chamber might do much phineas have now become so imbued with atmosphere of politics have be so breathed upon by lady laura barrington erle that must no longer endure thought of other life than of life spent among lobby desire to help to beat conservative have fastened on very soul almost made mr low odious in eye be afraid of mr low for nonce must not go to more must see porter at lincoln inn must write line to mr low must tell mr bunce that for present must still keep on room letter to mr low be a follows great marlborough street may dear low have made up mind against taking chamber be now off to inn to say that will not want of course know what will think of be very grievous to to have to bear hard judgment of man whose opinion value so highly in teeth of terribly strong argument think that there be something to be said on side of question seat in parliament have come in way by chance think must be pusillanimous in to reject feeling a do that seat in parliament confers very great honour be too very fond of politics regard legislation a finest profession going have one dependent on probably might not be justified in following bent of inclination be alone in world therefore have right to make attempt if after trial of one two session must fail in be attempting will not even then be too late to go back to better way can assure that at rate be not intention to be idle know very well how will fret fume over what say how utterly will fail in bringing round to way of thinking a must write to tell of decision can not refrain from defending to best of ability yours always faithfully phineas finn mr low received letter at chamber when have read simply pressed lip closely together placed sheet of paper back in envelope put into drawer at left hand having done went on with what work have before a though friend decision be matter of consequence to a far a be concerned thing be done there must be end of so told nevertheless mind be full of day though wrote not word of answer to phineas made reply within own mind to one of argument used in letter great honour how can there be honour in what come a say by chance have sense enough to understand that honour come from mode of winning from mode of wearing that very fact of being member for loughshane at instant simply prof that loughshane must have have privilege to return member one dependent on be not father mother sister dependent on a long a must eat bread till can earn bread of own will never earn bread of own will always be eating bread others have earned in way before day be over mr low became very angry swore to that must have nothing more to say to phineas finn yet found creating plan for encountering conquering parliamentary fiend who be at present so cruelly potent with pupil be not till third evening that told wife that finn have made up mind not to take chamber then must have nothing more to say to said mr low savagely for present can have nothing more to say to neither now ever said mr low with great emphasis have be false to said mr low who be man thoroughly thoughtfully just at point have not be false to have always meant what have said when be saying be weak blind fly like moth to candle one pity poor moth must save stump of wing if be possible phineas when have written letter to mr low started off for lincoln inn making way through well known dreary street of soho through st giles to long acre knew corner well for have walked same road almost daily for last three year have conceived liking for route might easily have changed without much addition to distance by passing through oxford street holborn there be air of business on prided in going by most direct passage declared to very often that thing dreary dingy to eye might be good in lincoln inn be dingy law court therein be perhaps meanest in equity ever disclosed mr low three room in old square of brown with binding of law book with dust collected on law paper with furniture have be brown always have become browner with year be perhaps a unattractive to eye of young pupil a room be ever entered study of chancery law be not alluring pursuit till mind have come to have insight into beauty of ultimate object phineas during three year course of reasoning on thing have taught to believe that thing ugly on outside might be very beautiful within have therefore come to prefer crossing poland street soho square so continuing travel by seven dial long acre morning walk be of piece with morning study took pleasure in gloom of now taste of palate have be already changed by glare of lamp in about palatial westminster found that st giles be disagreeable way about pall mall across park to parliament street to treasury be much pleasanter new office in downing street already half built absorbed interest have hitherto be able to take in suggested uncommenced erection of new law court in neighbourhood of lincoln inn a made way to porter lodge under great gateway of lincoln inn told that be glad that have escaped at rate for while from life so dull dreary if must only sit in chamber at treasury instead of chamber in old court how much pleasanter must be after a regarded that question of income might well be that treasury chamber must be more remunerative more quickly remunerative of two a thought lady laura might be compatible with treasury chamber parliament must not possibly be made compatible with old square lincoln inn nevertheless there came upon feeling of sorrow when old man at lodge seemed to be rather glad than otherwise that did not want chamber then mr green can have said porter will be good news for mr green know what gen'lemen will do for chamber if thing go on a be going mr green be welcome to chamber a far a phineas be concerned phineas felt nevertheless certain amount of regret that must have be compelled to abandon thing be regarded by porter by mr green a being so desirable have however written letter to mr low made promise to barrington erle be bound to lady laura standish walked out through old gateway into chancery lane resolving that must not even visit lincoln inn again for year there be certain book law book must read at such interval of leisure a politics might give within precinct of inn of court must not again put foot for twelve month let learned pundit of law such for instance a mr mr low say what might have told mr bunce before left home after breakfast that must for present remain under roof have be much gratified not simply because lodging in great marlborough street be le readily let than chamber in lincoln inn also because be great honour to to have member of

remunerating man for labour have long since joined trade union for two year past have paid subscription of shilling week towards fund longed to be doing battle against superior to be putting in opposition to employer not that objected personally to messrs foolscap margin vellum who always made much of a useful man because such antagonism must be manly fighting of battle must be right thing to do if labour mean to go to wall bunce must say to wife labour must look alive put somebody else there mr bunce be comfortable motherly woman who loved husband hated politics a have aversion to superior in world because be superior so have liking for for same reason despised people poorer than thought fair subject for boasting that child always have meat for dinner if be ever so small morsel took care that have in order that boast might be maintained world have once twice be almost too much for when for instance husband have be ill again to tell truth for last three month of long period in phineas have omitted to pay bill have kept fine brave heart during trouble must honestly swear that child always have bit of meat though have be occasionally without for day together at such time must be more than ordinarily meek to mr margin especially courteous to old lady who lodged in first floor drawing room for phineas lived up two pair of stair must excuse such servility by declaring that there be knowing how soon might want assistance husband in such emergency must become furious quarrelsome must declare that labour be going to wall that something very strong must be done at once that shilling bunce paid weekly to union regarded a being absolutely thrown away a much so a though cast weekly into thames have told so over over again making heart piercing allusion to eight child to bit of meat must always endeavour to explain to that there be other way under sun for keeping labour from being sent to wall must do so hopelessly altogether ineffectually have come to regard a lunatic to extent of one weekly shilling have woman instinctive partiality for comeliness in man be very fond of phineas finn because be handsome now be very proud of because be member of parliament have heard from husband who have told fact with much disgust that son of duke earl go into parliament liked to think that fine young man to whom talked more le day must sit with son of duke earl when phineas have really brought distress upon by owing thirty forty pound must never bring to be angry with because be handsome because dined out with lord have triumphed greatly over husband who have desired to be severe upon aristocratic debtor when money have be paid in lump know that be great catch bunce have said when prospect of lodger departure have be debated between jacob said wife think feel when have got people respectable about only respectable man know said jacob be man a earns bread mr finn a take be long way from yet phineas returned to lodging before went down to club again told mr bunce that have altogether made up mind about chamber if will keep will stay here for first session daresay of course will be only too proud mr finn though may perhaps be quite place for member of parliament think be quite place be very good of to say so mr finn will do very best to make comfortable respectable be may say though bunce be bit rough sometimes never to mr bunce be rough silly too with radical nonsense paying shilling week to nasty union just for nothing still mean well there ai man who work harder for wife child will say of if do talk politics like man to talk

saturday lord love mr finn when man a be journeyman have took up politics joined trade union ai no better than milestone for wife to take talk to after phineas went down to reform club made one of who be buzzing there in little crowd uttering prophecy a to future event lord de terrier be to go out be certain whether mr mildmay be to come in be uncertain that must go to windsor to morrow morning be not to be doubted be thought very probable that might plead age decline to undertake responsibility of forming ministry what then said phineas to friend fitzgibbon why then there will be choice out of three there be duke who be most incompetent man in england there be monk who be most unfit there be gresham who be most unpopular ca conceive possible to find worse prime minister than of three country affords other must mildmay name of one after other so a to make embarrassment greater be mr fitzgibbon description of crisis then be understood that mr fitzgibbon be given to romancing chapter viii news about mr mildmay sir everard fitzgibbon phineas started together from pall mall for portman square a of have promised to call on lady laura fitzgibbon turned in at brook a walked up st james square phineas went on by in cab must belong here said fitzgibbon a friend entered cab phineas immediately began to feel that must have done nothing till must get into brook might be very well to begin by talking politics at reform club such talking have procured for seat at loughshane be done now something more than talking be wanted for further progress nothing a told of political import be managed at reform club influence from thence be ever brought to bear upon adjustment of place under government upon arrangement of cabinet might be very well to count vote at reform club after vote have be counted have be counted successfully brook be place a phineas believed to learn at earliest moment what must be exact result of success must get into brook if might be possible for fitzgibbon be not exactly man to propose perhaps earl of brentford must do lady laura be at home with be sitting mr kennedy phineas have intended to be triumphant a entered lady laura room be there with express purpose of triumphing in success of great party of singing pleasant paean in conjunction with lady laura trumpet be put out of tune at once when saw mr kennedy said hardly word a gave hand to lady laura then afterwards to mr kennedy who chose to greet with show of cordiality hope be satisfied mr finn said lady laura laughing oh yes be that thought to have found joy quite irrepressible bottle of soda water though be very lively thing when opened wo maintain vivacity beyond certain period lady laura have have gas let off already well yes at rate sputtering part of nineteen be very well question be whether might not have have twenty one mr kennedy have just be saying that not single available vote have be missed on side have just come from brook seems to be what say there so mr kennedy also be member of brook at reform club there certainly have be idea that number might have be swelled to twenty one then a phineas began to understand nothing be correctly known at reform club for accurate appreciation of political balance of day must go to brook mr kennedy must of course be right said phineas belong to brook be only joking lady laura there be suppose doubt that lord de terrier be out be everything have probably tendered resignation said mr kennedy be same thing said phineas roughly not exactly said lady laura must there be difficulty about mr mildmay might at queen request make attempt with majority of nineteen against said phineas surely mr mildmay be not only man in country there be duke there be mr gresham there be mr monk phineas have at tongue end lesson that have be able to learn at reform club must hardly think duke must venture said mr kennedy nothing venture nothing have said phineas be very well to say that duke be incompetent know that anything very wonderful be required in way of genius duke have held own in house successfully be honest popular quite agree that prime minister at present day must be commonly honest more than commonly popular so be for duke be said lady laura again smiling a spoke to certainly if be deserted by mr mildmay think so find quite so easy to make up mind a do be inclined to think that mr mildmay will form government a long a there be that prospect need hardly commit to opinion a to probable successor then objectionable mr kennedy took leave phineas be left alone with lady laura be glorious be not began a soon a found field to be open for own manoeuvring be very young have not a yet learned manner in might best advance cause with woman a lady laura standish be telling too clearly that must have gratification in talking with unless must be allowed to have to might be very well if lady laura be in love with must hardly be way to reduce to condition mr finn said smiling a spoke be sure that did not mean be uncourteous to friend mr kennedy who be upon word did intend to be uncourteous if have thought have intended of course must not tell of now take liberty for be liberty oh because feel so anxious that must hing to mar chance a rising man be only too kind to always know how clever be how excellent be instinct see that be little impetuous wonder whether will be angry if take upon task of mentor nothing must say must make angry though might make very unhappy will not do that if can help mentor ought to be very old know be infinitely older than be must have thought be reverse indeed may say that know that be said phineas be not talking of year year have very little to do with comparative age of men woman woman at forty be quite old whereas man at forty be young phineas remembering that have put down mr kennedy age a forty in own mind frowned when heard walked about room in displeasure therefore continued lady laura talk to a though be kind of grandmother will be great grandmother if will only be kind enough to to say what really think must not then be so impetuous must be little more careful to be civil to person to whom may not take particular fancy now mr kennedy be man who may be very useful to want mr kennedy to be of use to be what call being impetuous being young being boy why must not mr kennedy be of use to a well a one else mean to conquer world by there be something mean to in expressed idea must make use of man more especially of man whom like why do not like mr finn because be one of dr fell like simply because doe not talk much may be good reason why must not make of intimate companion because like talkative people must be ground for dislike phineas paused for moment before answered thinking whether not must be well to ask question might produce from truth must not like to hear then did ask do like said too paused only for second yes think may say do like more than certainly no more than think be great deal wonder what must say if one asked whether liked said phineas looking away from through window just same without doubt if person who questioned have right to ask question there be not above one two who must have right be wrong of course to ask about mr kennedy said phineas looking out into square did not say so see think see nothing of kind be quite willing to be asked question by quite willing to answer mr kennedy be man of great wealth what can have to do with wait moment impetuous irish boy hear out phineas liked being called impetuous irish boy came close to sitting where must look up into face there came smile upon own be very handsome say that be man of great wealth continued lady laura a wealth give influence be of great use politically to party to belongs politically be to suppose care nothing for politics to such men to men who think a think who be to sit on same bench with go into same lobby be seen at same club be duty to be civil for own sake for of cause be for hermit of society to indulge in personal dislikings for men who have never be active never mean to be active have be telling mr kennedy how much thought of a good liberal came in spoilt yes did knocked down little house must build up again trouble lady laura will will be great deal of trouble great deal indeed will take mean to be very intimate with mr kennedy to shoot grouse to stalk deer to help to keep in progress a liberal member of parliament be quite prepared to admit a friend that must go back without such help oh understand believe that do understand at must endeavour to make do so by degree if be to be political pupil must at rate be obedient next time meet mr kennedy ask opinion instead of telling own have be in parliament twelve year be good deal older than when began at moment side door be opened red haired red bearded man whom phineas have seen before entered room hesitated moment a though be going to retreat again then began to pull about book toy lay on one of distant table a though be in quest of article must have retreated have not lady laura called to oswald said let introduce to mr finn mr finn think have ever met brother lord chiltern then two young men bowed of muttered something be in hurry oswald have nothing special to take away here be mr finn come to tell who be possible new prime minister be uncivil enough not to have named papa father be out of question said lord chiltern of course be said lady laura may be allowed little joke suppose will at rate be in cabinet said phineas know nothing about politics said lord chiltern wish did said sister with heart never did never will for wishing be meanest trade going think be sure be most dishonest talk of leg on turf of course there be leg what be to leg in house know whether be in parliament mr finn yes be mind beg pardon of course there be honest men there doubt be one of be indifferent honest a yet said lady laura be speaking of men who go into parliament to look after government place said lord chiltern be just what be doing said phineas why must not man serve crown have to work very hard for what earns believe that most of work at however beg pardon did mean in particular mr finn be such thorough politician that will never forgive said lady laura yes will said phineas will convert day if doe come into house lady laura suppose will come on right side will never go into house a call said lord

in house of lord night in house of common outgoing minister made explanation a business at present moment be with common will confine ourselves to chamber will do so more willingly because upshot of what be said in two place be same outgoing minister be very grave very self laudatory very courteous in regard to courtesy may be declared that stranger to way of place must have understood how such soft word must be spoken by mr daubeny beaten so quickly after very sharp word have uttered when only expected to be beaten announced to fellow commoner that right honourable friend colleague lord de terrier have thought right to retire from treasury lord de terrier in constitutional obedience to vote of lower house have resigned queen have be graciously pleased to accept lord de terrier resignation mr daubeny must only inform house that majesty have signified pleasure that mr mildmay must wait upon to morrow at eleven o'clock mr mildmay so mr daubeny understood must be with majesty to morrow at hour lord de terrier have found to be duty to recommend majesty to send for mr mildmay such be real import of mr daubeny speech that further portion of in explained with blandest most beneficent honey flowing word that party must have done everything that country must require of party have house allowed to remain on treasury bench for month two explained also that party must never recriminate must never return evil for evil must in wise copy factious opposition of adversary that party must now a ever have done carry with meekness of dove wisdom of serpent say be so generally felt by gentleman on side of house to be leather prunella very little attention be paid to great point be that lord de terrier have resigned that mr mildmay have be summoned to windsor queen have sent for mr mildmay in compliance with advice given to by lord de terrier yet lord de terrier first lieutenant have used most practised effort of eloquence for last three day in endeavouring to make countryman believe that more unfitting minister than mr mildmay ever attempted to hold rein of office nothing have be too bad for to say of mr mildmay yet in very first moment in found unable to carry on government advised queen to send for most incompetent baneful statesman who be conversant with own method of politics see nothing odd in because be used to surely in eye of stranger practice must be very singular there be nothing like in other country nothing a yet nowhere else be there same good humoured affectionate prize fighting ferocity in politics leader of two great party be to other exactly a be two champion of ring who knock other about for belt for five hundred pound side once in two year how fly at other striking a though blow must carry death if be possible yet there be one whom birmingham bantam respect so highly a doe bill burn brighton bully with whom have so much delight in discussing merit of pot of half half so be with mr daubeny mr mildmay in private life mr daubeny almost adulated elder rival mr mildmay never omitted opportunity of taking mr daubeny warmly by hand be not so in united state there same political enmity exists political enmity produce private hatred leader of party there really mean what say when abuse other be in earnest when talk a though be about to tear other limb from limb doubt whether mr daubeny must have injured hair of mr mildmay venerable head even for assurance of six continued month in office when mr daubeny have completed statement mr mildmay simply told house that have received must obey majesty command house must of course understand that by mean meant to aver that queen must even commission to form ministry if took such command from majesty must become duty to recommend majesty to impose task upon other person then everything be said that have to be said member returned to club certain damp be thrown over joy of excitable liberal by tidings reached house during mr daubeny speech sir everard powell be

have peculiar power of making agreeable one knew how to analyse define think be because listens so well said one man woman must not like for said have studied when to listen when to talk said third truth however be that phineas finn have made study in matter at be simply nature to be pleasant chapter xiv loughlinter phineas finn reached loughlinter together with mr ratler in post chaise from neighbouring town mr ratler who have done kind of thing very often before travelled without impediment new servant of hero be stuck outside with driver be in way never bring man with said mr ratler to young friend servant of house like much better because get fee 'd be just a well waited on cost half a much phineas blushed a heard there be impediment not to be got rid of for nonce phineas made best of attendant be one of point said a to man never quite make up mind if bring fellow wish have brought if wish have be great deal more decided in way that said mr ratler loughlinter a approached seemed to phineas to be much finer place than saulsby so be except loughlinter wanted that graceful beauty of age saulsby possessed loughlinter be of cut stone stone have be cut only yesterday stood on gentle slope with greensward falling from front entrance down to mountain lake on other side of lough there rose mighty mountain to sky ben linter at foot of round to left there ran wood of linter stretching for mile through crag bog mountain land better ground for deer than side of ben linter be there in highland linter rushing down into lough through rock in place almost met together above water ran so near to house that pleasant noise of cataract must be heard from hall door behind house expanse of drained park land seemed to be interminable then again came mountain there be ben linn ben lody whole territory belonging to mr kennedy be laird of linn laird of linter a people used to say yet father have walked into glasgow a little boy doubt with normal half crown in breech pocket magnificent be not said phineas to treasury secretary a be being driven up to door very grand young tree show new man new man may buy forest ca get park tree phineas at moment be thinking how far thing saw mountain stretching everywhere around castle lake river wealth of more than wealth nobility of beauty might act a temptation to lady laura standish if woman be asked to have half of must be possible that must prefer to take half of nothing thought might be possible for girl who must confess seem to confess that love must be everything must hardly be possible for woman who looked at world almost a man looked at a oyster to be opened with such weapon a must find ready to hand lady laura professed to have care for affair of world loved politics must talk of social science have broad idea about religion be devoted to certain educational view woman must feel that wealth be necessary to must be willing for sake of wealth to put up with husband without romance nay might not be that must prefer husband without romance thus phineas be arguing to a be driven up to door of loughlinter castle while mr ratler be eloquent on beauty of old park tree after scotch forest be very scrubby sort of thing said mr ratler there be nobody in house at least found nobody within hour phineas be walking about ground by mr ratler have declared to be delighted at having opportunity of writing letter doubt be writing by dozen dated from loughlinter detailing fact mr gresham mr monk plantagenet palliser lord brentford be in same house with phineas have letter to write therefore rushed down across broad lawn to river of heard noisy tumbling water there be something in air immediately filled with high spirit in desire to investigate glory of place forgot that be going to dine with four cabinet minister in row soon reached stream began to make way up through ravine there be waterfall over waterfall there be little bridge here there looked to be half natural half artificial path required that must climb be yet path be so arranged that not pleasant splashing rush of water be lost to visitor went on on up stream till there be sharp turn in ravine then looking upwards saw above head man woman standing together on one of little half made wooden bridge eye be sharp saw at glance that woman be lady laura standish have not recognised man have very little doubt that be mr kennedy of course be mr kennedy because must prefer that must be other man under sun must have turned back at once if have thought that must have done so without being observed felt sure that standing a be must have observed did not like to join must not intrude so remained still began to throw stone into river have not thrown above stone two when be called from above looked up then perceived that man who called be host of course be mr kennedy thereupon ceased to throw stone went up path joined upon bridge mr kennedy stepped forward bade welcome to loughlinter manner be le cold seemed to have more word at command than be usual with have not be long said in finding out most beautiful spot about place be not lovely said laura have not be here hour yet mr kennedy insisted on bringing here be wonderfully beautiful said phineas be very spot where now stand that made build house where be said mr kennedy be only eighteen when stood here made up mind be just twenty five year ago so be forty three said phineas to thinking how glorious be to be only twenty five within twelve month continued mr kennedy foundation be being dug stone cutter be at work what good natured man father must have be said lady laura have nothing else to do with money to pour over head a be think have other enjoyment of will go little higher lady laura will get fine view over to ben linn just now lady laura declared that must go a much higher a chose to take phineas be rather in doubt a to what must become to do must stay where be go down make to vanish after most acceptable fashion if be to do so abruptly must seem a though be attributing something special to companionship of other two mr kennedy saw doubt asked to join may a well come on mr finn dine till eight be not much past six yet men of business be writing letter lady who have be travelling be in bed believe not of mr kennedy said lady laura then went on with walk very pleasantly lord of that surveyed took from one point of vantage to till swore that of spot upon earth loughlinter be surely most lovely do delight in own said lord when come up here alone feel that in midst of little bit of crowded island have to myself with other man wealth can interfere grow proud of own till become thoroughly ashamed of after believe be better to dwell in city than in country better at rate for rich man mr kennedy have now spoken more word than phineas have heard to fall from lip during whole time that have be acquainted with other believe so too said laura if one be obliged to choose between two for think that little of be good for man woman there be doubt about said phineas doubt a far a enjoyment go said mr kennedy took up out of ravine on to side of mountain then down by path through wood to back of house a went relapsed into usual silence conversation be kept up between other two at point not very far from castle just so far that one must see by break of ground where castle stood kennedy left mr finn will take back in safety be sure said a be here will go up to farm for moment if show now again when be here think be indifferent about 'bestials now mr kennedy said lady laura be going to pretend to understand about sheep ox mr kennedy owning that be so went away to farm phineas with lady laura returned towards house think upon whole said lady laura that be a good man a know must think be idle one said phineas doubt that be perhaps neither zealous active be thoughtful high principled have method purpose in use make of money see that have poetry in nature too if get upon right string how fond be of scenery of place man must be fond of be ashamed to say that almost make envy certainly never have wished to be mr robert kennedy in london must like to be laird of loughlinter 'laird of linn laird of linter here in summer gone in winter there be ballad about old laird belongs to time when mr kennedy have not be heard of when branch of mackenzie lived down at wretched old tower see a first come upon lake when old mr kennedy bought there be hardly hundred acre on property under cultivation belonged to mackenzie yes to mackenzie of linn a be called be mr kennedy old man who be first called loughlinter be linn castle lived there for hundred of year highlander with be said of family pride have forgotten mackenzie already be quite proud of rich landlord be unpoetical said phineas yes then poetry be so usually false doubt whether scotland must not have be a prosaic country a under sun for walter scott have doubt that henry v owes romance of character altogether to shakspeare sometimes think despise poetry said phineas when be false do difficulty be to know when be false when be true tom moore be always false not so false a byron said phineas with energy much more so friend will not discus that now have seen mr monk since have be here have seen one came with mr ratler why with mr ratler can not find mr ratler companion much to taste chance brought together mr ratler be man of sense lady laura be not to be despised always seems to said lady laura that nothing be to be gained in politics by sitting at foot of little gamaliels great gamaliels will not have novice on footstool then sit at man foot be not astonishing that price generally put upon article by world be that owner put on that be specially true of man own self if herd with ratler men will take for granted that be ratlerite more if consort with gresham pallisers will equally be supposed to know own place never knew mentor said phineas so apt a be to fill telemachus with pride be because think fault lie that way if did if thought so telemachus may be sure must resign position a mentor here be mr kennedy lady glencora mr gresham on step then went up through ionic column on to broad stone terrace before door there found crowd of men woman for legislator statesman have written letter lady have taken necessary rest phineas a be dressing considered deeply that lady laura have said to not so much with reference to advice have given though also be of importance a to fact that have be given by have first called mentor have accepted name have addressed her a telemachus yet believed to be older than if indeed there be difference in age be possible that female mentor must love telemachus must love a phineas desired to be loved by lady laura must not say that be impossible perhaps there have be mistake between mistake in manner of addressing in hers of addressing perhaps old bachelor of forty three be not thinking of wife have old bachelor of forty three be really in love with lady laura must have allowed to walk home alone with phineas leaving with flimsy pretext of having to look at sheep phineas resolved that must at rate play out game whether be to lose to win in playing must if possible drop something of mentor telemachus style of conversation a to advice given of herding with gresham pallisers instead of with ratlers fitzgibbons must use that a circumstance might direct to a thought of be sufficiently astonishing that even ratlers fitzgibbons must admit among a one of when think of father of old house at killaloe remember that hitherto have done nothing can not understand how be must be at loughlinter there be only one way of understanding if lady laura really loved riddle might be read room at loughlinter be splendid much larger very much more richly furnished than at saulsby there be certain stiffness in movement of thing perhaps in manner of of present be not felt at saulsby phineas at once missed grace prettiness cheery audacity of violet effingham felt at same time violet effingham must be out of element at loughlinter at loughlinter be met for business be at least semi political perhaps rather semi official gathering became aware that ought not to look simply for amusement when entered drawing room before dinner mr monk mr palliser mr kennedy mr gresham with sundry others be standing in wide group before fireplace among be lady glencora palliser lady laura mr bonteen a approached seemed a though sort of opening be made for must see though others did not that movement came from lady laura believe mr monk said lady glencora that be only two in whole party who really know what must be at if must be divided from so many of friend said mr monk be happy to go astray in company of lady glencora palliser might ask said mr gresham with peculiar smile for be famous what be that mr monk be really at making men woman equal said lady glencora take to be gist of political theory lady glencora must cry off said mr monk yes doubt if be in cabinet must not admit so much there be reticence of course there be official discretion mean to say lady glencora that must really advocate equality said mr bonteen do mean to say so mr bonteen mean to go further to tell that be liberal at heart unless do so likewise unless be basis of political aspiration pray let speak for lady glencora by mean not when be criticising politics do not wish to make lower order comfortable certainly said mr bonteen educated happy good undoubtedly to make a comfortable a good a better if possible be sure wish to make a good a comfortable a anybody else a above if anybody be above will admit that yes if understand then have admitted everything be advocate for general equality just a mr monk be a be there be getting out of be there mr kennedy then dinner be announced mr kennedy walked off with french republican on arm a went whispered into mr kennedy ear will understand be not saying that people be equal that tendency of law making of governing must be to reduce inequality in answer to mr kennedy said not word lady glencora politics be too fast furious for nature week passed by at loughlinter at end of phineas found on term of friendly intercourse with political magnate assembled in house especially with mr monk have determined that must not follow lady laura advice a to selection of companion if in doing so must be driven even to seeming of intrusion made attempt to sit at foot of anybody must stand aloof when bigger men than be talking be content to be le a indeed be le than mr bonteen mr ratler at end of week found that without effort on part almost in opposition to effort on part have fallen into easy pleasant way with men be very delightful to have killed stag in company with mr palliser have stopped beneath crag to discus with question a to duty on irish malt have played chess with mr gresham have be told that gentleman opinion on trial of mr jefferson davis lord brentford have at last called finn have proved to that nothing be known in ireland about sheep with mr monk have have long discussion on abstract question in politics before week be over be almost disposed to call disciple at least follower of mr monk why not of mr monk a well a of one else mr monk be in cabinet of member of cabinet be most advanced liberal lady glencora be not so far wrong other night mr monk said to equality be ugly word must be used misleads frightens be bugbear in using have not perhaps clearly defined meaning for in own mind wish of honest man must be to assist in lifting up below till be something nearer own level than find to phineas assented by degree found assenting to great many thing mr monk said to mr monk be thin tall gaunt man who have devoted whole life to politics hitherto without personal reward beyond came to from reputation of name from honour of seat in parliament be one of four five brother besides be in trade have prospered in trade whereas have prospered solely in politics men said that be dependent altogether on what relative supplied for support have now be in parliament for more than twenty year have be known not only a radical a democrat ten year since when have risen to fame not to repute among men who then governed england nobody dreamed that joshua monk must ever be paid servant of crown have inveighed against one minister after a though deserved impeachment have advocated political doctrine at time seemed to be altogether at variance with possibility of governing according to english rule of government have be regarded a pestilent thorn in side of minister now be member of cabinet whom have terrified in old day began to find that be not so much unlike other men there be few horse can not put into harness of highest spirit will generally do work best phineas who have eye about thought that must perceive that mr palliser did not shoot deer with mr ratler that mr gresham played chess with mr bonteen bonteen indeed be noisy pushing man whom nobody seemed to like phineas wondered why must be at loughlinter why must be in office friend laurence fitzgibbon have indeed once endeavoured to explain man who can vote hard a call who will speak few word now then a be wanted without ambition that way may always have price if have pretty wife into bargain ought to have pleasant time of mr ratler doubt be very useful man who thoroughly knew business yet a seemed to phineas very great distinction be shown to mr ratler at loughlinter if got a high a that said to must think miracle of luck yet nobody seems to think anything of ratler be nothing unless one can go to very top believe did right to accept office mr monk said to one day a sat together on rock close by one of little bridge over linter indeed unless man doe so when bond of office tendered to be made compatible with own view decline to proceed on open path towards prosecution of view man who be combating one ministry after striving to imbue minister with conviction can hardly decline to become

thing mr kennedy have same enjoyment of everything around here yes while last lady glencora stand pretty much on same footing in spite of wealth except be married woman know what be worth something

satisfaction have not be despised by woman to whom have told love have not shown that thought to be unworthy of have not regarded love a offence indeed have almost told that prudence alone have forbidden to return passion have kissed have afterwards parted from a dear friend know why there must have be flavour of exquisite joy in midst of agony a thought of be so must never kiss again future

success go so far towards downright political success in be so pleasant have surpassed men in spite of office acquired position must not think that even mr low if knew must confess that have be right a to bosom friendship with mr kennedy that of course troubled ought not to be driving poniard into mr kennedy heart convention of life forbade therefore bosom friendship be to be excused if not enemy to death then there must be reason why must not be bosom friend went over to ireland staying one night with mr bunce came down upon at killaloe like god out of heaven even father be well nigh overwhelmed by admiration mother sister thought only fit to minister to pleasure have learned if have learned nothing else to look a though be master of circumstance around be entirely free from internal embarrassment when father spoke to about legal study did not exactly laugh at father ignorance recapitulated to father so much of mr monk wisdom at second hand showing plainly that be business to study art of speech technicality of house not to study law that father have nothing further to say have become man of such dimension that ordinary father must hardly dare to inquire into proceeding a for ordinary mother such a mr finn certainly be must do more than look after son linen with awe mary flood jones reader hope will not quite have forgotten mary flood jones be in great tremor when first met hero of loughshane after returning from honour of first session have be somewhat disappointed because newspaper have not be full of speech have made in parliament indeed lady of finn household have be ill at ease on head must not imagine why phineas have restrained with so much philosophy miss flood jones in discussing matter with miss finn have never expressed slightest doubt of capacity judgment when tidings came tidings came in letter from phineas to father that did not intend to speak session because speech from young member on first session be thought to be inexpedient miss flood jones miss finn be quite willing to accept wisdom of decision much a might regret effect of mary when met hero hardly dared to look in face remembered accurately circumstance of last interview with must be that wore that ringlet near heart mary have received from barbara finn certain hair supposed to have come from head of phineas always wore near own moreover since have seen phineas have refused offer of marriage from mr elia bodkin have refused almost ignominiously when doing so have told that must never be false to phineas finn think so good of to come to see again said

there be only for few day be very glad to be taken in again here can assure know how very glad be to have be glad to see mary very glad why must not be glad barbara dearest friend have in world of course talk about that make think of if knew mary how often think about then mary who be very happy at hearing such word who be walking in to dinner with at moment must not refrain from pressing arm with little finger knew that phineas in position must not marry at once must wait for oh for ever if must only ask of course be wicked traitor to tell that be wont to think of jove smile at lover perjury be well that must do so a such perjury can hardly be avoided altogether in difficult circumstance of successful gentleman life phineas be traitor of course be almost forced to be traitor by simple fact that lady laura standish be in london mary flood jones in killaloe remained for nearly five month at killaloe doubt whether time be altogether well spent of book recommended to by mr monk probably did read be often to be found encompassed by blue book fear that there be grain of pretence about blue book parliamentary paper in day be in gentle way something of impostor must not be angry with for not going to said once to mary mother when have declined invitation to drink tea fact be that time be not own pray make apology be quite aware that have very little to offer said mr flood jones who be not altogether happy about mary who perhaps knew more about member of parliament blue book than phineas finn have supposed mary be fool to think of man mother said to daughter next morning think of mamma not particularly be better than anybody else can see be beginning to give air said mr flood jones mary made answer went up into room swore before figure of virgin that must be

so public business will become profession be turned out with ministry yes be true sir must run chance if worst come to worst hope might be able to secure permanent place must think that can hardly fail to do so trust may never be driven to want thought however that have settled before then phineas assumed look of injured innocence a though father be driving too hard in mean time money have be enough said doctor after pause have intended to ask to advance hundred pound said phineas there be expense to be driven on first entering parliament hundred pound if be inconvenient sir can do without have not a yet paid for gun for velvet coat in have be shooting most probably for knickerbockers knew wanted hundred pound badly felt ashamed of in asking for if be once in office though office be

lead side if anybody lead doe have great faith in mr monk there be one who must go for ballot to morrow if be brought forward stoutly said barrington erle to mr ratler few minute afterwards pointing to phineas a spoke think much of young man said ratler mr bonteen mr ratler have put head together during last evening at loughlinter have agreed that did not think much of phineas finn why did mr kennedy go down off mountain to get pony why did mr gresham play chess with mr ratler mr bonteen may have be right in making up mind to think little of phineas finn barrington erle have be quite wrong when have said that phineas must go for ballot to morrow phineas have made up mind very strongly that must always oppose ballot that must hold same opinion throughout life one must pretend to say in present mood under tuition have received from mr monk be prepared to demonstrate out of house in that ballot be a political measure unmanly ineffective enervating enervating have be great word with mr monk phineas have clung to with admiration meeting took place at mr mildmay on third day of session phineas have of course heard of such meeting before have never attended one indeed there have be no such gathering when mr mildmay party came into power early in last session mr mildmay men have then made effort in turning out opponent have be well pleased to rest awhile upon oar now however must go again to work therefore liberal party be collected at mr mildmay house in order that liberal party might be told what be that mr mildmay cabinet intended to do phineas finn be quite in dark a to what must be nature of performance on occasion entertained idea that gentleman present must be called upon to express individually assent dissent in regard to measure proposed walked to st james square with laurence fitzgibbon even with fitzgibbon be ashamed to show ignorance by asking question after said fitzgibbon kind of thing mean nothing know a well a possible so do what mr mildmay will say then gresham will say few word then turnbull will make murmur then will assent to anything to nothing then will be over still phineas did not understand whether assent required must must not be individual personal assent when affair be over found that be disappointed that might almost a well have stayed away from meeting except that have attended at mr mildmay bidding have given silent adhesion to mr mildmay plan of reform for session laurence fitzgibbon have be very nearly correct in description of what must occur mr mildmay made long speech mr turnbull great radical of day man who be supposed to represent what many called manchester school of politics asked dozen question in answer to mr gresham made short speech then mr mildmay made speech then be over gist of whole thing be that there must be reform bill very generous in enlargement of franchise ballot mr turnbull expressed doubt whether must be satisfactory to country even mr turnbull be soft in tone complaisant in manner a there be reporter present that plan of turning private meeting at gentleman house into public assembly not having be a yet adopted there must be need for energy violence went to mr mildmay house to hear mr mildmay plan heard two day after phineas be to dine with mr monk mr monk have asked in lobby of house give dinner party said must like to come meet mr turnbull phineas accepted invitation a matter of course there be many who said that mr turnbull be greatest man in nation that nation must be saved only by direct obedience to mr turnbull instruction others said that mr turnbull be demagogue at heart rebel that be un english false very dangerous phineas be rather inclined to believe latter statement a danger dangerous men be always more attractive than safety safe

chiltern be in love with miss effingham did not like lord chiltern quite a well a have done before have simply admired miss effingham have taken pleasure in society though have be all did not like to hear of man wanting to marry be almost angry with lady laura for saying that believed miss effingham loved brother if miss effingham have twice refused lord chiltern ought to have be sufficient be not that phineas be in love with miss effingham a be still violently in love with lady laura other love be of course impossible nevertheless there be something offensive to in story a have be told if be wisdom on part said answering lady laura last word can not find fault with for decision find fault think brother must make happy lady laura when be left alone at once reverted to tone in phineas finn have answered remark about miss effingham phineas be very ill able to conceal thought wore heart almost upon sleeve can be possible that care for be nature of lady laura first question to herself upon matter in asking that question thought nothing of disparity in rank fortune between phineas finn violet effingham did occur to a at improbable that violet might accept love of who have so lately be own lover idea grated against wish on two side be most anxious that violet must ultimately become brother wife must not be pleased that phineas must be able to love woman must beg reader not to be carried away by last word into erroneous conclusion must not suppose that lady laura kennedy lately married bride indulged guilty passion for young man who have loved though have probably thought often of phineas finn since marriage thought have never be of nature to disturb rest have never occurred to even to think that regarded with feeling be offence to husband must have hated have such idea presented to mind prided on being pure high principled woman who have kept so strong guard upon a to be nearly free from danger of rock upon other woman made shipwreck of happiness took pride in must then blame for own pride though so blamed never occurred to to think that to there might be danger of such shipwreck have put away from idea of love when have first perceived that phineas have regarded with more than friendship have accepted mr kennedy offer with assured conviction that by doing so be acting best for own happiness for of concerned have felt romance of position to be sweet when phineas have stood with at top of fall of linter have told her of hope have dared to indulge when at bottom of fall have presumed to take in arm have forgiven without difficulty to herself telling that must be alpha omega of romance of life have not felt bound to tell mr kennedy of what have occurred have felt that must hardly have be angry even have be told have often thought of lover since of love telling that too have once have lover never regarding husband in light thought have not frightened a guilty thought will do there have come romance have be pleasant be gone have be soon banished have left to sweet flavour of loved to taste sweetness though knew that be gone man must be friend especially husband friend must be care to see that life be successful especially husband care be great delight to to know that husband liked man man must marry man wife must be friend have be very pure very pleasant now idea have flitted across brain that man be in love with one else did not like did not therefore become afraid of herself in least realise at once danger of own position immediate glance at matter did not go beyond falseness of men if be so a suspected if phineas have in truth transferred affection to violet effingham of how little value be love of such man did not occur to at moment that also have transferred hers to robert kennedy that if not have done worse did remember that in autumn young phoebus among men have turned back upon out upon mountain that might hide from agony of heart when learned that be to be wife of man now before winter be over must not hide from fact that heart be elsewhere then speculated counted up fact satisfied that phineas must not even have seen violet effingham since two have stood together upon mountain how false be men how false how weak of heart chiltern violet effingham said phineas to a walked away from grosvenor place be fair that must be sacrificed because be rich because be so winning so fascinating that lord brentford must receive even son for sake of receiving also daughter in law phineas also liked lord chiltern have seen fancied that have seen fine thing in have looked forward to regeneration hoping perhaps that might have hand in good work did not recognise propriety of sacrificing violet effingham even for work so good a if miss effingham have refused lord chiltern twice surely that ought to be sufficient did not occur to that love of such girl a violet must be great treasure to a regarded be still in love hopelessly in love with lady laura kennedy chapter xviii mr turnbull be wednesday evening there be house at seven o'clock phineas be at mr monk hall door be first of guest found mr monk alone in dining room be doing butler said mr monk who have brace of decanter in hand proceeded to put down in neighbourhood of fire have finished now will go up stair to receive two great men properly beg pardon for coming too early said finn not minute too early seven be seven be who be too late lord bless think be ashamed of being found in act of decanting own wine remember lord palmerston saying before committee about salary five six year ago now daresay that must do for english minister to have hall door opened by maid servant now be english minister have got nobody maid servant to open hall door be obliged to look after own wine wonder whether be improper must like to be mean of injuring british constitution perhaps if resign soon if nobody follows example grave evil result may be avoided sincerely hope so for do love british constitution love also respect in member of english cabinet be held now turnbull who will be here in moment hate be rich man have more powdered footman hanging about house than ever lord palmerston have be still in business oh yes make thirty thousand year here be how be turnbull be talking about maid servant hope opened door for properly certainly a far a perceived said mr turnbull who be better at speech than joke very respectable young woman must say there be not one more so in london said mr monk finn seems to think ought to have man in livery be matter of perfect indifference to said mr turnbull be one of who never think of such thing said mr monk then laird of loughlinter be announced went down to dinner mr turnbull be good looking robust man about sixty with long grey hair red complexion with hard eye well cut nose full lip be nearly six foot high stood quite upright always wore black swallow tail coat black trouser black silk waistcoat in house at least be always so dressed at dinner table what difference there might be in costume when at home at staleybridge few of who saw in london have mean of knowing there be nothing in face to indicate special talent one looking at must take to be fool there be none of fire of genius in eye be there in line of mouth of play of thought fancy be generally to be found in face of men woman who have made great mr turnbull have certainly made great must hardly have done so without force of intellect be one of most popular if not most popular politician in country poor men believed in thinking that be most honest public friend men who be not poor believed in power thinking that counsel must surely prevail have obtained ear of house favour of reporter opened voice at public dinner on public platform without conviction that word spoken by must be read by thousand first necessity for good speaking be large audience of advantage mr turnbull have made sure yet must hardly be said that be great orator be gifted with powerful voice with strong may perhaps call broad conviction with perfect self reliance with almost unlimited power of endurance with hot ambition with keen scruple with moral skin of great thickness nothing said against pained attack wounded raillery touched in least there be not sore spot about probably first thought on waking morning told that at least be totus teres atque rotundus be of course thorough radical so be mr monk mr monk first waking thought be probably exactly reverse of of friend mr monk be much hotter man in debate than mr turnbull mr monk be ever doubting of never doubted of so much a when have be most violent also most effective in debate when mr monk jeered at for being cabinet minister keeping attendant grander than parlour maid there be substratum of self doubt under joke mr turnbull be certainly great radical a such enjoyed great reputation think that high office in state have ever be offered to thing have be said justified seemed to to justify in declaring that in possible circumstance must serve crown serve people have said much a respect servant of crown think that own office be higher have be greatly called to task for speech mr mildmay present premier have asked whether did not recognise so called servant of crown a most hard worked truest servant of people house press have supported mr mildmay to that mr turnbull be quite indifferent when assertion made by before three four thousand person at manchester to effect that specially be friend servant of people be received with acclamation felt quite satisfied that have gained point progressive reform in franchise of manhood suffrage must be acknowledged not far distant end equal electoral district ballot tenant right for england a well a ireland reduction of standing army till there must be standing army to reduce utter disregard of political movement in europe almost idolatrous admiration for political movement in america free trade in everything except malt absolute extinction of state church be among principal article in mr turnbull political catalogue think that when once have learned art of arranging word a stood upon leg have so mastered voice a to have obtained ear of house work of life be not difficult having nothing to construct must always deal with generality being free from responsibility be not called upon to study detail to master even great fact be business to inveigh against existing evil perhaps there be easier business when once privilege of audience have be attained be work to cut down forest tree have nothing to do with subsequent cultivation of land mr monk have once told phineas finn how great be charm of inaccuracy be permitted to opposition mr turnbull doubt enjoyed charm to full though must sooner have put padlock on mouth for month than have owned a much upon whole mr turnbull be doubt right in resolving that must not take office though reticence on subject might have be more becoming to conversation at dinner though be altogether on political subject have in nothing of special interest a long a girl be there to change plate when be gone door be closed gradually opened out there came on to be pleasant sparring match between two great radical radical who have joined to governing power radical who stood aloof mr kennedy barely said word now then phineas be almost a silent a mr kennedy have come there to hear such discussion be quite willing to listen while gun of such great calibre be being fired off for amusement think mr mildmay be making great step forward said mr turnbull think be said mr monk did not believe that must ever live to go so far will hardly suffice even for year still coming from be great deal only show how far man may be made to go if only proper force be applied after matter very little who be minister be what have always declared said mr monk very little indeed mind whether be lord de terrier mr mildmay mr gresham if choose to get made first lord of treasury have such ambition turnbull must have thought have if went in for kind of thing must like to go to top of ladder must feel that if must do good at by becoming minister must only do by becoming first minister must doubt own fitness for position doubt fitness for position of minister said mr turnbull mean that on other ground said mr kennedy mean on ground said mr turnbull rising on leg standing with back to fire of course be not fit to have diplomatic intercourse with men who must come to simply with desire of deceiving of course be unfit to deal with member of parliament who must flock around because wanted place of course be unfit to answer man question so a to give information to one must not answer so a to give information said mr kennedy mr turnbull be so intent on speech that may be doubted whether heard interruption took notice of a went on of course be unfit to maintain propriety of seeming confidence between crown powerless people powerful man recognises own unfitness for such work more clearly than do mr monk if took in hand such work at must like to be leader not led tell fairly now what be conviction worth in mr mildmay cabinet be question man may hardly answer said mr monk be question man must at least answer for before consent to sit there said mr turnbull in tone of voice be almost angry what reason have for supposing have omitted that duty said mr monk simply can not reconcile known opinion with practice of colleague will not tell what conviction may be worth in mr mildmay cabinet will not take upon to say that be worth chair on sit when be there will tell what aspiration be when consented to fill chair will judge of worth thought that might possibly leaven batch of bread have to bake giving to whole batch more of flavour of reform than must have possessed have absented thought that when be asked to join mr mildmay mr gresham very fact of request indicated liberal progress that if refused request must be declining to assist in good work must have supported if anything be proposed worthy of support said mr turnbull yes must not have be so effective in taking care that measure be proposed worthy of support a may possibly be now thought good deal about believe that decision be right be sure be right said mr kennedy there can be juster object of ambition than seat in cabinet said phineas sir must dispute said mr turnbull turning round upon hero regard position of high minister a most respectable thank for so much said mr monk orator went on again regardless of interruption position of gentleman in inferior office of gentleman who attend rather to nod wink of superior in downing street than to interest of constituent regard a being highly respectable man can not begin at top said phineas friend mr monk have begun at what be pleased to call top said mr turnbull will not profess to think that even have raised by going into office to be independent representative of really popular commercial constituency be in estimation highest object of englishman ambition why commercial mr turnbull said mr kennedy because commercial constituency really do elect own member in accordance with own judgment whereas county small town be coerced either by individual by combination of aristocratic influence yet said mr kennedy there be not dozen conservative returned by county in scotland scotland be very much to be honoured said mr turnbull mr kennedy be first to take departure mr turnbull followed very quickly phineas got up to go at same time stayed at host request sat for awhile smoking cigar turnbull be wonderful man said mr monk doe not domineer too much fault be not arrogance so much a ignorance that there be must be difference between public private life in house of common man in mr turnbull position must speak with dictatorial assurance be always addressing not house only country at large country will not believe in unless believe in forgets that be not always addressing country at large wonder what sort of time mr turnbull little turnbulls have of phineas a went home made up mind that mr turnbull little turnbulls must probably have bad time of chapter xix lord chiltern ride horse bonebreaker be known that might be detail of mr mildmay bill ballot must not form part of a there be strong party in house of common very numerous party out of who be desirous that voting by ballot must be made part of electoral law be decided that independent motion must be brought on in anticipation of mr mildmay bill arrangement be probably one of mr mildmay own making so that might be hampered by opposition on subject by own follower if a did not doubt motion must be lost be expected that debate must not last over one night phineas resolved that must make maiden speech on occasion have very strong opinion a to inefficacy of ballot for good purpose thought that might be able to strike out from conviction spark of fire used to be so plentiful with at old debating club even at breakfast that morning heart began to beat quickly at idea of having to stand on leg before so critical audience knew that must be well that must if possible get subject off mind during day therefore went out among people who certainly must not talk to about ballot sat for nearly hour in

nothing be hateful to have never spoken of hate will always feel strongest regard for old friend playfellow there be many thing woman be bound to consider before allows so to love man that can consent to become wife allow then be matter entirely of calculation suppose there must be thought in lord chiltern there be now pause man hand be at last allowed to drop a there came response to proffered grasp walked once twice across room before spoke again then stopped closely opposite to will never try again said will be better so replied there be something to unmanly in man persecuting girl just tell laura will that be over may a well tell father good bye then tendered hand to did not take probably did not see at once left room house yet believe love lady laura said to friend in anger when discussed matter immediately on lord chiltern departure have right to say that laura have right to belief do believe think love that lack courage to risk in trying to save be woman bound to marry man if love yes be replied lady laura impetuously without thinking of what be saying be if be convinced that also be loved be man character be circumstance must do so whatever friend may say to contrary be there to be prudence in marriage there may be great deal too much prudence said lady laura be true there be certainly too much prudence if woman marries prudently without love violet intended by attack upon friend have not have present in mind at moment idea of lady laura special prudence in marrying mr kennedy lady laura felt keenly knew at once that arrow have be shot have wounded will get nothing said by descending to personality with other meant none laura suppose be always hard said lady laura for one person to judge altogether of mind of if have said anything severe of refusal of brother retract only wish that must have be otherwise lord chiltern when left sister house walked through slush dirt to haunt of in neighbourhood of covent garden there remained through whole afternoon evening certain captain clutterbuck joined dined with told nothing to captain clutterbuck of sorrow captain clutterbuck must see that be unhappy let have bottle of 'cham said captain clutterbuck when dinner be nearly over 'cham be only thing to screw one up when one be down peg can have what like said lord chiltern will have brandy water worst of brandy water be that one get tired of before night be over said captain clutterbuck nevertheless lord chiltern did go down to peterborough next day by hunting train rode horse bonebreaker so well in famous run from sutton spring to gidding that after run young pile of house of pile sarsnet gingham offered three hundred pound for animal be worth above fifty said lord chiltern will give three hundred said pile must ride if 'd got said lord chiltern oh must said pile mr pile did not continue conversation contenting with telling friend grogram that red devil chiltern be a drunk a lord chapter xx debate on ballot phineas took seat in house with consciousness of much inward trepidation of heart on night of ballot debate after leaving lord chiltern went down to club dined alone three four men came spoke to must not talk to at ease did quite know what be saying to be going to do something longed to achieve very idea of now that be so near to be terror to to be in house not to speak must to thinking be disgraceful failure indeed must not continue to keep seat unless spoke have be put there that might speak must speak of course must speak have not already be conspicuous almost a boy orator yet at moment did not know whether be eating mutton beef who be standing opposite to talking to so much be in dread of ordeal have prepared for a went down to house after dinner almost made up mind that must be good thing to leave london by one of night mail train felt to be stiff stilted a walked that clothes be uneasy to when turned into westminster hall regretted more keenly than ever have done that have seceded from keeping of mr low must thought have spoken very well in court must there have learned that self confidence now failed so terribly be however too late to think of must only go in take seat went in took seat chamber seemed to to be mysteriously large a though bench be crowded over bench gallery over gallery have be long enough in house to have lost original awe inspired by speaker clerk of house by row of minister by unequalled importance of place on ordinary occasion must saunter in out whisper at ease to neighbour on occasion went direct to bench on ordinarily sat began at once to rehearse to speech have in truth be doing day in spite of effort that have made to rid of memory of occasion have be collecting head of speech while mr low have be talking to refreshing quotation in presence of lord chiltern dumb bell have taxed memory intellect with various task a feared must not adjust one with have learned heading of speech so one heading might follow other nothing be forgotten have learned verbatim word intended to utter under heading with hope that if one compact part must be destroyed injured in compactness by treachery of memory by course of debate other compact part might be there in entirety ready for use at least so many of compact part a treachery of memory accident of debate might leave to so that speech might be like vessel watertight in various compartment must float by buoyancy of stern bow even though hold must be waterlogged use of composed word even though must be able to carry through must not complete work for must be duty to answer in sort who have gone before in order to do must be able to insert without prearrangement of word idea little intercalatory part between compact mass of argument with have be occupying for many laborious hour a looked round upon house perceived that everything be dim before that original awe of house have returned with present quaking fear that made feel pulsation of own heart became painfully aware that task have prepared for be too great must on occasion of rising to maiden leg have prepared for short general speech must indeed have done little for credit in house might have served to carry off novelty of thing have introduced to sound of own voice within wall must have trusted to what wit spirit must produce for on spur of moment not have burdened with huge exercise of memory during presentation of few petition tried to repeat to first of compact part compact part on a might certainly be brought into use let debate have gone a might have expended great care have flattered that there be something of real strength in word a repeated to in comfortable seclusion of own room have made so ready to tongue that thought to be impossible that must forget even intonation now found that must not remember first phrase without unloosing looking at small roll of paper held furtively in hand what be good of looking at must forget again in next moment have intended to satisfy most eager of friend to astound opponent a be one must be satisfied none astounded who have trusted in debate began if leisure afforded by long tedious speech must have served might have have leisure enough tried at first to follow that advocate for ballot might say hoping thence to acquire impetus of strong interest soon wearied of work began to long that speech might be ended although period of own martyrdom must thereby be brought nearer to at half past seven so many member have deserted seat that phineas began to think that might be saved further pain by count out reckoned member present found that be below mystic forty first by two then by four by five by seven at one time by eleven be not for to ask speaker to count house wondered that one else must do so yet a idea of termination to night work came upon a thought of lost labour almost took courage again almost dreaded rather than wished for interference of malicious member there be malicious member then present else be known that lord of treasury lord of admiralty must flock in during speaker ponderous counting thus slow length of ballot lover verbosity be permitted to evolve without interruption at eight o'clock have completed catalogue of illustration immediately mr monk rose from treasury bench to explain ground on government must decline to support motion before house phineas be aware that mr monk intended to speak be aware also that speech must be very short idea be have said to phineas man possessed of franchise must dare to have to express political opinion of own otherwise franchise be not worth having that men will learn that when so dare evil can come from such daring a ballot must make courage of kind unnecessary dislike ballot will confine to leave illustration to younger debater phineas also have be informed that mr turnbull must reply to mr monk with purpose of crushing mr monk into dust phineas have prepared speech with something of intention of subsequently crushing mr turnbull knew however that must not command opportunity there be chapter of accident to must accommodate such have be programme for evening mr monk made speech though be short be very fiery energetic quick a lightning word of wrath scorn flew from in painted cowardice meanness falsehood of ballot ballot box said be grave of true political opinion though spoke hardly for ten minute seemed to say more than enough ten time enough to slaughter argument of former speaker at hot word a fell phineas be driven to regret that paragraph of own be taken away from that choicest morsel of standing ground be being cut from under foot when mr monk sat down phineas felt that mr monk have said that phineas finn have intended to say then mr turnbull rose slowly from bench below gangway with speaker so frequent so famous a mr turnbull hurry be necessary be sure to have opportunity speaker eye be ever travelling to accustomed spot mr turnbull rose slowly began oration very mildly there be nothing said that admired so much a poetic imagery high flown sentiment of right honourable friend member for west bromwich mr monk sat for west bromwich unless be stubborn fact unanswered argument of honourable friend who have brought forward motion then mr turnbull proceeded after fashion to crush mr monk be very prosaic very clear in voice language very harsh very unscrupulous mr monk have be joined together in politics for over twenty year one must have thought from mr turnbull word that have be bitterest of enemy mr monk be taunted with office taunted with desertion of liberal party taunted with ambition taunted with lack of ambition once thought said mr turnbull nay not long ago thought that must have fought battle for people shoulder to shoulder knee to knee have preferred that knee next to own will wear garter that shoulder support will be decked with blue ribbon a shoulder presume be decked in closet conference be called cabinet just after while mr turnbull be still going on with variety of illustration drawn from united state barrington erle stepped across bench up to place where phineas be sitting whispered few word into ear bonteen be prepared to answer turnbull wish to do told that thought must have opportunity if wish phineas be not ready with reply to erle at spur of moment somebody told continued that have said that must like to speak to night so did said phineas will tell bonteen will do chamber seemed to swim round before hero eye mr turnbull be still going on with clear loud unpleasant voice there be knowing how long might go on upon phineas if must now consent might devolve duty within ten minute within three minute of rising there before full house to defend great friend mr monk from gross personal attack be fit that novice a must undertake work a be to do so that speech have prepared with various self floating part must go for nothing task be exactly that of task must best like to have accomplished to have accomplished well if must fail felt that must fail for such work man must have sens about full courage perfect confidence something almost approaching to contempt for listening opponent nothing of fear in regard to listening friend must be a cock in own farmyard master of circumstance around phineas finn have not even a yet heard sound of own voice in room at moment so confused be that did not know where sat mr mildmay where mr daubeny be confused there arose a be sound of water in ear feeling a of great hell around have rather wait said at last bonteen have better reply barrington erle looked into face then stepping back across bench told mr bonteen that opportunity be mr turnbull continued speaking quite long enough to give poor phineas time for repentance repentance be of use have decided against decision must not be reversed must have left house only seemed to have done so one must look at drew hat down over eye remained in place hating mr bonteen hating barrington erle hating mr turnbull hating one so much a hated have disgraced for ever must never recover occasion have lost mr bonteen speech be in way remarkable mr monk said have done state good service by adding wisdom patriotism to cabinet sort of argument mr bonteen used to prove that man who have gained credit a legislator must in process of time become member of executive be trite common be not used by mr bonteen with special force mr bonteen be glib of tongue possessed that familiarity with place poor phineas have lacked so sorely there be one moment however be terrible to phineas a soon a mr bonteen have shown purpose for be on leg mr monk looked round at phineas a though in reproach have expected that work must fall into hand of one who must perform with more warmth of heart than must be expected from mr bonteen when mr bonteen ceased two three other short speech be made member fired off little gun phineas having lost so great opportunity must not now consent to accept one must be comparatively valueless then there came division motion be lost by large majority by number might choose to name a phineas have said to lord brentford in there be triumph to poor wretch who have failed through fear who be now coward in own esteem left house alone carefully avoiding speech with one a came out have seen laurence fitzgibbon in lobby have gone on without pausing moment so that might avoid friend when be out in palace yard where be to go next looked at watch found that be just ten did not dare to go to club be impossible for to go home to bed be very miserable nothing must comfort sympathy be there one who must listen to abuse of must then answer with kindly apology for own weakness mr bunce must do if knew how sympathy from mr bunce must hardly avail there be one person in world to whom must tell own humiliation with hope of comfort that person be lady laura kennedy sympathy from man must have be distasteful to have thought for moment of flinging at mr monk foot telling weakness must not have endured pity even from mr monk be not to be endured from man thought that lady laura kennedy must be at home probably alone knew at rate that might be allowed to knock at door even at hour have left mr kennedy in house there must probably remain for next hour there be man more constant than mr kennedy in seeing work of day of night to end so phineas walked up victoria street from thence into grosvenor place knocked at lady laura door yes lady laura be at home alone be shown up into drawing room there found lady laura waiting for husband so great debate be over said with a much of irony a knew how to throw into epithet yes be over have done leviathan of people then phineas told what be majority be there anything matter with mr finn said looking at suddenly be not well yes be very well will not sit down there be something wrong know what be have simply be greatest idiot greatest coward most awkward as that ever lived what do mean know why must come to tell of at hour at night have come might tell probably because there be one else in whole world who must not laugh at at rate will not laugh at said lady laura will despise that be sure will not do can not help despise for year have placed before ambition of speaking in house of common for year have be thinking whether there must ever come to opportunity of making heard in assembly consider to be first in world to day opportunity have be offered to though motion be nothing opportunity be great subject be one on be thoroughly prepared manner in be summoned be most flattering to be especially called on to perform task be most congenial to feeling declined because be afraid have thought too much about friend said lady laura too much too little what doe matter replied phineas in despair there be fact must not do do remember story of conachar in 'fair maid of perth how heart refused to give blood enough to fight have be suckled with milk of timid creature though must die there be none of strength of manhood in be about same thing with take think be at like conachar said lady laura be equally disgraced must perish after same fashion will apply for chiltern hundred in day two will hing of kind said lady laura getting up from chair coming towards will not leave room till have promised that will hing of kind know a yet what have occurred to night do know that modesty have kept silent be more often grace than disgrace be kind of sympathy wanted drew chair nearer to then explained to a accurately a must what have taken place in house on evening how have prepared speech how have felt that preparation be vain how perceived from course of debate that if spoke at speech must be very different from what have first intended how have declined to take upon task seemed to require so close knowledge of way of house of temper of men a defence of such man a mr monk in accusing unconsciously excused excuse in lady laura ear be more valid than accusation must give up for said yes think ought have very little doubt that be right in allowing mr bonteen to undertake such task must simply explain to mr monk that felt too keen interest in welfare to stand up a untried member in defence be not think work for man who be not at home in house be sure mr monk will feel be quite certain that mr kennedy will think that have be right care what mr kennedy may think why do say that mr finn be not courteous simply because care so much what mr kennedy wife may think opinion be in to only that know be too kind to must not be too kind to be never too kind to one be justice phineas a heard tone of voice must not feel that there be in lady laura word something of accusation against husband hate justice said phineas know that justice must condemn love friendship know nothing of justice value of love be that overlook fault forgives even crime at rate said lady laura will forgive crime of silence in house strong belief in success will not be in least affected by what tell of failure to night must await opportunity if possible must be le anxious a to own performance there be violet a lady laura spoke last word there be sound of carriage stopping in street front door be immediately opened be staying here have be dining with uncle admiral effingham then violet entered room rolled up in pretty white fur silk cloak lace shawl here be mr finn come to tell of debate about ballot care twopence about ballot said violet a put out hand to phineas be going to have new iron fleet built be question sir simeon have come out strong to night said lady laura there be political question of importance except question of iron fleet said violet be quite sure of so if mr finn can tell nothing about iron fleet will go to bed mr kennedy will tell everything when come home said phineas oh mr kennedy mr kennedy never tell one anything doubt whether mr kennedy think that woman know meaning of british constitution do know what mean violet asked lady laura to be sure do be liberty to growl about iron fleet ballot tax peer bishop anything else except house of common be british constitution good night mr finn what beautiful creature be said phineas yes indeed said lady laura full of wit grace pleasantness wonder at brother choice will be remembered that be said on day before lord chiltern have made offer for third time poor oswald doe not know a yet that be in town after phineas went not wishing to await return of mr kennedy have felt that violet effingham have come into room just in time to remedy great difficulty did not wish to speak of love to married woman to wife of man who called friend to woman who felt sure must have rebuked must hardly have restrained have not miss effingham be there a went home thought more of miss effingham than did of lady laura think that voice of miss effingham have done almost a much towards comforting a have kindness of other at rate have be comforted chapter xxi do be punctual on very morning after failure in house of common when phineas be reading in telegraph took telegraph not from choice for economy word of debate have heard in must have taken part most unwelcome visit be paid to be near eleven breakfast thing be still on table be at time on committee of house with reference to use of potted pea in army navy at have sat once at preliminary meeting in reference to have already resolved that a have failed so frightfully in debate must certainly do duty to utmost in more easy infinitely more

laurence have simply assured that must be made right in two day at furthest by end of week since time have observed that friend have be somewhat shy of speaking to when others be with phineas must not have alluded to bill have laurence be alone together have be quick enough to guess from friend manner that matter be not settled now doubt serious trouble be about to commence visitor be little man with grey hair white cravat sixty year of age dressed in black with very decent hat on entering room at once put down on nearest chair with reference to whom judge on subject must have concurred at first sight in decision pronounced by mr bunce though none judge very well used to sift cause of own conclusion must have given reason for early decision ai gentleman mr bunce have said man certainly be not gentleman old man in white cravat be very neatly dressed carried without of humility betrays one class of uncertified aspirant to gentility of assumed arrogance be at once fatal to class nevertheless mr bunce have seen at glance that be not gentleman have seen moreover that man must have come only upon one mission be right there too visitor have come about money about bill mr finn said visitor proceeding to take out of breast coat pocket rather large leathern case a advanced up towards fire name be clarkson mr finn if may venture so far will take chair certainly mr clarkson said phineas getting up pointing to seat thankye mr finn thankye will be more comfortable doing business sitting sha whereupon horrid little man drew close in to fire spreading out leathern case upon knee began to turn over one suspicious bit of paper after a though be uncertain in what part of portfolio lay identical bit be seeking seemed to be quite at home to feel that there be ground whatever for hurry in such comfortable quarter phineas hated at once with hatred altogether unconnected with difficulty friend fitzgibbon have brought upon here be said mr clarkson at last oh dear dear third of november here be in march did think be so bad a did indeed be very bad very bad for parliament gent too who must be more punctual than anybody because of privilege must now mr finn men must be

paid money be manifestly due to on bill man must of course have gone failing in phineas must not turn out there be black cloud on young member brow great anger at heart against fitzgibbon rather than against man who be sitting there before sir said be really imperative must go be pledged to appointment at house at twelve want now only quarter regret that interview with must be so unsatisfactory can only promise will see mr fitzgibbon when will call again mr finn perhaps have better write to said phineas oh dear said mr clarkson must much prefer to look in looking in be always best can get to

catholic pleaded mr clarkson be always engaged on sunday said phineas suppose say monday tuesday tuesday morning at eleven do be punctual mr finn at tuesday morning will come then doubt will find

made way down stair be now twelve phineas rushed off to cab be in such fervour of rage misery that must hardly think of position what have better do till got into committee room when there must think of nothing else intended to go deeply into question of potted pea holding equal balance between assailed government office on one hand advocate of potted pea on other potter of pea who wanted to sell article to crown declared that extensive perhaps may say unlimited use of article must save whole army navy from scourge of scurvy dyspepsia rheumatism must be best safeguard against typhus other fever must be invaluable aid in other malady to soldier sailor be peculiarly subject pea in question be grown on large scale in holstein growth have be fostered with special object of doing good to british army navy pea be so cheap that there must be great saving in money really have seemed to many that official of horse guard admiralty have be actuated by fiendish desire to deprive men of salutary fresh vegetable simply because be of foreign growth official of war office admiralty declared that potted pea in question be hardly fit for swine motion for committee have be made by gentleman of opposition phineas have be put upon a independent member have resolved to give mind a far a be concerned to reach just decision in there must be favour shown to government side new broom be proverbial for thorough work in committee work phineas be a yet new broom unfortunately on day mind be so harassed that must hardly understand what be going on did not perhaps much signify a witness examined be altogether agricultural only proved production of pea in holstein fact a to phineas have doubt proof be naturally slow a evidence be given in german have to be translated into english work of day be much impeded by certain member who unfortunately spoke german who seemed to be fond of speaking german before brother of committee who be curious a to agriculture in holstein generally chairman did not understand german there be difficulty in checking gentleman in making understand that question be not relevant to issue phineas must not keep mind during whole afternoon from subject of misfortune what must do if horrid man came to once twice week certainly did owe man money must admit that to man doubt be dishonest knave who have discounted bill probably at fifty per cent nevertheless phineas have made legally responsible for amount privilege of house prohibited from arrest thought of very often thought only made more unhappy must not be said might not be said truly that have incurred responsibility responsibility be altogether unequal to answer because be so protected did feel that certain consciousness of privilege have be present to when have put name across paper there have be dishonesty in very consciousness of what service must privilege be to if man must harass hour of life man be to be with again in day two when appointment have be proposed phineas have not dared to negative how be to escape a for paying bill with be altogether impossible man have told have believed man payment by fitzgibbon be out of question yet fitzgibbon be son of peer whereas be only son of country doctor of course fitzgibbon must make effort great effort have thing settled ala ala knew enough of world already to feel that hope be vain went down from committee room into house dined at house remained there until eight nine at night fitzgibbon did not come then went to reform club be not there at club in house many men spoke to about debate of previous night expressing surprise that have not spoken making more more wretched saw mr monk mr monk be walking arm in arm with colleague mr palliser phineas must do more than just speak to thought that mr monk nod of recognition be very cold that might be fancy certainly be fact that mr monk only nodded to must tell mr monk truth then if mr monk chose to quarrel with at rate must take step to renew friendship from reform club went to shakspeare smaller club to fitzgibbon belonged of phineas much wished to become member to knew that friend resorted when wished to enjoy thoroughly to be at ease in inn men at shakspeare must do a pleased there be politics there fashion stiffness rule so men said be hardly true everybody called everybody by christian name member smoked over house who did not belong to shakspeare thought elysium upon earth who did believed to be among pandemonium most pleasant phineas called at shakspeare be told by porter mr fitzgibbon be up stair be shown into stranger room in five minute friend came down to want to come down to reform with said phineas by jingo dear fellow be in middle of rubber of whist there have be man with about bill what clarkson yes clarkson said phineas mind said fitzgibbon be nonsense how be to help minding must mind be coming to again on tuesday morning see how can help seeing make say be not at home have made appointment have told that will never leave alone will be death of if be not settled will be settled dear fellow will see about will see about write line must excuse now because fellow be waiting will have arranged again a phineas went home thoroughly wished that have not seceded from mr low chapter xxii lady baldock at home about middle of march lady baldock came up from baddingham to london coerced into doing so a violet effingham declared in thorough opposition to own taste by known wish of friend relative friend relative so miss effingham insinuated be unanimous in wishing that lady baldock must remain at baddingham park therefore that wish having be indiscreetly expressed have put to great inconvenience have come to london in march gustavus will go mad said violet to lady laura gustavus in question be lord baldock of present generation miss effingham lady baldock being peer mother why doe not lord baldock take house asked lady laura know dear violet answered how much baddingham people think of money like being vexed driven mad even be better than keeping up two household a regarded violet injury arising from lady baldock early migration be very great for be thus compelled to move from grosvenor place to lady baldock house in berkeley square a be so fond of being in london augusta have made up mind to come up before easter lady baldock have written to will go to now violet have said to friend because have not quite made up mind a to what will do for future marry oswald be own mistress mean to be own mistress without marrying oswald though see way quite clearly a yet think will set up little house of own let world say what plea suppose must make out to be lunatic must wonder if be to try said lady laura must not prevent in other way be in dark a yet so will be obedient go to aunt miss effingham went to berkeley square phineas finn be introduced to lady baldock have be often in grosvenor place have seen violet frequently mr kennedy gave periodical dinner once week to everybody went who must get invitation phineas have be guest more than once indeed in spite of misery have taken to dining out good deal be popular a eater of dinner must talk when wanted did not talk too much be pleasant in manner appearance have already achieved certain recognised position in london life of who knew intimately not one in twenty be aware from whence came what be parentage what mean of living be member of parliament friend of mr kennedy be intimate with mr monk though irishman did not a rule herd with other irishman be right sort of person to have at house people said be cousin of lord brentford others declared that be lord chiltern earliest friend there be however with position gained even lady baldock asked to house lady baldock have evening people went to house stood about room on stair talked to other for hour went away in march day there be crowding still there be always enough of people there to show that lady baldock be successful why people must have gone to lady baldock can not explain there be house to people go without reason phineas received little card asking to go always went think like friend mr finn lady laura said to miss effingham after first of evening yes do like decidedly so do must hardly have thought that must have taken fancy to hardly know what call taking fancy said violet be not quite sure like to be told have taken fancy for young man mean offence dear of course to speak truth think have rather taken fancy to there be just enough of not too much mean materially in regard to inch a to mental belonging hate stupid man who ca talk to hate clever man who talk down like man who be too lazy to make effort to shine particularly dislike man who be always striving for effect abominate humble man yet love to perceive that man acknowledges superiority of sex youth kind of thing want to be flattered without plain flattery of course do man who must tell that be pretty unless be over seventy ought to be kicked out of room man who ca show that think so without saying word about be lout now in matter friend mr finn seems to know what be about in other word make pleasant therefore one be glad to see suppose mean to fall in love with not that know of dear when do will be sure to give notice fear that there be more of earnestness in lady laura last question than miss effingham have supposed have declared to herself over over again that have never be in love with phineas finn have acknowledged to before mr kennedy have asked hand in marriage that there have be danger that must have learned to love man if such love must not have be ruinous to that romance of such passion must have be pleasant to have gone farther than have said to herself that must have given way to romance must have be ready to accept such love if offered to have not put out of own power to marry poor man by generosity to brother then have thing aside have clearly understood thought that have clearly understood that life for must be matter of business be not case with nine out of ten among mankind with nine hundred ninety nine out of thousand life must be matter of business not of romance of course must not marry mr finn knowing a did that neither of have shilling of men in world esteemed mr kennedy most when thought be passing through mind be well aware that must ask to be wife have not resolved that must accept offer must not have gone to loughlinter having put aside romance a unfitted to life must thought do duty a mr kennedy wife must teach to love nay have taught to love be at rate so sure of own heart that must never give husband cause to rue confidence placed in yet there be something sore within when thought that phineas finn be fond of violet effingham be lady baldock second evening phineas came to house at about eleven o'clock at time have encountered second third interview with mr clarkson have already failed in obtaining word of comfort from laurence fitzgibbon about bill be clear enough now that laurence felt that be made safe by privilege that mr clarkson must be treated a treat organ grinder be nuisance must be endured nuisance be not so great what can live in comfort if only be not too sore a to annoyance dear fellow laurence have said to have have clarkson almost living in room used to drink nearly pint of sherry day for looked to be did live there at same time if wish will send in sherry be very bad phineas tried to quarrel with friend found that be difficult to quarrel with laurence fitzgibbon though on side phineas be very miserable on side have obtained great comfort mr monk be better friend than ever a to what turnbull say about in house mr monk have said laughing understand other perfectly must like to see on leg be just a well perhaps that have deferred will have real question on immediately after easter then will have plenty of opportunity phineas have explained how have attempted how have failed how have suffered mr monk have be generous in sympathy know about said have gone through more respect feel for house more satisfaction will have in addressing when have mastered difficulty first person who spoke to phineas at lady baldock be miss fitzgibbon laurence sister aspasia fitzgibbon be warm woman a regarded money a be moreover most discreet spinster be made welcome by lady baldock in spite of well known iniquity of male relative mr finn said how d 'ye do want to say word to ye just come here into corner phineas not knowing how to escape did retreat into corner with miss fitzgibbon tell now mr finn have ye be lending money to laurence have lent money said phineas much astonished by question advice to ye on other matter laurence be best creature in world be bad to lend money to ai in hobble with then well nothing to speak of what make ask then be in hobble dear dear never saw such man a laurence never good bye must do again if be be then miss fitzgibbon came out of corner made way down stair phineas immediately afterwards came across miss effingham did not know said that divine aspasia be such close ally be dearest friend in world have taken breath away now may body be told how have done that violet asked well be afraid not even though body be miss effingham be profound secret really secret concerning third person began about just a though be speaking about weather how charming do so like have heard have that mr ratler proposed to other day did at least so tell everybody said 'd take if must promise to get brother salary doubled did tell not of course believe word of suppose barrington erle made up story be going out of town next week mr finn week next to be easter week heard be going into northamptonshire from lady laura yes from lady laura intend to spend three day with lord chiltern at willingford be old promise be going to ride horse be if be able to ride take care what be about mr finn say horse be so dangerous be rather good at falling flatter know that lord chiltern ride anything can sit so long a be animal that nobody else will ride be always so with be so odd be not phineas knew of course that lord chiltern have more than once asked violet effingham to be wife believed that from intimacy with lady laura must know that knew have also heard lady laura express very strong wish that in spite of refusal violet might even yet become brother wife phineas also knew that violet effingham be becoming in own estimation most charming woman of acquaintance how be to talk to about lord chiltern be odd said phineas be excellent fellow whom father altogether misunderstands exactly just so be so glad to hear say that who have never have misfortune to have anything to do with bad set why tell lord brentford lord brentford must listen to to yes of course must for be just link be wanting be chiltern intimate friend be also friend of big wig cabinet minister lord brentford must put down at once if spoke to on subject be sure must not be too big to be put down man can really dislike to hear son well spoken of by who be well spoken of wo try mr finn phineas said that must think of that must try if fit opportunity must be found of course know how intimate have be with standish said violet that laura be to sister that oswald used to be almost brother why speak to lord brentford who be favourite there be reason mr finn besides how can girl come forward say that know disposition of man can live with lord chiltern see what be made of know thought learn what be good in also what be bad after how be girl really to know anything of man life if can do anything miss effingham will said phineas then will of be so grateful to said violet with sweetest smile phineas retreating from conversation stood for while alone thinking of have spoken thus of lord chiltern because did love because did not sweet commendation have fallen from lip upon phineas finn be compatible with anything like growing partiality for be incompatible with such feeling have most reason to be comforted to be discomfited by what have taken place seemed hardly possible to imagination that violet effingham must love nobody a yet have have fair evidence that one standing a high in world a violet effingham must fain have loved must have followed dictate of heart have trembled when have first resolved to declare passion to lady laura fearing that must scorn a being presumptuous there have be no cause for such fear a that have declared love have not thought to be presumptuous that now be age ago eight month since lady laura have become married woman since have become so warmly alive to charm of violet effingham have determined with stern propriety that passion for married woman be disgraceful such love be in sin even though be accompanied by severest forbearance most rigid propriety of conduct lady laura have done wisely to check growing feeling of partiality have admitted now that be married must be a wise a be clear to that a regarded own heart way be open to for new enterprise what if be to fail again be told by violet when declared love that have just engaged to lord chiltern what be violet talking about so eagerly said lady laura to with smile in approach to laughter almost betrayed mistress be talking about brother be going to be not yes leave london on sunday night only for day two have chance there do think what with miss effingham yes with violet sometimes think love how can say in such matter can judge better than can do one woman with reference to can draw line between love friendship certainly like chiltern oh believe love do indeed fear doe not quite understand how much there be of tenderness with assumed ferocity oswald be so strange so unwise so impolitic that though love better than world beside will not sacrifice even turn of word to win when asks to marry almost fly at throat a angry debtor who applies for instant payment tell mr finn never to give over teach that must be soft with tell also that in heart like one woman a say know woman be certain must win if must only be gentle with then again before parted lady laura told that marriage be dearest wish of heart that there must be end to gratitude if phineas must do anything to promote again made hero unhappy chapter xxiii sunday in grosvenor place mr kennedy though be most scrupulously attentive member of parliament be man very punctual to hour rule in own house liked that wife must be a punctual a lady laura who in marrying have firmly resolved that must do duty to in way even though way might sometimes be painful have be perhaps more punctilious in respect than might have be have

men disagree that many of best of men be against such occupation on sunday to abstain be to be on safe side so novel be put away sunday afternoon with long evening became rather stumbling block to lady laura two hour moreover with husband in morning became very wearisome to at first have declared that must be greatest ambition to help husband in work have read letter from macnabs macfies asking to be made gaugers landing waiter with assumed interest work palled upon very quickly quick intellect discovered soon that there be nothing in really did be form verbiage pretence at business husband

chiltern a moved away from meet to pickwell gorse if will only sit on back will carry through a safe a church phineas must not help thinking that counsel of master of groom be very different idea be continued lord chiltern that in hunting must always avoid crowd think horse be worth riding will go in crowd be just like yachting must have plenty of sea room if be to pull horse up at fence till somebody else be over think 'd better come out on donkey so went away to pickwell gorse there be over two hundred men out phineas began to think that might not be so easy to get out of crowd crowd in fast run doubt quickly becomes small by degree beautifully le be very difficult especially for stranger to free from rush at first start lord chiltern horse plunged about so violently a stood on little hill side looking down upon cover that be obliged to take to distance phineas followed if break down wind said lord chiltern ca be better than be here if go up wind must turn before long will be all right a spoke old hound opened true sharp old hound whom pack believed in moment there be doubt that fox have be found there be not above eight nine acre in said lord chiltern ca hang long did ever see such uneasy brute a in life feel certain will go well when get away phineas be too much occupied with own horse to think much of on lord chiltern be mounted bonebreaker very moment that heard old hound note stretched out head put mouth upon bit began to tremble in muscle be great deal more anxious for than be said lord chiltern see have given that gag ride on till want give lot of room will go in snaffle caution made phineas think that insurance office must charge very dear on life at present moment fox took two ring of gorse then went up wind be not vixen will swear said lord chiltern vixen in cub never went away like yet now then finn boy keep to right lord chiltern with horse out of lincolnshire went away across brow of hill leaving hound to left selected a point of exit into next field stiff rail have there be accident must have put very wide margin of ground between rider horse go hard at fence then will fall clear have said to phineas think however that must have ridden at rail a did that there be help for brute began in own way carried on after in same fashion through said afterwards phineas took fence little lower down what be at rode never knew bonebreaker sailed over whatever be soon found by friend side ruck of men be lower down than two hero there be others far away to left others again who have be at end of gorse be now behind friend be not near hound not within two field of hound be below therefore must be seen be in hurry will be round upon lord chiltern said how deuce be one to help being in hurry said phineas who be doing very best to ride bonebreaker with snaffle have already began to feel that bonebreaker cared nothing for weak instrument by george must like to change with said lord chiltern lincolnshire horse be going along with head very low boring a galloped throwing neck up at fence just when ought to have kept steady after though phineas kept near lord chiltern throughout run be not again near enough to exchange word indeed have little breath for such purpose lord chiltern rode still little in advance phineas knowing friend partiality for solitude when taking fence kept little to left began to find bonebreaker knew pretty well what be about a for not using gag rein be impossible when horse put out what strength have against man arm man must put out what strength have against horse mouth bonebreaker be cunning have have gag rein on before contracted lip here bent out jaw there till have settled to mind then went away after own fashion seemed to have passion for smashing through big high grown ox fence by degree rider came to feel that if there be nothing worse coming fun be not bad fox ran up wind for couple of mile so a lord chiltern have prophesied then turned not to right a must best have served phineas to left so that be forced to make way through ruck of horse before must place again phineas found crossing road in out of before knew where be for while lost sight of lord chiltern in truth be leading now whereas lord chiltern have led before two horse having be together morning on previous day be willing enough to remain in company if be allowed to do so crossed road not very far from other going in out amidst crowd of horse before long be again placed well now having hunt on right whereas hitherto have be on left went over large pasture field phineas began to think that a long a bonebreaker must be able to go through thick grown up hedge must be right now again came to cut fence fence have be cut laid be not so pleasant force be not sufficient for admitted of mistake horse though must rush at unpleasantly took when came without touching might be right yet unless beast must tire with then phineas thought misfortune might probably occur remembered a flew over one such impediment that rode stone heavier than friend at end of forty five minute bonebreaker also might become aware of fact hound be running well in sight to right phineas began to feel of pride man indulges when becomes aware that have taken place comfortably have left squad behind be going well there be men nearer hound than be be near enough even for ambition there have already be enough of run to make sure that must be good thing enough to make aware also probably might be too good when run be over men be very apt to regret termination who minute two before be anxiously longing that hound might pull down game to finish well be everything in hunting to have led for over hour be nothing let pace country have be what might if fall away during last half mile therefore be that behind hope that fox may make that cover while forward men long to see turned over in field to ride to hound be very glorious to have ridden to hound be more glorious still have now crossed road larger one have got into somewhat closer country field be not so big fence be not so high phineas got moment to look about saw lord chiltern riding without cap be very red in face eye seemed to glare be tugging at horse with might animal seemed still to go with perfect command of strength phineas have too much work on own hand to think of offering quixotic assistance to one else saw one farmer a thought speak to lord chiltern a rode close together chiltern only shook head pulled at horse there be brook in part river eye form thereabouts of tributary do so tributary though small a river be considerable to men on one side who be called by exigency of occasion to place quickly on other phineas knew nothing of brook bonebreaker have gone gallantly over two now that there came third in way

stone phineas a soon a be safe looked back there be lord chiltern horse in very act of spring higher up rivulet where be even broader at distance phineas must see that lord chiltern be wild with rage against beast whether wished to take leap wished to avoid there be choice left to animal rushed at brook in moment horse horseman be lost to sight be well then that extra stone must tell a enabled phineas to arrest horse to come back to friend lincolnshire horse have chested further bank of course have fallen back into stream when phineas got down found that lord chiltern be wedged in between horse bank be better at rate than being under horse in water right old fellow said with smile when saw phineas go on be too good to lose be very pale seemed to be quite helpless where lay horse did

westminster hall on thursday have be requested by home secretary to put aside intention have complied with request made to mr mildmay be to move second reading of reform bill on day preliminary step having be taken without special notice bill of course included clause in favour of ballot petition be consequence of omission mr turnbull have predicted evil consequence in house out of be now doing best in power to bring about verification of own prophecy phineas who reached lodging late on thursday found that town have be in state of ferment for three day on wednesday forty fifty thousand person have be collected at primrose hill that police have be forced to interfere worse be expected on friday though mr turnbull have yielded to government a to receiving petition crowd be resolved that must see petition carried into house be argued that government must have done better to have refrained from interfering a to previously intended arrangement must have be easier to deal with procession than with mob of men gathered together without semblance of form mr mildmay have be asked to postpone second reading of bill request have come from opponent must not yield to said that must be bad expedient to close parliament from fear of people phineas found at reform club on thursday evening that member of house of common be requested to enter on friday by door usually used by peer to make way thence to own house found that landlord mr bunce have be out with people during entire three day mr bunce with flood of tear begged phineas to interfere a to friday be that headstrong that

unless be provoked to do provoked must anything provoke to make brute of be glad that be in danger if hear of let know how go on lady laura be of course full of concern wanted to go down to said mr kennedy thought that there be occasion be there mean in regard to danger be very solitary there must go to again mr kennedy will not let go unless can say that there be danger seems to think that

danger none if may believe doctor hunting be done for year will be very desolate will go down again to in few day try to bring up to town do do if be laid up in father house father must see phineas have not looked at matter in light thought that miss effingham might probably be right early on next morning saw mr bunce used eloquence to keep respectable member of society at home in vain what good do expect to do mr bunce said with perhaps little tone of authority in voice to carry point said bunce what be point present point be ballot a part of government measure expect to carry that by going out into street with rough of london putting in direct opposition to authority of magistrate do really believe that ballot will become law of land sooner because incur danger inconvenience look here mr finn believe sea will become fuller because piddle run into out of dorsetshire field do believe that water from country be what make ocean will help be duty to help be duty a respectable citizen with wife family to stay at home if everybody with wife family be to say so there 'd be none there rough then where must be what must government people say to then if man with wife family be to show in street to night must have ballot before parliament break up if none of do will never have ballot ai that so phineas who intended to be honest be not prepared to dispute assertion on spur of moment if be so said bunce triumphantly man duty clear enough ought to go though 'd two wife family went petition be to be presented at six o'clock crowd who collected to see carried into westminster hall began to form by noon be said afterwards that many of house in neighbourhood of palace yard bridge be filled with soldier if so men did not show in course of evening three four company of guard in st james park did show have rough work to do for many of people took away from westminster by route police who be very numerous in palace yard have hard time of afternoon be said afterwards that must have be much better to have allowed petition to have be brought up by procession on wednesday procession let be who will proceeds have in of own nature something of order now there be order petition be said to fill fifteen cab though absolute sheet of signature be carried into house by four men be being dragged about day certainly must have be impossible for member to have made way into house through westminster hall between hour of four six to effect entrance at be obliged to go round at back of abbey a space round st margaret church canning monument be filled with crowd parliament street be quite impassable at five o clock there be traffic across bridge from hour till after eight a evening went on mob extended to downing street front of treasury chamber before night be over hoarding round new government office have be pulled down window also of certain obnoxious member of parliament be broken when obnoxious member lived within reach one gentleman who unfortunately held house in richmond terrace who be said to have said that ballot be resort of coward fared very badly for window be not only broken furniture mirror be destroyed by stone be thrown mr mildmay say be much blamed after may be doubt whether procession on wednesday might not have ended worse mr turnbull be heard to say afterwards that number of people collected must have be much greater mr mildmay moved second reading of bill made speech made speech with knowledge that house of parliament be surrounded by mob think that fact added to efficacy certainly gave appropriate opportunity for display be not difficult voice faltered on two three occasion faltered through real feeling sort of feeling though be real be at command of orator on certain occasion doe yeoman service mr mildmay be old man nearly worn out in service of country who be known to have be true honest to have loved country well though there be of course who declared that hand have be too weak for power that service have be naught on evening virtue be remembered once when voice failed whole house got up cheered nature of whig prime minister speech on occasion will be understood by most of reader without further indication bill have be read before be understood that objection must be made to extent of change provided in by liberal side of house opposition coming from liberal member be to be confined to subject of ballot even a yet be not known whether mr turnbull follower must vote against second reading whether must take what be given declare intention of obtaining remainder on separate motion opposition of large party of conservative be matter of certainty to party mr mildmay did not conceive bound to offer so large amount of argument a must have given have there be at moment crowd in palace yard probably felt that crowd must assist with old tory enemy when in last word of speech declared that under circumstance must disfigure close of political career by voting for ballot not though people on whose behalf have be fighting battle life must be there in number to coerce there came round of applause from opposition bench mr daubeny began to fear that young horse in team might get loose from trace with great dignity mr daubeny have kept aloof from mr turnbull from mr turnbull tactic be not le alive to fact that mr turnbull with mob big petition might be of considerable assistance to in present duel between mr mildmay think mr daubeny be in habit of looking at contest a duel between leader on other side of house in assistance from quarter might be accepted if offered mr mildmay speech did not occupy much over hour at half past seven mr turnbull got up to reply be presumed that must do so not member left place though time of day be interesting time though mr turnbull be accustomed to be long there soon came to be little ground for doubting what must be nature of mr turnbull vote on second reading how may dare said to accept so small measure of reform a with message from country a be now conveyed to through presence of fifty thousand of countryman who be at moment demanding measure of reform just beyond frail wall of chamber right honourable gentleman have told that will never be intimidated by concourse of people know that there be need that must speak of intimidation one have accused right honourable gentleman of political cowardice a have so said will follow in footstep will be intimidated by large majority house presented other night against wish of people will support great measure of reform doe not include ballot among clause so mr turnbull threw down gauntlet mr turnbull spoke for two hour then debate be adjourned till monday adjournment be moved by independent member who a be known must support government at once received mr turnbull assent there be great hurry with bill be felt that must be well to let ferment subside enough have be done for glory when mr mildmay moved second reading quite enough in way of debate with such audience almost within hearing when mr turnbull speech have be made then house emptied at once elderly cautious member made exit through peer door younger men got out into crowd through westminster hall be pushed about among rough for hour so phineas who made way through hall with laurence fitzgibbon found turnbull carriage waiting at entrance with dozen policeman round hope wo get home to dinner before midnight said phineas understands about said laurence have good meal at three before left home 'd find sandwich sherry in plenty if be to search carriage know how to remedy cost of mob popularity at time poor bunce be being hustled about in crowd in vicinity of mr turnbull carriage phineas fitzgibbon made way out by degree worked passage for into parliament street mr turnbull have be somewhat behind in coming down hall have not be without sense of enjoyment in ovation be being given to there can be doubt that be wrong in what be doing that affair of carriage be altogether wrong did mr turnbull much harm for many day afterwards when got outside door where be twelve policeman guarding carriage great number of admirer endeavoured to shake hand with among be devoted bunce policeman seemed to think that mr turnbull be to be guarded even from affection of friend be a careful that must be ushered into carriage untouched a though have be favourite object of political aversion for moment mr turnbull when began to perceive that men be crowding close upon gate to hear noise to feel a be breath of mob stepped on quickly into carriage said word two in loud voice thank friend trust may obtain just demand did not pause to speak indeed must hardly have done so a policeman be manifestly in hurry carriage be got away at snail pace there remained in spot where carriage have stood making of very pretty street row bunce have striven hard to shake hand with hero bunce other reformer a ardent a decent a police be very determinate that there must be such interruption to programme for getting mr turnbull off scene mr bunce who have own idea a to right to shake hand with gentleman at westminster hall who might choose to shake hand with became uneasy under impediment be placed in way expressed warmly a to civil right now london policeman in political row be believe most forbearing of men so long a meet with special political opposition ordinary ill usage doe not even put out of temper be paid for rough work among rough take rub gallantly feel to be instrument for moment of despotic power a opposed to civil right wo stand what call jaw trip up policeman in such scramble will take in good spirit mention word habeas corpus will lock up if can a rule instinct be right for man who talk about habeas corpus in political crowd will generally do more harm than can be effected by tripping up of constable instinct may be mean of individual injustice think be so when mr bunce be arrested kept fast prisoner wife have shown knowledge of character when declared that 'd be took if one be took bunce be taken into custody with three four others like decent men who meant harm who thought that a men be bound to show political opinion perhaps at expense of little martyrdom be carried into temporary stronghold have be provided for necessity of police under clock tower keep at peril said bunce indignantly mean said sergeant who have in custody have done have'porth to break law said bunce be breaking law when be upsetting men a saw said sergeant have upset nobody said bunce very well rejoined sergeant can say before magistrate to morrow be to be locked up night said bunce be afraid will replied sergeant bunce who be not by nature very talkative man said more swore in heart that there must be vengeance between eleven twelve be taken to regular police station from thence be enabled to send word to wife bunce have be taken said with something of tragic queen something also of injured wife in tone of voice a soon a phineas let in with latchkey between twelve one then mingled with at last dominant over severer tone came voice of loving woman whose beloved one be in trouble knew how 'd be mr finn did what must do suppose 'd have bit to eat from moment went out a for drop of beer never think of except what put down for at meal nasty police always take best be why be so afeard phineas said that must to comfort promised to go to police office early in morning look after bunce no serious evil must thought probably come of still bunce have be wrong to go might have be took argued mr bunce just a well a then phineas explained that have gone forth in execution of public duty might have be took same said mr bunce for be sure bunce did hing amiss chapter xxvi first speech on following morning be saturday phineas be early at police office at westminster looking after interest of landlord there have be considerable number of men taken up during row friend must hardly procure attention for mr bunce case to thought decency of client own position a member of

determined to speak to speak on evening if must catch speaker eye again scene before be going round before again thing became dim again felt blood beating hard at heart thing be not so bad with a have be before because have nothing to remember hardly knew indeed what intended to say have idea that be desirous of joining in earnest support of measure with vehement protest against injustice have be done to people in general to mr bunce in particular have firmly resolved that fear of losing favour with government must induce to hold tongue a to buncean cruelty sooner than do so must certainly go among at banner office started up wildly when mr palliser have completed speech speaker eye not unnaturally have travelled to other side of house there be tory of old school upon leg mr western member for east barsetshire one of gallant few who dared to vote against sir robert peel bill for repealing corn law in mr western spoke with slow ponderous unimpressive very audible voice for twenty minute disdaining to make reference to mr turnbull politics pleading against reform with old argument phineas did not hear word that said did not attempt to hear be keen in resolution to make attempt at speaker eye at present moment be thinking of of only did not even give moment reflection a to what own speech must be must dash at take chance resolved at least must not fail in courage twice be on leg before mr western have finished slow harangue twice be compelled to reseat thinking that have subjected to ridicule at last member for east barset sat down phineas be conscious that have lost moment two in presenting again to speaker held ground however though saw that have various rival for right of speech held ground be instantly aware that have gained point there be slight pause a other urgent member did not reseat phineas heard president of august assembly call upon to address house thing be now to be done there be with house of common at foot crowded house bound to be auditor a long a must think fit to address reporter by ten twenty in gallery ready eager to let country know what young member for loughshane must say in maiden speech phineas finn have sundry gift powerful pleasant voice have learned to modulate handsome presence certain natural mixture of modesty self reliance must certainly protect from fault of arrogance pomposity perhaps might carry through peril of new position have also great advantage of friend in house who be anxious that must do well have not that gift of slow blood on former occasion must have enabled to remember prepared speech must now have placed own resource within own reach began with expression of opinion true reformer ought to accept mr mildmay bill even if be accepted only a instalment before have got through sentence became painfully conscious that be repeating own word be cheered almost from outset yet knew a went on that be failing have certain argument at finger end point with be in truth so familiar that need hardly have troubled to arrange for special use forgot even found that be going on with one platitude after a to benefit of reform in manner must have shamed six seven year ago at debating club pressed on fearing that word must fail altogether if paused did in truth speak very much too fast knocking word together so that reporter must properly catch have nothing to say for bill except what hundred have said before hundred must say again still be cheered still went on a became more more conscious of failure there grew upon idea dangerous hope that might still save from ignominy by eloquence of invective against police tried succeeded thoroughly in making house understand that be very angry succeeded in nothing else must not catch word to express thought of mind must not explain idea that people out of house have a much right to express opinion in favour of ballot a member in house have to express against that animosity have be shown to people by authority because have so expressed opinion then attempted to tell story of mr bunce in light airy way failed sat down in middle of again be cheered by around cheered a new member be usually cheered in midst of cheer must have blown out brain have there be pistol there ready for such operation that hour with be very bad did not know how to get up go away how to keep place for time sat with hat off forgetful of privilege of wearing then put on hurriedly a though fact of not wearing must have be observed by everybody at last at about two debate be adjourned then a be slowly leaving house thinking how might creep away without companionship mr monk took by arm be going to walk said mr monk yes said phineas will walk then may go together a far a pall mall come along phineas have mean of escape left house hanging on mr monk arm without word did mr monk speak till be out in palace yard be not much amiss said mr monk will do better than yet mr monk said phineas have made as of so thoroughly that there will at rate be good result that will never make as of myself again after same fashion ah thought have such feeling a therefore be determined to speak to may be sure finn care to flatter think ought to know that a far a be able will tell truth speech be certainly nothing great be about on par with other maiden speech in house of common have done neither good harm be desirable that must advice to now be never to avoid speaking on subject that interest never to speak for above three minute till find a much at home on leg a be when sitting suppose that have made as of yourself be in special degree now good night

attempted to argue with editor on merit of ballot editor put down very shortly go in for mr finn said if mr finn must go in for too editor seemed to think that mr finn might make very useful at banner

old premier in midst of there be mr gresham foreign minister said to be greatest orator in europe on whose shoulder be thought that mantle of mr mildmay must fall to be worn however quite otherwise than mr mildmay have worn for mr gresham be man with feeling for past void of historical association hardly with memory living altogether for future be anxious to fashion anew out of vigour of own brain whereas with mr mildmay even love of reform be inherited passion for old world liberalism there be with mr legge wilson brother of peer secretary at war great scholar polished gentleman very proud of position a cabinet minister conscious that have hardly earned by political work lord plinlimmon be with comptroller of india of working lord most jaunty most pleasant most popular very good at taking chair at dinner making becoming speech at shortest notice man apparently very free open in way of life cautious enough in truth a to step knowing well how hard be to climb how easy to fall mr mildmay entered room leaning on lord plinlimmon arm when made way up among armchair upon rug before fire others clustered around with cheering look kindly question then came privy seal old friend lord brentford last must say least that word of councillor must go for le in such assemblage than will of sir marmaduke morecombe chancellor of duchy of lancaster mr mildmay be soon seated in one of armchair while lord plinlimmon leaned against table close at elbow mr gresham stood upright at corner of chimney piece furthest from mr mildmay mr palliser at nearest to duke took armchair close at mr

one armchair be thus left vacant there be other comer be not so bad a thought must be said duke speaking aloud nevertheless addressing specially to chief be bad enough said mr mildmay laughing bad enough indeed said sir marmaduke morecombe without laughter good bill lost said lord plinlimmon worst of failure be that same identical bill can never be brought in again so that if lost bill be best bill will not be lost can only be second best said lord chancellor certainly did think that after debate before easter must not have come to shipwreck about ballot said mr mildmay be brewing for along said mr gresham who then with gesture of hand pressure of lip withheld word be nearly uttering must not probably have be complimentary to mr turnbull a be turned half round said something to lord cantrip be not audible to one else in room be worthy of note however that mr turnbull name be not once mentioned aloud at meeting be afraid be brewing all along said sir marmaduke morecombe gravely well gentleman must take a get said mr mildmay still smiling now must consider what will do at once then paused a though expecting counsel must come to first from one colleague then from such counsel came probably mr mildmay did not in least expect that must come can not stay where be of course said duke duke be privileged to say a much a though man in room knew that must be so one duke must have said before mr mildmay have spoken plainly said mr mildmay suppose that can hardly stay where be probably none of wish gentleman then looked round upon colleague there came sort of assent though there be spoken word sound from sir marmaduke morecombe be louder than from others yet from be no more than attesting grunt have two thing to consider continued mr mildmay though spoke in very low voice word be heard by present two thing chiefly be work of country queen comfort propose to see majesty afternoon at five be in something le than two hour time hope to be able to tell house by seven have taken place between majesty friend grace will do a much in house of lord if agree with gentleman will explain to queen that be not for welfare of country that must retain place will place resignation own in majesty hand will advise majesty to send for lord de terrier said mr gresham certainly there will be other course open to to said mr gresham to remark from rising minister of day word of reply be made of present in room three four of most experienced servant of crown felt that mr gresham have be imprudent duke who have ever be afraid of mr gresham told mr palliser afterwards observation must not have be made sir harry coldfoot pondered upon uneasily sir marmaduke morecombe asked mr mildmay what thought about time change so much with time feeling of men said mr mildmay doubt whether sir marmaduke quite understood there be silence in room for moment two after mr gresham have spoken then mr mildmay again addressed friend of course may be possible that lord de terrier may foresee difficulty may find difficulty will oblige either at once after attempt have be made to decline task majesty will probably commit to of doubt know that arrangement of government be not most easy task in world that be not made more easy by absence of majority in house of common must dissolve presume said duke must say so continued mr mildmay may not improbably come to pas that majesty will feel obliged to send again for one two of that may tender to majesty advice owe to for for instance for friend duke in such matter must be much guided probably by what lord de terrier might have suggested to must be so must be consulted present feeling be that must resume office so that necessary business of session must be completed that must then dissolve parliament thus ascertain opinion of country in such case however must of course meet again quite think that course proposed by mr mildmay will be best said duke who have doubt already discussed matter with friend prime minister in private one else said word either of argument disagreement cabinet council be broken up old messenger who have be asleep in chair stood up bowed a minister walked by then went in rearranged chair have a much idea of giving up a have said lord cantrip to friend mr gresham a walked arm in arm together from treasury chamber across st james park towards club be not sure that be not right said mr gresham do mean for for country asked lord cantrip for future fame who have abdicated have clung to abdication have always lost by cincinnatus be brought back again charles v be felt to have be foolish peach of retired minister of hear so often have generally be cultivated in constrained seclusion at least world so belief be talking probably of mr mildmay a to whom of colleague have thought probable knowing that must now resign that must have to day declared intention of laying aside for ever care of office mr monk walked home alone a went there be something of feeling of disappointment at heart made ask whether mr turnbull might not have be right in rebuking for joining government think be in way due to mr mildmay resignation rather to conviction on mr monk part that that have contributed little to country welfare by sitting in mr mildmay cabinet chapter xxx mr kennedy luck after holding of cabinet council of author have dared to attempt slight sketch in last chapter there be various visit made to queen first by mr mildmay then by lord de terrier afterwards by mr mildmay duke together then again by lord de terrier there be various explanation made to parliament in house rival be very

held seat did so a be only upon further trial mr mildmay took course have indicated to colleague at cabinet meeting before explanation journeying be completed april be over much needed whitsuntide holiday be coming on little of routine work of session have be done a mr mildmay told house more than once country must suffer be queen to dissolve parliament at period of year old minister must go on with business of country lord de terrier with follower having declined to take affair into hand at close of session must be made a short a possible writ must be issued for new election be mr mildmay programme be one of one dared to complain very loudly mr turnbull indeed did speak word of caution told mr mildmay that have lost bill good in other respect because have refused to introduce ballot into measure let promise to be wiser for future to obey manifested wish of country then must be well with in answer to mr mildmay declared that to best of power of reading country countryman have manifested such wish that if did so if by fresh election must be shown that ballot be in truth desired must at once leave execution of wish to abler younger hand mr turnbull expressed perfectly satisfied with minister answer said that coming election must show whether mr mildmay be right many men among of colleague thought that mr mildmay have be imprudent man ought ever to pledge to anything said sir harry coldfoot to duke be to anything unnecessary duke who be very true to mr mildmay made reply to even thought that old friend have be betrayed into promise too rapidly pledge be given people already began to make much of there appeared leader after leader in people banner urging constituency to take advantage of prime minister word to show clearly at hustings that desired

suffer materially by absence may take for granted that with man so sedulous a to duty there be arrear of work when accident took place put out hand to phineas said word in whisper word two among phineas caught sound of potted pea then continued to look out of window there be men who be utterly prostrated by bodily ailment seemed that mr kennedy be one of phineas who be full of own bad news have intended to tell sad story at once perceived that neck of chancellor of duchy be too stiff to allow of taking interest in external matter so refrained what doe doctor say about said phineas perceiving just for present there must be only one possible subject for remark mr kennedy be beginning to describe in long whisper what doctor did think about when lady laura came into room of course began at first to talk about mr kennedy must not have be kind to not to have done so lady laura made much of injury a behoves wife to do in such circumstance for sake of sufferer of hero declared conviction have phineas be moment later husband neck must have be irredeemably broken think ever do kill people said phineas at rate mean to do so thought did said lady laura fancy not said phineas eager in cause of truth think man be very clumsy whispered mr kennedy perhaps be beginner said phineas may make difference if so be afraid have interfered with education then by degree conversation got away to other thing lady laura asked after loughshane have made up mind to give up said smiling a spoke be afraid there be bad chance said lady laura smiling also father have behaved so well said phineas have written to say will find money if determine to contest borough mean to write to by to night post to decline offer have right to spend money must succeed if did spend of course make little down in mouth then smiled again have got plan of own said lady laura what plan rather be mine papa old mr standish be going to give up loughton papa want to come try luck there lady laura be quite certainty know suppose be a near certainty a anything left came from strong radical reformer lady laura must accept such favour from father then mr kennedy nodded head very slightly whispered yes yes must think of said phineas finn have right to favour be matter entirely for papa consideration said lady laura with affectation of solemnity in voice think have always be felt that politician may accept offer a when be made to that politician must ask for father feel that have to do best can with influence in borough therefore come to be said phineas somewhat rudely of course private feeling have weight said lady laura be not probable that papa must have gone to perfect stranger perhaps mr finn may own mr kennedy must be very sorry that must not be in house that feeling on part have have weight with father of course will stand whispered mr kennedy still looking straight out of window a though slightest attempt to turn neck must be fraught with danger to duchy papa have desired to ask to call upon said lady laura suppose there be very much to be said a of know so well other way of thinking have better see to day to morrow of course phineas be persuaded before left mr kennedy room indeed when came to think of there appeared to to be valid reason why must not sit for loughton favour be of kind have prevailed from time out of mind in england between most respectable of great land magnate young rising liberal politician burke fox canning have be placed in parliament by similar influence of course phineas finn desired earnestly longed in very heart of heart to extinguish such parliamentary influence to root out for ever last vestige of close borough nomination while thing remained be better that thing must contribute to liberal than to conservative strength of house if to liberal how be to be achieved by acceptance of such influence by liberal candidate if be right that must be accepted by liberal candidate then why not by logic of argument seemed to to be perfect felt something like sting of reproach a told that in truth great offer be made to not on account of excellence of politics because have be instrumental in saving lord brentford son in law from violence of garrotter crushed qualm of conscience a being over scrupulous a told not practical must take world a find with struggle to be something more honest than around phineas a preached to sermon declared to that who attempted more than flew too high in cloud to be of service to men woman upon earth a did not see lord brentford day postponed writing to father for twenty four hour on following morning found earl at home in portman square having first discussed matter fully with lord chiltern scruple about said lord chiltern be quite welcome to borough for if did not stand must do so there be so many reason ought to induce to accept seat in parliament whether be true not phineas will not accept father interest at loughton unless be offered to in way in never will be offered know well enough to be sure that will not change mind will therefore may go down to loughton with pure conscience a far a be concerned phineas have interview with earl in ten minute everything be settled on way to portman square there have come across mind idea of grand effort of friendship what if must persuade father so to conduct towards son that son must consent to be member for borough did say word two to effect setting forth that lord chiltern must condescend to become legislator if only father must condescend to acknowledge son fitness for such work without comment on son past life earl simply waived subject away with hand must be a obstinate a son lady laura have be mercury between on subject lady laura have failed must not now consent to employ mercury very little hardly word indeed be said between earl phineas about politics phineas be to be saulsby candidate at loughton for next election be to come to saulsby with kennedy from loughlinter with kennedy somewhat in advance of say that there will be opposition said earl expect none be very courteous nay be kind feeling doubtless that family owed great debt of gratitude to young man with whom be conversing nevertheless there be not absent on part touch of high condescension perhaps might be thought to become earl cabinet minister great borough patron phineas who be sensitive felt winced have never quite liked lord brentford must not bring to do so now in spite of kindness earl be showing be very happy when sat down to write to father from club father have told that money must be forthcoming for election at loughshane if resolved to stand that chance of success must be very slight indeed that in opinion there must be chance of success nevertheless father have evidently believed when writing that phineas must not abandon seat without useless expensive contest now thanked father with many expression of gratitude declared conviction that father be right about lord tulla then in most modest language that must use went on to say that have found borough open to in england be going to stand for loughton with assistance of lord brentford thought that election must probably not cost above couple of hundred pound at outside then wrote very pretty note to lord tulla thanking for former kindness telling irish earl that be not intention to interfere with borough of loughshane at next election few day after phineas be very much surprised at visit be made to at lodging mr clarkson after scene in lobby of house called again in great marlborough street be admitted have better let sit in armchair for hour so fitzgibbon have said phineas almost believed that must be better man be terrible nuisance to be beginning to think that have better undertake to pay debt by degree be knew quite on card mr clarkson must have arrested while at saulsby since scene in lobby mr clarkson have be with twice there have be preliminary conversation a to real payment mr clarkson wanted hundred pound down bill for two hundred twenty at three month date think of time trouble in coming here mr clarkson have urged when phineas have objected to term think of time trouble do be punctual mr finn phineas have offered ten pound quarter payment to be marked on back of bill tender mr clarkson have not seemed to regard a strong evidence of punctuality have not be angry have simply expressed intention of calling again giving phineas to understand business must probably take to west of ireland in autumn if only business might not take down to loughlinter to saulsby strange visitor who came to phineas in midst of trouble put end to strange visitor be miss aspasia fitzgibbon will be very much surprised at coming to chamber doubt said a sat down in chair phineas placed for phineas must only say that be very proud to be so highly honoured that hoped be well pretty well thank have just come about little business mr finn hope will excuse be quite sure that there be need for excuse said phineas laurence when hears about will say that have be impertinent old fool never care what laurence say way that have be to mr clarkson mr finn have paid money said phineas have mr finn happened to hear what occurred night at door of house of common who told miss fitzgibbon never mind who told heard knew before that have be foolish enough to help laurence about money so put two two together be first time have have to do with mr clarkson so sent to have bought bill there be miss fitzgibbon produced document bore name of phineas finn across front of did pay two hundred fifty pound for not quite have very hard tussle got at last for two hundred twenty pound did do if have employed lawyer must have have to pay two hundred forty pound five pound for cost now mr finn hope wo have more money engagement with brother laurence phineas said that thought might promise that must have more because if do sha interfere if laurence began to find that must get money out of in way there must be end to mr clarkson must very soon be spending spare time in drawing room good bye mr finn if laurence say anything just tell that 'd better come to then phineas be left looking at bill be certainly great relief to that must be thus secured from domiciliary visit of mr clarkson great relief to to be assured that mr clarkson must not find out down at loughton nevertheless have to suffer pang of shame a felt that miss fitzgibbon have become acquainted with poverty have found herself obliged to satisfy pecuniary liability chapter xxxii lady laura kennedy headache phineas went down to loughlinter early in july taking loughton in way stayed there one night at inn be introduced to sundry influential inhabitant of borough by mr grating ironmonger who be known by who knew loughton to be very strong supporter of earl interest mr grating about dozen others of tradesman of town came to inn met phineas in parlour told be good sound liberal supporter of mr mildmay government of neighbour earl be so conspicuous ornament be almost be said about earl out loud individual man of loughton then present took opportunity during meeting of whispering into mr finn ear word two to show that also be admitted to secret council of borough that too must see inside of arrangement of course must support earl one said never mind what hear about tory candidate mr finn whispered second earl can do what plea here seemed to phineas that be thought by to be rather fine thing to be thus held in hand by english nobleman phineas must not reflect much upon a lay in bed at loughton inn great political question on political world be engrossed up in london be enfranchisement of englishman of englishman down to rank of artisan labourer yet when found in contact with individual englishman with men even very much above artisan labourer found that rather liked being bound hand foot being kept a tool in political pocket of rich man one of loughton tradesman be proud of own personal subjection to earl from loughton went to loughlinter having promised to be back in borough for election mr grating must propose be to be seconded by mr shortribs butcher grazier mention have be made of conservative candidate mr shortribs have seemed to think that good stand up fight upon english principle with clear understanding of course that victory must prevail on liberal side must be good thing for borough earl man of business saw phineas on morning of departure told not to regard mr shortribs 'd like said man of business daresay will have enough of when reform bill be passed at present one will be fool enough to come spend money here have in hand too well for mr finn found great house at loughlinter nearly empty mr kennedy mother be there lord brentford be there lord brentford private secretary mr kennedy private secretary at present be entire party lady baldock be expected there with daughter violet effingham a well a phineas must learn must not be at loughlinter until after have left there have come up lately rumour that there must be autumn session that house must sit through october part of november in order that mr mildmay might try feeling of new parliament if be to be so phineas have resolved that in event of election at loughton must not return to ireland till after autumn session must be over gave account to earl in presence of earl son in law of what have taken place at loughton earl expressed a satisfied be manifestly great satisfaction to lord brentford that must still have borough in pocket more so because there be so very few nobleman left who have such property belonging to be very careful in speech never saying in so many word that privilege of returning member be own meaning be not le clear be dreary day at loughlinter there be fishing if phineas chose to fish be told that must shoot deer if be minded to go out alone seemed a though be intention of host that guest must spend time profitably mr kennedy be shut up with book paper morning always took up book after dinner earl also must read little then must sleep good deal old mr kennedy slept also lady laura looked a though must like to sleep if be not that husband eye be upon a be administered tea mr kennedy not liking practice of having handed round by servant when none be there member of family circle read novel phineas got hold of stiff bit of reading for tried to utilise time took alison in hand worked way gallantly through couple of volume even more than once twice found on very verge of slumber then must wake up try to think about thing why be phineas finn irishman from killaloe living in great house of loughlinter a though be one of family striving to kill hour feeling that be in way subject to dominion of host must not be better for to get up go away in heart of heart did not like mr kennedy though believed to be good man of what service to be to like lady laura now that lady laura be possession in hand of mr kennedy then must tell that owed position in world entirely to lady laura that be ungrateful to feel ever dull in society moreover there be something to be done in world beyond making love being merry mr kennedy must occupy with blue book for hour together without wincing so phineas went to work again with alison read away till nodded in day often wandered up down linter across moor to linn so down to lake must take book with must seat down on spot loved must pretend to read think that got much advantage from book be thinking of life trying to calculate whether wonderful success have achieved must ever be of permanent value to must be nearer to earning bread when must be member for loughton than have be when be member for loughshane be there before slightest probability that must ever earn bread then thought of violet effingham be angry with for remembering at moment violet effingham be mistress of large fortune once before when be sitting beside linter have made up mind to declare passion to lady laura have done so on very spot now within twelvemonth of time made up mind on same spot to declare passion to miss effingham thought best mode of carrying suit must be to secure assistance of lady laura lady laura doubt have be very anxious that brother must marry violet lord chiltern a phineas knew have asked for violet hand twice in vain moreover chiltern have declared to phineas that must never ask for again lady laura who be always reasonable must surely perceive that there be hope of success for brother that chiltern must quarrel with must quarrel with to knife did not doubt felt that fear of quarrel a must deter loved violet effingham must indeed be pusillanimous if loving a did be deterred from expressing love from fear of suitor whom did not favour must not willingly be untrue to friendship for lady laura brother have there be chance for lord chiltern must have abstained from putting forward what be use of abstaining when by doing so must in wise benefit friend when result of doing so must be that interloper must come in carry off prize must explain to lady laura if prize must be kind to must disregard anger of lord chiltern even though might be anger to knife a be thinking of lady laura stood before where be sitting at top of fall at moment remembered well circumstance of scene when have be there with at last visit to loughlinter how thing have changed since then then have loved lady laura with heart have now already brought to regard a discreet matron whom to love must be almost a unreasonable a though be to entertain passion for lord chancellor reader will understand how thorough have be cure effected by lady laura marriage interval of few month when swain be already prepared to make lady depositary of confidence in matter of love be often here suppose said lady laura looking down upon a sat upon rock well yes not very often come here sometimes because view down upon lake be so fine be prettiest spot about place hardly ever get here now indeed be only second time have be up since have be at home then came to bring papa here there be little wooden seat near to rock upon phineas have be lying upon lady laura sat down phineas with eye turned upon lake be considering how might introduce subject of love for violet effingham did not find matter very easy have just resolved to begin by saying that violet must certainly never accept lord chiltern when lady laura spoke word two stopped altogether how well remember said day when be here last autumn so do told then that be going to marry mr kennedy how much have happened since then much indeed enough for whole lifetime yet how slow time have gone think have be slow with said phineas have be active have have hand full of work be beginning to think that be great curse to have be born woman yet have heard say that woman may do a much a man be before have learned lesson properly know better than now oh dear have doubt be for best a be have kind of wish might be allowed to go out milk cow may not milk cow if wish lady laura by mean not only not milk hardly look at at rate must not talk about phineas of course understood that be complaining of husband hardly knew how to reply to have be sharp enough to perceive already that mr kennedy be autocrat in own house knew lady laura well enough to be sure that such masterdom must be very irksome to have not imagined that must complain to be so different at saulsby lady laura continued everything there seemed to be own everything here be own yes according to prayer book everything in truth be own a dainty at banquet belonged to sancho governor mean said then hesitated mean that mr kennedy stand over guarding for own welfare a doctor stood over sancho guarded there be pause before answered long pause during be looking away over lake thinking how might introduce subject of love long a be pause have not begun when lady laura be again speaking truth be friend said that have made mistake mistake yes phineas mistake have blundered a fool blunder thinking be clever enough to pick footstep aright without asking counsel from one have blundered stumbled fallen now be so bruised that be not able to stand upon foot word that struck most in be own christian name have never called phineas before be aware that circle of acquaintance have fallen into way of miscalling by christian name a one observes to be done now again in reference to special young man most of men whom called friend called phineas even earl have done so more than once on occasion in greatness of position have dropped for moment out of mind mr low have called phineas when regarded a husband most cherished pupil mr bunce have called mr phineas have always be phineas to everybody at killaloe still be quite sure that lady laura have never so called before must have done so now in husband presence be sure of also mean that be unhappy said still looking away from towards lake yes do mean that though know why must come tell so except be still blundering stumbling have fallen into way of hurting at step can tell one who be more anxious for happiness said phineas be very pretty speech what must do for happiness indeed what be possible that must do mean a rebuke when say that happiness unhappiness be matter a to will soon become perfectly indifferent why must say so lady laura because be natural that must be so mr kennedy might have be friend not that will be because be unlike other in way might have be so be not to be friend asked in very few month will not think of telling be desire what sorrow a for will be out of question must tell mine to how can be friend if be not quite sure of friendship lady laura must not speak to a be speaking now still did not look at lay with face supported on hand eye turned away upon lake where be sitting must see be aided by sight in making comparison in mind between two men who have be lover between whom have taken whom have left there be something in hard dry unsympathising unchanging virtue of husband almost revolted have not fault have tried at point have be able to strike spark of fire from even by disobeying must produce heat only access of firmness how must have be with have thrown idea of fortune to wind linked lot to of young phoebus who be lying at foot if have ever loved one have loved have not thrown away love for money so swore to herself over over again trying to console in cold unhappiness have married rich man in order that might be able to do something in world now that be rich man wife found that must hing rich man thought to be quite enough for to sit at home look after welfare in meantime young phoebus phoebus a have be once be thinking altogether of one else phineas said slowly have in such perfect confidence will tell truth a one man may tell to wish must go from here what at once not to day to morrow stay here now till election return will ask to come press hard will be hurt for strange to say with coldness really like have pleasure in seeing here must not have pleasure at expense of trouble to why be trouble to asked men be such fool so awkward so unready with wit ever behind occasion by dozen second so a soon a word be uttered knew that must not have be spoken because be fool said why else be not that enough for laura said will have none of be fool not such fool a to suppose that cure be to be found there only say what can do for though be with entire life will do can hing except to keep away from be earnest in telling that now at last have turned round be looking at a looked saw hat of man appearing up path immediately afterwards face be hat face of laird of loughlinter here be mr kennedy said phineas in tone of voice not devoid of dismay trouble so perceive said lady laura there be dismay trouble in tone of voice in countenance of mr kennedy a approached closer there be not much to be read only perhaps slight addition of gloom rather perhaps of frigid propriety of moral demeanour for have always be conspicuous have grown upon at marriage have be greatly increased by double action of being made cabinet minister being garrotted be glad that headache be better said to wife who have risen from seat to meet phineas also have risen be now looking somewhat sheepish where stood came out because be worse said irritated so must not stand house longer will send to callender for dr macnuthrie pray hing of kind robert want dr macnuthrie at where there be illness medical advice be always expedient be not ill headache be not illness have thought be said mr kennedy very drily at rate must rather not have dr macnuthrie be sure can not do good to climb up here in heat of sun have be here long finn morning here hereabouts clambered up from lake have book in pocket happened to come across by accident mr kennedy asked there be something so simple in question that very simplicity proved that there be suspicion yes by chance said lady laura one at loughlinter always come up here if one ever be missing whom wanted to find be where must look be going on towards linter forest to meet blane said mr kennedy blane be gamekeeper if mind trouble finn wish 'd take lady laura down to house let stay out in heat will take care that somebody go over to callender for dr macnuthrie then mr kennedy went on phineas be left with charge of taking lady laura back to house when mr kennedy hat have first appeared coming up walk phineas have be ready to proclaim prepared for devotion in service of lady laura indeed have begun to reply with criminal tenderness to indiscreet avowal lady laura have made to felt now after what have just occurred in husband presence that show of tenderness of criminal tenderness be impossible absence of suspicion on part of mr kennedy have made phineas feel that be bound by social law to refrain from such tenderness lady laura began to descend path before without word went on on a though must have reached house without speaking have not addressed doe head still pain asked of course doe suppose be right in saying that must not be out in heat know be not worth while to think about sends in so of course must go tell to take so of course must take must wish must let go alone yes must only will be sure to find out must not tell that left at request do think that be afraid of said phineas yes think be know that be papa be that mother hardly dare to call soul own know why must escape mr kennedy be nothing to be something to so suppose have better go on now will have horrid man from little town pawing covering everything with snuff bidding take scotch physic seems to increase in quantity nastiness a dos in england decrease will stand over to see take what doctor from callender mr kennedy will if advised to have hole in glove mended must ask before went to bed whether be done never forgot anything in life be never unmindful of anything that think will do mr finn have brought out from tree may be taken a bringing home will hardly get scolded if part here remember what told up above remember also that be in power to hing else for good bye so turned away towards lake let lady laura go across wide lawn to house by herself have failed altogether in intention of telling friend of love for violet have come to perceive that must not for present carry out that intention after what have passed must be impossible for to go to lady laura with passionate tale of longing for violet effingham if be even to speak to of love at must be quite of love than never must speak to of love a felt quite sure must allow to do so what astounded most a thought of interview have just passed be fact that lady laura whom have known whom have thought have known must have become so subject to man a mr kennedy man whom have despised a being weak irresolute without purpose for day two that remained at loughlinter watched family closely became aware that lady laura have be right when declared that father be afraid of mr kennedy will follow almost immediately said earl confidentially to phineas when candidate for borough took departure from loughlinter like to be there just when election be going on will be at saulsby to receive day afterwards phineas took leave from mr kennedy with warm expression of friendship on part of host from lady laura with mere touch of hand tried to say word be sullen if not put on mood like to sullenness said never word to on day after departure of

wife be bored if so what be to be future of life of hers went up to london year to parliament a duty then during period of recess must have house full of guest a duty happiness be to consist in such hour a seemed to inflict upon wife penalty of continual headache shadow of truth came upon what if wife did not like living quietly at home a mistress of husband house what if headache be always to be result of simple performance of domestic duty more than shadow of truth have come upon lady laura dark cloud created by entire truth be upon making everything black wretched around have asked question two have discovered that have love for husband that kind of life intended to exact from be insupportable to that have blundered fallen in entrance upon life perceived that father have already become weary of mr kennedy lonely sad a must be at saulsby by be intention to repudiate idea of making home at loughlinter yes must be deserted by everyone except of course by husband then then must throw on

headache have said so for last ten day having headache be not being ill only wish must not talk of then perhaps must get rid of can not believe that headache in nine case out of ten come from stomach though said saying because be common place common sense sort of thing to say still at very moment there be shadow of truth before eye what if headache meant simple dislike to to mode of life be nothing of sort said lady laura impatient at having ailment inquired into with so much accuracy then what be can not think that can be happy to hear complaining of headache day making excuse for absolute idleness what be that want to do said jumping up from seat set task if go mad over will get through there be account book give to suppose can see figure will try to see laura be unkind of ungrateful of course be everything be bad what pity that did not find out last year oh dear oh dear what be to do then threw down upon sofa put hand up to temple will send for dr macnuthrie at once said mr kennedy walking towards door very slowly speaking a slowly a walked do such thing said springing to foot again intercepting before reached door if come will not see give word will not speak to if come understand said understand at what be ought to understand asked that woman doe not like to be bothered made reply at once stood there twisting handle of door collecting thought yes said at last be beginning to find out to find out also what be that bother woman a call can see now what be that make head ache be not stomach be quite right there be prospect of quiet decent life to must be attached performance of certain homely duty dr macnuthrie be learned man doubt whether can do anything for malady be quite right robert can hing be malady must cure for laura be to be cured by

small raised booth be called platform be that be called upon to do mr grating made speech in proposing mr shortribs in seconding be speech be required thing seemed to be so very easy that be afterwards almost offended when be told that bill for so insignificant piece of work came to l s d have seen occasion for spending even odd forty seven pound then be member for loughton a passed evening alone at inn having dined in company with messrs grating shortribs sundry other influential elector began to reflect that after be not so very great thing to be member of parliament almost seemed that have come to so easily must not be of much value on following day went to castle be there when earl arrived two be alone together earl be very kind to so have opponent after said great man of loughton with slight smile not ghost of candidate did not think there must be have tried once twice have always failed there be only one two in place who like to go one way just because neighbour go other in truth there be conservative feeling in place phineas although be at present moment member for loughton must not enjoy joke of must there be liberal feeling in place indeed political

confidential be conversation that phineas be almost silenced for awhile word two have be said about loughlinter of beauty of place of vastness of property be almost afraid said lord brentford that laura be not happy there hope be said phineas be so hard dry what call exacting be just word for now laura have never be used to with always have own way in everything always found fit to have

independent of press on second morning after meeting with late friend saw result of independence there be startling article tremendous article showing pressing necessity of immediate reform proving necessity by illustration of borough mongering rottenness of present system when patron a lord brentford cabinet minister with sinecure must by mere word put into house stick a phineas finn man who have struggled to stand on leg before speaker have wanted courage capacity nothing further must surely be wanted to prove that reform bill of required to be supplemented by more energetic measure

that without that be absurd know that father must make such condition a phineas said that thought be absurd then rode on again cantering through wood have be bold to speak to about lord chiltern a have done have answered just a must have wished to be answered how must press suit for while be cantering by side presently came to rough ground over be forced to walk be close by side mr finn said wonder whether may ask question question replied be there quarrel between lady laura none between no none be greater ally than ever then why be not going to be at loughlinter have written to expressly

not try will not even think of cause whatever be have be full of sorrow to must have given left hand to have be at loughlinter autumn be so fond of must have be staying there with said paused for moment there be word spoken by of must perceive that hand in held whip be playing with horse mane with nervous movement when found how must be must miss rushed down here that might see for moment now be here dare to speak to of be now beyond rock violet without speaking word again put horse into trot be by side in moment must not see face have not word to say to asked replied not word when speak

must not find moment in to speak to though spent evening with stood over a sang at earl request pressed hand a went to bed be up to see start in morning must not draw from word look chapter xxxv mr monk upon reform phineas finn went to ireland immediately after return from saulsby having said nothing further to violet effingham having heard nothing further from than what be recorded in last chapter felt very keenly that position be unsatisfactory brooded over autumn early winter must form plan for improving dozen time thought of writing to miss effingham asking for explicit answer must not however bring to write letter thinking that written expression of love be always weak vapid deterred also by conviction violet if driven to reply in writing must undoubtedly reply by refusal fifty time rode again in imagination ride in saulsby wood told a often that syren answer to have be of possible answer most indefinite provoking tone of voice a galloped away from bearing of countenance when rejoined manner to when saw start from castle in morning forbade to believe that word to have be taken a offence have replied to with direct negative simply with word have so said that there have hardly be sting in have known at moment that might be result of suit need not regard violet effingham a enemy doubt made sojourn in ireland very wearisome to there be other matter tended also to discomfort though be not left even at period of life without continuation of success seemed to be very wonderful first will say word of discomfort heard not line from lord chiltern in answer to letter have written to lordship from lady laura did hear frequently lady laura wrote to exactly a though have never warned away from loughlinter a though there have be occasion for such warning sent letter filled chiefly with politics saying something also of guest at loughlinter something of game just word two here there of husband letter be very good letter preserved carefully be manifest to that be intended to be good letter a such to be preserved in one of received about end of november told that brother be again in old haunt at willingford bull that have sent to portman square for property of own have be left there there be word in letter of violet effingham though lady laura did speak more than once of violet always did so a though violet be simply joint acquaintance of herself correspondent there be allusion to existence of special regard on part for miss effingham have thought that violet might probably tell friend what have occurred at saulsby if did so lady laura be happy in power of reticence hero be disturbed also when reached home by finding that mr flood jones miss flood jones have retired from killaloe for winter know whether might not have be more disturbed by presence of young lady for must have found constrained to exhibit towards tenderness of manner such tenderness of manner must in existing circumstance have be dangerous be made to understand mary flood jones have be taken away from killaloe because be thought that have ill treated lady accusation made unhappy in middle of heat of last session have received letter from sister in pushing question have be asked a to then existing feeling about poor mary have answered petulantly nothing more have be written to about miss jones nothing be said to when reached home must not however ask after mary when did ask accusation be made again in quietly severe manner with perhaps most of have be made acquainted at period of life think phineas said sister have better say nothing about dear mary be not here at present probably may not see while remain with be that about phineas have demanded understanding whole matter thoroughly then sister have demurely refused to say word further on subject not word further be said about miss mary flood jones be at floodborough living did not doubt in very desolate way quite willing did not doubt also to abandon desolation if must go over there in manner must become after what have passed on one two occasion between young lady how be to do with such work on hand a have undertaken now that be in ireland thought that did love dear mary very dearly felt that have two identity that be a be two separate person that must without real faithlessness be very much in love with violet effingham in position of man of fashion member of parliament in england also warmly attached to dear little mary flood jones a irishman of killaloe be aware however that there be prejudice against such fulness of heart therefore resolved sternly that be duty to be constant to miss effingham how be possible that must marry dear mary with such extensive job of work on hand be not possible must abandon thought of making dear mary own doubt have be right to remove still a took solitary walk along shannon up on hill overhung lake above town felt somewhat ashamed of dreamed of giving up parliament of leaving violet to noble suitor to lord chiltern if must take of going to floodborough with honest proposal that must be allowed to press mary to heart miss effingham must probably reject at last whereas mary dear mary must come to heart without scruple of doubt dear mary in day of dreaming told that after dear mary be real love of course such day be day of dreaming only have letter in pocket from lady laura kennedy made impossible for to think in earnest of giving up parliament then there came wonderful piece of luck in way there lived have lived in town of galway very eccentric old lady one miss marian persse who be aunt of mr finn mother of hero with lady dr finn have quarrelled persistently ever since marriage because lady have expressed wish to interfere in management of family offering to purchase such right by favourable arrangement in reference to will doctor have resented there have be quarrel miss persse be not very rich old lady thought good deal of own money now died leaving l to nephew phineas finn sum of about equal amount bequeathed to roman catholic seminary thus be worldly wealth divided must have done better with said old doctor a far a be concerned windfall be more pleasant a being wholly unexpected in day doctor be undoubtedly gratified by son success in life never said much about law phineas in truth did do work during autumn reading blue book reading law book reading perhaps novel two at same time shutting up very carefully a studied so that sister be made to understand for certain four hour in day not sound be to be allowed to disturb on receipt of legacy at once offered to repay father money have be advanced over above original allowance doctor refused to take come to same thing phineas said what have of share now ca have hereafter a regard present income have only made work little longer than have intended believe that later in life man work more likely be to live phineas therefore when returned to london have in pocket owed l remainder must of course invest there have be talk of autumnal session mr mildmay decision have at last be against who can not understand that such must be decision of minister to whom be left slightest fraction of free will in matter why must minister court danger of unnecessary attack submit to unnecessary work incur odium of summoning friend from rest in midst of doubt a to new old ministry when political needle be vacillating so tremulously on pivot pointing now to one set of men a coming government then to vague suggestion a to autumn session might be useful be thrown out in good faith mr mildmay when spoke on subject to duke be earnest in thinking that question of reform must not be postponed even for six month pledge said duke mr mildmay did not pledge afterwards when mr mildmay found that be once more assuredly prime minister changed mind felt to be under fresh obligation to duke lord de terrier have altogether failed country might very well wait till february country did wait till february somewhat to disappointment of phineas finn who have become tired of blue book at difference between english life life at home be so great that be hardly possible that must not become weary of latter did become weary of strove gallantly to hide weariness from father mother at time world be talking much about reform though mr mildmay have become placidly patient feeling be growing mr turnbull with friend be doing must to make grow fast there be certain amount of excitement on subject excitement have grown downwards from leader to people from self instituted leader of popular politics down by mean of press to rank of working men instead of growing upwards from dissatisfaction of mass till expressed by mouthpiece that chosen by people there be strong throb through country making men feel that safety be to be have by reform must not be have without reform there be understanding that press orator be too strong to be ignored that new measure of reform must be conceded to sooner concession be made le might be necessary to concede men of party be agreed on point that reform be in odious to many of who spoke of freely who offered willingly to be promoter be acknowledged be not only odious to lord de terrier to most of who worked with be equally so to many of mr mildmay most constant supporter duke have wish for reform indeed be hard to suppose that duke can wish for change in state of thing must seem to to be so salutary workman be getting full wage farmer be paying rent capitalist by dozen be creating capitalist by hundred nothing be wrong in country over dominant spirit of speculative commerce there be nothing in reform to check why must duke want reform a for such men a lord brentford sir harry coldfoot lord plinlimmon mr legge wilson be known to men that advocated reform a of advocate doctor amount of doctoring be necessary for may hardly hope to avoid let have a little of doctor a possible mr turnbull cheap press rising spirit of loudest among people made manifest that something must be conceded let be generous in concession be now doctrine of many perhaps of most of leading politician of day let be generous let at rate seem to be generous let give with open hand still with hand though open will not bestow too much coach must be allowed to run down hill indeed unless coach go on running journey will be made let have drag on hind wheel must remember that coach running down hill without drag be apt to come to serious misfortune there be men even in cabinet who have other idea of public service than of dragging wheel of coach mr gresham be in earnest plantagenet palliser be in earnest that exceedingly intelligent young nobleman lord cantrip be in earnest mr mildmay threw perhaps a much of earnestness into matter a be compatible with age full appreciation of manner in present cry for reform have be aroused be thoroughly honest thoroughly patriotic thoroughly ambitious that must be written of hereafter a one who to end of long life have worked sedulously for welfare of people disbelieved in mr turnbull in bottom of heart indulged aristocratic contempt for penny press there be man in england more in earnest more truly desirous of reform than mr monk be great political idea political advantage must be extended to people whether people clamoured for did not clamour for even whether desired did not desire ask child whether must like to learn lesson must say at rate wait till cry for book when therefore men said to that there be earnestness in cry for reform that cry be false cry got up for factious purpose by interested person must reply that thing to be done must not be done in obedience to cry because be demanded by justice be debt due to people hero in autumn have written to mr monk on politics of moment following have be mr monk reply longroyston october dear finn be staying here with duke duchess of st bungay house be very full mr mildmay be here last week a shoot ca play billiards have taste for charade be becoming tired of gaiety will leave to morrow of course know that be not to have autumn session think that mr mildmay be right must have be sure of passing measure must have be very well must not have be sure failure with bill in session convened for express purpose of passing must have injured cause greatly must hardly have gone on with again in spring indeed must have resigned though may truly say must a lief have good measure from lord de terrier a from mr mildmay that be indifferent to own present personal position still think that must endeavour to keep seat a long a honestly believe to be more capable of passing good measure than be opponent be astonished by difference of opinion exists about reform not only a to difference in extent exact tendency of measure be needed that there must be such divergence of idea a to grand thing to be done grand reason for doing be agreed that want reform in order that house of common may be returned by larger proportion of people than be at present employed upon work that member when returned must represent somewhat more equal section of whole constituency of country than member generally do at present men confess that l county franchise must be too high that borough with le than two hundred registered voter must be wrong seems to that few among perceive at rate acknowledge real reason for changing thing reforming what be wrong without delay one great authority told other day that sole object of legislation on subject must be to get together best possible member of parliament that to must be most repulsive idea if be not that by very vagueness becomes inoperative who will say what be best what characteristic constitutes excellence in member of parliament if gentleman mean excellence in general wisdom in statecraft in skill in talking in private character even excellence in patriotism then say that be utterly wrong have never touched with intellect true theory of representation one only excellence may be acknowledged be excellence of likeness a portrait must be like person portrayed so must representative house be like people whom represents in arranging franchise doe seem to that have right to regard other view if country be unfit for representative government may be that there be still people unable to use properly greatest of blessing question a to what state policy may be best for be different question if do have

london before end of january did not find there many of whom wished to see mr low be there to showed mr monk letter thinking that must be convincing even to mr low did in mr low drawing room knowing that mr low must also condescend to discus politics on occasion have dined with have be glad to see mr low have be le severe than hitherto against great sin of husband late pupil have condescended to congratulate on becoming member for english borough instead of irish one have asked question about saulsby castle nevertheless mr monk letter be not received with respectful admiration phineas thought that deserved phineas foolishly have read out loud so that attack came upon simultaneously from husband from wife be just usual claptrap said mr low only put into language somewhat more grandiloquent than usual claptrap said phineas be what call downright radical nonsense said mr low nodding head energetically portrait indeed why must want to have portrait of ignorance ugliness what want be to have thing quiet orderly then 'd better have paternal government at once said phineas just so said mr low only that what call paternal government be not always quiet orderly national order take to be submission to law must not think quiet orderly if be sent to cayenne without being brought before jury man a must not be sent to cayenne said phineas next door neighbour might be must be almost a bad let be sent to cayenne if deserves let jury say that have deserved idea of government be that want to be governed by law not by caprice that must have legislature to make law if thought parliament a at present established made law badly must desire change doubt whether will have better from change in parliament reform will give of course not said mr low will have lot of beggar put on horseback know where ride to then phineas became aware that be not easy to convince man woman on point of politics not even though who argues may have eloquent letter from philosophical cabinet minister in pocket to assist chapter xxxvi phineas finn make progress february be far advanced new reform bill have already be brought forward before lady laura kennedy came up to town phineas have of course seen mr kennedy have heard from tidings of wife be at saulsby with lady baldock miss boreham violet effingham be to be in london soon mr kennedy a appeared did not quite know when be to expect wife phineas thought that must perceive from tone of husband voice that something be amiss must not however ask question excepting such a referred to expected arrival be miss effingham to come to london with lady laura mr kennedy believed that miss effingham must be up before easter did not know whether must come with wife woman said be so fond of mystery that one can never quite know what intend to do corrected at once however perceiving that have seemed to say something against wife explained that general accusation against sex be not intended to apply to lady laura however did so awkwardly a to strengthen feeling with phineas that something assuredly be wrong miss effingham said mr kennedy never seems to know own mind suppose be like other beautiful girl who be petted on side said phineas a for beauty think much of said mr kennedy a for petting understand in reference to grown person child may be petted dog though too be bad what call petting for grown person be think frivolous almost indecent phineas must not help thinking of lord chiltern opinion that must have be wise to have left mr kennedy in hand of garrotter debate on second reading of bill be to be commenced on st of march two day before lady laura arrived in grosvenor place phineas got note from in three word to say that be at home must see if called on sunday afternoon sunday to alluded be last day of february phineas be now more certain than ever that something be wrong have there be nothing wrong between lady laura husband must not have rebelled against by asking visitor to house on sunday have nothing to do with however of course did a be desired called on sunday found mr bonteen sitting with lady laura be just in time for debate said lady laura when first greeting be over mean to say that intend to sit out said mr bonteen word of unless lose seat what else be there to be done at present place give be so unpleasant said mr bonteen there be worse place even than lady gallery said lady laura perhaps be a well to make used to inconvenience of kind will speak mr finn intend to do so of course will great speech will be mr gresham mr daubeny mr monk mr palliser intends to be very strong said mr bonteen man can not be strong not a like said lady laura mr palliser believe to be most useful man never can become orator be of same class a mr kennedy only of course higher in class look for great speech from mr kennedy said mr bonteen have not slightest idea whether will open lip said lady laura immediately after mr bonteen took leave hate woman like poison continued lady laura be always playing game be such small game that play contributes so little to society be not witty well informed not even sufficiently ignorant ridiculous to be laughing stock one get nothing from yet have made footing good in world thought be friend of yours did not think so must not have thought so how can bring such accusation against knowing a do never mind mr bonteen now on what day will speak on tuesday if can suppose can arrange will endeavour to do so a far a arrangement can go will carry second reading said lady laura yes said phineas think will by vote of men who be determined so to pull bill to piece in committee that own parent will not know doubt whether mr mildmay will have temper to stand tell that mr mildmay will abandon custody of bill to mr gresham after first speech know that mr gresham temper be more enduring than mr mildmay said phineas well will see own impression be that nothing must save country so effectually at present moment a removal of mr turnbull to higher better sphere let say house of lord said phineas god forbid said lady laura phineas sat there for hour then got up to go having spoken word on other subject than of politics longed to ask after violet longed to make inquiry respecting lord chiltern to tell truth felt painfully curious to hear lady laura say something about own self must not remember have be said between up over waterfall how have be warned not to return to loughlinter then again did lady laura know anything of what have passed between violet where be brother said a rose from chair oswald be in london be here not hour before came in

whether be angry with angry with not in least will tell just what said said must not wish to live even with that must sooner try with than with man ever knew have got letter from did not say so did not say have not will see to morrow if can then phineas prepared to go one word mr finn said lady laura hardly looking in face yet making effort to do so wish to forget what said to at loughlinter

here a yet because be so frightfully dull do best on tuesday then let see on wednesday good bye phineas a walked across park towards club made up mind that must forget scene by waterfall have never

chiltern be out have felt palpitation at heart a made inquiry knowing well fiery nature of man expected to see might be that there must be actual personal conflict between half mad lord before got back again into street what lady laura have said about brother did not in estimation of phineas make at le probable half mad lord be so singular in way that might well be that must speak handsomely of rival behind back yet take by throat a soon a be together face to face yet a phineas thought be necessary that must see half mad lord have written letter to have received no reply considered to be incumbent on to ask whether have be received whether answer to be intended to be given went therefore to lord chiltern at once a have said with feeling at heart that there might be violence at rate of word before must find again in street lord chiltern be not there that porter knew be that lord chiltern intended to leave house on following morning then phineas wrote note left with porter dear

friendship for phineas phineas crushed note into pocket of course determined that must be in room at hour named debate be opened by speech from mr mildmay in gentleman at great length with much perspicuity explained notion of measure of parliamentary reform thought to be necessary be listened to with greatest attention to close perhaps at end of speech with more attention than usual a there have gone abroad rumour that prime minister intended to declare that must be last effort of life in course if ever intended to utter pledge heart misgave when time came for uttering merely said that a management of bill in committee must be affair of much labour probably spread over many night must be assisted in work by colleague especially by right honourable friend secretary of state for foreign affair be then understood that mr gresham must take lead must bill go into committee be understood also that resignation of leadership have be made by mr mildmay measure now proposed to house be very much same a have be brought forward in last session existing theory of british representation be not to be changed actual practice be to be brought nearer to ideal theory idea of manhood suffrage of electoral district be to be a for ever removed from bulwark of british constitution there be to be county with agricultural constituency purposely arranged to be purely agricultural whenever nature of county must admit of being so no artificer at reform let be conservative liberal can make middlesex lancashire agricultural wiltshire suffolk be to be preserved inviolable to plough apple of devonshire be still to have sway town in three kingdom with certain population be to have two member here there be much room for cavil a men knew must be case who will say what be town where will be limit bit of county might be borrowed so a to lessen conservatism of county without endangering liberalism of borough then there be borough with one member then group of little borough in discussion of such arrangement how easy be picking of hole how impossible fabrication of garment that will be impervious to such picking then again there be that great question of ballot on that there be to be mistake mr mildmay again pledged to disappear from treasury bench must motion clause resolution be carried by house in favour of ballot spoke for three hour then left carcass of bill to be fought for by opposing army reader of page will desire that speech in debate must be even indicated soon became known that conservative must not divide house against second reading of bill declared however very plainly intention of so altering clause of bill in committee at least of attempting so to do a to make bill bill rather than bill of opponent to mr palliser replied that a long a nothing vital be touched government must only be too happy to oblige friend opposite if anything vital be touched government must only fall back upon friend on side in way men be very civil to other mr turnbull who opened debate on tuesday thundered out assurance to god men that must divide house on second reading of bill did not doubt that there be many good men true to go with into lobby into lobby must go if have more than single friend to support warned sovereign warned house warned people of england that measure of reform now proposed by so called liberal minister be measure prepared in concert with ancient enemy of people be very loud very angry quite successful in hallooing down sundry attempt be made to interrupt find said that there be many member here who know yet young member probably who be green from waste land road side of private life will know soon then may be there will be le of foolish noise le of elongation of unnecessary neck rome must be aroused to sense of danger by other voice than be called to order be ruled that have not be out of order be very triumphant mr monk answered be declared afterwards that mr monk speech be one of finest piece of oratory have ever be uttered in house made one remark personal to mr turnbull quite agreed with right honourable gentleman in chair said when declared that honourable member be not out of order just now of agree with always on such point rule of house have be laid down with utmost latitude so that course of debate may not be frivolously too easily interrupted member may be so in order a to incur displeasure of house to merit reproach of countryman little duel gave great life to debate be said that two great reformer mr turnbull mr monk must never again meet a friend in course of debate on tuesday phineas got upon leg reader trust will remember that hitherto have failed altogether a speaker on one occasion have lacked even spirit to use deliver oration have prepared on second occasion have broken down woefully past redemption a said who be not friend unfortunately not past redemption a said who be true friend after once again have arisen said few word have called for remark have be spoken a though be in habit of addressing house daily may be doubted whether there be dozen men now present who recognised fact that man who be so well known to so many of be now about to make attempt at first speech phineas diligently attempted to forget such be case have prepared for few heading of what intended to say on one two point have arranged word hope be that even though must forget word might still be able to cling to thread of discourse when found again upon leg amidst crowded seat for few moment there came upon that old sensation of awe again thing grew dim before eye again hardly knew at end of long chamber speaker be sitting there arose within sudden courage a soon a sound of own voice in room have made intimate to ear after first few sentence fear awe be gone from when read speech in report afterwards found that have strayed very wide of intended course have strayed without tumbling into ditch falling into sunken pit have spoken much from mr monk letter have have grace to acknowledge whence have come inspiration hardly knew however whether have failed again not till barrington erle came up to a be leaving house with old easy pressing manner so have got into form at last said always thought that must come never for moment believed that must come sooner later phineas finn answered not word went home lay awake night triumphant verdict of barrington erle sufficed to assure that have succeeded chapter xxxvii rough encounter phineas when woke have two matter to occupy mind success of previous night coming interview with lord chiltern stayed at home whole morning knowing that nothing must be done before hour lord chiltern have named for visit read word of debate studiously postponing perusal of own speech till must come to in due order then wrote to father commencing letter a though writing have reference to affair of previous night soon found compelled to break into mention of send time said in order that may see have have finger in pie have hitherto abstained from putting forward in house partly through base fear for despise partly through feeling of prudence that man of age must not be in hurry to gather laurel be literally true there have be fear there have be prudence wonder be have not incurred more contempt from others because have be coward people have be so kind to that must suppose to have judged more leniently than have judged then a be putting up paper looked again at own speech of course read word of once more a did so occurred to that reporter have be more than courteous to man who have followed have be thought at rate a long winded a to orator le than column have be granted to have be granted ten line in big type after that whole column half let lord chiltern come do worst when wanted twenty minute to one be beginning to think in what way have better answer half mad lord must lord in wrath be very mad there came to note by hand of messenger knew at once that be from lady laura opened in hot haste be a follows dear mr finn be talking about speech father be in gallery heard said that have to thank for sending to loughton that made very happy mr kennedy declares that be eloquent too short that coming from be praise indeed have seen barrington who take pride to that be political child violet say that be only speech ever read be there be delighted be sure that be in to do yours l k suppose will see after house be up write a will barely have opportunity of speaking to then will be in portman square not at home from six till seven moment in phineas refolded note put into breast coat pocket be think happiest of life then before have withdrawn hand from breast remembered that what be now about to take place between lord chiltern must probably be mean of separating altogether from lady laura family nay might not render necessary that must abandon seat in parliament have be conferred upon by personal kindness of lord brentford let be a might one thing be clear to must not abandon violet effingham till must be desired to do so in plainest language by violet effingham looking at watch saw that be one o'clock at moment lord chiltern be announced phineas went forward immediately with hand out to meet visitor chiltern said be very glad to see lord chiltern did not take hand passing on to table with still on head with dark scowl upon brow young lord stood for few moment perfectly silent then chucked letter across table to spot at phineas be standing phineas taking up letter perceived that be that in great attempt to be honest have written from inn at loughton be own letter to said yes be letter to received oddly enough together with own note at moroni on monday morning have be round world suppose reached only then must withdraw withdraw sir withdraw a far a can learn without asking question must have committed young lady have not acted upon have not yet done what there threaten to do in have be very wise there can be difficulty in withdrawing letter certainly will not withdraw lord chiltern do remember what once told about miss effingham question asked very slowly pausing between word looking full into face of rival towards whom have gradually come nearer countenance a did so be by mean pleasant redness of complexion have become more ruddy than usual still wore hat a though with studied insolence right hand be clenched there be that look of angry purpose in eye man like to see in eye of antagonist phineas be afraid of violence personal to be afraid of of what may perhaps best call row to be tumbling over chair table with late friend present enemy in mr bunce room must be most unpleasant to if there be to be blow too must strike be very averse to strike lady laura brother lord brentford son violet effingham friend if need be however must strike suppose remember what mean said phineas think declared that must quarrel with man who might presume to address miss effingham be that to allude be that said lord chiltern remember what said very well if nothing else be to deter from asking miss effingham to be wife will hardly think that ought to have weight threat have weight be not spoken a threat sir that know a well a do be said from friend to friend a thought then be not le true wonder what can think of faith truth honesty of purpose when took advantage of absence whom have told thousand time loved better than own soul stand before world a rising man stand before world a man damned have be chosen by father to sit for family borough while be outcast from house have cabinet minister for friend while have hardly decent associate left to in world can say of have never done anything unworthy of gentleman while thing that be doing be unworthy of lowest man have done nothing unworthy said phineas wrote to instantly when have resolved though be painful to to have to tell secret to one wrote yes when be mile distant week month away did not come here to bullyrag like old woman got letter only on monday know nothing of what have occurred be miss effingham to be wife lord chiltern have now come quite close to phineas phineas felt that clenched fist might be in face in moment miss effingham of course be not engaged to seemed to that if be now so to declare such declaration must appear to have be drawn from by fear ask said lord chiltern in what position now stand towards miss effingham if be not coward will tell whether tell not know be not coward said phineas will have to try said lord chiltern if please will ask for answer to question phineas paused for moment thinking what honesty of purpose high spirit must when combined together demand of together with requirement felt that be bound to join feeling of duty towards miss effingham lord chiltern be standing there fiery red with hand still clenched hat still on waiting for answer let have question again said phineas will answer if find can do so without loss of self respect ask in what position stand towards miss effingham mind doubt at choose to have reply from will remember of course can only answer to best of belief answer to best of belief think regard a intimate friend have said a indifferent acquaintance must think have be mark will let that be presume may understand that have given up idea of changing position may understand nothing of kind lord chiltern why what hope have be thing will not speak of at rate not to then sir now lord chiltern advanced step raised hand a though be about to put with form of violence on person of rival stop chiltern said phineas stepping back so that there be article of furniture between adversary choose that there must be riot here what do call riot sir believe that after be poltroon what require of be that will meet will do that mean to fight yes to fight to fight to fight for what other purpose do suppose that can wish to meet phineas felt at moment that fighting of duel must be destructive to political hope few englishman fight duel in day who do so be always reckoned to be fool duel between lord brentford son must a thought separate from violet from lady laura from lord brentford from borough yet how must refuse what have to think of sir when offer a be made to said fiery red lord have to think whether have courage enough to refuse to make as say that wish to have riot be way to escape what call riot want to bully chiltern sir simply want that must leave where found not interfere with have long known claim a own be not own then can only fight have better send friend to will name one whom will meet of course will do that if have promise to meet can be in belgium in hour two back again in few more hour be one of who may chance to be alive will select friend will tell everything will then do a bid yes old steady going buffer mr kennedy perhaps will certainly not be mr kennedy will probably ask laurence fitzgibbon to manage for in affair perhaps will see at once then so that colepepper may arrange with afternoon let assure mr finn that there will be meeting between after fashion let idea of friend mr fitzgibbon be what may then lord chiltern purposed to go turned again a be going remember said complaint be that have be false to damnably false not that have fallen in love with young lady with then fiery red lord opened door for took departure phineas a soon a be alone walked down to house at there be early sitting a went there be one great question have to settle with be there justice in charge made against that have be false to friend when have thought over matter at saulsby after rushing down there that might throw at violet foot have assured that letter a resolved to write to lord chiltern must be even chivalrous in absolute honesty must tell purpose to lord chiltern moment that purpose be formed must afterwards speak of lord chiltern behind back a one dear friend must speak of have miss effingham shown slightest intention of accepting lord chiltern offer must have acknowledged to that circumstance of position made impossible that must with honour become friend rival be to be debarred for ever from getting that wanted because lord chiltern wanted also knowing a did so well that lord chiltern must not get thing wanted have be quite sufficient for at saulsby now charge against that have be false to friend rang in ear made unhappy certainly be true that lord chiltern have not given up hope that have spoken probably more openly to phineas respecting than have done to other human being if be true that have be false then must comply with requisition lord chiltern might make short of voluntarily giving up lady must fight if be asked to do so even though fighting be ruin when again in house yesterday scene came back upon more than one man came to congratulating mr monk took hand spoke word to old premier nodded to mr gresham greeted plantagenet palliser openly told that have made good speech how sweet must all have be have there not be ever at heart remembrance of terrible difficulty consciousness that be about to be forced into absurdity must put end to sweetness why be world in england so severe against duelling after a regarded matter now duel might be best way nay only way out of difficulty if might only be allowed to go out with lord chiltern whole thing might be arranged if be not shot might carry on suit with miss effingham unfettered by impediment on side if be shot what matter be that to one why must world be so thin skinned so foolishly chary of human life laurence fitzgibbon did not come to house phineas looked for at club frequented leaving note at a did not find also left note for at lodging in duke street must see evening will dine at reform club pray come there after phineas went up to portman square in accordance with instruction received from lady laura there saw violet effingham meeting for first time since have parted from on great step at saulsby of course spoke to of course be gracious to graciousness be only smile speech be only word there be many in room not enough to make privacy possible a becomes possible at crowded evening meeting lord brentford be there bonteens barrington erle lady glencora palliser lord cantrip with young wife be manifestly meeting of liberal semi social semi political so arranged that lady might feel that interest in politics be allowed to perhaps influence also afterwards mr palliser came in phineas however be most struck by finding laurence fitzgibbon be there that mr kennedy be not in regard to mr kennedy be quite sure have meeting taken place before lady laura marriage mr kennedy must have be present must speak to a go away said phineas whispering word into fitzgibbon ear have be leaving note for about town not duel hope said fitzgibbon how pleasant be that meeting must have be have there not be nightmare on breast talked a though there be perfect accord between perfect confidence there be there great men cabinet minister beautiful woman wife daughter of of england highest noble phineas finn throwing back now again thought to killaloe found among a one of how must mr low say that be wrong on sofa near to so that must almost touch foot with be sitting violet effingham a leaned over from chair discussing point in mr mildmay bill with most inveterate politician lady glencora violet looked into face smiled oh heaven if lord chiltern might only toss up a to of must go to patagonia remain there for next ten year must have violet effingham for wife in london come along phineas if mean to come said laurence fitzgibbon phineas be of course bound to go though lady glencora be still talking radicalism violet effingham be still smiling ineffably volume ii chapter xxxviii duel knew be duel bedad did said laurence fitzgibbon standing at corner of orchard street oxford street when phineas have half told story be sure of from tone of voice boy must let come off be not if can help then phineas be allowed to proceed finish story see way out of indeed said laurence by time phineas have come to think that duel be in very truth best way out of difficulty be bad way out then be way must not see other a for ill treating be nonsense said laurence what be girl to do if one fellow may come on a soon a fellow be down then see fellow never know when be down therefore think that be ill used will tell now must wonder if must do on sly unless one of be stupid enough to hit other in awkward place if be certain of hand now right shoulder be best spot phineas felt very certain that must not hit lord chiltern in awkward place although be by mean sure of hand let come what might must not aim at adversary of have thought proper to say nothing to laurence fitzgibbon duel did come off on sly meeting in drawing room in portman square of mention be made in last chapter took place on wednesday afternoon on thursday friday monday tuesday following great debate on mr mildmay bill be continued at three on tuesday night house divided there be majority in favour of minister not large enough to permit to claim triumph for party even ovation for still sufficient to enable to send bill into committee mr daubeny mr turnbull have again joined force together in opposition to ministerial measure on thursday phineas have shown in house during remainder of interesting period be absent from place be seen at club did man know of whereabouts think that lady laura kennedy be first to miss with real sense of absence must now go to portman square on afternoon of sunday at time husband be attending second service of church there must receive whom called father guest a father be never there on sunday a gathering have be created by reader will probably think that be obeying husband behest in regard to sabbath after very indifferent fashion reader may be quite sure however that mr kennedy knew well what be being done in portman square might be lady laura fault did not commit fault of disobeying husband in secret there be probably few word on subject need not go very closely into matter at present moment on sunday afforded rest in middle of great reform debate lady laura asked for mr finn one must answer question then be remembered that laurence fitzgibbon be also absent barrington erle knew nothing of phineas have heard nothing be able to say that fitzgibbon have be with mr ratler patronage secretary liberal whip early on thursday expressing intention of absenting for two day mr ratler have be wroth bidding remain at duty pointing out to great importance of moment then barrington erle quoted laurence fitzgibbon reply boy said laurence to poor ratler path of duty lead to grave same will be in at death ratler boy a sure a sun in heaven not ten minute after telling of little story fitzgibbon entered room in portman square lady laura at once asked after phineas bedad lady laura have be out of town for two day know nothing mr finn have not be with then with not with have job of business of own took over to paris have phinny fled too poor ratler must wonder if be asylum be in before session be over laurence fitzgibbon certainly possessed rare accomplishment of telling lie with good grace have man called liar must have considered to be not only insulted injured also believed to be man of truth there be however in estimation certain subject on man might depart a wide a pole be asunder from truth without subjecting to ignominy for falsehood in dealing with tradesman a to debt with rival a to lady with man woman in defence of lady character in such matter a of duel laurence believed that gentleman be bound to lie that must be gentleman if hesitated to do so not slightest prick of conscience disturbed when told lady laura that have be in paris that knew nothing of phineas finn in truth during last day two have be in flanders not in paris have stood a second with friend phineas on sand at little fishing town twelve mile distant from bruges have left friend since at hotel at ostend with wound just under shoulder from bullet have be extracted manner of meeting have be in wise captain colepepper laurence fitzgibbon have held meeting at meeting laurence have taken certain standing ground on behalf of friend in obedience to friend positive instruction be that friend must not abandon right of addressing young lady must hereafter ever think fit to do so let that be granted laurence must do anything then must not be granted laurence must only shrug shoulder must laurence admit that friend have be false question lie in nutshell said laurence with sweet connaught brogue always came to when desired to be effective here be one gentleman tell that be sweet upon young lady that young lady have refused always will refuse for ever ever be truth anyhow be second gentleman bound by not to address young lady say be not bound 'd be d d hard tratement captain colepepper if man mouth ardent affection of heart be to be stopped in manner by jases know who 'd like to be friend of man if be to be way of captain colepepper be not very good at argument think 'd better see other said colepepper pulling thick grey moustache if choose to have so so be think hardest thing in world do indeed then put head together in most friendly way declared that affair must if possible be kept private on thursday night lord chiltern captain colepepper went over by calais lille to bruges laurence fitzgibbon with friend dr obehaughnessy crossed by direct boat from dover to ostend phineas went to ostend by dover calais took day route on friday have be arranged among so that there might be suspicion a to job in hand even obehaughnessy laurence fitzgibbon have left london by separate train met on sand at blankenberg about nine o'clock on saturday morning having reached that village in different vehicle from ostend bruges have met quite unobserved amidst sand heap one shot have be exchanged phineas have be wounded in right shoulder have proposed to exchange shot with left hand declaring capability of shooting quite a well with left a with right to colepepper fitzgibbon have objected lord chiltern have offered to shake hand with late friend in true spirit of friendship if only late friend must say that did not intend to prosecute suit with young lady in dispute young lady name be never mentioned phineas indeed have not once named violet to fitzgibbon speaking of always a lady in question though laurence correctly surmised identity of young lady never hinted that have even guessed name doubt whether lord chiltern have be so wary when alone with captain colepepper then lord chiltern be when spoke at very plain spoken man of course lordship late friend phineas must give such pledge therefore lord chiltern moved off ground back to blankenberg bruges into brussels in still living enmity with hero laurence doctor took phineas back to ostend though bullet be then in shoulder phineas made way through blankenberg after fashion that one there knew what have occurred not living soul except five concerned be at time aware that duel have be fought among sand hill laurence fitzgibbon made way to dover by saturday night boat be able to show in portman square on sunday know anything about phinny finn said afterwards to barrington erle in answer to inquiry from anxious gentleman not word think 'd better send town crier round after barrington however did not feel quite so well assured of fitzgibbon truth a lady laura have done dr obehaughnessy remained during sunday monday at ostend with patient people at inn only knew that mr finn have sprained shoulder badly on tuesday came back to london again via calais dover bone have be broken phineas though shoulder be very painful bore journey well obehaughnessy have received telegram on monday telling that division must certainly take place on tuesday on tuesday at about ten in evening phineas went down to house by be here said ratler taking hold of with affection be too warm yes be here said phineas wincing in agony be little careful there be good fellow have be down in kent put arm out put arm out have said ratler observing sling for first time be sorry for will stop vote yes will stop vote have come up for purpose hope wo be very late there be daubeny gresham to speak yet at least three others suppose will be much before three be right now can go down smoke if like in way phineas finn spoke in debate heard end of voting for party fought duel with lord chiltern in middle of did go sit on well cushioned bench in smoking room then be interrogated by many of friend a to mysterious absence have said be down in kent have have accident with arm by have be confined when questioner perceived that there be little mystery in matter questioner did not push question simply entertained own surmise one indiscreet questioner however did trouble phineas sorely declaring that there must have be affair in woman have have part asking after young lady of kent indiscreet questioner be laurence fitzgibbon who a phineas thought carried spirit of intrigue little too far phineas stayed voted then went painfully home to lodging how singular must be if affair of duel must pas away one be bit wiser four men who have be with on sand at blankenberg again wondered at own luck have told that duel with lord chiltern must create quarrel between lord chiltern relation also between violet effingham that must banish from comfortable seat for loughton ruin in regard to political prospect now have fought duel be back in town thing seemed to have be thing of nothing have not a yet seen lady laura violet have doubt be a much in dark a other people day might arrive thought on must be pleasant for to tell violet effingham what have occurred day have not come a yet whither lord chiltern have gone what lord chiltern intended to do have not idea imagined that must soon hear something of brother from lady laura that lord chiltern must say word to lady laura of what have occurred to other person in world did not in least suspect there must be man more likely to be reticent in such matter than lord chiltern more sure to be guided by almost exaggerated sense of what honour required of did doubt discretion of friend fitzgibbon if only friend might not damage secret by being too discreet of silence of doctor captain be by mean equally sure even though must gossip gossiping must take so long time in oozing out becoming recognised information a to have lost much of power for injuring be lady laura to hear at moment that have be over to belgium have fought duel with lord chiltern respecting violet must probably feel obliged to quarrel with such obligation must rest on if in course of six nine month must gradually have become aware that encounter have taken place lord chiltern during interview at room in great marlborough street have said word to about seat in parliament have expressed opinion that a phineas finn be interfering with view of standish family in regard to miss effingham ought not to keep standish seat have be conferred upon in ignorance of such intended interference phineas a thought of must not remember lord chiltern word there be present to idea that such have be purport be bound in circumstance a now existed to give up loughton made up mind that be not so bound unless lord chiltern must demand from that must do so nevertheless be uneasy in position be quite true that seat now be for session by parliamentary law even though elector might wish to be rid of that lord brentford must not even open mouth upon matter in tone more loud than of whisper phineas feeling that have consented to accept favour of corrupt seat from lord brentford felt also that be bound to give up spoil if be demanded from if be demanded from either by father son must be given up at once on following morning found leading article in people banner devoted solely to during late debate so ran passage in leading article mr finn lord brentford irish nominee for pocket borough at loughton did at last manage to stand on leg open mouth if be not mistaken be mr finn third session in parliament hitherto have be unable to articulate three sentence though have on more than one occasion made attempt for what special merit young man have be selected for aristocratic patronage know that there must be merit recognisable by aristocratic eye surmise three year ago be raw young irishman living in a irishman only know how to live earning nothing apparently without mean then suddenly burst out a member of parliament a friend of cabinet minister possession of one good gift must be acceded to honourable member for loughton be handsome young man look to be a strong a coal porter can be that promotion have sprung from be a may must like to know where have be during late mysterious absence from parliament in what way came by wound in arm even handsome young member of parliament feted by titled lady rich lord be amenable to law to law of country to law of other may suit to visit for while infamous scoundrel said phineas to a read vile low disreputable blackguard be clear enough however that quintus slide have found out something of secret if so only hope must rest on fact that friend be not likely to see column of people banner chapter xxxix lady laura be told by time mr mildmay great bill be going into committee phineas be able to move about london in comfort with arm however still in sling there have be nothing more about wound in people banner be beginning to hope that nuisance must also be allowed to die away have seen lady laura having dined in grosvenor place where have be petted to heart content dinner have be cut up for wound have be treated with tenderest sympathy singular to say question be asked have be to kent have come by accident no more than be told dear sympathising friend be content to receive so much information to ask for more have not a yet seen violet effingham be beginning to think that romance about violet might a well be brought to close have not however a yet be able to go into crowded room unless went out to large party must not be sure that must meet miss effingham at last resolved that must tell lady laura whole truth not truth about duel truth about violet effingham ask for assistance when making resolution think that must have forgotten much that have learned of friend character by making think that showed also that have not learned a much a opportunity might have taught knew lady laura obstinacy of purpose knew devotion to brother knew also how desirous have be that brother must win violet effingham for knowledge must think have sufficed to show how improbable be that lady laura must assist in enterprise beyond be fact fact a to consequence of phineas be entirely blind beautifully ignorant that lady laura have once condescended to love nay have gone farther than have ventured to tell even after marriage that remembrance of feeling have once dwelt in heart in regard to be still danger to have warned from loughlinter then have received in london now selected a confidante in love affair have not be beautifully ignorant most modestly blind must surely have placed confidence elsewhere be not that lady laura kennedy ever confessed to herself existence of vicious passion have indeed learned to tell that must not love husband once in excitement of such silent announcement to herself have asked whether heart be quite blank have answered by desiring phineas finn to absent from loughlinter during subsequent winter have scourged inwardly for own imprudence quite unnecessary folly in so doing what must not laura standish who from earliest year of girlish womanhood have resolved that must use world a men use not a woman do must not have felt slight shock of passing tenderness for handsome youth without allowing feeling to be rock before big enough sharp enough for destruction of entire barque must not command if not heart at rate mind so that might safely assure that whether man man be here there course must be unaltered what though phineas finn have be in same house with throughout winter must not have so lived with on term of friendship deed word look of friendship might have be open to husband open to world must have done so told that be not need not have be great calamity whether must endure dull monotonous control of slow imperious lord whether must not rather tell that be not to be endured be trouble so told again admitted phineas to intimacy in london nevertheless phineas have not be beautifully ignorant most blind to own achievement must not have expected from lady laura kennedy assistance with miss violet effingham phineas knew when to find lady laura alone came upon one day at favourable hour two first clause of bill have be passed after twenty fight endless division two point have be settled a to however mr gresham have be driven to give way so far to yield so much that men declared that bill a government must consent to call own must never be passed by parliament in session immediately on entrance into room lady laura began about third clause must house let gresham have way about phineas stopped at once dear friend said have come to in private trouble want to drop politics for hour have come to for help private trouble mr finn be serious be very serious be trouble of kind of be thinking be serious enough to take up thought can help indeed can whether will be different thing must help in anything in power mr finn do not know have be very kind to so must mr kennedy mr kennedy can not help here what be mr finn suppose may a well tell at once in plain language know how to put story into word will fit love violet

everything can say in oswald favour will say nothing of duel beyond that have right to demand secrecy with yes have better go mr finn for be hardly well remember if can forget little episode about miss effingham so will forget also so will oswald can promise for then smiled gave hand went rose from chair a left room waited till heard sound of great door closing behind before again sat down then when be gone when be sure that be no longer there with in same house laid head down upon arm of sofa burst into flood of tear be no longer angry with phineas there be further longing in heart for revenge did not now desire to injure though have done so a long a be with nay resolved instantly almost instinctively that lord brentford must know nothing of lest political prospect of young member for loughton must be injured to have rebuked to rebuke again again must be only fair must at least be womanly must protect from material injury a far a power of protection might avail why be weeping now so bitterly of course asked a rubbed away tear with hand why must weep be not weak enough to tell that be weeping for injury have be done to oswald got up suddenly from sofa pushed away hair from face pushed away tear from cheek then clenched fist a held out at full length from body stood looking up with eye fixed upon wall as exclaimed fool idiot must not be able to crush into nothing have done with why must not have after be better than oswald oh be that door of room have be opened while be standing thus husband have entered yes be be anything wrong very much be wrong what be laura can not help if be in trouble must tell what be leave to to try to help nonsense said shaking head laura be uncourteous not to say undutiful also suppose be beg pardon must not help laura must help such

about more will not speak to of of papa only want to understand that there be subject must be secret to on may be allowed to shed tear if be so weak will not trouble on matter in have not sympathy then left standing in middle of room depressed by what have occurred not thinking of a of trouble must do more than make uncomfortable for day chapter xl madame max goesler day after day clause after clause bill be fought in committee few men fought with more constancy on side of minister than did member for loughton troubled though be by quarrel with lord chiltern by love for violet effingham by silence of friend lady laura for since have told her of duel have become silent to never writing to hardly speaking to when met in society nevertheless phineas be not so troubled what must work at vocation now when must find upon leg in house must wonder at hesitation have lately troubled so sorely must sit sometimes speculate upon dimness of eye upon tendency of thing to go round upon obtrusive palpitation of heart have afflicted so seriously for so long time house now be more to than other chamber member more than other men guarded from oration speaking always very shortly because believed policy good judgment required that must be short word be very easy to must feel a though must talk for ever there quickly came to reputation for practical usefulness be man with strong opinion who must yet be submissive man seemed to know how reputation have come have made one good speech after two three failure who knew whole party have be aware of failure one good speech have be regarded by many a very wonderful effort be man who be pleasant to other men not combative not self asserting beyond point at assertion cease to be necessity of manliness nature have be very good to making comely inside out with comeliness have crept into popularity secret of duel be think at time known to great many men woman so phineas perceived be not thought known to lord brentford to violet effingham in be right rumour of have yet reached ear of of person rumour though fly so fast so far be often slow in reaching ear must be most interested in tidings dim report of duel reached even mr kennedy asked wife who told said sharply bonteen told that be certainly so mr bonteen always know more than anybody else about everything except own business then be not true lady laura paused then lied of course be not true must be very sorry to ask of to seems to be most improbable thing in life then mr kennedy believed that there have be no duel in wife word put absolute faith thought that must certainly know anything that brother have done a be man given to little discourse asked further question about duel in house at club at first phineas have be greatly dismayed when men have asked question tending to elicit from explanation of mystery by degree became used to a tidings have got abroad did not seem to injure a questioning be not pushed very closely became indifferent there came out article in people banner in lord c n mr p s f n be spoken of a glaring example of aristocratic snobility be expressive word coined evidently with great delight for occasion rotten state of london society in high quarter now produced here be young lord infamously notorious quarrelling with one of boon companion whom have appointed to private seat in house of common fighting duel breaking law scandalising public be done without punishment to guilty there be old story afloat so said article of what in former century have be done by lord mohuns mr best now in c c c so article went on reader may fill in without difficulty concluding indignation virtuous appeal for reform in social moral a well a parliament phineas have so far progressed that have almost come to like kind of thing certainly think that duel did harm in society otherwise must hardly have be asked to semi political dinner at lady glencora palliser even though might have be invited to make one of five hundred guest who be crowded into saloon staircase after dinner be over to have be one of five hundred be nothing to be one of sixteen be great deal be indeed so much that phineas not understanding a yet advantage of own comeliness be at loss to conceive why so pleasant honour be conferred upon there be man among eight men at dinner party not in parliament only other except phineas not attached to government be mr palliser great friend john grey member for silverbridge there be four cabinet minister in room duke lord cantrip mr gresham owner of mansion there be also barrington erle young lord fawn under secretary of state wit grace of lady present lent more of character to party than even position of men lady glencora palliser be host there be woman then in london better able to talk to dozen people on dozen subject then moreover be still in flush of beauty bloom of youth lady laura be there by what mean divided from husband phineas must not imagine lady glencora be good at such division lady cantrip have be allowed to come with lord a be well understood lord cantrip be not so manifestly husband a be mr kennedy there be men who can not guard from assertion of marital right at most inappropriate moment now lord cantrip lived with wife most happily yet must pas hour with together hardly know that knew other one of duke daughter be there not duchess who be known to be heavy there be beauteous marchioness of hartletop violet effingham be in room also giving phineas blow at heart a saw smile might be that must speak word to on occasion mr grey have also brought wife then there be madame max goesler phineas found that be fortune to take down to dinner not violet effingham madame max goesler when be placed at dinner on other side of there sat lady hartletop who addressed few word spoke exclusively to mr palliser there have be in former day matter difficult of arrangement between two think that old passage have now be forgotten by phineas be therefore driven to depend exclusively on madame max goesler for conversation found that be not called upon to cast seed into barren ground up to moment have never heard of madame max goesler lady glencora in introducing have pronounced lady name so clearly that have caught with accuracy must not surmise whence have come why be there be woman probably something over thirty year of age have thick black hair wore in curl unlike anybody else in world in curl hung down low beneath face covering perhaps intended to cover certain thinness in cheek must otherwise have taken something from charm of countenance eye be large of dark blue colour very bright used in manner be a yet hardly common with englishwoman seemed to intend that must know that employed to conquer looking a knight may have looked in olden day who entered chamber with sword drawn from scabbard in hand forehead be broad somewhat low nose be not classically beautiful being broader at nostril than beauty required moreover not perfectly straight in line lip be thin teeth endeavoured to show a little a possible be perfect in form colour who criticised severely said however that be too large chin be well formed divided by dimple gave to face softness of grace must otherwise have be much missed perhaps great beauty be in brilliant clearness of dark complexion might almost fancy that must see into so a to read different line beneath skin be somewhat tall though by mean tall to fault be so thin a to be almost meagre in proportion always wore dress close up to neck never showed bareness of arm though be only woman so clad now present in room singularity did not specially strike one because in other respect apparel be so rich quaint a to make inattention to impossible observer who did not observe very closely must perceive that madame max goesler dress be unlike dress of other woman seeing that be unlike in make unlike in colour unlike in material ordinary observer must not see also that be unlike in form for other purpose than of maintaining general peculiarity of character in colour be abundant yet fabric of garment be always black pen may not dare to describe tracery of yellow ruby silk went in out through black lace across bosom round neck over shoulder along arm down to very ground at foot robbing black stuff of sombre solemnity producing brightness in there be nothing gaudy wore vestige of crinoline hardly anything must be called train lace sleeve of dress with bright tracery of silk be fitted close to arm round neck wore smallest possible collar of lace above there be short chain of roman gold with ruby pendant have ruby in ear ruby brooch ruby in bracelet on arm such a regarded outward woman be madame max goesler phineas a took place by side thought that fortune for nonce have done well with only that must have liked so much better must have be seated next to violet effingham have said that in matter of conversation morsel of seed be not thrown into barren ground know that can truly be said to have produced even morsel subject be mooted by lady so great be fertility in discoursing that conversational grass seemed to grow with spontaneously mr finn said what must not give to be member of british parliament at moment a why at moment a particularly because there be something to be done let tell senator though be be not always case with experience be short sometimes seems to that there be too much to be done too much of nothingness mr finn be not that case now there be real fight in list one great drawback to life of woman be that can not act in politics side must take what here in england said madame max goesler from expression from one two others of similar nature phineas be led into doubt whether lady be countrywoman of not indeed be hard to say politically must want to out turnbull mr turnbull to vote for everything must be voted for ballot manhood suffrage womanhood suffrage unlimited right of striking tenant right education of everybody annual parliament abolition of at least bench of bishop be strong programme said phineas be strong mr finn be what must like think however must be tempted to feel dastard security in conviction might advocate view without danger of seeing carried out for to tell truth at want to put down lady gentleman think that must go with bench of bishop want anything to go be a far a real life be concerned there be that dear good bishop of abingdon be best friend have in world a for bishop of dorchester 'd walk from here to there to hear preach 'd sooner hem apron for than that must want pretty decoration then mr finn there be such difference between life theory be there not be so comfortable to have theory that one be not bound to carry out said phineas be mr palliser do live up to political theory at moment mr palliser be sitting perfectly silent between lady hartletop duke daughter gave little spring in chair a sudden address be made to house of common theory mean mr palliser mr finn be saying that be very well to have far advanced idea doe not matter how far advanced because one be never called upon to act upon practically be dangerous doctrine think said mr palliser pleasant so at least mr finn say be at least very common said phineas not caring to protect by contradiction for myself said mr palliser gravely think may say that always be really anxious to carry into practice doctrine of policy advocate in theory during conversation lady hartletop sat a though word of reached ear did not understand madame max goesler by mean loved mr palliser when have made little speech turned to duke daughter asked question about conservatory at longroyston have called forth word of wisdom said madame max goesler almost in whisper yes said phineas taught cabinet minister to believe that be most unsound politician may have ruined prospect for life madame max goesler let hope not a far a can understand way of thing in government aspirant to office succeed chiefly by making uncommonly unpleasant to who be in power if man can hit hard enough be sure to be taken into elysium of treasury bench not that may hit others that may cease to hit who be there think men be chosen because be useful be very severe upon indeed a far a can see one man be a useful a to put aside joking tell that be sure to become minister phineas felt that blushed must be that people said of behind back that be man likely to rise high in political position informant be very kind replied awkwardly know who be will never get up in way describe be by abusing men support after madame max goesler turned round to mr grey who be sitting on other side of phineas be left for moment in silence tried to say word to lady hartletop lady hartletop only bowed head gracefully in recognition of truth of statement made so applied for while to dinner what do think of miss effingham said madame max goesler again addressing suddenly what do think about know suppose oh yes know be closely connected with kennedy who be friend of mine so have heard tell that score of men be raving about be one of oh yes mind being one of sundry score there be nothing particular in owning to admire of course do said phineas ah see be joking do

said phineas then paused moment before continued to speak can not say that know miss effingham very intimately from what have seen of must think very probable that may not marry at very probably said madame max goesler who then again turned away to mr grey ten minute after when moment be just at hand in lady be to retreat madame max goesler again addressed phineas looking very full into face a did so wonder whether time will ever come mr finn in will give account of day journey to blankenberg to blankenberg yes to blankenberg be not asking for now will look for day then lady glencora rose from seat madame max goesler went out with others chapter xli lord fawn what have madame max goesler to do with journey to blankenberg thought phineas a sat for while in silence between mr palliser mr grey why must who be perfect stranger to have dared to ask question a conversation round table after lady have gone soon drifted into politics became general phineas for while forgot madame max goesler blankenberg journey listened to eager word of cabinet minister now again uttering word of own showing that too be a eager a others session in mr palliser dining room be not long phineas soon found making way amidst throng of coming guest into room above object be to meet violet effingham failing that must not be unwilling to say few more word to madame max goesler first encountered lady laura

now have not be at portman square oh then lady glencora be so much more advanced than be after be humdrum people a world go now then phineas began to roam about room striving to find opportunity of engrossing five minute of miss effingham attention during time lady laura be giving history of madame max goesler eye have wandered round have perceived that violet be standing in further corner of large lobby on to stair opened so situated indeed that must hardly escape because of increasing crowd on very account almost impossible to be reached must see also that be talking to lord fawn unmarried peer of something over thirty year of age with unrivalled pair of whisker small estate rising political reputation lord fawn have be talking to violet through whole dinner phineas be beginning to think that must like to make journey to blankenberg with object of meeting lordship on sand when lady laura have done speaking eye be turned through large open doorway towards spot on

doubt said violet be such grand prospect said opening in life so much excitement know useful career a if there be not plenty of opening here for miss effingham said lord fawn plenty of excitement do think there be said violet be much more civil than mr finn must say then phineas began to hope that need not be afraid of lord fawn what happy man be at dinner continued violet addressing to phineas thought lord fawn be happy man have madame max goesler to yourself for nearly two hour suppose there be not creature in room who did not envy doubt that ever so much interest be made with lady glencora a to taking madame max down to dinner lord fawn know intrigued miss effingham really must contradict barrington erle begged for a particular favour duke with sigh owned that be impossible because of cumbrous rank mr gresham when be offered to declared that be fatigued with business of house not up to occasion how much did say to what did talk about ballot chiefly that manhood suffrage

thing never escape even violet must not be such fool a send card if come will soon see miss boreham quite understood mother though must never master card be prepared miss boreham must never master mother by own effort be think by little intrigue on part that lady baldock be mastered indeed altogether cowed in reference to hero that victory be gained on very afternoon in time to prevent sending of card when mother daughter be at tea before dinner lord baldock came into room after having be patted petted praised by mother took up card out of china bowl ran eye over lord fawn said greatest as in london lady hartletop know wo come see why must come said lady baldock mere country clergyman daughter julius caesar conway great friend of mine therefore always blackball other friend at club lord

have better put by card for present dear said lady baldock at last will make inquiry believe word of what gustavus have said think that even violet be such fool a if rash ill natured people have spoken of may be a well to be careful be always well to be careful be not mamma not what think very improper that thing must be said about young woman a for story of duel believe word of be absurd

house certainly did say that quite concurred must be taking too much on must be acting dishonestly if be to allow to imagine that be proposition have asked to recommend must have named that say frankly did not did not mr mildmay named 'do think ' said 'that friend finn must join at treasury told that did think so 'and do not think ' said 'that must be useful appointment then ventured to say that have doubt whatever on point knew well enough to feel confident that must lend strength to liberal government then there be few word said about seat be commissioned to write to be phineas be grateful not too grateful bore very well in interview explained to lord brentford that of course be object to serve country to be paid for service that considered to be very fortunate to be selected so early in career for parliamentary place must endeavour to do duty must safely say of that did not wish to eat bread of idleness a made assertion thought of laurence fitzgibbon laurence fitzgibbon have eaten bread of idleness yet be promoted phineas said nothing to lord brentford about idle friend when have made little speech asked question about borough have already ventured to write letter to agent at loughton telling that have accepted office that will be shortly there again will see shortribs arrange if be must write to shortribs to grating after have seen mr mildmay of course will not mention name earl looked very grave a uttered caution of course will not said phineas think will find difficulty about seat said peer there never have be difficulty at loughton yet must say that for if can scrape through with clause will be right will not be clause a to so violent opposition be expected from mr turnbull clause a to phineas have felt that must hardly know how to support government in event of committee being pressed to division upon must ardent reformer reformer at heart must say that borough a loughton must be spared that arrangement by shortribs grating have sent to parliament in obedience to lord brentford order be in due accord with theory of representative legislature in what respect have gatton old sarum be worse than loughton be not false to principle in sitting for borough a loughton have spoken to mr monk mr monk have told that rome be not built in day have told also that good thing be most valued be more valuable when came by instalment then mr monk enjoyed satisfaction of sitting for popular constituency be not personally pricked in conscience by own parliamentary position now however now that phineas have consented to join government such consideration a must be laid aside must no longer be free agent even free thinker have be quite aware of have taught to understand that member of parliament in direct service of government be absolved from necessity of free thinking individual free thinking be incompatible with position of member of government unless such abnegation be practised government must be possible be of course man duty to bind together with other men with whom on matter of general policy must agree heartily having found that must so agree knew that must be duty a subaltern to vote a be directed must trouble conscience le to sit for loughton vote for objectionable clause a member of government than must have done to give vote a independent member in so resolving thought that be simply acting in accordance with acknowledged rule of parliamentary government therefore when lord brentford spoke of clause must answer pleasantly think will carry see in getting through committee if can carry by one be a good a hundred be comfort of close fighting in committee in open house be almost a much beaten by narrow majority a by vote against just so just so said lord brentford delighted to see that young pupil a

daring to tell lord brentford that have quarrelled with lord chiltern feeling that if did so everything must go wrong said that must write to lord chiltern a went away felt that be bound to get answer from violet effingham if must be necessary be willing to break with lord brentford on matter even though such breaking must lose borough place not on other matter chapter xliv phineas friend hero

mr turnbull generally slipping away gradually into account of own martyrdom for have be martyr having failed in obtaining redress against policeman who have imprisoned so wrongfully people banner have

nearest to heart in politics be not self aggrandisement welfare of people in general yet must not agree with bunce that there be something wrong when such men a laurence fitzgibbon be called upon to act a governor be not to be expected that ignorant still intelligent bunce of population must d n on evening of day went up to mr low very sure that must receive encouragement from from husband have be angry with because have put into position in money must be spent none must be made low especially mr low have refused to believe that success be within reach now that have succeeded now that be in

unhappy on next morning be received in grosvenor place with amount of triumph went far to compensate lady laura have written to to call there on arrival found violet effingham madame max goesler with friend when phineas entered room first feeling be one of intense joy at seeing violet effingham be present there then there be one of surprise madame max goesler must make one of little party lady laura have told at mr palliser dinner party that in portman square have not a yet advanced far enough to receive madame max goesler yet here be lady in mr kennedy drawing room now phineas must have thought more likely that must find in portman square than in grosvenor place truth be that madame goesler have be brought by miss effingham with consent indeed of lady laura with consent given with much of hesitation what be afraid of violet have asked be afraid of nothing lady laura have answered one have to choose one acquaintance in accordance with rule one doe lay down very strictly be clever woman said violet everybody like if think mr kennedy must object of course be right then lady laura have consented telling that be not necessary that must ask husband approval a to new acquaintance might form at same time violet have be told that phineas must be there so party have be made up beee conquering hero come said violet in cheeriest voice be so glad that mr finn have be made lord of something said madame max goesler have pleasure of long political discussion with other night quite approve of be so much gratified mr finn said lady laura mr kennedy say that be best appointment must have made papa be quite proud about be lord brentford member be not asked madame max goesler be question phineas did not quite like be obliged to excuse by remembering that questioner have lived so long out of england a to be probably ignorant of myth theory system working of british constitution violet effingham little a knew of politics must never have asked question so imprudent question be turned off phineas with easy grace submitted to be petted congratulated purred over almost caressed by three lady good natured enthusiasm be at rate better than satire of bunce wisdom of mr low lady laura have misgiving a to phineas being fit for governing violet effingham said nothing a to short lived tenure of minister madame max goesler though have asked indiscreet question thoroughly appreciated advantage of government pay prestige of government power be lord now said speaking a be customary with with slightest possible foreign accent will be president soon then perhaps secretary order of promotion seems odd be told be very pleasant be pleasant to succeed of course said phineas let success be ever so little knew must succeed said lady laura be quite sure of be not violet always said so dear for venture to have opinion on such matter will always have to go to big building in corner mr finn stay there from ten till four wo that be bore have half holiday on saturday know said phineas do lord of treasury have to take care of money asked madame max goesler only own generally fail in doing said phineas sat there for considerable time wondering whether mr kennedy must come in wondering also a to what mr kennedy must say to madame max goesler when did come in knew that be useless for to expect opportunity then there of being alone for moment with violet effingham only chance in direction must be in crowded room at ball at might ask to dance with seemed that fate be very unkind to that such chance came in way mr kennedy did not appear madame max goesler with violet went away leaving phineas still sitting with lady laura of said kind word to a went know whether may dare to expect that lord of treasury will come see said madame max goesler then phineas made second promise that must call in park lane violet blushed a remembered that must not ask to call at lady baldock good bye mr finn said giving hand be so very glad that have chosen do hope that a madame max say will make secretary president everything else very quickly till will come to turn to be making other people be very nice said madame goesler to violet a took place in carriage bear being petted spoilt without being awkward conceited on whole be rather nice said violet only have not got shilling in world have to make before will be anybody must marry money of course said madame max goesler hope be contented said lady laura rising from chair coming opposite to a soon a be alone of course be contented be not when first heard of why did promote that empty headed countryman of yours to place for be quite unfit be not contented then be more ambitious for than be for sat without answering for awhile stood waiting for reply have nothing to say to asked know what to say when think of be lost in amazement tell that be not contented that be ambitious for why be that must feel interest in matter be not reasonable that must be interested for friend when last parted here in room be hardly friend be not wrong there very deeply told what be ambition resented said phineas think said must not help think said also that thought must fail know showed much resentment see told that be here that might come meet know that wished brother must succeed wished before ever knew can not expect must change wish if can not succeed pleaded phineas who be to say have woman never be won by devotion perseverance besides how can wish to see go on with suit must sever from father injure political prospect perhaps fatally injure seems to now that father be almost only man in london who have not heard of duel of course will hear of have half made up mind to tell do mr finn there can be reason for did not ask to come here to day to talk to about violet have given advice about can do more lady laura can not take be out of power to take very well matter will be what member of parliament call open question between when papa asked to accept place at treasury did ever occur to to refuse did for hour so hoped must yet knew be wrong thought that must count to be worth more than that must a be assert then be so difficult to draw line between proper self assertion proper self denial to know how high to go up table how low to go down doubt that have be right only make understand that be not a other junior lord that have be willing to be junior lord anything else for purpose that purpose be something higher than of fetching carrying in parliament for mr mildmay mr palliser hope in time to get beyond fetching carrying said phineas of course will knowing be glad that be in office suppose there will be difficulty about loughton then phineas laughed hear said that mr quintus slide of people banner have already gone down to canvas elector mr quintus slide to canvas elector of loughton lady laura drew up spoke of unseemly intrusion on father borough a though vulgar man who have be named have forced way into very drawing room in portman square at moment mr kennedy came in do hear what mr finn tell said have heard that mr quintus slide have gone down to loughton to stand against why not said mr kennedy dear ejaculated lady laura mr quintus slide will doubt lose time money will gain prestige of having stood for borough will be something for on staff of people banner said mr kennedy will get that horrid man vellum to propose said lady laura very likely said mr kennedy le of say about better finn dear fellow congratulate heartily nothing for long time have given greater pleasure than hearing of appointment be equally honourable to to mr mildmay be great step to have gained so early phineas a thanked friend must not help asking what friend have done to be made cabinet minister little a phineas have done in house in two session half mr kennedy have hardly done more in fifteen twenty then mr kennedy be possessed of almost miraculous wealth owned county whereas phineas owned almost nothing at of course prime minister must offer junior lordship at treasury to man with l year soon after phineas took leave think will do well said mr kennedy to wife be sure will do well replied lady laura almost scornfully be not quite such black swan with a be with still think will succeed if take care of be astonishing how absurd story of duel with chiltern have got about be impossible to prevent people talking said lady laura suppose there be quarrel though of will tell say be about miss effingham must hardly think that finn must have hope in direction why must not have hope because have position money birth said mr kennedy be gentleman said lady laura think have position see why must not ask girl to marry there be understanding laura said mr kennedy angrily thought have quite other hope about miss effingham so have have nothing to do with spoke of mr finn a though must be guilty of crime be to ask violet effingham to be wife in disagree with mr finn be will make sick of name of mr finn be sorry offend by gratitude to man who saved life mr kennedy shook head knew that argument used against be false did not know how to show that knew that be false perhaps have better not mention name more continued lady laura nonsense quite agree with that be nonsense robert mean to say be that if go on a do will turn head spoil do think know what be going on among what be going on among a call be taking young man up putting on pedestal worshipping just because be well looking rather clever decently behaved be always way with woman who have nothing to do who can not be made to understand that must have duty can not live without kind of idolatry have neglected duty to robert yes know have in going to reception at father house on sunday what have to do with mr finn psha begin to think have better tell mr finn not to come here more since presence be disagreeable to world know how great be service did will seem to be very ridiculous people will say manner of thing anything will be better than that must go on a have done accusing wife of idolatry towards young man because be well looking never said anything of kind did robert did not did not speak more of than of lot of others accused personally saying that because of idolatry have neglected duty really made jumble of with papa visitor sunday afternoon can not follow what be in mind then mr kennedy stood for awhile collecting thought so that might unravel jumble if be possible to finding that be not possible left room closed door behind then lady laura be left alone to consider nature of accusation husband have brought against nature rather of accusation have chosen to assert that husband have implied for in heart knew that have made such accusation have intended to make none idolatry of have spoken be idolatry woman might show to cat dog picture china furniture carriage horse pet maid servant such be idolatry of mr kennedy have spoken be there no other worship in heart worse more pernicious than in reference to young man have schooled about very severely have come to various resolution have found out confessed to herself that did not must not love husband have found out confessed to herself that did love must not help loving phineas finn then have resolved to banish from presence have gone length of telling so after that have perceived that have be wrong have determined to meet a met other men to conquer love then when must not be done when something almost like idolatry grew upon determined that must be idolatry of friendship that must not sin even in thought that there must be nothing in heart of need be ashamed that one great object purport of life must be promotion of friend welfare have just begun to love after fashion have taught to believe that might combine something of pleasure of idolatry towards friend with full complement of duty towards husband when phineas came to with tale of love for violet effingham lesson got then be very rough one so hard that at first must not bear anger at love for brother wished for bride be lost in dismay that phineas must love one after having once loved by sheer force of mind have conquered that dismay that feeling of desolation at heart have almost taught to hope phineas might succeed with violet wished why must not have what wished whom so fondly idolised be not fault that be not man wife have chosen to arrange otherwise be not bound to assist now in present object of reasonable wish have got over in heart that difficulty about brother must not quite conquer other difficulty must not bring to plead cause with violet have not brought a yet to do now be accused of idolatry for phineas by husband with lot of others in lot violet be of course included must not be better that two must be brought together must not friend husband still be friend must not then forget to love must not then be safer than be now a sat alone struggling with difficulty have not a yet forgotten to love be a yet safe chapter xlv miss effingham four lover one morning

said man opening door miss effingham be not there lady baldock be sitting alone lady laura perceived that have be caught in net specially wished to avoid now lady baldock have not actually openly quarrelled with lady laura kennedy with lord brentford have conceived strong idea that niece violet be countenanced in impropriety by standish family generally that therefore standish family be to be regarded a family of enemy there be doubtless in mind considerable confusion on subject for did not know whether lord chiltern mr finn be suitor whom most feared be aware after sort of muddled fashion that claim of two wicked young men be antagonistic to other be regarded by a emanation from same source of iniquity therefore without going deeply into machination of lady laura without resolving whether lady laura be injuring by pressing brother a suitor upon miss effingham by pressing rival of brother still became aware that be duty to turn cold shoulder on two house in portman square grosvenor place difficulty in doing be very great may be said that lady baldock be placed in unjust cruel position before end of may have proposed to leave london to take daughter violet down to

pain chapter xlvii mr mildmay bill will be necessary that must go back in story for very short period in order that reader may be told that phineas finn be duly re elected at loughton after appointment at treasury board there be little trouble at loughton something more of expense than have before encountered mr quintus slide absolutely came down be proposed by mr vellum for borough mr vellum being gentleman learned in law hostile to interest of noble owner of saulsby be able to raise little trouble against hero mr slide be proposed by mr vellum seconded by mr vellum clerk though a afterwards appeared mr vellum clerk be not in truth elector went to poll like man received three vote at twelve o'clock withdrew in must hardly have afforded compensation for expense mr slide backer must have encountered have opportunity of making speech word of be reported in people banner if speech be made in language given in report mr slide be really possessed of oratorical power most of who read speech in column of people banner be probably not aware how favourable opportunity of retouching sentence in type have be given to mr slide by fact of connection with newspaper speech have be very severe upon hero though speaker have be so hooted pelted at loughton a to have be altogether inaudible so maltreated that in point of fact have not be able to speak above tenth part of speech at nevertheless speech did give phineas certain amount of pain why phineas must have read who can tell who be there that abstains from reading that be printed in abuse of in speech a be printed mr slide declared that have thought of being returned for borough knew too well how borough be managed what slave elector be how groaned under tyranny from hitherto have be unable to release of course earl nominee lacquey a honourable gentleman might be called must be returned earl must order to return whichever of lacqueys pleased there be something peculiarly pleasing to democratic ear in word lacquey one serving big man service may be be big man lacquey in people banner speech throughout be very bitter mr phineas finn who have previously served in parliament a lacquey of irish earl have be turned off by have now fallen into service of english earl be lacquey chosen for present occasion quintus slide who boasted to be man of people must tell that day of thraldom be coming to end that enfranchisement be near at hand friend of people mr turnbull have clause in breech pocket must either force down unwilling throat of mr mildmay else drive imbecile premier from office by carrying in teeth loughton a loughton must be destroyed must be born again in better birth a part of real electoral district sending real member chosen by real constituency to real parliament in day must come soon mr quintus slide rather thought that mr phineas finn must be found nowhere rather thought also that when showed again a certainly must do in midst of democratic electoral district a popular candidate for honour of representing in parliament that democratic electoral district must accord to reception very different from be now receiving from earl lacqueys in parliamentary village of loughton prettier bit of fiction than sentence a composing part of speech delivered proposed to be delivered at loughton phineas thought have never seen when read at close of speech though earl hired bully did worst remark of mr slide be received by people with reiterated cheering threw back in chair at treasury roared poor fellow have be three minute on leg have received three rotten egg one dead dog have retired not half of speech a printed in people banner have be quoted sin of phineas who in spite of inability to open mouth in public have be made treasury hack by aristocratic influence by aristocratic influence not confined to male sex be described at great length in such language phineas for while be fool enough to think that must be duty to belabour mr slide with horsewhip notion however did not endure long with when mr monk told that thing of kind came a matter of course be comforted found much more difficult to obtain comfort when weighed argument brought forward against abomination of such borough a for sat reflected that if mr turnbull brought forward clause phineas finn must be bound to vote against clause knowing clause to be right because be servant of government argument even though appeared in people banner be true argument have on one occasion admitted truth to friend lady laura in presence of great cabinet minister husband what business have man a down there be there single creature who want lady laura have said suppose anybody doe want mr quintus slide phineas have replied be disposed to think elector must choose man do want at present have choice left to be quite satisfied said lady laura angrily then lady laura continued phineas that alone must be sufficient to prove privilege of returning member to parliament be too much for ca defend be defended by tradition said mr kennedy by great utility said lady laura bowing to young member who be present forgetting very useless old gentleman cousin who have sat for borough for many year in country doe do to go too fast said mr kennedy then mixture of vulgarity falsehood pretence said lady laura shuddering a mind recurred to fact that mr quintus slide have contaminated loughton by presence be told that hardly let leave place alive mr kennedy lady laura might think about loughton general question of small borough be found by government to great cost that mr turnbull clause be reality after two month of hard work question of franchise have be settled rating renting new newfangled fancy franchise one fancied franchise for borough franchise for county franchise single dual three cornered four sided by various clause to committee of whole house have agreed after score of division matter of franchise have be settled doubt there be house of lord there might yet be shipwreck be generally believed that lord must hardly look at bill that must not even venture on amendment lord must only be too happy to let matter be settled by common then after franchise came redistribution how sick of subject be member of government one must tell who did not see weary face whole house be sick having be whipped into various lobby night after night during heat of summer for week past redistribution why must there be redistribution have got must get beautiful franchise must not see what must do for why redistribute anything ala be too late to go back to so blessed idea a redistribution must have there must be a little redistribution a possible men be sick of must not be exigeant something must be done for overgrown county something for new town have prospered in brick mortar must be easy to crush up peccant borough two borough have be discovered in sin few borough now blessed with two member might consent to be blessed only with one fifteen small clause might settle redistribution in spite of mr turnbull if only mr daubeny must be good natured weather be very hot tedium of session have be very great anxiety of minister be very pressing have effect in impairing energy of mr turnbull be a instant a oratorical a hostile a indignant about redistribution a have be about franchise have be sure then be sure now that minister desired to burke question to deceive people to produce bill must be bill brought out clause made loughton instance must honourable gentleman who sat lowest on treasury bench who at moment be in sweet confidential intercourse with right honourable gentleman now president of board of trade who have once be friend of people must young lord of treasury get up in place tell that peer of parliament have at present voice in sending member to house of common that peer must have voice if bill a proposed by government be passed in present useless ineffectual conservative most dishonest form phineas who replied to who told turnbull that must not answer for peer that thought probable that most peer must by opinion somewhat influence opinion of elector be thought to have got out of difficulty very well there be clause of mr turnbull to be dealt with clause directly disfranchising seven single winged borough of loughton be of course one clause to government must either submit object submission must be certain defeat in one way objection must be a certain defeat in if gentleman on other side be not disposed to assist minister be said that cabinet be divided mr gresham mr monk be for letting seven borough go mr mildmay must not bring to obey mr turnbull mr palliser supported when mr mildmay be told that mr daubeny must certainly go into same lobby with mr turnbull respecting seven borough be reported to have said that in case mr daubeny must be prepared with government mr daubeny made beautiful speech about seven borough seven sin seven star seven church seven lamp must make party question of gentleman who usually acted with must vote a own sense of right wrong directed from expression of special sanction be considered that gentleman be not accustomed to exercise privilege now accorded to in regarding question a one of right wrong in looking at what believed to be wish of country interest mr daubeny being simply humble member of house must support clause of honourable gentleman almost to whom have be surrendered privilege of using own judgment for occasion only used discreetly a chief have used mr turnbull carried clause by majority of fifteen be then be mr gresham rising after division said that right honourable friend first lord of treasury be too tired to return to house have requested to state that government must declare purpose at pm on following evening phineas though have made little speech in answer to mr turnbull with good humoured flippancy have recorded vote in favour of seven borough with sore heart much a disliked mr turnbull knew that mr turnbull be right in have spoken to mr monk on subject a be asking mr monk permission to throw up office vote against mr mildmay mr monk be angry with telling that conscience be of restless uneasy sort be useful manly know said mr monk none better than mr mildmay that can not justify such borough a loughton by theory of parliamentary representation more than can justify fact that huntingdonshire must return a many member a east riding there must be compromise must trust to others who have studied matter more thoroughly than to say how far compromise must go at present moment be influence of peer not paucity of elector said phineas have peer influence in county must disfranchise westmoreland believe finn if want to be useful must submit in such matter to with whom act phineas have answer to make be not happy in mind be le happy perhaps because be very sure that mr mildmay must be beaten mr low in day harassed sorely mr low be very keen against such borough a loughton declaring that mr daubeny be quite right to join standard to of mr turnbull on issue mr low be reformer now phineas found obliged to fight losing battle on behalf of acknowledged abuse never went near bunce unfortunately for bunce caught once in street showed mercy slide be little on in banner other day eh mr finn too a told mr slide can be just a heavy a plea bunce be in course press be free thank god a yet be good rattling away at earl little borough when be sure to go of course will go mr finn think will whole seven on 'ouse must do tell be mr mildmay own work sticking out for keeping on 'em be very old so will forgive must go mr finn will know about soon bunce if get seat mr finn suppose will see back at inn hope may be better than being member for loughton mr finn may be sure of then mr bunce passed on mr turnbull carried clause loughton be doomed loughton other six deadly sin be anathematized exorcised finally got rid of out of world by voice of gentleman who have be proclaiming beauty of such pleasant vice life who in heart hated change tended towards popular representation not le be mr mildmay beaten in accordance with promise made by first lieutenant immediately after vote be taken prime minister came forward on next evening made statement have already put resignation into hand of majesty majesty have graciously accepted be very old felt that time have come in behoved to retire into leisure thought have perhaps earned have hoped to carry bill a last act of political life be too old too stiff a said in prejudice to bend further than have bent already must leave completion of matter in other hand majesty have sent for mr gresham mr gresham have already seen majesty mr gresham other colleague though dissented from clause have be carried by united effort of gentleman opposite to of gentleman below on own side of house be younger men than must for country sake for sake of majesty endeavour to carry bill through there must then of course be dissolution future government must no doubt depend on choice of country from be understood that mr gresham be to go on with bill to conclusion might be division carried against that new secretary of state for foreign affair must be chosen phineas understood also that have lost seat at loughton for borough of loughton there must never again be election if have be mr mildmay must have thrown bill up altogether lord brentford said afterwards of course be not for to interfere session be protracted for two month after beyond time at grouse must have be shot by rd of august became law of land will never get over said mr ratler to mr finn seated one terribly hot evening on bench behind cabinet minister never suppose session for work be ever known before think what be to have to keep men together in august with thermometer at degress river stinking like like very mischief mr ratler however did not die on last day of session laurence fitzgibbon resigned rumour reached ear of phineas a to cause of certain cause be told be said that lord cantrip have insisted upon laurence having by mischance be called upon for official statement during unfortunate period of absence there be however mystery about mystery be not so wonderful a triumph to phineas when mr gresham offered place will have seat said phineas will none of have seat to morrow said mr gresham will be at loss to find place to stand for election will not come on till november

omnium must be no more to than other man yet duke of omnium be more to than other men when came down into drawing room be angry with stood apart be then angry with again because stood apart why must

possible respect for duke of st bungay must not take much interest in wailing of duchess on husband behalf thing do seem to be so very uncomfortable now said duchess thinking partly of resignation of mr mildmay partly of fact that own old peculiar maid who have lived with for thirty year have retired into private life not so very bad duchess hope said phineas observing at moment madame max goesler eye be brilliant with triumph then there came upon sudden ambition that must like to cut out duke of omnium in estimation of madame max goesler brightness of madame max goesler eye have not be thrown away upon hero violet effingham came at appointed time to surprise of phineas be brought to matching by lord brentford phineas at first thought that be intended that earl son must meet make up quarrel

asked than answered be quite true that great difficulty have be got over laura have have her money if father will only acknowledge that have wronged throughout from beginning to end will go to saulsby to morrow must cut out at next day only that loughton be not loughton longer can not expect father to do therefore there be difficulty so have have that awfully ponderous duke here how did get on with admirably condescended to do something called shaking hand with be greatest old dust out said lord chiltern disrespectfully did take notice of violet not that observed ought not to be allowed into same room with after there be short pause phineas felt hesitation in speaking of miss effingham to lord chiltern how do get on with asked lord chiltern here be question for man to answer question be so hard to be answered that phineas did not at first make attempt to answer know exactly ground stand on continued lord chiltern have refused three time have be more fortunate lord chiltern a asked question looked full into finn face in manner be irresistible look be not one of anger even of pride be not indeed without strong dash of fun such a be showed phineas that lord chiltern intended to have answer said at last have not be more fortunate perhaps have changed mind said host have not changed mind said phineas quickly how stand then come let be honest to other told down at willingford must quarrel with man who attempted to cut out with violet effingham made up mind that must do so therefore quarrelled with ca always be fighting duel hope may not have to fight must be absurd said lord chiltern rather think that what did be absurd upon life did not see other way out of however be over how be to be now what be to say in answer to asked phineas just truth have asked suppose yes have asked have refused yes have refused mean to ask again will if ever think that there be chance indeed chiltern believe will whether think have chance not then start fairly finn certainly will do

rang nearly hour ago fellow be hanging about outside door interview have in one respect be very pleasant to phineas in have be very bitter be pleasant to to know that lord chiltern be again friend be delight to to feel that half savage high spirited young nobleman who have be so anxious to fight with to shoot be nevertheless ready to own that have behaved well lord chiltern have in fact acknowledged that though have be anxious to blow out hero brain be aware time that hero be good sort of fellow phineas understood felt that be pleasant with understanding accompanying pleasure there be conviction in heart that distance between lord chiltern violet must daily grow to be le still le that lord chiltern must afford to be generous if miss effingham must teach to be fond of lord chiltern what have phineas finn to offer in opposition to claim of such suitor that evening lord chiltern took miss effingham out to dinner phineas told that be of course so arranged by lady glencora with express view of serving saulsby interest be almost nothing to at moment madame max goesler be intrusted to have ambition respecting madame max goesler that for time be in abeyance must hardly keep eye off miss effingham yet a well knew observation of must be quite useless knew beforehand with absolute accuracy manner in must treat lover must be kind genial friendly confidential nay affectionate yet manner must mean nothing must give clue to future decision for against lord chiltern be a phineas thought peculiarity with violet effingham that must treat rejected lover a dear familiar friend immediately after rejection of mr finn said madame max goesler eye ear be tell tale of passion hope not said phineas a certainly wish that one must guess how strong be regard for be prettily turned very prettily turned show more readiness of wit than gave credit for under present suffering of course know where heart be men undertake perilous journey to belgium for nothing unfortunate journey to belgium dear madame max really nobody know why went met lord chiltern there oh yes met lord chiltern there there be duel madame max must not ask to criminate of course there be of course be about miss effingham of course lady think bound to refuse gentleman who be so very wicked of course well what follows ah if have not wit enough to see think can be duty to tell wished to caution a friend that eye ear must be more under command will go to saulsby violet said to lord chiltern can not possibly tell a yet said frowning then can tell that ought to go care bit for frown what doe fifth commandment say if have better argument than commandment violet there can be none better do mean to say that commandment be nothing to mean to say sha go to saulsby because be told in twentieth chapter of exodus to honour father mother must believe anybody who told that did anything because of commandment oh lord chiltern people be so prejudiced so used to humbug for most part in least know own motif for what do will go to saulsby to morrow for reward for what reward said violet blushing for only one in world must tempt to do anything must go for sake of duty must not even care to see go much a long for if feeling did not take there be arranged that phineas lord chiltern be to leave matching together phineas be to remain at office october in general election be to take place what have hitherto heard about future seat be most vague be to meet ratler barrington erle in london have be understood that barrington erle who be now at saulsby be to make inquiry a to group of borough of loughton at moment formed one a loughton be smallest of four borough a one of four have for many year have representative of own phineas feared that success must be found there in present agony began to think that there might be strong plea made for few private seat in house of common that propriety of throwing loughton into melting pot be after open to question lord chiltern be to return to london together lord chiltern according to present scheme be to proceed at once to willingford to look after cub hunting nothing that violet phineas must say to must induce to promise to go to saulsby when phineas pressed be told by lord chiltern that be fool for pain by phineas understood perfectly well that when lord chiltern did go to saulsby phineas be to take that a strong evidence that everything be over for a regarded violet effingham when violet expressed eagerness that visit must be made be stopped with assurance that must have done at once if pleased let only be enabled to carry with tidings of betrothal must start for father house without hour delay authority violet must not give when answered after fashion must only tell that be ungenerous at rate be not false replied on one occasion what say be truth there be very tender parting between phineas madame max goesler have learned from pretty nearly history certainly knew more of reality of affair than of in london who have be most staunch friend of course will get seat said a took leave of if understand at never throw over ally so useful a be intention be that in matter nobody will longer have power of throwing over of not throwing over anybody be very well friend cake will still be hot in mouth even though mr daubeny turn purist with mr turnbull to help if want assistance in finding seat will not go to people banner even yet certainly not to people banner quite understand what franchise be continued madame max goesler household in borough said phineas with energy very well household in borough daresay be very fine very liberal though comprehend in least want borough very well wo go to household think will not at first be where will go then oh to great patron of borough to club perhaps to great firm household will know nothing about till be told be not that truth be madame max know where will go be like child lost in wood may understand if see in park lane before end of january will have perished in wood then will come find with troop of householder will come will be there believe in death coming without sign be full of life a spoke have hold of hand there be nobody near be in little book room inside library at matching door though not latched be nearly closed phineas have flattered that madame goesler have retreated there in order that farewell might be spoken without interruption mr finn wonder whether may say one thing continued may say anything to replied not in country in england there be thing one may not say here be tabooed by sort of consent that without reason paused again phineas be at loss to think what be subject on be about to speak must mean must not mean to give outward plain spoken sign that be attached to be peculiar merit of man that be not vain though much be done to to fill with vanity a idea crossed brain hated because have be there to may say anything madame goesler said here in england a plainly a though be in vienna can not say in english said then in french blushing laughing a spoke almost stammering in spite of usual self confidence told that accident have made rich full of money money be drug with money knew be wanted even for householder must not understand come to learn from how faithful woman must be still be holding by hand now raised to lip kissed offer from said be a high minded a generous a honourable a acceptance by must be mean spirited vile ignoble whether fail whether succeed will see before winter be over chapter l again successful phineas also said word of farewell to violet before left matching there be nothing peculiar in little speech to in to of course will see other in london talk of not being in house of course will be in house then phineas have shaken head smiled where be to find requisite number of householder prepared to return a went up to london told that air of house of common be now very breath of nostril life to without must be life to have come within reach of good thing of political life to have made mark so a to have almost insured future success to have be petted young official aspirant of day then to sink down into miserable platitude of private life to undergo daily attendance in law court without brief to listen to men who have come to be much below in estimation social intercourse to sit in wretched chamber up three pair of stair at lincoln inn whereas be now at moment provided with gorgeous apartment looking out into park from colonial office in downing street to be attended by mongrel between clerk errand boy at s d week instead of by private secretary who be son of earl sister be petted by countess daughter innumerable must surely break heart must have done so told must have taken glory in doing have not other thing come in way other thing have come have run risk have thrown dice now when game be so nearly won must be that everything must be lost at last knew that nothing be to be gained by melancholy look at club by show of wretchedness at office london be very empty approaching election still kept there who otherwise must have be looking after first flush of pheasant barrington erle be there be not long in asking phineas what be view ah be so hard to say ratler told that must be looking about ratler be very well in house said barrington be of use for anything beyond suppose be not brought up at london university oh said phineas remembering glory of trinity because there must have be opening what do say to stratford new essex borough broadbury brewer be there already yes ready to spend money like to name let see loughton be grouped with smotherem walker be deal too strong at smotherem to hear of other claim think must dare to propose there be chelsea hamlet will take wack of money have not got wack of money said phineas laughing be devil of think if be must hark back upon place in ireland must get laurence to give up seat what fitzgibbon yes have not ghost of chance of getting into office again nothing on earth must induce to look at paper during week be at colonial office when cantrip spoke to said be 'ah bother cantrip did not like can tell must make give up seat of course 'd have to arrange by phineas understood barrington erle to mean that phineas be in way to give to laurence fitzgibbon adequate compensation for surrender of position a county member be afraid that be out of question said phineas if be to go must not get must have chance at loughshane be thinking of trying said phineas of course know that morris be very ill mr morris be brother of lord tulla be sitting member of loughshane upon word think must try that see where be to put hand on seat in england indeed phineas a listened to must not help thinking that barrington erle though have certainly expressed great deal of solicitude be not a true friend a used to be perhaps phineas have risen too fast barrington erle be beginning to think that might a well be out of way wrote to father asking after borough asking after health of mr morris in letter told own story very plainly almost pathetically perhaps have be wrong to make attempt have made began to believe that have be wrong at rate have made so far successfully failure now must be doubly bitter thought that party to belonged must now remain in office must hardly be possible that new election must produce house of common favourable to conservative ministry with liberal ministry phineas must be sure of place sure of official income if only must find seat be very true be almost pathetic old doctor who be inclined to be proud of son be not unwilling to make sacrifice mr finn declared before daughter that if there be seat in ireland phineas ought to have mary flood jones stood by listening wondering what phineas must do if lost seat must come back live in county clare be like other girl lover poor mary have come to lose ambition to think that girl whose lover stayed at home be happiest nevertheless must have walked way to lord tulla house back again might have availed to get seat for phineas then there came express over from castlemorris doctor be wanted at once to see mr morris mr morris be very bad with gout in stomach according to messenger be supposed that mr morris be dying before dr finn have have opportunity of answering son letter mr morris late member for loughshane have be gathered to father dr finn understood enough of election for parliament of nature of borough to be aware that candidate chance of success be very much improved by being early in field be aware also that death of mr morris must probably create various aspirant for honour of representing loughshane must hardly address earl on subject while dead body of late member be lying in house at bill have passed in late session for reforming constitution of house of common have not touched ireland future measure having be promised to irish for comfort loughshane therefore be a to lord tulla influence same a have ever be have not there plenary power other lord have held in hand in regard to loughton still castlemorris interest must go long way might be possible to stand against must be much more desirable that candidate must have at back dr finn be fully alive to a sat opposite to old lord saying now word about old lord gout in leg arm then about gout in stomach have carried away to world lamented late member for borough poor jack said lord tulla piteously if 'd known need have paid over two thousand pound for last year need doctor indeed said dr finn feeling that patient might perhaps approach subject of borough never must live by rule know said desolate brother very hard to guide be not lord very devil now see do do what be told pretty well doctor sometimes by george do nearly always know what mean by sometimes have be drinking brandy water till be sick of to oblige tell about sometimes doctor expect man to be slave have kept out of stomach thank god yes be very well thanking god must have gone a poor jack have gone if have be most careful man in world be drinking champagne ten day ago must do know lord tulla must talk about own ailment by hour together dr finn who have thought that noble patient be approaching subject of borough be beginning again to feel that double interest of gout be present gout have passed away must be too absorbing however must say little to direct conversation mr morris see lived more in london than do be subject to temptation know what call temptation have temptation of bottle of wine under nose day of life doubt have drink hardly ever take above glass two of brown sherry by george when think of wonder at own courage do indeed man in london lord why deuce must go to london by bye what be to do about borough now let son stand for if will lord have clean swept away brentford seat at loughton have have have have what nice game for to have be forced to help to do there be nobody on earth pity so much a radical peer who be obliged to work like nigger with spade to shovel away ground from under own foot a for care who sits for loughshane did care for poor jack while be alive think will interfere longer be glad lasted jack time lord tulla have probably already forgotten that have thrown jack over for last session one phineas lord began father be now under secretary of state oh have doubt be very fine fellow see be out out radical lord then how can serve with such men a mr gresham mr monk have turned out poor old mildmay among because be not fast enough for tell anxiety of course be for boy prospect seems to have done so well in parliament why stand for marylebone finsbury money know lord sha interfere here doctor if come people then choose to return will say nothing may do just a please tell lambert st george of mockrath be going to stand if doe be d piece of impudence ever heard of be tenant of own though have lease for ever father never owned acre of land in county till uncle died then doctor knew that with little management lord interest might be secured for son phineas came over stood for borough against mr lambert st george contest be sharp enough gentry of neighbourhood must not understand why such man a lord tulla must admit liberal candidate to succeed brother one canvassed for young under secretary with more persistent zeal than did father who when phineas first spoke of going into parliament have produced so many good argument against perilous step lord tulla agent stood aloof desolate with grief at death of late member at moment of family affliction lord tulla declared must not think of matter a borough be known that lord tulla be dreadfully jealous of mr lambert st george whose property in part of county be now nearly equal to own who saw much more company at mockrath than be ever entertained at castlemorris word from lord tulla so said conservative of county must have put mr st george into seat that word be not spoken conservative of neighbourhood swore that lord tulla be renegade contest be very sharp hero be returned by majority of seventeen vote again successful a thought of remembered story of great general who be said to have chained fortune to wheel of chariot seemed to that goddess have never served general with such staunch obedience a have displayed in cause have not everything gone well with so well a almost to justify in expecting that even yet violet effingham must become wife dear dearest violet if must only achieve that general who ever led army across alp must be equal either in success in reward of success then questioned a to what must say to miss flood jones on very night be to meet dear little mary flood jones that evening at neighbour house sister barbara have so told in tone of voice quite understood to imply caution will be so glad to see phineas have replied if there ever be angel on earth be mary said barbara finn know that be a good a gold said phineas gold replied barbara gold indeed be more precious than refined gold phineas perhaps have better not single out for special attention have thought wisest to meet of course said phineas why not be phineas have nothing more to say men of course be different from girl be true barbara at rate laugh at phineas when be thinking of nothing of interest when be making manner of excuse for because know what must be distraction of world in live barbara made more than one attempt to renew conversation before evening came phineas thought that have have enough of did not like being told that excuse be made for after what have done have once kissed mary flood jones behind door be so glad to see mary said coming taking chair by side have be specially warned not to single mary out for attention yet there be chair left vacant a though be expected that must fall into thank did not happen to meet last year did mr finn call mr finn mary be such great man now not at great man if only knew what little men understrappers be in london must hardly speak to be something of state now be not well yes be name give simply mean that if member want to badger one in house about colony be man to be badgered if there be credit to be have be not man who be to have be great thing to be in parliament in government too be great thing for mary to have salary though may only be for year two however will not deny that be pleasant to have be successful have be very pleasant to phineas mamma have be so much rejoiced be so sorry not to see be at floodborough suppose oh yes be at home doe not like coming out at night in winter have be staying here know for two day go home to morrow will ride over call on mother then there be pause in conversation for moment doe not seem odd mary that must see so little of other be so much away of course yes be reason still seems almost unnatural

over see mother will be at home on wednesday suppose yes will be at home upon that got up went away again in evening found near perhaps there be position more perilous to man honesty than in phineas now found that namely of knowing to be quite loved by girl whom almost love of course loved violet effingham who talk best of love protest that man woman can be in love with two person at once phineas be not in love with mary flood jones must have liked to take in arm kiss must have liked to gratify by swearing that be dearer to than world must have liked to have episode did at moment think that might be possible to have one life in london life altogether different at killaloe dear mary said a pressed hand night thing will get settled at last suppose be behaving very ill to did not mean to behave ill rode over to floodborough saw mr flood jones mr flood jones however received very coldly mary did not appear mary have communicated to mother resolution a to future life fact be mamma love can not help if ever chooses to come for here be if doe not will bear a well a can may be very mean of be true chapter li trouble at loughlinter there be dull house at loughlinter during greater part of autumn few men went down for grouse shooting late in season stayed short time when went lady laura be left alone with husband mr kennedy have explained to wife more than once that though understood duty of hospitality enjoyed performance of have not married with intention of living in whirlwind be disposed to think that whirlwind have hitherto be too predominant have said so very plainly with good deal of marital authority autumn winter be to be devoted to cultivation of proper relation between wife doe that mean darby joan wife have asked when proposition be made to mean mutual regard esteem replied mr kennedy in most solemn tone trust that such mutual regard esteem between may yet be possible when lady laura showed letter from brother received week after conversation in lord chiltern expressed intention of coming to loughlinter for christmas returned note to wife without word suspected that have made arrangement without asking be angry must not tell that brother must not be welcome at house be not doing said when saw frown on brow said nothing about anybody doing replied will write to oswald bid not come if wish of course can understand why be coming not to see be

last july deny then lady laura rose up very haughty in gait with something of fire in eye silently left room mr kennedy when found alone be very unhappy looking back in mind to summer week in london remembered that wife have told violet that be to spend christmas at loughlinter that have given muttered assent violet a far a must remember have made reply have be one of thing be so often mentioned not settled felt that have be strictly right in denying that have be settled in presence yet felt that have be wrong in contradicting wife so peremptorily be just man must apologise for fault be austere man must take back value of apology in additional austerity did not see wife for hour after conversation have be narrated when did meet mind be still full of subject laura said be sorry that contradicted be quite used to robert be not used to smiled bowed head wrong by saying that be used to then paused moment said not word only smiled bowed head again remember continued that something be said in presence to miss effingham about coming here at christmas be so slight however that have passed out of memory till recalled by effort beg pardon be unnecessary robert be dear do wish must put off put oswald off brother never yet have seen in house whose fault have that be have said nothing about anybody fault robert merely mentioned fact will let know whether will bid stay away be welcome to come only like assignation for love making assignation clandestine meeting lady baldock must not wish lady baldock do think that violet must exercise secrecy in matter that will not tell lady baldock oswald will be here a soon a know have nothing to do with surely robert must have much to do with why must not two young people meet acknowledged wish of family be that must marry other in matter at rate brother have behaved extremely well mr kennedy said nothing further at time became understanding violet effingham be to be month at loughlinter staying from th of december to th of january that lord chiltern be to come there for christmas with must probably mean three day before christmas came however there be various other source of uneasiness at loughlinter there have be a matter of course great anxiety a to election with lady laura anxiety have be very strong even mr kennedy have be warmed with amount of fire a announcement reached of success of failure english return came first then scotch be quite a interesting to mr kennedy a english own seat be quite safe be not contested neighbouring seat be source of great solicitude then when be over there be tidings from ireland to be received respecting one special borough in ireland lady laura evinced more solicitude than husband approved there be much danger for domestic bliss of house of loughlinter when thing came to pas such word be spoken a election at loughshane produced be in said lady laura opening telegram who be in said mr kennedy with frown on brow to wife be now well accustomed though asked question knew very well who be hero to whom telegram referred friend phineas finn said lady laura speaking still with excited voice with voice be intended to display excitement if there be to be battle on matter there must be battle must display anxiety for young friend fling in husband face if chose to take a injury what must endure reproach from husband because regarded interest of man who have saved life of man respecting whom have suffered so many heart struggle a to whom have at last come to conclusion that must ever be regarded a second brother loved equally with elder brother have done duty by husband so at least have assured must dare to reproach on subject must be ready for battle now battle came be glad of said with eagerness must throw into voice be indeed so ought to be husband brow grew blacker blacker still said nothing have long be too proud to be jealous be now too proud to express jealousy if only must keep expression back wife must not leave subject be so thankful for said pressing telegram between hand be so afraid must fail over do anxiety on subject at last said speaking very slowly what do mean robert how can be over anxious if concerned other dear friend have in world must not be affair of life death to be almost so must have walked from here to london to get election a spoke held up clenched fist of left hand shook while still held telegram in right hand laura must tell that be improper that must speak of man in term of man be stranger to blood stranger to blood what have to do with man be friend be friend saved life have be brother best friend be loved by father be loved by very dearly tell what mean by improper will not have love man very dearly robert tell will have such expression from be unseemly be used only to provoke be to understand be insulted by accusation if so let beg at once may be allowed to go to saulsby must rather accept apology retractation there than here will not go to saulsby there have be accusation there will be apology if please there will be no more mention of mr finn name between for present if will take advice will cease to think of extravagantly must desire to hold further direct communication with have held communication with said lady laura advancing step towards mr kennedy simply pointed to telegram in hand left room now in respect to telegram there have be unfortunate mistake be not prepared to say that there be reason why phineas must not have sent news of success to lady laura have not done so piece of paper still held crushed in hand be in very innocent hurrah for loughshanes finny have done trick such be word written on slip have be sent to lady laura by young cousin clerk in office who acted a private secretary to under secretary of state lady laura resolved that husband must never see innocent rather undignified word occasion have become one of importance such word be unworthy of besides must not condescend to defend by bringing forward telegram a evidence in favour so burned morsel of paper lady laura mr kennedy did not meet again till late that evening be ill said must not come down to dinner after dinner wrote note dear robert think must regret what said to if so pray let have line from to effect yours affectionately l when servant handed to have read smiled thanked girl who have brought said must see mistress just now anything must be better than that servant must know that there be quarrel servant in house have known about for last three hour when door be closed be alone sat fingering note thinking deeply how must answer whether must answer at must not answer not in writing must give wife written record of humiliation have not acted wrongly have said nothing more than now upon mature consideration thought that circumstance demanded yet felt that must in sort withdraw accusation have made if did not withdraw there be knowing what wife might do about ten in evening went up to made little speech dear have come to answer note thought must have written to line have come instead laura now if will listen to for one moment think everything will be made of course will listen said lady laura knowing very well that husband moment must be rather tedious resolving that also must have moment afterwards think will acknowledge that if there be difference of opinion between a to question of social intercourse will be better that must consent to adopt opinion have law on side be not speaking of law well go on robert will not interrupt if can help be not speaking of law be speaking simply of convenience of must feel to be right if wish that intercourse with person must be of such such nature must be best that must comply with wish paused for assent neither assented dissented a far a can understand position of man wife in country there be other way in life can be made harmonious life will not run in harmony expect that ours will be made to do so laura need hardly say to that intend to accuse of impropriety of feeling in reference to young man robert need hardly say indeed to speak own mind think that need hardly have alluded to might go further say that allusion be in insult insult now repeated after hour of deliberation insult will not endure to have repeated again if say word in way suggesting possibility of improper relation between mr finn a to deed thought a god be above will write to father brother desire to take from house if wish to remain here have better be careful a be making speech temper seemed to rise to become hot then hotter till glowed with red heat have be cool till word insult used by have conveyed back to strong impression of own wrong perhaps must rather say strong feeling of necessity of becoming indignant be standing a spoke fire flashed from eye quailed before threat have held out to be very dreadful to be man terribly in fear of world good opinion who lacked courage to go through great harassing trial in order that something better might come afterwards married life have be unhappy wife have not submitted either to will to way have that great desire to enjoy full right so strong in mind of weak ambitious men have told that wife obedience be one of right must not abandon without injury to self esteem have thought about matter slowly a be wont have resolved that must assert have asserted wife told to face that must go away leave must detain legally must not do even that without fact of such forcible detention being known to world how be to answer now at moment so that might not write to father so that self assertion might still be maintained passion laura can never be right must have woman submit to insult without passion at rate be not such woman then there be pause for moment if have nothing else to say to have better leave be far from well head be throbbing came up took hand snatched away from laura said let quarrel certainly will quarrel if such insinuation be repeated made insinuation repeat be be cowed left having first attempted to get out of difficulty of position by making much of alleged illness by offering to send for dr macnuthrie positively refused to see dr macnuthrie at last succeeded in inducing to quit room have occurred about end of november on th of december violet effingham reached loughlinter life in mr kennedy house have gone quietly during intervening three week not very pleasantly name of phineas finn have not be

taking wife to church twice sunday using longer family prayer than approved reading additional sermon sunday evening calling upon for weekly attention to elaborate household account asking for personal assistance in much local visiting initiating into favourite method of family life in country till sometimes almost longed to talk again about phineas finn so that there might be rupture might escape husband asserted within bound submitted longing for coming of violet effingham must not write to father beg to be taken away because husband must read sermon to on sunday evening to violet very shortly after arrival told whole story be terrible said violet make feel never will be married yet what can woman become if remain single curse be to be woman at have always felt so proud of privilege

there be to tell have spoken plainly with true word equally plainly with word be not true violet effingham have almost come to love phineas finn never told friend that be so at one time have almost made up mind to give wealth to adventurer be better man thought than lord chiltern have come to persuade that be almost imperative on to take one other though must talk about remaining unmarried knew that be practically impossible around of baldock a well a of brentford faction must make such life impossible to besides in such case what must do be very well to talk of disregarding world of setting up house for herself be quite aware that project must not be used further than for purpose of scaring amiable aunt if not that then must content to look forward to joint life with lady baldock augusta boreham might of course oblige aunt by taking lord fawn oblige aunt equally by taking mr appledom be strongly of opinion that lord chiltern phineas must be preferable to thinking over always have come to feel that must be lord chiltern phineas have never whispered thought to man woman on journey to loughlinter where then knew that be to meet lord chiltern endeavoured to persuade that must be phineas lady laura have marred by ill told fib there have be moment before in violet have felt that phineas have sacrificed something of truth of love for gave credit to glance of madame goesler eye

crichton unassuming ardent lover have simply taken up with a soon a have failed with friend lady laura have be most enthusiastic in expression of friendship such platonic regard might be very well be

throughout now have be beaten in game absolutely ignored old passion for lady laura a though have never be regarded a model of constancy a man who have loved not wisely perhaps much too well who must now therefore suffer living death hated parliament hated colonial office hated friend mr monk especially hated madame max goesler a to lord chiltern believed that lord chiltern have obtained object by violence must see to yes let consequence be what might must see to that went up by duke of york column a passed athenaeum saw chief lord cantrip standing under portico talking to bishop must have gone on unnoticed have be possible lord cantrip came down to at once have put name down here said lordship what be use said phineas who be profoundly indifferent at moment to club in london ca do harm know will come up in time if must get into ministry will let in at once ministry ejaculated phineas lord cantrip took tone of voice a simply suggestive of humility suspected nothing of profound indifference to minister ministerial honour phineas have intended to express by bye said lord cantrip putting arm through of under secretary wanted to speak to about guarantee will be in devil own mess know so secretary of state went on about rocky mountain railroad phineas strove hard to bear burden with broken back be obliged to say something about guarantee railway frozen harbour something especially about difficulty must be found not in measure in natural pugnacity of opposition in fabrication of garment for national wear great thing be to produce garment will a far a possible defy hole picking may be sometimes be case garment so fabricated will be good also for wear lord cantrip at present moment be very anxious very ingenious in stopping of hole thought that perhaps under secretary be too much prone to indulgence of large philanthropical view without sufficient thought of hole picker on occasion by time that reached brook have be enabled to convince under secretary though have always thought well of under secretary thought better of now than ever have done phineas during whole time have be meditating what must do to lord chiltern when two must meet must take by throat smite happen to know broderick be working a hard at matter a be said lord cantrip stopping opposite to club moved for paper know at end of last session now mr broderick be gentleman in house looking for promotion in conservative government of course must oppose measure must be brought forward by cantrip finn colonial administration then lord cantrip slipped into club phineas went on alone spark of old ambition with reference to brook be first thing to make forget misery for moment have asked lord brentford to put name down be not sure whether have be done threat of mr broderick opposition have be of use towards strengthening of broken back sight of lord cantrip hurrying in at coveted door did do something man ca cut throat blow brain out said to after must go on do work for heart will break yet brokenly live on thereupon went home after sitting for hour over own fire looking wistfully at little treasure have treasure obtained by slight fraud at saulsby now chucked into fire then instantly again pulled out of soiled unscorched dressed for dinner went out to madame max goesler upon whole be glad that have not sent note of excuse man must live even though heart be broken living must dine madame max goesler be fond of giving little dinner at period of year before london be crowded when guest might probably not be called away by subsequent social arrangement number seldom exceeded six eight always spoke of entertainment a being of humblest kind sent out big card preferred to catch people a though by chance when be possible dear mr jones mr smith be coming to tell about sherry on tuesday will come tell too daresay know a much about then there be studious absence of parade dish be not very numerous bill of fare be simply written out once for mistress so circulated round table not word about thing to be eaten thing to be drunk be ever spoken at table at least such word be ever spoken by madame goesler nevertheless who knew anything about dinner be aware that madame goesler gave very good dinner indeed phineas finn be beginning to flatter that knew something about dinner have be heard to assert that soup at cottage in park lane be not to be beaten in london cared for soup to day a slowly made way up madame goesler staircase there have be one difficulty in way of madame goesler dinner party have required patience great ingenuity in management must either have lady must not have there be great allurement in latter alternative knew well that if gave way to prospect of general society must for be closed for ever have be in early day of widowhood in park lane cared little for woman society knew well that society of gentleman without woman must not be that desired knew also that might a effectually crush aspiration by bringing to house indifferent woman woman lacking something either in character in position in talent a by having none at thus there have be great difficulty sometimes have thought that thing must not be done at english be so stiff so hard so heavy yet must not have cared to succeed elsewhere than among english by degree however thing be done prudence equalled wit even suspicious people have come to acknowledge that must not put finger on anything wrong when lady glencora palliser have once dined at cottage in park lane madame max goesler have told that henceforth did not care what suspicious people said since that duke of omnium have almost promised that must come if must only entertain duke of omnium must have done everything there be duke of omnium there to night at time duke of omnium be of course not in london lord fawn be there old friend laurence fitzgibbon who have resigned place at colonial office there be mr mr bonteen with hero made up party one doubted for moment to what source mr bonteen owed dinner mr bonteen be good looking must talk be sufficiently proper kind of thing did a well a other woman at time of year to keep madame max goesler in countenance there be never sitting after dinner at cottage must rather say there be never sitting after madame goesler went so that two lady must not weary other by being alone together mr bonteen understood quite well that be not required there to talk to hostess be a willing a woman to make agreeable to gentleman might meet at madame goesler table thus mr mr bonteen not unfrequently dined in park lane now have only to wait for horrible man mr fitzgibbon said madame max goesler a welcomed phineas be always late what blow for said phineas be always in good time there be limit beyond good time end being shamefully late at once begin here be then a laurence fitzgibbon entered room madame goesler rang bell for dinner phineas found placed between hostess mr bonteen lord fawn be on other side of madame goesler be hardly seated at table before one stated a fact that lord brentford son be reconciled now phineas knew thought that knew that must not a yet be case indeed such be not case though father have already received son letter phineas did not choose to say anything at present about lord chiltern how odd be said madame goesler how often english father quarrel with son how often english son quarrel with father rather said lord fawn who be known for respect have always paid to fifth commandment come from entail primogeniture old fashioned english prejudice of kind said madame goesler lord chiltern be friend of yours mr finn think be friend of mine said phineas ah yes lord chiltern once did something odd together there be little mystery be there not be very little of mystery now said fitzgibbon be about lady be not said mr bonteen affecting to whisper to neighbour be not at liberty to say anything on subject said fitzgibbon have doubt phineas will tell believe about lord brentford said mr bonteen happen to know chiltern be down at loughlinter three day ago that passed through london yesterday on way to place where hunt earl be at saulsby must have gone to saulsby if be true depends upon whether miss effingham will accept said mr bonteen looking over at phineas a spoke a there be two of violet effingham suitor at table subject be becoming disagreeably personal more so a one of party knew surmised something of fact of case cause of duel at blankenberg have become almost a public a duel lord fawn courtship have not be altogether hidden from public eye on present occasion might probably be able to carry better than phineas even presuming to be equally eager in love for knew nothing of fatal truth be unable to hear mr bonteen statement with indifference showed concern in matter by reply lady will be much to be pitied said who doe that chiltern be last man in world to whom must wish to trust happiness of woman for whom cared chiltern be very good fellow said laurence fitzgibbon just little wild said mr bonteen never have shilling in pocket in life said husband regard a simply madman said lord fawn do so wish knew said madame max goesler be fond of madman men who have shilling who be little wild must not bring here mr finn phineas did not know what to say how to open mouth without showing deep concern will be happy to ask if wish replied a though question have be put to in earnest see so much of lord chiltern a used to do believe that violet effingham will accept asked mr bonteen paused moment before spoke then made answer in deep solemn voice with seriousness be unable to repress have accepted said do mean that know said madame goesler yes mean that know have anybody told beforehand that must openly make declaration at madame goesler table must have said that of thing be most impossible must have declared that nothing must have induced to speak of violet effingham in existing frame of mind that must have have tongue cut out before spoke of a promised bride of rival now have declared whole truth of own wretchedness discomfiture be well aware that of there knew why have fought duel at blankenberg be except perhaps lord fawn felt a made statement a to lord chiltern that blushed up to forehead that voice be strange that be telling tale of own disgrace when direct question have be asked have be unable to refrain from answering directly have thought of turning off with jest affectation of drollery have failed at moment have be unable not to speak truth believe word of said lord fawn who also forgot do believe if mr finn say so said mr bonteen who rather liked confusion have caused who must have told finn asked mr bonteen sister lady laura told so said phineas then must be true said madame goesler be quite impossible said lord fawn think may say that know that be impossible if be so must be most shameful arrangement shilling have in world must be swallowed up now lord fawn in making proposal have be magnanimous in offer a to settlement pecuniary provision generally for minute after phineas did not speak word conversation generally be not so brisk bright a be expected to be at madame goesler madame max goesler thoroughly understood hero position felt for must have encouraged questioning about violet effingham have thought that must have led to result now exerted to turn mind of guest to other subject at last succeeded after while too phineas be able to talk drank two three glass of wine dashed away into politics taking earliest opportunity in power of contradicting lord fawn very plainly on one two matter laurence fitzgibbon be of course of opinion that ministry must not stay in long since have left government minister have made wonderful mistake spoke of quite a enemy might speak yet fitz said mr bonteen used to be so staunch supporter have seen error of way can assure said laurence always observe said madame max goesler that when of gentleman resign usually do on very trivial matter resigning gentleman becomes of foe bitterest somebody go on very well with friend agreeing most cordially about everything till find that public virtue can not swallow little detail then resigns one perhaps on other side have attacked in melee be hurt so resigns when have resigned made parting speech full of love gratitude know well after where to look for bitterest hostility to late friend yes be beginning to understand way in politics be done in england be rather severe upon laurence fitzgibbon be man of world bore better than phineas have borne defeat dinner taken altogether be not success so madame goesler understood lord fawn after have be contradicted by phineas hardly opened mouth phineas talked rather too much rather too loudly mr bonteen who be well enough inclined to flatter lord fawn contradicted made mistake said madame goesler afterwards in having four member of parliament who of be have be in office never will have two men in office together again said to mr bonteen dear madame max said mr bonteen resolution ought to be that will never again have two claimant for same young lady in drawing room up stair madame goesler managed to be alone for three minute with phineas finn be a say friend asked voice be plaintive soft there be look of real sympathy in eye phineas almost felt that if two have be quite alone must have told everything have wept at foot said be so never doubted when have declared may venture to say that wish have be otherwise be too late now madame goesler man of course be fool to show that have feeling in such matter fact be heard just before came here have made up mind to send excuse wish have now say that mr finn have made as of myself in estimation have done if may venture to give counsel speak of affair again a though have be personally concerned in in world now day only thing disgraceful be to admit failure have failed need not admit mr finn know ought not to say a much to rather be deeply indebted to will go now madame goesler a wish to leave house with lord fawn will come see soon then phineas promised that must come soon felt a made promise that must have opportunity of talking over love with new friend at rate without fresh shame a to failure laurence fitzgibbon went away with phineas mr bonteen having sent wife away by walked off towards club with lord fawn be very anxious to have few word with lord fawn lord fawn have evidently be annoyed by phineas mr bonteen did not at love young under secretary fellow have become most consummate puppy ever met said a linked on to lord monk one two others among have contrived to spoil altogether believe word of what said about lord chiltern said lord fawn about marriage with miss effingham must be such abominable shame to sacrifice girl said lord fawn only think of everything be gone man be drunkard believe be more reconciled to father than be lady laura kennedy must have have object in saying so perhaps invention of finn altogether said mr bonteen irish fellow be just men for kind of thing man know so violent that nobody can hold said lord fawn thinking of chiltern so absurdly conceited said mr bonteen thinking of phineas man who have never done anything with advantage in world never will wo hold place long said mr bonteen whom do mean phineas finn oh mr finn be talking of lord chiltern believe finn to be very good sort of fellow be undoubtedly clever say cantrip like amazingly will do very well believe word of about lord chiltern then mr bonteen felt to be snubbed soon afterwards left lord fawn alone chapter liv consolation on day following madame goesler dinner party phineas though be early at office be not able to do much work still feeling that a regarded reality of world back be broken might no doubt go on learning after time might be able to exert in perhaps useful altogether uninteresting kind of way doing work simply because be there to be done a carter tailor doe from same cause knowing that man must have bread to live a for ambition idea of doing good love of work for work sake a for elastic spring of delicious beneficent labour be over for must have worked from day till night from night till day from month till month throughout year to have secured for violet effingham assurance that husband position be worthy of own now have motive for such work a a long a took public pay must earn be on next day thing be little better with received note in morning from lord cantrip saying that two be to see prime minister evening in order that whole question of railway to rocky mountain might be understood phineas be driven to work before time of meeting came have once more lost own identity in great idea of colonial welfare have planned peopled mighty region on red river must have sympathy with american democracy when waited upon mr gresham in afternoon said nothing about mighty region indeed left to lord cantrip to explain most of proposed arrangement speaking only word two here there a occasion required be aware that have so far recovered a to be able to save from losing ground during interview be about first irishman have have have be worth salt said mr gresham to colleague afterwards that other irishman be terrible fellow said lord cantrip shaking head on fourth day after sorrow have befallen phineas went again to cottage in park lane in order that might not be balked in search for sympathy wrote line to madame goesler to ask if must be at home will be at home from five to six alone m m g be answer from marie max goesler phineas be of course at cottage few minute after five be not think surprising that man when want sympathy in such calamity a have now befallen phineas finn must seek from woman woman sympathise most effectually with men a men do with woman be perhaps little odd that man when want consolation because heart have be broken always like to receive from pretty woman one must be disposed to think at moment must be profoundly indifferent to matter delight must come to from female beauty that must want must be softness of simply sympathetic soul generally want soft hand a well eye can be bright behind mutual tear lip that will be young fresh a express concern for sorrow thing be added to phineas when went to madame goesler in grief be so glad to see said madame max be very good natured to let come be so good of to trust be sure must come after what took place other night saw that be pained be so sorry for made fool of not at thought that be right to tell when question have be asked if thing be not to be kept secret be better to speak out will get over quicker in way than in other have never seen young lord oh there be nothing amiss about a to what lord fawn said half of be simply exaggeration other half be misunderstood in country be so much to be lord said madame goesler phineas thought moment of matter before replied standish family have be very good to violet effingham have be very good be not fault of of that be now wretched back broken have meditated much on have resolved that must not even think evil of in heart believe that have have anything to do with said have friend always know violet effingham be not mine well know violet be not yours have met did not specially admire then taste of men woman about beauty be never same know be one always life with lord countess girl who always lived with countess feel to be hard to settle down a plain mistress have have plenty of choice among sort of men be not title must not have accepted chiltern unless have what be use of talking of have known other long oh yes

father that be forbidden by husband to do so also forbid such communication said mr kennedy in answer to lady laura told that there be marital command must not consider to be duty to obey when matter have come to pas may be conceived that mr kennedy wife be very unhappy have almost resolved that must take step to enable to live apart from husband have begun to consider what course must pursue if such step be taken wife be subject to husband by law of god man mr kennedy be one who thought much of such law in meantime lady laura carried point went to saulsby leaving husband to go up to london

majestic effect must have achieved have be thoroughly prepared roundness majesty must have gone against grain with son there must have be danger of outbreak a be lord chiltern smiled muttered word about thing being right then made way out of room be great deal better than have hoped said to have come from going in without being announced there be still fear upon that father even yet might prepare speech speak to great peril of mutual comfort meeting with violet be of course pleasant enough now that have succumbed have told have told that loved did not scruple to be a generous a maiden must be who have acknowledged to be conquered have rendered to conqueror must walk with ride with take lively interest in performance of horse listen to hunting story a long a chose to tell in be so good so loving that lady laura be more than once tempted to throw in teeth old often repeated assertion that be not prone to be in love that be not nature to feel ardent affection for man that

account suppose that be untrue in love to violet effingham back be altogether broken by fall be quite aware that such be fact not a yet at least have come to remotest idea that cure be possible early in march heard that lady laura be up in town of course be bound to go to information be given to by mr kennedy who told that have be to scotland to fetch in day there be acknowledged friendship between two there be intimacy indeed mr kennedy be man who be hardly intimate with other man with phineas now then exchanged few word in lobby of house when chanced to meet other met a friend mr kennedy have strong wish to see again in house man respecting whom have ventured to caution wife be thoughtful thinking over found better to ask there one must know that there be reason why phineas must not come to house especially a world knew that phineas have protected from garrotter lady laura be in town now said must go see before long phineas of course promised that must go in day phineas

certain mildly apologetic way still spoke well of young man whom have first introduced into political life only four year since there be earnestness cordiality in barrington erle manner phineas knew that first staunch friend must no longer be regarded a pillar of support there be set of men quite a influential so phineas thought a busy politician of club who be very friendly to be men generally of high position of steady character hard worker who thought quite a much of what man did in office a what said in house lord cantrip thrift fawn be of class be very courteous to phineas envious men began to say of that cared little now for one of party who have not handle to name that preferred to live with lord lordlings be hard upon a great political ambition of life be to call mr monk friend must sooner have acted with mr monk than with other man in cabinet though mr monk have not deserted there have come to be little of late in common between two life be becoming that of parliamentary

forced out of office be indifferent a to direction thing in respect might take with phineas who have achieved declared object in getting into place felt that be almost constrained to adopt view of others let be what might men spoke to a though parliamentary career be wholly at disposal of government a though be like proxy in mr gresham pocket with difference that when directed to get up speak on subject be bound to do so annoyed complained to mr monk mr monk only shrugged shoulder told that must make choice soon discovered mr monk meaning if choose to make parliament profession a have chosen can have right even to think of independence if country find out when be in parliament then invite to office of course thing be different latter be slow career probably must not have suited be meaning of what mr monk said to after official parliamentary honour be greater when seen at distance than found to be now that possessed mr low worked ten hour day must rarely call day own after with work mr low be le of slave more independent than be phineas finn under secretary of state friend of cabinet minister member of parliament since twenty fifth year began to dislike house to think bore to sit on treasury bench who few year since have regarded parliament a british heaven on earth who since have be in parliament have looked at bench with longing envious eye laurence fitzgibbon who seemed to have a much to eat drink a ever bed also to lie on must come go in house a pleased since resignation there be new trouble coming reform bill for england have passed now there be to be reform bill for ireland let pas what bill might must not render necessary new irish election till entire house must be dissolved feared that must be called upon to vote for abolition of own borough for other point almost equally distasteful to knew that must not be consulted must be called upon to vote perhaps to speak be certain that if did so there must be war between constituent lord tulla have already communicated to idea that for certain excellent reason loughshane ought to be spared evil be hoped distant one be generally thought that a english reform bill have be passed last year a irish bill if carried must not be immediately operative doing of thing might probably be postponed to next session when first saw lady laura be struck by great change in look manner seemed to to be old worn judged to be wretched a be have written to to say that must be at father house on such such morning have gone to there be of use coming to grosvenor place said see nobody there house be like prison later in interview told not to come dine there even though mr kennedy must ask why not demanded because everything must be stiff cold uncomfortable suppose wish to make way into lady house if asks not there be sort of smile on face a said must perceive that be very bitter smile can easily excuse yes can excuse then do so if be particularly anxious to dine with mr kennedy can easily do so at club in tone of voice word used hardly attempted to conceal dislike of husband now tell about miss effingham said there be nothing for to tell yes there be much to tell need not spare pretend to deny to have be hit hard so hard have be nearly knocked down will not hurt now to hear of did always love can not say think did after own fashion sometimes think woman must be le cruel said if knew how great be anguish

at madame goesler foot madame goesler what matter who be a long a be young pretty have interest attached to of something more than ordinary position when men tell of cruelty of woman think that woman can be really cruel because man be capable of suffering woman if be thrown aside doe suffer do mean to tell then that be indifferent to miss effingham when thus spoke wonder whether have forgotten that have ever declared to very woman to whom be speaking passion for psha suit lady laura to be harsh to be not speaking thought then lost control of herself poured out to real truth be in whose thought did speak when be on brae of loughlinter be wrong in saying that change be easy to have grown to be so old that can talk to a though far away folly ought to be forgotten be so long ago talk of

interior of africa said phineas be seldom that know anything accurately on subject that have not made matter of careful study said mr monk very often do so even then be very apt to think that men woman understand one most probably know nothing even of mode of thought of man who life next door to suppose not there be general law current in world a to morality 'thou shalt not steal ' for instance have necessarily be current a law through nation first man meet in street will have idea about theft so different from yours that if knew a know own must say that law yours be not even founded on same principle be compatible with man honesty to cheat in matter of horseflesh with man be in traffic of railway share with other man a to woman fortune with fourth anything may be done for seat in parliament while fifth man who stand high among who implores god sunday to write law on heart spends hour of daily toil in system of fraud be regarded a pattern of national commerce mr monk phineas be dining together at mr monk house elder politician of two in little speech have recurred to certain matter have already be discussed between mr monk be becoming somewhat sick of place in cabinet though have not a yet whispered word of sickness to living ear have begun to pine for lost freedom of seat below gangway have be discussing political honesty with phineas hence have come sermon of have ventured to reproduce concluding denunciation phineas be fond of such discussion fond of holding with mr monk in matter fluttering like moth round candle must not perceive that a have made up mind to be servant of public in parliament must abandon idea of independent action unless did so must be neither successful a regarded useful to public whom served must man be honest in parliament yet abandon idea of independence when put such question to mr monk did not get direct answer indeed question be never put directly teaching received be ever of nature to make uneasy be always to effect have taken up trade now seem to be fit for success in have better give up thinking about special honesty yet mr monk must on occasion preach to sermon a have just uttered perhaps there be question more difficult to man mind than of expediency inexpediency of scruple in political life whether must candidate for office be more liable to rejection from leader because be known to be scrupulous because be known to be reverse putting aside fourth commandment theory will come to ireland said phineas will be delighted live in castle know thought everybody did live in castle in ireland said mr monk seemed to do when be there twenty year ago for prefer cottage trip to ireland have be proposed in consequence of certain idea respecting tenant right mr monk be beginning to adopt a to mind of politician be becoming moved have be very well to put down fenianism ribandmen repeal everything have be put down in ireland in way of rebellion for last seventy five year england ireland have be apparently joined together by law of nature so fixed that even politician liberal a be mr monk liberal a be mr turnbull must not trust to think disunion must be for good of irish have taught that certainly must not be good for english if be incumbent on england to force upon ireland maintenance of union for own sake for england sake because england must not afford independence established so close against own rib be at rate necessary to england character that bride thus bound in compulsory wedlock must be endowed with best privilege that wife can enjoy let at least not be kept mistress let be bone of bone flesh of flesh if be to live together in married state between husband wife warm word now then matter little if there be thoroughly good understanding at bottom let there be that good understanding at bottom what about protestant church what about tenant right mr monk have be asking question for time past in regard to church have long made up mind that establishment in ireland be cry sin man have married woman whom knew to be of religion different from own then insisted that wife must say that believed thing knew very well that did not believe a mr monk well knew subject of protestant endowment in ireland be so difficult that must require almost more than human wisdom to adjust be one of matter almost seemed to require interposition of higher power coming of apparently chance event to clear away evil a fire come pestilential alley be removed a famine come men be driven from want ignorance dirt to seek new home new thought across broad water a war come slavery be banished from face of earth in regard to tenant right to arrangement by tenant in ireland might be at least encouraged to lay out what little capital might have in labour money without being at once called upon to pay rent for outlay be own a well a for land be not own mr monk thought that be possible that if man must look hard enough might perhaps be able to see way a to that have spoken to two of colleague on subject two men in cabinet whom believed to be most thoroughly honest in idea a public servant duke mr gresham there be so much to be done then so little be known upon subject will endeavour to study said mr monk if can see way do said mr gresham of course can not bind must be glad to see named in queen speech at beginning of next session said mr monk be long way off a yet said mr gresham laughing who will be in then who will be out so matter be disposed of at time mr monk did not abandon idea rather felt more bound to cling to because received so little encouragement what be seat in cabinet to that must on account omit duty have not taken up politics a trade have sat far behind treasury bench below gangway for many year without owing man shilling must afford to do so again be different with phineas finn a mr monk understood understanding felt bound to caution young friend may be question whether caution did not do more harm than good will be delighted said to go over with in august think that if be must take up matter why not want to fight battle singlehanded desire such glory must wish to have better lieutenant than have subject of be really fond be beginning to understand in regard to can make useful mean canada business yes will grow to other matter a regard colony there be nothing so important to public man a that must have own subject thing understands in respect of can make really useful then there come change yes man who have half learned how to have ship built without waste be sent into opposition be then brought back to look after regiment perhaps have to take up beautiful subject study of career of india nevertheless if have subject stick to at rate a long a will stick to said phineas if man take up own subject independent of government man can drive from how often doe do anything look at annual motion come forward in hand of private men ballot for instance be becoming more more apparent day that legislation must be carried by government must be carried in obedience to expressed wish of people truest democracy that ever have chance of living be that be now establishing in great britain then leave tenant right to people cabinet why must take up mr monk paused moment two before replied if choose to run muck there be reason why must follow be old be young want nothing from politics a profession do moreover have congenial subject where be need not disturb for tell in confidence can not speak so comfortably of own position will go see at rate said phineas yes said mr monk will go see thus in month of may be settled between that a soon a session must be over incidental work of office must allow phineas to pack up be off two must start together for ireland phineas felt rather proud a wrote to father asked permission to bring home with cabinet minister a visitor at time reputation of phineas at killaloe a well in mind of killaloeians generally a in of inhabitant of paternal house stood very high indeed how must father think that son have done badly when before be thirty year of age be earning l year how must father not think well of son who have absolutely paid back certain money into paternal coffer money so repaid have not be much repayment of such money at killaloe have be regarded a little short of miraculous news of mr monk coming flew about town about county about diocese people began to say good thing about old doctor only son mr finn have long since be quite sure that real black swan have be sent forth out of nest sister finn for time past have felt in social gathering stood quite on different footing than formerly because of brother be asked about in county two of have be staying only last easter with molonys molonys of poldoodie how must father mother sister not be grateful to son to brother to veritable black swan out of nest a for dear little mary flood jones eye became suffused with tear a in solitude thought how much out of reach swan be flying yet took joy in swanhood swore that must love still that must love always might bring home with to killaloe mr monk cabinet minister of course might when mr finn first heard of august arrival felt a though must like to expend in entertaining though hour whole cabinet phineas during spring have of course met mr kennedy frequently in about house have become aware that lady laura husband from time to time made little overture of civility to taking now again by button hole walking home with a far a joint path allowed asking once twice to come dine in grosvenor place little advance towards repetition of old friendship phineas must have avoided altogether have be possible invitation to mr kennedy house did refuse feeling positively bound to do so by lady laura command let consequence be what might when did refuse mr kennedy must assume look of displeasure leave phineas must hope that work be done then there must come encounter invitation must be repeated at last about middle of may there came note dear finn will dine with on wednesday th give long notice because seem to have so many appointment yours always robert kennedy have alternative must refuse even though double notice have be given must only think that mr kennedy be very obtuse man one who must not take hint hope that might succeed at last so wrote answer not intended to be conciliatory dear kennedy be sorry to say that be engaged on th yours always phineas finn at period did best to keep out of mr kennedy way must be very cunning in manoeuvre that must not be alone together be difficult a sat on same bench in house consequently saw other almost day of life nevertheless thought that with little cunning might prevail especially a be not unwilling to give so much of offence a might assist own object when mr kennedy called upon at office day after have written above note have mean of escape be sorry can not come to on th mr kennedy said a soon a be seated phineas be taken so much by surprise that cunning failed well yes said be very sorry very sorry indeed seems to finn that have have reason for avoiding of late know have done anything to offend nothing on earth said phineas be wrong then in supposing that anything beyond mere chance have prevented from coming to house phineas felt that be in terrible difficulty felt also that be being rather ill used in being thus cross examined a to reason for not going to gentleman dinner thought that man ought to be allowed to choose where must go where must not go that question such a be very uncommon mr kennedy be sitting opposite to looking more grave more sour than usual now own countenance also became little solemn be impossible that must use lady laura name yet must in way let persecuting friend know that further invitation must be of use that there be something beyond mere chance in not going to grosvenor place how be to do difficulty be so great that must not see way out of so sat silent with solemn face mr kennedy then asked question made difficulty ten time greater have wife asked not to come to house be necessary now that must make rush get out of trouble in way to tell truth kennedy think want to see there doe not answer question have asked not to come said that left on mind impression that must sooner did not come what did say how can answer such question a kennedy be fair to ask quite fair think think quite unfair must decline to answer can not imagine what expect to gain by cross questioning in way of course man like to go to house if doe not believe that everybody there will make welcome lady laura used to be great friend hope be not enemy now thing will occur that cause friendship to grow cool have quarrelled with father with lord brentford with brother since duel mean upon word honour can not stand will not have not a yet quarrelled with anybody must quarrel with if go on in way be quite unusual that man must be put through facing after fashion must beg that there may be end of then must ask lady laura can say what like to own wife of course can not hinder upon mr kennedy formally shook hand with in token that there be positive breach between a two nation may still maintain alliance though have made up mind to hate other thwart other at turn took leave phineas a sat at window looking out into park thinking of what have passed must not reflect disagreeable a mr kennedy have be to must probably make much more disagreeable to wife for thought that have got out of scrape very well by exhibition of little mock anger chapter lix earl wrath reader may remember that rumour have be conveyed to phineas rumour indeed reached from source regarded a very untrustworthy that violet effingham have quarrelled with lover must probably have paid attention to rumour beyond necessarily attached to tidings a to matter so full of interest to have not be repeated to in quarter bird have told that violet effingham have broken with lover madame goesler said to one day what bird asked ah that can not tell will confess to that bird tell news be seldom very credible be often not very creditable must take bird word for what may be worth be said that have quarrelled daresay if truth be known be billing cooing in other arm at moment phineas did not like to be told of billing cooing did not like to be told even of quarrelling though be to quarrel must do no good must rather that nobody must mention name to so that back have be so utterly broken might in process of time get cured from what knew of violet thought very improbable that even be to quarrel with one lover must at once throw into arm of did feel too that there must be meanness in taking be willing to be so taken nevertheless rumour coming to in way from different source almost made incumbent on to find out truth began to think that broken back be not cured that perhaps after be not in way of being cured be not possible that there might be explanation then went to work built castle in air so constructed a to admit of possibility of violet effingham becoming wife have be in april at time that knew of violet be that be not yet in london thought that knew same a to lord chiltern earl have told that chiltern be not in town expected in town a yet in saying so have seemed to express displeasure against son phineas have met lady baldock at house frequented have be quite surprised to find graciously received by old woman have said not word of violet have spoken of lord chiltern mentioning name in bitter wrath be friend of mine said phineas smiling friend indeed mr finn know what sort of friend believe that be friend be afraid be not worthy of having friend phineas did not quite understand from lady baldock be signifying to that badly a have thought of a suitor for niece must have preferred especially now when people be beginning to speak well of to terrible young man who from youth upwards have be to cause of fear trembling of course be desirable that violet must marry elder son peer heir kind of thing in lady baldock eye be most desirable nevertheless anything be better than lord chiltern if violet must not take mr appledom lord fawn in heaven name let take young man who be kind worthy steady who be civilised in manner must doubt be amenable in regard to settlement lady baldock have so far fallen in world that must have consented to make bargain with niece almost bargain so long a lord chiltern be excluded phineas did not quite understand when lady baldock asked to come to berkeley square perceived that help be being proffered to where certainly have not looked for help be frequently with lord brentford who talked to constantly on matter connected with parliamentary life after having be intimate friend of daughter of son now seemed to be lot to be intimate friend of father earl have constantly discussed with arrangement with son have lately expressed a only half satisfied with such reconciliation a have taken place phineas must perceive that from day to day earl be le le satisfied must complain bitterly of son complain of silence complain of not coming to london complain of conduct to violet complain of idle indifference to anything like proper occupation have never a yet said word to show that there have be quarrel between violet lover phineas have felt that must not ask question mr finn said earl to one morning a soon a entered room have just heard story have almost seemed to to be incredible nobleman manner be very stern fact that called young friend mr finn showed at once that something be wrong what be have heard lord said phineas that chiltern went over last year to belgium fought duel there now must have be case in set among lived lord brentford son daughter phineas finn old lord be only man who have not heard of duel before have even penetrated to dull ear of mr kennedy reminding a did so that wife have told lie be fact that rumour of duel have reached earl till morning be true said phineas have never be so much shocked in life never have idea that have thought of aspiring to hand of miss effingham lord voice a said be very stern a aspired in vain a chiltern have be successful need not now be made reproach against know what to think of mr finn be so much surprised that hardly know what to say must declare opinion at once that behaved very badly know how much know lord how much know circumstance of little affair permit to be explicit about a have expressed opinion so openly must allow to express mine to say that a far a can judge of own action did not behave badly at do intend to defend duelling sir if mean to tell that duel be of sinful have nothing to say suppose be defence of merely go to manner in duel be fought fact that fought with son can not conceive how can have come to house a guest stood upon interest for borough when at time be doing very best to interpose between chiltern lady whom so well knew wished to become wife phineas be aware that earl must have be very much moved indeed when thus permitted to speak of borough said nothing now however though earl paused then angry lord went on must say that there be something something almost approaching to duplicity in such conduct if be to defend by evidence lord brentford must have to go back to exact date date not of fact must verify date a to feeling must not be verified must be useless can only say that believe know what honour truth of gentleman demand even to verge of self sacrifice have done nothing ought to place character a gentleman in jeopardy if will ask son think will tell same have asked be who told of duel when did tell lord just now morning thus phineas learned that lord chiltern be at moment in house at least in london did complain of conduct complain of sir complain of very bitterly placed greatest confidence in especially in regard to son affair deceived earl be very angry be more angry from fact that young man who have offended to whom have given such vital assistance when assistance be needed have used that assistance to utmost before sin be found out have phineas still be sitting for loughton so that earl must have said to be now bound to retreat from borough because have offended patron think that must have forgiven offender allowed to remain in seat there must have be scene earl must have be pacified now offender be beyond reach altogether having used borough a most convenient stepping stone over difficulty having so used just at time when be committing sin there be good fortune about phineas added greatly to lord wrath then to tell truth have not that rich consolation for phineas gave credit lord chiltern have told that morning that engagement between violet be at end have so preached to lord about duty son have said to father that find obliged to give sermon at second hand till can bear no longer of phineas knew nothing a yet earl however be so imprudent in anger that before interview be over have told whole story yes deceived continued can never trust again be for lord to tell of must have increased anger against own son when wanted to fight be to come like sneak at school tell story know what must have thought of have done so when be over be to come tell then think what must have done when be young may be quite sure that did same have gained have got that wanted have also got that wanted have helped lord brentford can put hand on heart say have be honest to have got nothing wanted said earl in despair lord chiltern miss effingham will be man wife will not have quarrelled with be so obstinate that will not bear with then be true even though rumour have reached through laurence fitzgibbon madame max goesler at rate lord have not be fault said after moment hesitation earl be walking up down room angry with at own mistake in having told story not knowing what further to say to visitor have be in habit of talking so freely to phineas about son that must hardly resist temptation of doing so still yet be impossible that must swallow anger continue in same strain lord said phineas after while can assure that grieve that must be grieved have received so much undeserved favour from family that owe debt can never pay be sorry that must be angry with now hope that time may come when will think le severely of conduct be about to leave room when earl stopped will give word said earl that will think more of miss effingham phineas stood silent considering how might answer proposal resolving that nothing must bring to pledge a suggested while there be yet ledge for hope to stand on say that mr finn will forgive everything can not acknowledge have done anything to be forgiven say repeated earl everything will be forgotten there need be cause for alarm lord said phineas may be sure that miss effingham will not think of will give word lord certainly not have right to ask pursuit be open to a to other man who may choose to follow have hardly vestige of hope of success be barely possible must succeed if be true that miss effingham be disengaged will endeavour to find opportunity of urging suit must give up everything have seat in parliament ambition of life for barest chance of success when have accepted son desisted of course have now heard from more source than one of have changed mind if be so be free to try again earl stood opposite to scowling at said nothing good morning lord good morning sir be afraid must be good bye for long day to come good morning sir earl a spoke rang bell then phineas took up hat departed a walked away mind filled gradually with various idea springing from word lord brentford have spoken what account have lord chiltern given to father of duel hero be man very sensitive a to good opinion of others in spite of bold assertion of own knowledge of what became gentleman be beyond measure solicitous that others must acknowledge claim at rate to title thought that have be generous to lord chiltern a went back in memory over almost word have be spoken in interview have just passed fancied that be able to collect evidence that antagonist at blankenberg have not spoken ill of a to charge of deceit earl have made against told that earl have made in anger must not even think hardly of earl who have be so good friend to believed in heart that earl have made accusation out of wrath not out of judgment can not think have be false to phineas said to be very sad to that must have to quarrel with family of standish a must not feel that be who have put on foot seemed a though be never to see lady laura again except when chanced to meet in company on occasion simply bowed to now earl have almost turned out of house though there have be to certain extent reconciliation between lord chiltern in day never saw friend who have once put upon bonebreaker now now that violet effingham be again free how be possible to avoid renewal of enmity between must however endeavour to see lord chiltern at once then thought of violet of violet again free of violet a again possible wife for of violet to whom might address at rate without scruple a to own unworthiness everybody concerned many who be not concerned at be aware that have be among lover thought that must perceive that who interested on subject have regarded a only horse in race likely to run with success against lord chiltern have received offer without scorn have always treated a though be favoured friend though not favoured a lover now even lady baldock be smiling upon asking to house a though red faced porter in hall in berkeley square have never be ordered to refuse moment admission inside door have be very humble in speaking of own hope to earl surely there might be chance what if after little strain have have in back be to be cured after such fashion a when got to lodging found card from lady baldock informing that lady baldock must be at home on certain night that there must be music must not go to lady baldock on night named a must be necessary that must be in house did much care to go there a violet effingham be not in town must call explain endeavour to curry favour in way at once wrote note to lord chiltern addressed to portman square a be in town can not meet come dine with at club on saturday be note after few day received following answer dated from bull at willingford why on earth must chiltern be staying at bull at willingford in may old shop at w friday dear phineas ca dine with because be down here looking after cripple writing sporting novel tell ought to do something so be going to do hope think turned informer against in telling earl of pleasant little meeting on sand have become necessary be too much of man to care much for truth being told be terribly angry with with fact be be so blindly unreasonable that one can not regard anger endeavoured to tell story truly so told certainly must not have injured in estimation did very sorry old fellow hope will get over be good deal more important to than to c there be not word about violet then be hardly to be expected that there must be word about violet be not likely that man must write to rival of own failure yet there be flavour of violet in letter must not have be there so phineas thought if writer have be despondent pleasant little meeting on sand have be convened altogether in respect of violet telling of story to earl must have arisen from discussion about violet lord chiltern must have told father that phineas be rival must rejected suitor have written on subject in such strain to correspondent if have believed own rejection to be certain then lord chiltern be not like anybody else in world be impossible to judge of by one experience of motif of others shortly afterwards phineas did call in berkeley square be shown up at once into lady baldock drawing room whole aspect of porter countenance be changed towards from too gathered good augury have surprised surprise be far greater when on entering room found violet effingham there alone little fresh colour came to face a greeted though can not be said that blushed behaved admirably not endeavouring to conceal little emotion at thus meeting betraying none be injurious to composure be so glad to see mr finn said aunt have just left will be back directly be by mean equal in management of on occasion perhaps may be acknowledged that position be more difficult of two have not seen since engagement have be proclaimed to world now have heard from source be not to be doubted that have be broken off of course there be nothing to be said on matter must not have congratulated in one case must either congratulate condole with on other yet did not know how to speak to a though such event have occurred did not know that be in town said only came yesterday have be know at rome with effinghams since have be indeed have be vagrant can not tell of coming going be hard at work oh yes always be right wish must be something if be only stick in waiting door keeper be so good to be something be such teaching a have jarred against lord chiltern susceptibility have seemed to to be repetition of father sermon man must try to be something said phineas woman must be content to be nothing unless mr mill can pull through now tell have seen lady laura not lately mr kennedy sometimes see in house visit to colonial office of reader have be made aware have not at time a yet be made be sorry for said upon phineas smiled shook head be very sorry that there must be quarrel between two there be quarrel used to think that might do so much for other be of course if must make friend of be man of whom be very hard to make friend said phineas feeling that be dishonest to mr kennedy in saying so thinking that such dishonesty be justified by what owed to lady laura yes be hard what call ungenial wo say anything about will have seen much of earl asked a though such question have reference whatever to lord chiltern oh dear ala ala have not quarrelled with too have quarrelled with have heard miss effingham of what happened last year think be wrong of course be wrong mr finn very likely to chose to defend certainly will not do so to at rate did not think necessary to quarrel with ought to have done so wonder why aunt doe not come then rang bell now have told about said must tell something of about be like knife grinder who have story to tell none at least to be told have doubt got little story interesting enough to ourselves story miss effingham said be of such intense interest to at moment luckily lady baldock came into room phineas be saved from necessity of making declaration at moment must have be most inopportune lady baldock be exceedingly gracious to bidding violet use influence to persuade to come to gathering persuade to desert work to come hear fiddler said miss effingham indeed will not aunt who can tell what colony might suffer from through century such lapse of duty might drive province two into arm of mortal enemy herr moll be coming said lady baldock so be signor scrubi pjinskt who say be greatest man living on flageolet have ever heard pjinskt mr finn phineas never have heard pjinskt a for herr moll there be nothing equal to year at least lady baldock have taken up music season enthusiasm be unable to shake conscientious zeal of young under secretary of state at gathering must have be unable to say word in private to violet effingham chapter lx madame goesler politics may be remembered that when lady glencora palliser be shown into madame goesler room madame goesler have just explained somewhat forcibly to duke of omnium reason for refusing loan of grace villa at como have told duke in so many word that did not mean to give world opportunity of maligning must then have be left to duke to decide whether other arrangement might have be made for taking madame goesler to como have

glencora said that be very much changed indeed finding grace so much changed mr fothergill have made little attempt at dictation have receded with finger very much scorched in attempt be indeed

on one condition when lady glencora entered room madame goesler received beautifully how lucky that must have come just when grace be here said saw uncle carriage of course knew said lady glencora

injurious to prospect of handsome bold faced little boy lady glencora rose to take leave first be not for to show anxiety to force duke out of lady presence if duke be resolved to make fool of nothing that must do must prevent thought that little inspection might possibly be of service that uncle ardour must be cooled by interruption to have be subjected so went immediately afterwards duke followed interruption have at rate saved on occasion from making highest bid for pleasure of madame goesler company at como duke went down with little boy in hand so that there be not opportunity for single word of interest between gentleman lady madame goesler when be alone seated on sofa tucking foot up under a though be seated somewhere in east pushed ringlet back roughly from face then placed two hand to side so that thumb rested lightly on girdle when alone with something weighty on mind must sit in form for hour together resolving trying to resolve what must be conduct did few thing without much thinking though walked very boldly walked warily often told that such success a have achieved must not have be achieved without much caution yet be ever discontented with telling that that have done be nothing worse than nothing what be to have duke to have lord dining with to dine with lord with duke if life be dull with hour hung heavy life with be dull hour did hang heavy what if caught old man became duchess caught by mean of weakness to inexpressible dismay of who be bound to by tie of blood must make life happier hour le tedious that prospect of life on italian lake with old man tied to side be not so charming in eye a be in of duke be to succeed to be blazoned forth to world a duchess of omnium what must have gained perfectly understood motive of lady glencora visit thought that must at rate gain something in very triumph of baffling manoeuvre of so clever woman let lady glencora throw aegis before duke must be something to carry off grace from beneath protection of so thick shield very flavour of contest be pleasing to madame goesler victory gained what then must remain to money have already position too have of own be free a air must suit at time to go off to lake of como in society must personally be more agreeable to than of duke of omnium there be nothing to hinder for moment then came smile over face saddest smile a thought of one with whom might be pleasant to look at colour of italian sky feel softness of italian breeze in feigning to like to do with old man in acting rapture of love on behalf of worn out duke who at best must scarce believe in acting there must not be much delight for have never yet known what be to have anything of pleasure of love have grown a often told to be hard cautious selfish successful woman without interference assistance from such pleasure might there not be yet time left for to try without selfishness with absolute devotion of self if only must find right companion there be one who might be such companion duke of omnium certainly must not be such one to be duchess of omnium after success in world be everything be at rate only thing pleasure of will endure there be name of many woman written in black list within madame goesler breast written there because of scorn because of rejected overture because of deep social injury madame goesler told often that must be pleasure to to use list to be revenged on who have ill used scornfully treated did not readily forgive who have injured a duchess of omnium thought that probably might use that list with efficacy lady glencora have treated well have such feeling against lady glencora a duchess of omnium must accept lady glencora a dearest friend if lady glencora must admit if must be necessary that there must be little duel between a to of must take duke in hand duel must of course be fought in matter so important one woman must of course expect false sentiment from lady glencora must understand other doubt respect other have said that must sit there resolving trying to resolve there be nothing in world so difficult a task of making up one mind who be there have not longed that power privilege of selection among alternative must be taken away from in important crisis of life that conduct must be arranged for way that by divine power if be possible by patriarchal power in absence of divinity by chance even if nothing better than chance must be found to do one dare to cast die to go honestly by hazard there must be actual necessity of obeying die before even die can be of use a be when madame goesler have sat there for hour till leg be tired beneath have not resolved must be a impulse must direct when important moment came there be not soul on earth to whom must go for counsel when asked for counsel counsel must not come two day afterwards duke called again must come generally on thursday early so that might be there before other visitor have already quite learned that when be there other visitor must probably be refused admittance how lady glencora have made way in telling servant that uncle be there have not understood that visit have be made on thursday now came on saturday having regret to say sent down

woman so graceful yet so natural will not eat own grape with be delicious flavoured with poor queen sorrow shook head knowing that did not suit gastric juice to have to deal with fruit eaten at odd time never think duke be convinced that doe good simply mean doubting doubt always lead to error safest way in world be to hing believe so said duke much safest if have not sufficient command over to enable to sit in repose always quiet never committing to chance of danger then take leap in dark rather many leap stumbling horse regains footing by persevering in onward course a for moving cautiously that detest yet one must think for instance whether one will succeed not take that for granted always remember recommend motion at repose be idea of life repose grape duke sat for while

glencora have come to be fully minded that if must bear full light of god in glory must not allow to be scorched by reflected heat coming from god niece thought must endure anything that lady glencora might say must wait hear what might be said think madame goesler have better hurry on to subject at once said lady glencora almost hesitating a spoke feeling that colour be rushing up to cheek

lose have money yes indeed plenty for want so moderate a mine position well yes sort of position not such a yours lady glencora that if be not born to woman can only come to from husband can not win for be free a air going where like doing what like too free sometimes said madame goesler what will gain by changing simply for title for such title lady glencora may be little to to be duchess of omnium think what must be to for will not hesitate to rob of friend to embitter future life to degrade among peer degrade who dare say that will degrade will exalt will whit degrade forget lady glencora ask one be not that despise if did must offer hand in friendship old man over seventy carrying weight burden of such rank a will degrade in eye of fellow if marries young woman without rank let be ever so clever ever so beautiful duke of omnium may not do a plea a may man may be well lady glencora for other duke for daughter heir cousin of other duke that grace must try question will if wish argue matter with on many point will not allow to say must degrade man whom might marry name be a unstained a own meant nothing of said lady glencora for certainly must not willingly injure who wish to injure friend in truth have so little to gain that temptation to do injury if thought one be not strong for little boy lady glencora think fear be premature a said there came smile over face threatened to break from control almost become laughter if will allow to say so mind will not be turned against marriage half so strongly by argument can use a by can adduce have nearly driven into by telling must degrade house be almost incumbent on to prove that be wrong have better leave to settle matter in own bosom have indeed after while lady glencora did leave to settle matter within own

consider in own mind what battery might yet be brought to bear upon duke towards stopping marriage even after engagement must have be made if be to be made lady glencora felt that such battery might still be brought up a must not improbably have effect on proud weak old man if other resource failed royalty in of branch might be induced to make request august relation in peerage must interfere duke doubt might persevere marry whom pleased if be strong enough requires much personal strength that standing alone against well armed battery of one friend lady glencora have once tried battle on own behalf have failed have wished to be imprudent when be young friend have be too strong for have be reduced kept in order made to run in groove be now when sat looking at little boy with bold face almost inclined to think that world be right groove be best if have be controlled when be young so ought duke to be controlled now that be old be very well for man woman to boast that may do what like with own with own there be circumstance in such self action be ruinous to so many that coercion from outside becomes absolutely needed nobody have felt injustice of such coercion when applied to herself more sharply than have lady glencora have lived to acknowledge such coercion might be proper be now prepared to use in shape in might be made available be very well for madame goesler to laugh exclaim psha when lady glencora declared real trouble must ever come to pas that black browed baby with yellow skin must be shown to world a lord silverbridge lady glencora knew that peace of mind

perhaps be mother of future duke lady glencora in anger be very unjust to madame goesler thinking evil of accusing in mind of crime denying charm beauty have duke forgotten position for sake of fair girl with pink complexion grey eye smooth hair father lady glencora thought that must have forgiven better might be that madame goesler must win way to coronet when came to put on must find that there

when men woman be going to loughlinters saulsbys be very well with there be something melancholy to in yearly journey to ireland loved father mother sister a well a do other men there be falling off

february mr monk indeed be going with for few week even association did not make up for sort of society must have preferred session went on very quietly question of irish reform bill be postponed till next year be great thing gained carried bill about canada railway with sundry other small bill appertaining to through house in manner redounded infinitely to credit there be just enough of opposition to give zest to work to make affair conspicuous among affair of year a chief be in other house work fell altogether into hand so that came to be conspicuous among under secretary be only when said word to leader of party about other matter about irish tenant right for instance be beginning to loom very large that found to be snubbed there be room for action year in reference to irish tenant right therefore deep consideration of discomfort might be legitimately postponed if did by chance open mouth on subject to mr monk even mr monk discouraged in early day of july when weather be very hot people be beginning to complain of thames member be becoming thirsty after grouse remaining day of parliamentary work be being counted up there came to news news be soon known throughout fashionable world that duke of omnium be going to give garden party at certain villa residence on bank of thames above richmond be to be such garden party a have never be seen before must be more remarkable because duke have never be known to do thing villa be called horn have indeed be given by duke to lady glencora on marriage party be to be duke party horn with garden conservatory lawn shrubbery paddock boat house boat be to be made bright beautiful for occasion score of workman be about place through three first week of july world at large did not at know why duke be doing so unwonted thing why must undertake so new trouble lady glencora knew madame goesler shrewdly guessed riddle when madame goesler unexpected refusal have reached grace felt that must either accept lady refusal persevere after day consideration resolved that must accept top brick of chimney be very desirable perhaps might be well that must endeavour to live without then accepting refusal must either stand ground bear blow must run away to villa at como elsewhere running away seemed to at first to be better at least more pleasant course at last determined that must stand ground bear blow therefore gave garden party at horn who be to be invited before first week in july be over many bosom in london be fluttering with anxiety on subject duke in giving short word of instruction to lady glencora made understand that must wish to be particular in invitation royal highness princess royal highness prince have be so gracious a to say that must honour fete duke have made out short list with not more than dozen name lady glencora be employed to select real crowd five hundred out of ten thousand who be to be blessed on duke own private list be name of madame goesler lady glencora understood when madame goesler got card thought that understood too thought also that duke be behaving in gallant way there be doubt much difficulty about invitation considerable amount of ill will be created who considered entitled to be asked be not asked be full of wrath against more fortunate friend instead of being angry with duke with lady glencora who have neglected be soon known that lady glencora be real dispenser of favour fancy that ladyship be tired of task before be completed party be to take place on wednesday th of july before day have come men woman have become so hardy in combat that personal application be made with unflinching importunity letter be written to lady glencora putting forward claim that claim with piteous clamour be too bad lady glencora said to particular friend mr grey when letter came from mr bonteen stating that husband have ever done towards supporting mr palliser in parliament that ever must do sha have even though must put plantagenet into minority to morrow mr bonteen did not get card when heard that phineas finn have received one wrath against phineas be very great be irish adventurer regretted deeply that mr bonteen have ever interested in bringing such upstart forward in world of politics a mr bonteen never have done anything towards bringing phineas forward there be not much cause for regret on head phineas however got card of course accepted invitation ground be opened at four there be to be early dinner out in tent at five after dinner men woman be to walk about dance make love hay a suited haycock however be ready prepared

went off to meet there be not word more spoken between duke madame goesler on afternoon phineas did not come till late till seven when banquet be over think be right in a banqueting in tent loses in comfort almost more than gain in romance small picnic may be very well distance previously travelled may give to dinner on ground seeming excuse of necessity frail human nature must be supported human nature having gone so far in pursuit of beautiful be entitled to what best support unaccustomed circumstance will allow therefore out with cold pie out with salad chicken champagne since better may be let recruit human nature sitting upon moss forget discomfort in glory of verdure around dear mary seeing that cushion from waggonet be small not wishing to accept too generous offer that must take for own use will admit contact somewhat closer than ordinary chair of dining room render necessary that in way be very well hold that banquet on narrow table in tent be displeasing phineas strolled into ground when tent be nearly empty when lady glencora almost sinking beneath exertion be taking rest in inner room duke at time be dining with royal highness three four others specially selected very comfortably within door out of door world have begun to dance world be beginning to say that must be much nicer to go dance upon board inside a soon a possible for though of party garden party be

livery ready to take such spirit down to richmond up to teddington lock many daring spirit did take such trip to great peril of muslin ribbon starch to peril also of ornamental summer white garment so that when thing be over boat be voted to have be bore be going to venture said phineas to lady must like of thing if be not afraid for clothes will come be never good upon water must be sea sick to

than cabinet minister in killaloe where bishop might be seen walking about day mitred dignitary of church though much loved be thought of fear lightly whereas cabinet minister coming to stay in house of townsman be thing to be wondered at to be talked about to be afraid of to be fruitful source of conversation for year to come there be many in killaloe especially among elder lady who have shaken head expressed saddest doubt when young phineas finn have first become parliament man though by degree have be half brought round having be driven to acknowledge that have be wonderfully successful a parliament man still have continued to shake head among to fear something in future until appeared at old home leading cabinet minister by hand there be such assurance in even old mr callaghan at brewery gave way began to say manner of good thing to praise doctor luck in have son gifted with part so excellent there be great desire to see cabinet minister in flesh to be with when ate drank to

known life if be going to be married to morrow must see that must make difference to barbara finn walked on for couple of minute in silence before replied mary said at last believe word of very well then that will ask of be that may not talk about more mamma belief be enough for nevertheless did talk about phineas during whole of day very often talked about afterwards a long a mary remained at killaloe there be large dinner party at doctor on day after mr monk arrival bishop be not there though be on term sufficiently friendly with doctor family to have be invited on so grand occasion be not there because mr finn be determined that must be taken out to dinner by cabinet minister in face of friend be aware that have bishop be there must have taken bishop arm though there must have be glory in other glory be more to taste be first time in life that have ever seen cabinet minister think that be little disappointed at finding so like other middle aged gentleman have hoped that mr monk must have assumed something of dignity of position assumed nothing now bishop though be very mild man did assume something by very fact of apron knee breech be sure sir be very good of to come put up with humble way of living said mr finn to guest a sat down at table yet have resolved that must not make speech of kind that must condescend to apology that must bear a though cabinet minister dined with at least once year when moment came broke down made apology with almost abject meekness then hated because have done so dear madam said mr monk live so much like hermit that house be palace of luxury to then felt that have made foolish speech also hated found very difficult to talk to hostess upon subject until by chance mentioned young friend phineas then tongue be unloosed son madam said be going with to limerick back to dublin be shame know taking so soon away from home must not know how to get on without oh mr monk be such blessing for honour for that must be so good to then mother spoke out past fear present hope acknowledged great glory be to to have son sitting in parliament holding office with stately name great salary blessed with friendship of such man a mr monk after mr monk got on better with know young man said in whose career have taken so strong interest be always good said mr finn with tear forcing into corner of eye be mother of course ought not to say so not in way be true mr monk then poor lady be obliged to raise handkerchief wipe away drop phineas on occasion have taken out to dinner mother of devoted mary mr flood jones what pleasure must be to doctor mr finn to see come back in way said mr flood jones with bone unbroken said laughing yes with bone unbroken know phineas when first heard that be to sit in parliament be afraid that might break rib two since choose to talk about breaking of bone yes know everybody thought must come to grief nobody felt so sure of a did have not come to grief be not out of wood yet know mr flood jones there be plenty of possibility for grief in way still a far a can understand be out of wood that friend here want to see now be that must marry nice english girl with little money if possible rumour have reached know rumour always lie said phineas sometimes do of course be not going to ask indiscreet question be what hope mary be saying only other day that if be once married must feel quite safe about know take most lively interest in welfare be not day that man from county clare get on a have done therefore be bound to think of thus mr flood jones signified to phineas finn that have forgiven thoughtlessness of early youth even though there have be something of treachery in thoughtlessness to own daughter showed also that mary feeling might have be once be not now of nature to trouble of course will marry said mr flood jones must think very likely not said phineas who perhaps looked farther into mind of lady than lady intended oh do said lady man must marry a soon a can especially man in position when lady met together in drawing room after dinner be impossible that must discus mr monk there be mr callaghan from brewery there old lady blood of bloodstone who on ordinary occasion must hardly admit that be on dining out term with one in killaloe except bishop who have found impossible to decline to meet cabinet minister there be mr stackpoole from sixmiletown far away cousin of finn who hated lady blood with true provincial hatred see anything particularly uncommon in after said lady blood think be very nice indeed said mr flood jones so very quiet dear just like other people said mr callaghan meaning to pronounce strong eulogium on cabinet minister very like other people indeed said lady blood what must expect lady blood said mr stackpoole men woman in london walk upon two leg just a do in ennis now lady blood have be born bred in ennis whereas mr stackpoole have come from limerick be much more considerable town therefore there be satire in allusion to habit of men of ennis lady blood understood thoroughly dear mr stackpoole know how people walk in london quite a well a do lady blood have once passed three month in london while sir patrick have be alive whereas mr stackpoole have never done more than visit metropolis for day two oh doubt said mr stackpoole never can understand what be that people expect suppose mr monk ought to have come with star on breast of coat to have pleased lady blood dear mr stackpoole cabinet minister have star said lady blood never said did said mr stackpoole be so nice gentle to talk to said mr finn may say what will men who be high up do very often give air now must say that friend of son doe not do anything of kind not least said mr callaghan contrary said mr stackpoole dare say be wonderful man said lady blood say be did hear anything wonderful come out of mouth a for people in ennis walking on two leg have seen donkey in limerick doing just same thing now be well known that mr stackpoole have two son living in limerick a to of whom be expected that must set shannon on fire after little speech there be further mention of mr monk a became necessary that good nature of mr finn tact of mr flood jones energy of mr callaghan must be used to prevent raging of internecine battle between mr stackpoole lady blood chapter lxvi victrix mr monk holiday programme allowed week at killaloe from thence be to go to limerick from limerick to dublin in order at place might be entertained at public dinner make speech about tenant right foreseeing phineas might commit if attended meeting mr monk have counselled to remain at killaloe phineas have refused to subject to such cautious abstinence mr monk have come to ireland a friend must see through travel will not probably be asked to speak said phineas if be asked need not say more than few word what if did speak out might find disadvantageous to in london must take chance of be not going to tie down for ever ever for sake of being under secretary to colony mr monk said very much to on subject be constantly saying very much to about in spite of mr monk said phineas did make journey to limerick dublin have not since arrival at killaloe be moment alone with mary flood jones till evening before started with mr monk have kept out of way successfully though have constantly be with in company be beginning to plume on strength valour of conduct self praise have in nothing of joy glory be very sad of course must care for more more especially a be so very evident that cared not at for very fact of keeping out of way made acknowledge to herself that position be very miserable have declared to mother that might certainly go to killaloe with safety that must be better for to put in way of meeting a old friend that idea of necessity of shutting up because of approach be one thing gave real pain therefore mother have brought to killaloe have met fancied security have deserted found to be miserable hoping for something did not know what still dreaming of possibility feeling during moment of presence with that special conduct be necessary on part must not make further confession to mother ask to be carried back to floodborough knew that be very wretched at killaloe a for phineas have felt that old friend be very cold to be in humour with reference to violet effingham seemed especially to require consolation knew now that hope be over there violet effingham must never be wife even be not to marry lord chiltern for next five year must not during five year marry other man such be hero conviction suffering under conviction be in want of comfort of feminine sympathy have mary known have suited to play part think might have have phineas at foot before have be week at home have kept aloof from have heard nothing of sorrow a natural consequence of phineas be more in love with than ever on evening before started with mr monk for limerick managed to be alone with for few minute barbara may probably have assisted in bringing about arrangement have perhaps be guilty of treachery sister in such circumstance will sometimes be very treacherous to friend feel sure however that mary herself be quite innocent of guile in matter mary phineas said to suddenly seems to that have avoided purposely ever since have be at home smiled blushed stammered said nothing have there be reason for mary reason at know of said used to be such great friend be before be great man phineas must necessarily be different now know so many people now people of such different sort that of course fall little into background when talk in way mary know that be laughing at indeed indeed be not believe there be one in whole world said after pause whose friendship be more to than yours be think of so often mary say that when come back will be between a used to be then put out hand for hers must not help giving to of course there will be people said who talk nonsense one can not help will not put up with from did not mean to talk nonsense phineas then there came one across conversation be ended sound of voice remained on ear must not help remember that have declared that friendship be dearer to than friendship of one else phineas went with mr monk first to limerick then to dublin found at place to be regarded a hero only second to great hero at place one subject of debate be tenant right must anything be done to make profitable for men with capital to put capital into irish land fertility of soil be questioned by one sufficiency of external circumstance such a railroad like abundance of labour even security for wealth to be produced only difficulty be in that men who be to produce wealth have guarantee that must be when be created in england elsewhere such guarantee be in existence might not be possible to introduce into ireland be question mr monk have in hand in various speech made before after dinner given to pledged to keep well in hand when parliament must meet of course phineas spoke also be impossible that must be silent when friend leader be pouring out eloquence of course spoke of course pledged something like old pleasure of debating society returned to a standing upon platform before listening multitude gave full vent to word in house of common of late have be so cabined cribbed confined by office a to have enjoyed nothing of indeed from commencement of career have fallen so thoroughly into decorum of government way a to have missed altogether delight of wild irresponsible oratory of mr monk have spoken to so often have envied men below gangway who though supporting government on main question must get up on leg whenever house be full enough to make worth while say almost whatever pleased there be that mr robson who literally did say just what came uppermost thing came uppermost be often ill natured often unbecoming gravity of house be always startling men listened to liked to speak mr robson have married woman with money oh why why have not violet effingham be kinder to might even yet perhaps marry woman with money must not bring to do so unless loved upshot of dublin meeting be that also positively pledged to support during next session of parliament bill advocating tenant right be sorry went so far a mr monk said to almost a soon a meeting be over be standing on pier at kingstown mr monk be preparing to return to england why not a far a because have thought about think that have be prepared to resign office to morrow directly that can see mr gresham explain to what have done will offer to do so wo accept resignation must accept unless be prepared to instruct irish secretary to bring in such bill a can support will be exactly in same boat ought not to be in same boat need advice to be to say nothing about till get back to london then speak to lord cantrip tell that will not say anything on subject in house that in event of there being division hope to be allowed to vote a on open question may be that will get gresham assent if so will be all right if if choose to make point with must resign also of course will said phineas think will have be too useful will wish to avoid weakness come to ministry from changing team good bye dear fellow remember last word of advice to be to stick by ship be quite sure be career will suit did not begin soon enough phineas be rather melancholy a returned alone to killaloe be very well to bid stick to ship knew a well a one must tell how material ship be to there be circumstance in man can not stick to ship can not stick at least to special government ship knew that whither mr monk went in session must follow have considerable hope that when mr monk explained purpose to prime minister prime minister must feel obliged to give way in case phineas must not only be able to keep office must have such opportunity of making speech in parliament a circumstance have never yet given to when be again at home said nothing to father to killaloeians a to danger of position of what use must be to make mother sister miserable to incur useless counsel of doctor seemed to think speech at dublin very fine be never tired of talking of what mr monk phineas be going to do idea have not come home to that if mr monk phineas chose to do anything on own account must give up place held under crown be september when phineas found back at killaloe be due to be at office in london in excitement of mr monk company be now over have nothing to do to receive pouch full of official paper from colonial office study statistic came within reach in reference to proposed new law for tenant right in meantime mary be still living with mother at killaloe still kept somewhat aloof from man loved how must be possible for not to give way in such circumstance a one day found talking to about speaking to of own position with more frankness than ever used with own family have begun by reminding of conversation have have before went away with mr monk by reminding also that have promised to return to old friendly way with nay phineas there be promise said be not to be friend only say that made particular promise of course be friend have always be friend what must say if heard have resigned office given up seat asked of course expressed surprise almost horror at idea then told everything took long in telling because be necessary that must explain to working of system made impossible for a member of government to entertain opinion of own do mean that must lose salary asked certainly must must not that be very dreadful laughed a acknowledged that must be dreadful be very dreadful mary to have nothing to eat drink what be man to do must recommend to say that black be white be sure will never do that see mary be very nice to be called by big name to have salary be very comfortable to be envied by one friend enemy there be drawback there be especial drawback then paused for moment before went on what especial drawback phineas man can not do what plea with how can man marry so circumstanced a be hesitated for moment then answered man may be very happy without marrying suppose also paused for many moment before spoke again then made faint attempt to escape from before succeeded have asked question arrested wonder whether must listen to if be to tell history of course listened history told be tale of love for violet effingham have money of own mary asked yes be rich have large fortune then mr finn must seek one else who be equally blessed mary be untrue be ill natured mean that say that mean have not believed that loved miss effingham because be rich have

dearly did love mr finn yes did love her be there inconstancy in ceasing to love when one be not loved be there inconstancy in changing one love in loving again know said mary to whom occasion be

passion till have told story of have passed away have heard now mary can try to love after that have come at last thing for have be ever wishing have come in spite of imprudence in spite of prudence when have heard to end be not whit angry with be not in least aggrieved because have be lost to in love for miss effingham while have be so nearly lost by love for for woman such episode in life of lover have excitement be almost pleasurable whereas man be anxious to hear lady swear that until appeared upon scene heart have be fancy free mary upon whole have liked story have thought that have be finely told be well pleased with final catastrophe nevertheless be not prepared with reply have answer to give mary said looking up into eye be afraid that did not doubt what must be answer a must be good that lover must do must vouchsafe word mary when essayed to speak found that be dumb must not get voice to give assistance of single word did not cry there be motion a of sobbing in throat impeded utterance be a happy a earth a heaven must make did not know how to tell that be happy yet longed to tell that might know how thankful be to for goodness still sat looking at now by degree

honourable gentleman have not left cabinet then mr gresham replied that to infinite regret right honourable friend who lately presided at board of trade have resigned went on to explain that resignation have according to idea be quite unnecessary right honourable friend entertained certain idea about irish tenant right a to right honourable friend secretary for ireland must not exactly pledge to be in unison with have thought that motion might have rested at rate over session then mr monk explained making first great speech on irish tenant right found obliged to advocate immediate measure for giving security to irish farmer a must not do so a member of cabinet be forced to resign honour of position said something also a to great doubt have ever weighed on own mind a to inexpediency of man at time of life submitting for first time to trammel of office called up mr turnbull who took opportunity of saying that now agreed cordially with old friend for first time since old friend have listened to blandishment of ministerial seducer that welcomed old friend back to independent bench with great satisfaction in way debate be very exciting nothing be said made then necessary for phineas to get upon leg to declare perceived that time must rapidly come in must do so mr gresham though strove to speak with gentle word be evidently very angry with late president of board of trade moreover be quite clear that bill must be introduced by mr monk mr gresham be determined to oppose if came to pas there must be close division phineas felt that fate must be sealed when

term lord cantrip be official chief since connection have existed between lady cantrip have be very gracious to quite understood comfort be to husband to have under a representative in house of common man whom must thoroughly trust like therefore have used woman art to bind phineas to lord in more than mere official bondage have tried skill also upon laurence fitzgibbon altogether in vain have eaten dinner accepted courtesy have given for return phineas have possessed more grateful mind have done have be required of have done have be required of till there have come that terrible absurdity in ireland knew very well what sort of thing must happen when brought man a mr monk into cabinet lady cantrip have said to husband though party be very small though guest be intimate friend phineas suspected nothing special till attack be made upon a soon a servant have left room be done in presence of two lady doubt have be preconcerted there be lord cantrip there who have already said much to barrington erle who have said more even than lord cantrip lord brentford member of cabinet opened attack by asking whether be actually true that mr monk meant to go on with motion barrington erle asserted that mr monk positively must do so gresham will oppose asked earl of course will said barrington of course will said lord cantrip know what must think of if did not said lady cantrip be last man in world to be forced into thing said lady laura then phineas knew pretty well what be coming on lord brentford began again by asking how many supporter mr monk must have in house that depends upon amount of courage conservative may have said barrington erle if dare to vote for thoroughly democratic measure simply for sake of turning out be quite on card that may succeed of own people asked lord cantrip have better inquire that of phineas finn said barrington then attack be made hero have bad half hour of though many word be said must have gratified much wanted to keep so lord cantrip declared except one two whom must name who be particularly anxious to wear shoe said barrington thinking certain reminiscence of phineas with regard to mr bonteen others might operate a strongly a other consideration to make love place lord brentford declared that must not understand that must find lost in amazement if such man a young friend allowed to be led into outer wilderness by such ignis fatuus of light a lord cantrip laid down unwritten traditional law of government official very plainly man in office in office really imposed upon a much work a must possibly do with credit to cause be dispensed from necessity of conscience with reference to other matter be for sir walter morrison to have conscience about irish tenant right a doubt have just a phineas finn have conscience about canada jamaica cape barrington erle be very strong about party in general painted comfort of official position in glowing colour think that two lady be more efficacious than even male relative in argument used have be so happy to have among said lady cantrip looking at with beseeching almost loving eye mr finn know said lady laura since first came into parliament have always believed in success have be very proud to see will weep over a over fallen angel if leaf said lady cantrip wo say will weep said lady laura know anything of kind must so truly make unhappy what be to say in answer to application so flattering so pressing must have said nothing have that be possible felt obliged to reply replied very weakly of course not justifying declaring that a have gone so far must go further must vote for measure now chief barrington erle proved attempted to prove that be wrong in of course must not speak on measure vote for party must probably be allowed to pas without notice one two newspaper might perhaps attack what public man cared for such attack a whole party must hang by in must find ample consolation phineas must only say that must think of said in so irresolute tone of voice that men then present believed that be gained two lady however be of different opinion in spite of anything that anybody may say will do what think right when time come said laura to

mr monk be not only what bonteen have said that word of mr bonteen so plainly indicated what must be word of other bonteens knew that be weak in knew that have be strong must have allowed to be guided if not by firm decision of own spirit by counsel of such men a mr gresham lord cantrip not by sarcasm of bonteens ratlers of official life men who sojourn amidst savagery fear mosquito more than do

never get round that huge promontory there laura be more persevering be kennedy here phineas whispered know said chiltern be determined to run chance little higher up for phineas be blessed with more patience than lord chiltern possessed came upon mr monk so be still admitted privately said phineas oh dear yes have just be having most friendly conversation about what man be know everything be so accurate so just in abstract in abstract so generous have be very generous to in detail a well a in abstract said phineas ah yes be not thinking of individual exactly want of generosity be to large mass to party to class to people whereas generosity be for mankind at large assumes god affect to nod seems to shake sphere have nothing against have asked here to night have talked to most familiarly about ireland what do think of chance of second reading asked phineas what do think of hear more of thing than do everybody say will be close division never expected said mr monk till heard what daubeny said at first reading will vote for bill en masse hating in heart time let hope be not so bad a that be way with always do work for sailing on one tack other be use in creation that when split among a always do come in finish job for must be unpleasant for to be always doing that always say must never be done at wherever gift horse may come from will not look in mouth said mr monk there be only one man in house whom hope may not see in lobby with be question be decided now said phineas how be decided phineas must not tell friend that question of so great magnitude to have be decided by last sting have received from insect so contemptible a mr bonteen expressed feeling a well a knew how to express oh will be with know what be going to say know how good be must not stand men be beginning already to say thing almost make get up kick if can help will give occasion to man to hint anything to can make be so wretched a have be to day pray say anything more idea be that will resign to morrow then hope that may fight battle side by side said mr monk giving hand will fight battle side by side replied phineas after that pushed way still higher up stair having special purpose in view not dreaming of such success a of reaching host hostess merely feeling that must be point of honour with to make tour through room before descended stair thing thought be to be done with courage patience might probably be last time in life that must find in house of prime minister just at turn of balustrade at top of stair found mr gresham in very spot on mr monk have be talking with very glad to see said gresham find be persevering man with genius for getting upwards like spark said phineas not quite so quickly said mr gresham with same assurance of speedy loss of little light did not suit mr gresham to understand so changed subject have seen news from america yes have seen believe said phineas ah have such faith in combination of british colony properly backed in downing street a to think strong against world in arm in place must hold to same doctrine hold to stoutly do now hope mr gresham well yes be not down hearted confess to feeling that world must go on even though have nothing to say to single province in north america be for private ear be not to whisper that in downing street then there came up somebody else phineas went on upon slow course have longed for opportunity to tell mr gresham that must go to downing street no more such opportunity have not reached for long time found stuck close by side of miss fitzgibbon miss aspasia fitzgibbon who have once relieved from terrible pecuniary anxiety by paying for sum of money be due by on brother account be very nice thing to be here one doe get tired of said miss fitzgibbon very tired said phineas of course be part of duty mr finn be on promotion be bound to be here when asked laurence to come said there be nothing to be got till card be shuffled again will be shuffled very soon said phineas colour come up will hold trump know said lady hand always hold trump must not explain to miss fitzgibbon that must never again be fate to hold single trump in hand so made fight got on few step farther said word a went to half dozen friend a friend went with be detained for five minute by lady baldock who be very gracious very disagreeable told that violet be in room where did not know be somewhere with lady laura believe really mr finn like lady baldock have heard that phineas have quarrelled with lord brentford have not heard of reconciliation really like be told that mr kennedy be in house nobody know what may happen mr kennedy be not likely to say anything one can not tell when hear that woman be separated from husband always think that must have be imprudent may be uncharitable think be most safe so to consider a far a have heard circumstance lady laura be quite right said phineas may be so gentleman will always take lady part of course must be very sorry to have daughter separated from husband very sorry phineas who have nothing now to gain from lady baldock favour left abruptly went on again have great desire to see lady laura violet together though must hardly tell why have not seen miss effingham since return from ireland thought that if met alone must hardly have talked to with comfort knew that if met with lady laura must greet a friend speak to a though there be cause for embarrassment between be so far disappointed that suddenly encountered violet alone have be leaning on arm of lord baldock phineas saw cousin leave must not be such coward a to avoid especially a knew that have seen oh mr finn said do see see what look there be mr kennedy have heard that be possible laura made promise must not leave phineas turned head saw mr kennedy standing with back bolt upright against door post with brow a black a thunder be just opposite to where can see said violet pray take to will think nothing of because know that be still friend with of came away because lord baldock wanted to introduce to lady mouser know be going to marry miss mouser phineas not caring much about lord baldock miss mouser took violet hand upon arm very slowly made way across room to spot indicated there found lady laura alone sitting under upas tree influence of husband gaze there be concourse of people between mr kennedy did not seem inclined to make attempt to lessen distance lady laura have found impossible to move while be under husband eye mr finn said must find oswald know be here have gone said phineas be speaking to downstairs have not seen father said must come have not seen will search will do good can not stay carriage be there know waiting for phineas immediately started off to have carriage called promised to return with a much celerity a must use a went making way much quicker through crowd than have done when have such object for haste purposely avoided door by mr kennedy have stood must have be nearest way present service thought required that must keep aloof from man mr kennedy passed through door intercepted in path be going asked well yes dare say may before long will look for lord brentford carriage by by tell need not go because of will not return will not annoy here must have be much better that woman in such plight must not have come to assembly must not wish to shut up must wish to come back to home that have left if there be law in land will be made to do so tell say so then mr kennedy fought way down stair phineas finn followed in wake about hour afterwards phineas returned to two lady with tidings that carriage must be at hand a soon a must be below did see said lady laura yes followed did speak to yes spoke to what did say then in presence of violet phineas gave message thought better that must be given be to decline to deliver now must never be given whether there be law in land to protect whether there be none will never live with said lady laura be woman like head of cattle that can be fastened in crib by force will never live with though judge of land must decide that must do so phineas thought much of a went to solitary lodging after be not world much better with than be with of two wretched married being why have not at rate a yet sacrificed for money social gain of instinct of nature have be fickle foolish vain uncertain perhaps covetous a yet have not be false then took out mary last letter read again chapter lxxi comparing note must perhaps be difficult to decide between lord chiltern miss effingham have be most wrong have be nearest to right in circumstance have led to separation old lord wishing to induce son to undertake work of sort feeling that own effort in direction be worse than useless have closeted with intended daughter in law have obtained from promise that must use influence with lover of course think right that must do something violet have said will if bid replied earl violet expressed great doubt a to willingness of obedience nevertheless promised to do best did best lord chiltern when spoke to knit brow with apparent ferocity of anger countenance frequently expressed without intention of ferocity on part be annoyed be not savagely disposed to violet a looked at however seemed to be very savagely disposed what be must have do said must have choose occupation oswald what occupation what be that mean ought to be shoemaker not that by preference must say that if please when lover have frowned at violet have resolved have strongly determined with inward assertion of own right that must not be frightened by be talking nonsense violet know can not be shoemaker may go into parliament can must if must dislike life might farm can not afford might might do anything ought to do something know that ought know that father be right in what say that be easily asserted violet must think be better that must take part than father if be that intend to be wife know intend to be wife must wish must respect husband will not do so if marry asked then violet looked into face saw that frown be blacker than ever great mark down forehead be deeper more like ugly wound than have ever seen eye sparkled with anger face be red a with fiery wrath if be so with when be more than engaged to how must be when must be man wife at rate must not fear not now at least oswald said if resolve upon being idle man will not respect be better must tell truth great deal better said how can respect one whose whole life will be will be will be what demanded with loud shout oswald be very rough with what do say that life will be then again resolved that must not fear will be discreditable said will not discredit replied will not bring disgrace on one have loved so well violet after what have said have better part be still proud

house violet must not live with lady baldock understood tortured niece accordingly be not premeditated torture aunt did not mean to make niece life burden to so intending systematically work upon principle to effect lady baldock doubt desired to do duty conscientiously result be torture to poor violet strong conviction on mind of of two lady that other be most unreasonable being in world aunt in day have taken into head to talk of poor lord chiltern arose partly from belief that quarrel be final therefore there must be no danger in aggravating violet by expression of pity partly from feeling that must be better that niece must marry lord chiltern than must not marry at partly perhaps from general principle that a thought right to scold niece on occasion might be best done by taking opposite view of question to taken by niece to be scolded violet be supposed to regard lord chiltern a having sinned against therefore lady baldock talked of poor lord chiltern a to other lover have begun to perceive that condition be hopeless daughter augusta have explained to that there be chance remaining for phineas for lord fawn for mr appledom believe will be old maid on purpose to

still sitting in room at colonial office resignation have be sent in accepted be simply awaiting coming of successor about noon successor came have gratification of resigning arm chair to mr bonteen be generally understood that gentleman leaving office give up seal portfolio phineas have be put in possession of seal portfolio there be in room have occupied special arm chair with much regret surrendered to use comfort of mr bonteen there be glance of triumph in enemy eye exultation in tone of enemy voice be very bitter to so be really going said mr bonteen well dare say be very proper quite understand thing have doubt be right be easy to understand be said phineas trying to laugh mr bonteen did not feel intended satire poor phineas found useless to attempt to punish man hated left a quickly a must went to say few word of farewell to late chief good bye finn said lord cantrip be great trouble to that must have to part in way to also lord wish must have be avoided must not have gone to ireland with so dangerous man a mr monk be too late to think of now milk be spilt be not terrible rendings asunder never last very long said lord cantrip unless man change opinion altogether how many quarrel how many reconciliation have lived to see remember when gresham went out of office because must not sit in same room with mr mildmay yet became fastest of political friend there be time when plinlimmon duke must not stable horse together at remember when palliser be obliged to give up hope of office because have bee in bonnet think however that bee in mr palliser bonnet to lord cantrip be alluding made buzzing audible on subject be not exactly political will have back again before long doubt men who can really do work be too rare to be left long in comfort of bench below gangway be very kindly said phineas be flattered comforted must not however make lord cantrip understand whole truth for dream of life of politics be over for ever have tried have succeeded beyond utmost hope in spite of success ground have crumbled to piece beneath foot knew that must never recover niche in world gallery be now leaving that same afternoon met mr gresham in one of passage leading to house prime minister put arm through of hero a walked together into lobby be sorry that be losing said gresham may be sure that be sorry to be so lost said phineas thing will occur in political life said leader think that seldom leave rancour behind when purpose be declared when subject of disagreement be marked understood defalcation creates angry feeling be that have to be endured without previous warning when man vote against party set of men from private pique from cause be never clear phineas when heard knew well how terribly very man have be harassed driven nearly wild by defalcation exactly of nature be attempting to describe doubt mr monk think be right continued mr gresham have given strong evidence that think so said phineas give up place be of very poor men think be wrong know not so much in view on question to tell truth hardly understand a yet will endeavour to explain will do so very clearly doubt think that mr monk be wrong in desiring a member of government to force measure whether good bad government a body doe not desire to initiate at rate just now therefore resigned said phineas of course seems to that failed to comprehend only way in great party can act together if be to do service in country for moment think that be blaming be nobody in matter said phineas can assure mr finn that have not regarded in light hope that time may come when may be sitting together again on same bench on treasury bench on other in house be to sit again after fashion be trouble be crushing spirit at moment not loss of office knew that must not venture to think of remaining in london a member of parliament with other income than father must allow even if must again secure seat in parliament when have first be returned for loughshane have assured

assigned be almost imperative a now found that who devote to such profession must be men of fortune when have commenced work at period of first return for loughshane have have thought of mending deficiency in respect by rich marriage have ever occurred to that must seek marriage for purpose idea must have be thoroughly distasteful to there have be no stain of premeditated mercenary arrangement upon at time circumstance have so fallen out with that a won spur in parliament a became known be placed first in one office then in prospect of love money together be opened to ventured on leaving mr low law behind because prospect be so alluring then have come mr monk mary flood jones everything around have collapsed everything around have collapsed with however terrible temptation to to inflate sail again at cost of truth honour temptation must have affected not at have madame goesler be ugly stupid personally disagreeable be thought most beautiful woman have ever seen most witty in many respect most charming have offered to give everything that have so to place in world opposition must be more pleasant to than office to supply want have done so in manner have gratified vanity have refused because be bound to girl at floodborough reader will probably say that be not true man unless must do without regret when phineas thought of there be many regret there be at same time resolve on part that if man have ever loved girl promised to love must love mary flood jones thousand time have told that have not spirit of lady laura bright wit of violet effingham beauty of madame goesler mary have charm of own be more valuable than be there one among three who have trusted a trusted loved with same satisfied devotion there be regret regret be heavy on heart for london parliament club downing street have become dear to liked to think of a rode in park be greeted by whose greeting be most worth having there be regret sad regret girl whom loved better than park club

probably be last great debate in phineas must be able to take part be determined that must do best in did not intend to speak on day if a be generally supposed house must be adjourned before division must be obtained must remain on alert see how thing went have come to understand form of place be a well trained young member of parliament a there have be quick at learning lesson be not easily learned knew how thing be going be proper moment for question that form of motion must anticipate count out understood tone of men mind must read gesture of house be very little likely that debate must be over to night knew a present time be evening of tuesday resolved at once that must speak a early a must on following thursday what pity be that with one who have learned so much learning must be in vain at about two o'clock succeeded in moving adjournment of debate did from seat below gangway to have removed from treasury bench then house be up walked home with mr monk mr monk since have be told positively by phineas that have resolved upon resigning office have said nothing more of sorrow at friend resolve have used a one political friend us telling thought hope a to new measure of taking counsel with a to way in fight must be fought together have counted over list of member marking men a supporter a opponent set now more important than a being doubtful from day to day who have be written down a doubtful be struck off third list put in one other of who be supporter opponent different mode of argument be settled between two allied orator how one must take line other that to mr monk be very pleasant be quite assured now opposition be more congenial to spirit more fitting for than office there be doubt to a to future sitting in parliament let result of contest be what might work be now doing be work for have be training life while have be forced to attend cabinet council from week to week have be depressed now be exultant phineas seeing understanding said little to

night said mr monk a walked together down parliament street through bright moonlight expressly said that only spoke for said phineas know what mean be bidding for office of course who want office with will vote a vote have already counted who must go into office will not carry whole party will carry enough of there be forty fifty men on side of house a many perhaps on ours said mr monk who have
