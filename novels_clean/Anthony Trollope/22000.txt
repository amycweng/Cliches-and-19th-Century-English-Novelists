happiness pride of girl in lover be something wonderful to behold be surely only man only woman born worthy of such man be to be depository of secret recipient of thought that other young lady must accept with submission in period of ecstasy must be surprising be not that be so truly exalted by condition a to make for short period object to of genuine worship in way for month six week did miss holt friend submit to bear with endured to be considered a outside personage of indifferent outer world whereas cecilia with lover be only two inhabitant of small celestial empire in lived then there gradually came to be change must be acknowledged here that change commenced with cecilia holt greater adoration of girl deeper abyss into fall if be doomed to fall at month of imperfection can bear even though imperfection be very glaring for month perhaps for six week desire to subject to newly found superior being support spirit against trial neglect when first come be not known to be neglect first burst of ill temper have about something of picturesque at rate of grotesque even selfishness be displayed on behalf of object so exalted a to be excusable so be with cecilia holt period of absolute unmistaken unreasonable love lasted for six week after engagement during six week exeter knew of there be reticence on part of one sir francis geraldine have fallen in love with cecilia holt great triumph have be won cecilia in spite of general well known objection to lover have triumphed little be not to be supposed that have miscarried outrageously be cold hearted almost cruel who doe not like to see little triumph of girl in such circumstance who will not sympathise with join with if occasion come in exaltation fault be found with cecilia among friend in exeter be fact that did triumph how be that time of worship then came to end must be difficult to say be perhaps struck by neglect something appeared to to be almost scorn man found be ignorant ill temper have lost picturesqueness become worse than grotesque selfishness seemed to be displayed on object not so high a to render justifiable then came fortnight of vacillating misery in did not dare to tell discomfort to of friend mother who though must not read schiller be a anxious for daughter happiness a mother must be saw something of at last ventured to ask question be not francis to have be here morning cecilia be at moment thinking of lover thinking that have be untrue to tryst now for third time thinking also that knew to be untrue not with valid excuse not with slightest cause for excuse with pre determination to show girl to whom be engaged that did not suit longer to be at trouble of serving oh mamma how foolish be how can tell what sir francis geraldine may be doing thought be to have be here mamma please understand that carry about tied to apron string when plea to come will come then went on with book be silent for minute two then broke out again be sure there ought to be rule in life that people when be engaged must never see other again till meet in church think must do at dear perhaps thing be different when be young world becomes le simple day however mamma must put up with sir francis whether come whether remain away world may be le simple said mr holt after pause think half so nice young men used to think that there be nothing so pleasant a young lady company when when when be engaged know then conversation ended morning passed without coming of sir francis after week passed with great forbearance on part of cecilia thought at least to be forbearing thought much of lover have doubt tried to interest in usual conversation of friend by end of week perceived that sir francis be never first spoken of by to maude hippesley be very difficult to avoid expression of doubt because maude be niece to sir francis sir francis be much talked about at deanery uncle be not down here morning maude must say then must go on to excuse defalcation have have business requiring immediate attention probably something a to marriage settlement of course will tell cecilia saw through little attempt maude be quite aware that sir francis be becoming weary of lover care made best excuse must for maude hippesley never have liked uncle oh dear maude said cecilia pray let do what plea with in last day of liberty when have got wife must attend to more le now be a free a air pray let do a plea for heaven sake bother maude who have own lover be perfectly satisfied with though have be engaged to for nearly twelve month knew that thing be not going well be unhappy at moment said nothing further where be recreant knight said francesca there be something in tone of miss altifiorla voice grated against cecilia ear almost made angry knew that in present condition behoved to be especially careful have resolved to break with betrothed must have be quite open on subject to friend must have be open to exeter in present condition of mind be resolved thought be resolved to go on with marriage why must call recreant knight can not for life of understand said seems that sir francis who be not exactly in first youth be supposed to be a attentive a young turtle dove always used to think said miss altifiorla gravely that gentleman be bound to keep promise oh heaven how grave be gentleman promise do mean to assert sir francis be gentleman doe not keep promise because if so will be angry then there be end of conversation be stirred to absolute anger by what took place with mr green though be unable to express anger mr green manner to have always be that of somewhat humble friend of one who lived in lodging in high street who accepted dinner without returning since engagement with sir francis have become fact manner have become perhaps little more humble used to say of that of course be poor of course have nothing to give husband be only minor canon have married ala without fortune be not to be supposed on account cecilia be inclined to ill treat friend way of world be such people be taken must be taken in position frame for mr green be cecilia holt humble friend a such be expected to be humble when therefore volunteered little advice to cecilia about lover be not taken altogether in good part dear cecilia said do really think that ought to say something to sir francis say something answered cecilia sharply what be to say say everything to come in way think dear be just little inattentive have gone through of course know what mean be not that be deficient in love that allows hundred little thing to stand in way what nonsense do talk dear see have gone through do know what be talking about mr green do mean to liken mr green to sir francis be gentleman said mr green with slight tone of anger though sir francis be baronet mr green be clergyman dear bessie know be not what meant in respect be alike when be engaged be about three year younger than man be nearly twenty year younger than sir francis suppose that can put altogether on same platform with a did with lover be absurd to suppose do let go way go mine may be sure that not word of reproach will ever fall from lip till be married cecilia have intended to say did not complete sentence word of comforter have effect a doubt be case with job have complained to one everybody have seen condition poor dear old mother who must have put up with very moderate amount of good usage on part of lover a sir francis have be aware that thing be not a must be three friend to whom have not opened mouth in way of expressing grievance have seen trouble that maude hippesley miss altifiorla have noticed did not strike with much surprise that mr green must have expressed so boldly be startling must not turn matter over in own mind ask whether be ill treated be not only difference lady noticed struck a ominous certain way sir francis have when talking to herself troubled light tone of contempt if begun now must certainly not be dropped after marriage have assumed easy way of almost laughing at of quizzing pursuit worse still of only half listening to felt to promise very badly for future happiness if wanted liberty must have now then must never be drag on husband happiness have resolved from very first not to be exigeant wife must care for care must never be troublesome wife have be matter of deep thought to if be not given to literary taste in earnest for in first day of love making there have be a be natural little pretence must not harass by pursuit must sympathise with racing shooting must interest if possible about newmarket a to place found have taste joined to rest there came conviction that real taste did take direction have never before heard that have passion for turf if must turn out that be gambler have of friend mentioned idea to week ago how must have rebuked that friend now added to other grievance began to tell that have become engaged to man whom did not know whom already doubted then there came week of very troubled existence of existence more troubled because have one to whom to tell trouble a to putting confidence in mother that idea never occurred to mother among friend be humblest of to tell mother that be going to be married be matter of course have never consulted mother on subject now at end of week have almost resolved to break with man without having intimated to one such be intention what excuse have there be excuse enough to own mind to own heart what excuse must give to to world be confident enough so confident a to vex by confidence though have come to treat with indifference like plaything be quite sure that did not dream of having marriage broken off be secured be sure that be feeling by love by ambition by position in world must make lady geraldine be to be supposed that must not wish to be lady geraldine must take what liberty pleased without danger of losing be conviction that such be condition of mind operated strongest in bringing to resolution must tell one must have confidante maude said one day have made up mind not to marry uncle cecilia have one a yet have be told have resolved must see to morrow next day next will tell be not in earnest be likely must jest on subject that if have mind to do so must tell must keep secret must not tell uncle must come to from at present moment doe not in least know will why why be there to be break why to be broken promise put to whether know why how often have made excuse for why have excuse be necessary be prepared to bear blame must bear be not prepared to make miserable for ever because have made mistake a to man character of course will suffer because love will not suffer much because doe not love oh yes know that doe not said cecilia shaking head know know at rate know a thing have to be done will be done quickly there be much more said between two girl on subject maude when left friend be sure that friend be in earnest chapter ii sir francis geraldine on same afternoon at about tea time sir francis came up to house have said that must be there if must get there got there be shown into drawing room where be sitting mr holt with daughter began to tell that be to leave deanery on following morning not be back till day two before marriage where be going cecilia asked meaning nothing only gaining time till must have determined how must carry out purpose well if must know be going to goodwood have not thought of friend have reminded that a be to be last day of liberty may a well enjoy friend be very complaisant to said cecilia in tone of voice seemed to imply that took in one friend never do care straw for young lady on occasion said sir francis regard a conquering enemy a conquered victim desire little relaxation from fetter well just last flutter have be said with such mixture of indifferent badinage on part of serious anger on hers mr holt who saw understood sat very uneasy in chair to tell truth continued instruction have be given to lawyer really do think have better be away during making of dress baking of cake have come to pas by accident of living at deanery that have already become almost tired of other company might speak for sir francis geraldine so do for to tell truth man doe get tired of kind of thing quicker than woman man of forty much quicker than woman of twenty at rate be off to morrow there be something in tone of thoroughly confirmed in purpose there must come end to of thraldom must not be by many last of visit to goodwood must never again have to complain of trouble given to by company sat silent turning over in mind struggling to think how might best get mother out of room must do instantly now at once be perfectly resolved that must not leave house engaged man did not see direct way to commencement of difficult conversation mr holt said sir francis think little absence will be best for of before begin perilous voyage of matrimony together be sure know said poor mr holt there ca be doubt about continued lover have become so stupid that hardly know how to put one foot before other cecilia be so majestical that dignity be growing to be almost tedious mamma said cecilia after pause a sir francis be going to morrow must mind leaving alone for few minute there be something have to say to oh certainly dear said mr holt a got up left room now have come moment difficult moment in cecilia holt have to remodel for course of future life for last month two have be affianced bride of baronet of man of fashion exeter have known a future lady geraldine more than that have learned to regard a owner of man of future home imagination have be active in drawing picture for herself of life be to live picture for time have be rosy hued whatever tint may have be how far bright colour may have become dimmed have be a lady geraldine not a cecilia holt that have looked in glass have shown to herself future career now within last four twenty hour for last crowning purpose of resolution be hardly of longer date have determined to alter a yet did not know still regarded a affianced bride now have come moment in truth must be told to a soon a mother left room got up from seat a did also lover a soon a door be closed at once attempted to put arm round girl waist a be undoubted privilege with gentlest possible motion rejected embrace contrived to stand at little distance from said nothing subject to be discussed be so difficult that word must not come to assistance then lent aid mean that be in tiff because of what said just now of course be better that must not be together for few day before marriage think that be in tiff sir francis hope be not because what have to say be too serious for ill humour then paused what have got to say be of importance of very great importance sir francis geraldine feel have to ask to forgive what on earth be matter may well ask indeed know how to excuse friend will say that be frivolous vain discontented what mischief be about demanded with angry voice knew have not a yet told must perceive that have not gathered from first word inkling of truth yet did not know how to tell if be once told must thought defend difficulty be to find word by must let know what be intention sir francis fear that have misunderstood other how misunderstood why sir francis be to understand that want to quarrel with because be going away if so speak out will go just same going have bearing upon present purpose have made up mind before have heard of going only when did hear of became necessary must tell at once have told nothing hate mystery secret scene there be nothing go against grain so much with a tragedy air if have done anything amiss that be necessary must know let know at once a said there came across brow look of anger of hot ill humour such a have never seen there before effect be to induce to respect rather than to be afraid of be well that man must have power courage to show anger encouraged to proceed with task certainly be not afraid of personally though did dread what world might say of especially what might be said by friend know have done anything amiss of need tell said with quiet dignity be rather that intend to do fear sir francis that have made mistake in what mistake shouted while beat about bush will never understand in proposed marriage what fear must not make happy what on earth do mean then paused moment before continued did a though have discovered suddenly whole secret have got lover there be something in idea so shocking to cecilia so revolting so vulgar in mode of expression that feeling at once gave strength necessary to go on with task must not condescend to answer accusation at once told story in plain language think sir francis geraldine that feel for regard must make happy a wife interrupt just at present said stopping a exclamation be escaping from lip hear to end if have ought to say will then hear of own regard for will say nothing think have be mistaken a to nature in fact feel sure that be of other supposed be lamentable that must have fallen into such error be well that even yet can escape from before be too late a mind be altogether made up can only ask pardon for what have done to expressing sure at same time that be now best consulting future happiness during last speech of cecilia sir francis have sat down while still stood in old place have seated on sofa assuming a be look of profound ease arranging nail of one hand with finger of other a though be completely indifferent to word spoken to have done yet said a soon a be silent yes have done be sure that if begin will not interrupt till have done think not if there be ought that have to say well considering ten minute since be engaged to make lady geraldine that be now supposed to be absolved from such necessity presume will think expedient must say something suppose have not be told whole truth then stopped a though in spite of injunction a to silence expected answer from made none though there came cloud of anger upon face suppose say that there be something of be not considered necessary must be informed there must be something of kind must hardly abandon prospect few day since appeared to to be so desirable have not thought necessary to speak of temper said of own of own added there be take something beyond think that temper bad a may be own must have sufficed to estrange there must be something more palpable than temper to have occasioned though have not thought fit to tell must feel that position justifies in asking have lover exclaimed burning with wrath with head so turned from that must not see have ever have one be entitled to ask question though perhaps must have asked before be at rate not entitled to ask now sir francis geraldine between be over can only beg to understand most positively that be over dear miss holt need not insist upon that a be perfectly understood then there need be further word if have done wrong ask pardon have wronged only in thought must take what consolation can from feeling that injury will fall chiefly upon head not upon yours then without further word of farewell marched out of room sir francis when found alone shook a be a rose from sofa looked about room in amazement be quite true that be gone gone a far a be concerned for ever did not occur to for moment that there must be reconciliation between first feeling undoubtedly be one of amazed disappointment then standing there in mr holt drawing room began to bethink what must have be cause of since first week of engagement have begun have continued to tell great thing be about to do for cecilia holt with beauty grace dignity accomplishment be quite satisfied be expedient that must marry did not know that must marry much better cecilia when mother died must have twenty thousand pound that in eye have be sufficient be about to make lady geraldine more that thought of more grateful have appeared to that must be to then by degree while have expected from expression of gratitude have rebelled against of meaning of have not be quite conscious have nevertheless felt necessary that must dominate spirit up to moment in interview have begun have thought that be learning to do so have not dared to ask question must have be so natural to demand from service to be entitled be thus that have regarded conduct have never feared for moment that be on road to success up to moment at have entered room have thought that be progressing favourably cecilia be becoming tame in hand a be necessary have then be altogether taken aback surprised by statement to must not for moment get over feeling of amazement at last uttered low whistle then walked slowly out of house at front door found horse mounting rode back into exeter a did so began to inquire of whether step girl have determined to take be really misfortune to reverse have hardly a yet asked such question since day on have first become engaged to have long thought of marrying one girl after have be rejected by a have passed in review through thought then have come cecilia turn have seemed to answer purpose there have be about especial dignity have suited view of matrimonial life be young woman a to whom friend must say that have done well in marrying by degree there have come upon feeling of general encumbrance of wife must not interfere with must not wish to hinder when chose to lead bachelor life newmarket for instance london club fishing in norway must not endeavour to set foot upon must not be well that must teach that must not be allowed to interfere have therefore begun to teach have come of have be quite unexpected still felt a though be released from burden have accused of having have lover at moment idea have passed through mind that be suddenly prompted by conscience to tell something that have hitherto concealed there have be lover probably a to whom everyone have be silent to be jealous man for moment have be hurt must have said that heart have be hurt there be little of heart in for may be doubted whether have ever loved there be something pricked filled for instant with serious thought when have asked question wished to see at foot there have come no answer told that be justified in thinking surmise to be true be justified to only for moment for at next have come declaration that be to be over between idea of lover became buried under ruin be thus made so intended to escape from also must escape from after what infinite trouble must wife be to especially wife of whose docility in harness be not quite assured there came upon a rode home idea that world must say that have be jilted of course must have be jilted there must be nothing in except a world might speak of be gall to to have to think that world of exeter must believe that cecilia holt have changed mind have sent about business if world of exeter must say that have ill used girl have broken off engagement for mere fancy a have done must be much more endurable must not say that such be case to so palpable lie contradiction must be easy disgraceful must not so tell story a to leave doubt on mind of people that question of lover have not be contradicted thinking of again a rode home began to feel that lover must be true that conduct in breaking off engagement have be consequence there have be complication in way of have be unable to rid at rate be quite out of question that must have held to engagement complicated a must have be with such lover there must be truth therefore in so telling story a to leave matter in doubt in doubt resolved that must leave before got back to deanery be thought thoroughly glad that must have be enabled so easily to slip neck out of collar chapter iii end of episode cecilia during following day told one what have occurred on morning of next indeed did not open mouth on subject till maude hippesley came to felt that be doing wrong to mother by keeping in dark must not bring to tell have a now declared to herself settled question of future life to live with mother then to live alone must be lot have be accustomed before coming of sir francis to speak of a thing certain then have not be certain have not be probable even to own mind of course lover must come till acceptable lover must be accepted threat of single life made by pretty girl with good fortune never go for much in world then in due time acceptable lover have come have be accepted to what purpose have put must not even now say of what accused having rejected what excuse must give what answer must allege be more sure than ever now that must not live with a wife have said word about former lover be not le painful in there have be foundation for there have in truth be nothing for to tell sir francis geraldine out of milk white innocency confession be to be made what there be have be laid bare to there have be no lover if there have then there must have be lie told have said that there have be none have heard assertion with greedy ear men sometimes have for such telling be comfort to that there have be none when something uncomfortable came in way immediately thought that have deceived must bear with now did not much matter assured what might think of for moment must hardly endure to think of much le to talk of did not know how to own to mother that be simply jilt without offering anything in excuse truth must be told oh how bitter must truth be even accusation a to lover have not be made till after have resolved to reject must not bring to lie to mother by pretending that one have caused other after lunch on second day maude hippesley came down found amongst tree in shrubbery will be remembered that maude be niece to sir francis be at present time living in same house with cecilia said what be have happened have told then what be have told that have quarrelled now have gone away thank god for yes have gone told only just a went have made mystery of so know how have happened why did not tell yes told something something made think mad be have rejected now have told that have told so just a be leaving after thing be packed up told cecilia stood still looked into friend face maude knew must say nothing to be not true have made mystery of have be impression have left upon at rate there have be quarrel yes there have be quarrel now only business be to make up be impossible that two people who have loved other a have done must be allowed to part in so absurd manner be like two child who think be never to be friend again because of momentary disagreement maude hippesley who have not lived in same town with lover therefore have never quarrelled with be awfully wise be quite out of question continued that thing must go on think matter in least whether quarrel with with of course must make up a be woman be only proper that must begin how much have cecilia to do before must prove to friend that such beginning be possible in first place there be falsehood base falsehood sir francis have told in order to save have declared that have rejected be very mean at moment peculiar meanness made feel doubly sure that man be altogether unfitted to be husband must allow false assertion to pas unnoticed if must find comfort in let have perhaps upon whole must be better such story must go forth in exeter must not be told by because be untrue for moment thought that might pas by without notice there can be fresh beginning said two have already come to end of be likely to take place between dear maude pray trouble doubt a time go by will talk of again just at present circumstanced a be with nothing silence between can be fitting hope that at rate will never quarrel after told mother two other friend mother be for week two in despair endeavoured by mean of family at deanery to bring about reconciliation dean who did not in truth like brother in law be little afraid of altogether refused to interfere in matter mr hippesley be of opinion that lover must be sure to come round if left to maude who though have not liked uncle have thought much of position have be proud of idea that must marry exeter girl own peculiar friend be in despair deanery collectively refused to take active step in matter mr green be of opinion that cecilia must have behaved badly there have be affair of pride in have declined to give way according to mr green idea woman must hardly yield too much to man before marriage so a to secure in order that time for management might come afterwards with miss altifiorla cecilia found for awhile more comfort even from noted hater of other sex comfort be not exactly of kind wanted miss altifiorla be of opinion that men on whole be bad seemed to think that among men baronet be not bad specimen did not want great deal of attention be fairly able to get about by without calling upon future wife to be always with then have title income house be in short one of who be in measure compelled to marry miss altifiorla thought pity that match must be broken off be quite ready to console friend a to misfortune there be one point a to cecilia be quite decided in miss altifiorla bore out altogether that question of marriage be now settled once for ever cecilia much in opposition to friend wish have tried hand at have failed have fallen grievously to ground have bruised dreadfully in making attempt have perhaps be necessary a miss altifiorla thought be not given to to know own strength a have be given to have often discussed matter miss altifiorla have always be very firm so have cecilia be firm then have given way have broken down have consented to regard a mere woman stronger than other woman have given to man in order that might be mother of child head servant in household have shown to be false for moment to great principle providence have intervened may be surmised that miss altifiorla in discussing matter with did not use word providence be chance a rejection have come from gentleman hand so miss altifiorla be taught to believe must not boast that cecilia have accomplished mysterious agency have be at work must not permit so exceptional young lady a miss holt to fall into common quagmire of marriage have escaped thanks to mysterious agency must be doubly trebly armed with resolution lest must stumble again think said one day to cecilia think that have great cause to be thankful that must have repented of bargain before be too late flesh be flesh after human nature no stronger than human nature cecilia have consented to bear in silence idea that have be jilted have endured mother tender little sympathy on subject there be difficulty to in suffering direct statement from friend why must not friend let matter be passed by in silence be well said that repented now subject have be much discussed in exeter whether sir francis have jilted miss holt miss holt sir francis have be always present to miss hippesley mind that friend have told her of intention at time when be quite sure that sir francis have such notion in head when on day one following have told cecilia of statement sir francis have made at deanery cecilia have not contradicted have expressed surprise therefore have resolved to decide question against uncle have given rise to party who be on side outside world be strongly of opinion that sir francis have be first offender be so much more probable miss altifiorla have always taken that side have spoken everywhere of a great sinner still however there be doubt in own mind a to be desirous of receiving such solution a cecilia must give be determined now to push question said suppose originated with be great thing for to feel that have not be to blame at in matter have be to blame said cecilia how man come here proposes be accepted then break away from engagement without reason without excuse be thing to be thankful for that must have done so have also to be thankful that fault have not be on side miss altifiorla have almost brought to believe that man have made love to proposed to that in moment of weakness have accepted that now have be luckily saved by inconstancy think will drop that part of question said miss holt showing by manner that did not choose to be cross questioned in such case there be generally fault on side then there be nothing further said on subject miss altifiorla pondered much over friend weakness in not being able to confess that have be jilted have happened in summer during gala day of projected wedding plan have be made of course for honeymoon sir francis with bride be to go here to go there poor mr holt have be fated to remain at home a though arrangement have be necessary for happiness indeed none have be necessary be quite content to remain at exeter expect such excitement a might come to from letter from lady geraldine to talk to everybody around about lady geraldine must have sufficed for when hope be broken up have be really decided that there must be wedding when became apparent that cecilia holt be to remain a cecilia holt still there be autumn tour cecilia have declared that in place must life be so quiet for a at home mamma have said let prepare for what be to come mean to live together happily life must be home life then applied specially to flower shrub began even to look after vegetable in fulness of energy in day did not see much of three friend in august maude be married became mr thorne mr thorne be eldest son of squire from honiton for whom thing be to be made modestly comfortable during father life maude coming marriage have not be counted a much during day of friend high hope have risen in consideration since fall have taken place between miss altifiorla cecilia there have come not quarrel coolness two lady did continue to see other occasionally there be little between to console misery miss altifiorla have attempted to resume position of equality unreasoned imaginary equality with perhaps slight step in advance to in present circumstance be entitled by age cecilia cared nothing for equality must not consent to be held to have lost anything though miss altifiorla declared that friend have risen very highly in sentiment there be too evidently depreciation in manner cecilia must not endure consequently two lady be not at period of much comfort one to other with mr green matter might have be different mr green too manifestly thought that cecilia have be wrong still clung to idea that with proper management baronet might be made to come back again with lady holding such idea a there must be sympathy in owning truth must be confessed that cecilia at period of life be too self conscious did not think felt that world around be suffused by holt geraldine aspect flavour must not walk abroad without idea that people whom saw be talking about must not shut in garden without conviction that passer by be saying that girl living there have be jilted by sir francis geraldine have be well aware of greatness of position in be to have be placed though have abandoned situation without doubt a soon a have learned mistake a to man character still felt fall inwardly grieved over have not known at first how grievous must be isolation when found alone

be taken away from exeter for ever asked mr holt doctor did not say for ever mr holt might probably be able to let house for year go elsewhere for period then there arose question a to pretty furniture household good cecilia be most unwilling before christmas came arrangement have be made house be let first of january saw mr holt daughter comfortably established in pension at nice mr holt at rate declared that be comfortable though cecilia on mother behalf stated to be impossible told though have whispered no word on subject to living ear told that have be driven abroad by falsehood

in truth to console by beauty have not admitted that be consoled campanile at florence have filled with satisfaction come from supreme beauty still when went home to hotel thought more of sir francis geraldine than of campanile to have be jilted must be bad to have said of that have be jilted when be conscious that be untrue be sore provocation yet one must say that have behaved well be instigated by good motif have found that lover be ignoble did not love have at once separated from since in correspondence with friend have quietly endured idea must continually crop up that have be jilted never denied be false accusation rather than loss of that marriage have promised made feel matterhorn campanile to be equally ineffective then there gradually came to comfort from source from have certainly not expected on travel have become acquainted with mr western silent shy almost middle aged man whom have sat next to at dinner for nearly week before have become acquainted with have passed on from scenery to city a have be fortune mr western have passed on with who doe not know way in strange traveller becomes friend on second third meeting in station hotel saloon in way mr holt cecilia have become acquainted with mr western on parting with at venice in october have received with gratification assurance that must again turn up in rome be very good sort of man said mr holt to daughter night cecilia agreed with perhaps le enthusiasm than mother have displayed for mr assertion have be quite enthusiastic cecilia did think that mr western have made agreeable be unmarried man however there have be something in nature of communication have made to have prevented from being loud in praise not that communication have be one have in way given offence have be unexpected confidential of such nature a to create much thought no doubt intimacy have sprung up between yet be singular that man apparently so reticent a mr western must make such communication how intimacy have grown by degree need not here be explained that have grown to be very close will appear from nature of story told story be one of mr western own life be a follows be man of good not of large fortune have be to oxford have there distinguished have be called to bar have not practised have gone into parliament have left finding that bench of house of common be only fitted for waste of time have joined

certain miss mary tremenhere by have be jilted since for twelve month have be travelling abroad in quest said not of consolation of mitigation of woe cecilia when heard whispered to one little question do love thought did answered then subject be dropped be most singular communication for to make why must elderly man a at first took to be select a recipient for tale took to be elderly man till found by accident of conversation that be two year younger than sir francis geraldine then looked into face saw that appearance of age have come upon from sorrow there be tinge of grey through hair there be settled line about face look of steadied thought about mouth robbed of youth when observed upright form perceived that be strong stalwart man in very pride of manhood a far a strength be concerned then felt that have wronged still be one who have suffered so much a to be entitled to be called old felt impossibility of putting in same category among men a filled by sir francis geraldine strength of manhood be still there not salt of youth why must have told her who have exactly same story to tell back again if only must tell once twice there came to idea that must tell have sought for sympathy not under assurance of secrecy with full conviction a felt that secret must be safe why must not do same that there must be great comfort in doing so be well aware to have one who must sympathise with hitherto have one even mother who be kindness even obedience who attended to smallest wish even mother regretted baronet son in law yet must have be left alone said to herself marvelling at unselfish fondness of mother mr western must be bound to sympathise having called upon for sympathy must be ready when have thought of thrice did not do be to tell story must seem a though be repeating to back own too have be in love engaged have jilted gentleman considerably senior in age must have to say that likening to girl who have jilted else to tell other story untrue story story world believed in order that might be on par with must not do if told must tell truth truth be not suitable to be told therefore kept peace sympathised with one sided sympathy in rome did again meet on occasion met a quite old friend called upon at hotel sat with happier than usual in manner for almost light gay of heart party be made to st peter coliseum capitol when left on occasion cecilia remarked to mother how much le triste be than usual men suppose said to herself get over kind of thing quicker than woman in rome seemed to cecilia mr western when alone with have other subject for conversation than ill treatment have received from mary tremenhere eagerness in coming back to subject quite surprised be fascinated by yet felt must be better be to put stop to there be way of doing unless be to take mother from rome must not tell on matter have said enough must warn that so much of confidential intercourse between must give rise in mind of others to erroneous idea mother never seemed to see that there be anything peculiar in intercourse so went on from day to day from week to week asked once whether loved said one day did be astonished now that must have be so be very lovely suppose so most perfect complexion be ever seen on lady cheek cecilia remembered that complexion too have be praised before blow have fallen upon colour must come go so rapidly that used to marvel be thought drove blood hither thither there be thought unless of own prettiness own fortune accepted a husband because be necessary for to settle in life be in parliament that thought to be something have house in chester square be something be promised carriage that conquered a bride have chosen for became known to many then began to understand that might have done better with be old not given to many amusement then came man with better income with fewer year did not hesitate for moment when took aside told that have changed mind be quiescence indifference that disturbed most there be nothing of new lover simply that did not love did not stoop for moment to prayer took at word left within week be acknowledged to be engaged to captain geraldine naming of name of course struck cecilia holt remembered to have heard something of coming marriage by lover cousin something too of story of girl have reached ear in lightest form have hardly remained in memory be now of matter a have determined to keep own history to herself therefore made exclamation when name of geraldine be mentioned how must love after that continued betraying strong passion felt have loved girl whose existence have imagined of whom have seen merely outward form have known nothing of inner self what be that love continued be merely coloured doll soft to touch pleasant to kiss be inner nature hope to discover of have found outside so attractive have found no inner have be possible must love be welcome to mere doll who be wanted simply that must grace equipage have asked why be that be so sorely driven seeing that in truth love must not have now for world know well how providential have be escape yet go about like wounded animal who can find none to consort with till met learnt to talk to be truly miserable why because have be saved from falling when standing on precipice because engine have not be allowed to crush when passing along on iron road ought not to rejoice be thankful rather a think of what have escaped in truth be poor weakness of human nature people say have be jilted what matter to what people say have be saved a time go on will know be thankful word of came home to gave back own story there be own soreness own salvation there be remembrance of what people in exeter be saying of only slightly relieved by conviction that have be preserved from life of unhappiness have never be able to look at quite a did knew that better thing have happened to though knew also be sore at heart because people told story a thought to discredit there be indeed difference between be said truly of that girl have jilted falsely of that have be jilted however told nothing of own life there have come moment in be sorely tempted have allowed to pas by telling on occasion that at rate be not moment must not do now now now lest there must seem to be peculiar motive on own part so matter went on till there have arisen feeling of free confidence on one side of absolute restraint on other must not do said to herself much a trusted mr western deeply a regarded a friend strongly a wished that story have be told to at former passage of intimacy proper time have passed by said must be left in ignorance then one day there happened that outside world at rome have long expected among number mr holt george western proposed to marry cecilia holt of world at rome

fallen into habit of confiding to in everything have told her of money of future life have consulted about book picture have bought even about servant of establishment can not have expected yet when moment came be unable to give answer be not that did not think that liked have be surprised to find how fond have gradually become of how sir francis have faded in memory have become poor washed out daub of man while other have grown into proportion of hero did not declare to herself that loved be sure that must do so two reason did for while make feel that must not accept one be weak a water still operated with since have be abroad have corresponded regularly with miss altifiorla miss altifiorla in letter have be very strong in aversion to matrimony many thing have be said apparently with intention of comforting cecilia written in truth with view of defending have chosen better side have be true to without danger of stumbling so be that miss altifiorla put dearest cecilia have have accident have recovered stand once more upon solid ground take care oh take care that fall cecilia did not remember that chance of stumbling have come in miss altifiorla way be upon whole disgusted by constancy of friend argument still did weigh drove to ask whether in truth unmarried life be not safer for woman cause operated strongest with be silence have maintained there be indeed reason why must not at once begin tell story in doing so must appear that have be induced to do only by mr western offer cheated by vague idea that must be telling secret of person have be for only said to must have done long since that made improper then must make still more improper now so held peace told mr western nothing of story came to day after offer demanded answer be not a yet able to give to have in meantime told mother have received from ready willing quick assurance of sanction be sure to operate in different way than intended mother be thinking only of material interest of comfortable house steady well to do life companion of what more must have thought reader will say cecilia have still in head undefined vague notion of something might be better than of companion who might be better than companion other girl generally choose for dreamed of one who must sit with during long morning read dante to when must have taught to understand of one with hidden nobility of character must be divine invective against matrimony have come from fear lest man with hidden nobility must not be forthcoming have tried have nearly tried sir francis geraldine have made one hideous mistake be be not mr western man with such hidden nobility if so thought that might love required week gave whole thought to object must must not abandon that mode of life to have certainly pledged in first day of misery created by geraldine disruption have declared that must never more open ear heart to matrimonial project promise have only be made to miss altifiorla to miss altifiorla to herself at present moment did not greatly regard miss altifiorla promise made to herself corroborated by assurance to almost overcame then there be that story must not now tell to mr western must not say to yes will accept must first hear tale then tell exact copy of own to yet be necessary that must know time must come day ala did not remember that day must be le painful le disagreeable than present if did not like story now must tell so have done with there must be fault found with have hitherto be free to to tell not a pleased have not meant to have disclosed secret now be necessary even have fancied that have invented in part made like to own harm no dangerous harm must come from that must be angry recede from offer found that did not wish to recede objection to matrimony have be cured told at last moment that be not able to undergo absurdity of such revelation accepted chapter v cecilia second chance became at once necessary that mr western must start off for london have be already explained must go whether accepted refused when have named week have told that must only have just time to wait for reply offered to be ready in five day must not hurry during week have hardly seen be aware that remained silent moody almost sullen be somewhat afraid of temper yet have found in other respect so open so noble so consistent will be so said putting hand into then very nature seemed to have changed appeared a though nothing must restrain in expression of satisfaction nothing must be more quietly joyous than manner be to have left rome by mid day train must wait for train at midnight in order that might once dine with own wife be to be will kill with fatigue cecilia said laughed at be not so easy to kill then sat with through long morning telling her of doings of past life scheme for life to come have great book wanted to write a to everybody might laugh at must not laugh laughed at aspiration promised sympathy told of house at exeter of mother future loneliness must do anything for within power mother must live with if wished spoke of money be to be own told of offer mother have made a to giving up portion of of must have none told how must be settled behaved just a lover must do taking upon to give direction giving direction just such a must have then went there came upon cold chilling feeling that have already be untrue to be feeling a to must not speak even to mother why have not mother advised urged to tell everything mother have said not word to about why did mother treat a though be one to be feared beyond possibility of advice to mother said not word on subject from moment in mr western have first begun to pay attention name of sir francis have never be mentioned between mother daughter now in intercourse mr holt spoke with unclouded serenity of future life be to a though geraldine episode have be absolutely obliterated from memory of mr western to be everything must not accept magnificent offer of home because knew that old woman in man house must only be considered a in way must divide income give at rate third to daughter did bestow much advice a to manner in everything must be done so a to tend to happiness taste must be adopted way of life must be studied pursuit must be made pursuit friend friend be very well cecilia knew without teaching from mother instinct told a much a what be to do with secret loaded bosom a to must not bring even to ask mother advice then made up mind that must write to lover relate whole story a to sir francis geraldine did write be alarmed at finding that story when told extended over various sheet of paper story must take shape of confession a though be telling lover of passage in life of have cause to be ashamed knew that there be ground for shame have done nothing ought not to have done nothing must not have acknowledged to without blush when letter be completed found to be one must not send be a though be telling something on reading must have to decide whether engagement must must not be continued be not at purpose thinking of with view to happiness to honour did not wish to suppose that there must be doubt on subject be clear to that letter so worded be not fit for occasion destroyed still be minded to write to for moment postponed purpose of course wrote to friend in exeter be to be silent to must appear a though be ashamed of what be now doing told maude hippesley mr thorne a be now called told mr green also miss altifiorla immediate answer came from three from two married lady be in respect satisfactory that from mr thorne be quite enthusiastic in praise of matrimony that from mr green be little le warm be still discreetly happy have doubt in own mind that married life be preferable mr western though perhaps little old be upon whole well chosen deserving consort for life letter from miss altifiorla be very different from a have effect perhaps in producing circumstance be to be told will be given at length dear cecilia be of course expected to congratulate a far a mr western merit be concerned do so with full heart be possessed have doubt of virtue must adorn husband be in respect very opposite to sir francis geraldine give to understand that be steady hard working properly ambitious in spite of mistake made in reference to sir francis geraldine will not doubt that judgment in respect to mr western will be found correct if be to be dare say must not be better must be of course must said cecilia to herself feeling very angry with miss altifiorla for raising question at time in such manner after sweet converse sweeter resolution have passed between on matter must be abandoned like breath of summer wind meaning nothing of what infinitely bad taste be not woman guilty in thus raising question when only final answer to have be already given cecilia felt ashamed of a thought of in have admitted friendship of such friend breath of summer wind said repeating with scorn friend somewhat high flown word can not say that like martha have chosen worser part continued letter thing of world be in accident have be for moment in to knowing a do be aware how soon will fade away have more than proper weight then will wake day feel that have devoted to mending of stocking feeding of baby there be something in stirred cecilia to absolute wrath if there be baby must not be baby a well a be not intention of lord that world must be populated worser part indeed then took up cudgel in own mind on behalf of martha a have often done before how must world get on unless there be marthas be not more than probable that self dubbed mary must fall into idle way under pretence that be filled with special inspiration looking at miss altifiorla a mary be somewhat in love with marthas doubt that mr western be what must be letter went on even judging by letter find that be autocratic opinioned be future life not yours of be thinking success not yours doings not doings how doe know exclaimed cecilia have only account of not of be right in went on letter because way of world allow such privilege to men what must man be unless took place personal strength have obtained for for woman in general of course matrimony be fit have to earn bread think of little else to be man toy then slave with due allowance for food clothes suffices for have dreamed dream that must not suffice for ala ala stand alone now in expression of creed must excuse if repine when find so cruelly deserted cecilia felt to be a absurd a be ill timed to be redeemed a be from ill nature by ridiculous philosophy at last there came paragraph admitted of such excuse what have mr western said a to story of sir francis geraldine of course have told whole presume that have pardoned that episode in spite of expression of feeling have be unable to control must believe dear cecilia be a anxious a ever for happiness be most affectionate friend francesca altifiorla cecilia when have completed reading of letter believed nothing of kind that last paragraph about sir francis have turned all kindly feeling into wrath contained one word knew not how to endure be told that mr western have pardoned geraldine episode in life have done nothing for pardon have be necessary to merit pardon there must have be misconduct a woman have known behaviour in matter what right have to talk of pardon in what have deserved pardon at rate pardon of mr western there have be foolish engagement made between sir francis geraldine have be most wisely dissolved sin if sin there have be be against sir francis certainly have never be considered a sin by woman who now wrote to be sin that have loved before matter a to mr western be necessarily in ignorance when first came to might not come to pas that pardon must be required in story have never be told to be sting came from that feeling added fierceness to wrath of course have told whole presume that have pardoned that episode have not told mr western whole have thus created episode for pardon might be required be that woman have intended to insinuate understanding with little sharpness with poor appreciation of character how probable be that cecilia must not have told of previous engagement sat thinking of night till matter assumed new difficulty in mind eyesight began to question to herself whether mr western have right to secret whether secret did not belong to two person be bound to keep for sake of other person have committed wrong injury at rate have inflicted deserved punishment upon sir francis one a to man must naturally much dislike that must be noised about world be not bound to keep secret still secret for sake be angry with when asked question still asked knew that owed nothing to sir francis geraldine that owed to mr western still asked because in way must best strengthen against telling of story more turned matter in mind more impossible to became task of telling at last resolved that must not tell now must not tell at rate till again saw because miss altifiorla have told that presumed have pardoned that episode be arranged that must be married at exeter in house there be not yet vacant must be lent to for fortnight after marriage mr holt must go into lodging remain there till house must be ready for be to return to exeter together then there must be bustle confusion till happy ceremony must have be performed be arranged that must have two bridesmaid be determined that must not ask miss altifiorla to be one of younger sister of mr green younger sister also of maude hippesley be chosen miss altifiorla when came to see cecilia on return expressed a quite satisfied be best so dear said be afraid that must ask of course must have done heart must not have be there can understand know cecilia wrath have become mitigated by time answered friend civilly just so think ought to be old maid therefore like to lend hand at turning into young wife have got two girl who have objection on score might find hundred in exeter said miss altifiorla proudly yet may be right in opinion mr western be to come down to exeter only on day before marriage holts have seen a came through london where slept one night a yet story have not be told cecilia expected almost wished that story might reach from other quarter be so natural now that must talk about girl whom intended to marry so natural a cecilia thought that in doing so must hear name of sir francis geraldine sir francis be man well known to world of fashion many men must have heard of intended marriage cecilia though almost hoped almost feared that must be so figure of mr western asking with angry voice why have not be told did alarm asked such question a far a cecilia knew have heard anything of sir francis when holts passed through london did seem to have heard when came down to exeter at rate did not say word respecting sir francis spent last evening with holts in own house cecilia felt that have never before made so happy with so pleasant so joyous have be same during long walk together in afternoon be so full of affair be own be so soon to become own that there be not moment for in must tell story there be story for telling of peculiar atmosphere be required be one of must not interrupt in middle of discourse say oh by bye there be something have got to say to to tell story must tune mind to purpose must begin in proper tone be sure that must be ready to hearken to a must be heard felt that telling must be specially difficult in that have be put off so long though have made up mind to tell before have started on walk desirable moment never came so again put off saying that must be done late at night when mother have gone to bed time came when be alone with sitting with arm around waist telling of thing must do for to make life blessed how too must endeavour to do little thing for in order that life might be happy must not tell then though little might come of must not do yet from day to day feeling have grown upon that be certainly duty to let know that one accident in life there be disgrace in cause for anger on part even for displeasure if have only be told at rome must then have taken left a pleased of course must have taken only trouble of life must have be spared what possible reason must there have be that must not take be not reason of kind have kept silent of be quite confident indeed now must not explain to herself why have held peace seemed to a though must have be mad to have let day after day go by at rome never to have mentioned to name of sir francis geraldine such ala have be fact now time have come in found to be impossible to tell story a went for last time to solitary bed endeavoured to console by thinking that must have heard of from other quarter then again declared that in nobility must certainly not have be silent must have questioned then have told that be right between now a tossed unhappily on pillow told that be wrong chapter vi what friend said about went merry a marriage bell george western cecilia holt be married in cathedral by dean who be thus supposed to show great anger at brother in law conduct be more strongly evinced by presence of hippesleys for be there to grace ceremony except maude who be still absent with young squire who wrote letter full of warmest affection congratulation cecilia received on very morning miss altifiorla also came to cathedral with pink bow in bonnet determined to show that though be left alone in theory of life did not resent desertion mr green be there humble sweet tempered a ever snubbing husband little who assisted at altar whispering word into friend ear to assure that have done proper thing be hardly necessary to say that on morning of wedding be in truth impossible for cecilia to tell story have now to be left untold with what hope there might be for smoothing over in future stage of married life have done deed now have married man with untold secret in heart sin surely must not be of nature to weigh so deeply on conscience endeavoured to comfort with idea again again how many girl be married who have be engaged to at least in love with dozen suitor before man have come who be at last to be lord cecilia told a endeavoured thus to find comfort that nature be not such a theirs thing have done be sin not sin according a might be regarded by person who did be sin to heavy grievous sin one weighed terribly on conscience a repeated word after dean at altar that morning there be moment in almost refused to repeat in almost brought to demand that might retire for time with who be not yet husband give chance mind entertained exaggerated feeling of feeling felt to be exaggerated must not restrain in meantime service went on irrevocable word be spoken when be done be led away into cathedral vestry a sad bride a might be yet nobody have seen trouble with capacity for struggling infinitely greater than possessed by man have smiled looked happy beneath bridal finery a though grief have weighed heavily at heart be a jocund bridegroom a ever put ring upon lady finger gloom of have seemed to be nature till after have accepted have vanished altogether carried with sheepish shame faced demeanour a though half ashamed of thing have done seemed a proud to be bridegroom a ever girl be to become bride in truth be proud of did think that have chosen well after former trouble of life did feel that have brought to happy haven at last there be modest breakfast at mr holt house from guest departed quickly a soon a bride bridegroom have be taken away to railway station when others be gone miss altifiorla remained out of kindness mr holt need make stranger of must be so desolate for to be alone so surmised miss altifiorla suppose said when have fastened up pink ribbon so that might not be soiled by trifle with prepared to regale while asked question suppose that know story about other man why must asked mr holt in sharp tone be quite uncommon to well know much about such thing presume be common to tell gentleman when anything of kind have occurred what business have to know what can matter perhaps doe know have not told why must tell think that be thing need talk about may be quite sure that cecilia have done what be proper in saying mr holt belied own thought cecilia have never said word to about have dared to say word to own daughter on subject have be intently anxious that daughter must be married when have seen mr western in act of falling in love have studiously abstained from subject might bring about reference to sir francis geraldine have felt that daughter must make that straight daughter be so much more wise so much more certain to do what be right so much more high minded than be that considered bound to leave to cecilia a day went on hour fixed for marriage became nearer nearer have become anxious something seemed to tell that duty have be omitted moment have never come in have be able to ask daughter now must not endure to be cross examined on subject by miss altifiorla miss altifiorla be not at afraid of mr holt be determined to push question little further ought to know know be sure cecilia will have thought that if ought to know then doe know said mr holt with great certainty be sure may leave to cecilia if be satisfied with doe not matter much who else may be dissatisfied oh if be satisfied be enough said miss altifiorla a took leave felt sure that secret have not be told that ought to have be told felt proud to think that have spotted fault cecilia holt must have done very well in world have confined a have solemnly promised to high solitary feminine duty to miss altifiorla have devoted have chosen to make slave of man who a miss altifiorla expressed to must turn upon rend miss altifiorla have seen did see time might come when wounded dove must return to care of course hoped that time must not come might will tell one thing said mr green to husband a walked home from breakfast girl have not yet said word to man about sir francis geraldine what make think that dear think know be not likely that there must be much talk about sir francis in cathedral at breakfast one can tell from other thing whether subject have be avoided be plain when little thing must have be said be not said there have be allusion made to reason for leaving house see that signifies much dear oh doe what must have thought if after have become engaged to have found that month two before have be engaged to man be more than twelve month dear be not more than twelve month since first met in italy know what be talking about need not contradict will find that will learn of sudden then fat will be in fire know what men be be thus that gentle mr green expressed on subject to husband at deanery matter be spoken of in different tone still with similar feeling think cecilia have ever yet said word to poor man a to engagement with francis can not tell what have put into mind think that be so be thus that mr hippesley spoke to dean brother behaved very badly very badly

long a behaved well to if have heard nothing of now find out be not man take to be if let hear of be nothing to said dean oh be nothing to will see that what say come true in way world of cecilia

long statement about sir francis have interest whatsoever required to be at once destroyed soon learnt in married life that husband have wish to see letter must so willingly have shown to must have taken joy in asking for sympathy delight in exposing miss altifiorla peculiar view of life that lost much by constrained reticence necessity of destroying paper be very grievous to though knew that must not read letter without permission still must destroy in possible way endeavoured to silence correspondent not answering at first then giving such answer a be certainly not affectionate in way must miss altifiorla be snubbed then after while proposed to come stay week at durton lodge be not to be endured very thought of filled poor mr western heart with despair yet did not like to refuse without telling husband of miss altifiorla have already made mention mr western have be taught to laugh at peculiarity of old maid pray have said to will make very uncomfortable life will be burden to what can say to room suggested cecilia there be two room know there be be one to be driven by strict regard for literal truth to entertain unwelcome friend miss altifiorla thought that ought not to have married a thought ought have word about whom did want to marry asked mr western with laugh nobody be averse to marriage altogether unless be advocate of other suitor see that need quarrel with be friend not mine if choose to put off of course can do so must advise to find something more probable than want of bedroom in house in one be only occupied there be truth in what reason must find knowing husband regard to truth did not dare to suggest reason to friend more plausible than want of room still essentially false be driven about thinking that must get husband to take away from home for awhile for two three day letter remained unanswered when husband suggested to that have better write must not go somewhere replied with look of trouble on brow run away from home on account of miss altifiorla said be beginning to be afraid of knew that be so did not dare to declare to thought be afraid at moment that must read then must just tell that ca have will be best if have made up mind a far a be concerned be welcome friend of yours must be welcome oh george must bore out of life be not so easily bored be sure that intimate friend of yours must have something to say for oh plenty a for having be advocate for single life have not seen therefore reason must not have be personal there be great many young woman thirty year old upwards who take up idea wish to subject perhaps because have not be asked by right person think there have be person here not that be bad looking perhaps think will fall in love with 'd have directly be last person in world must think of can get on very well with anyone who have idea there be at rate something to strike at young lady who agrees with everything suggests nothing be to most intolerable at rate have better make up mind at once will have here before know where be be did indeed happen on day after last conversation mr western wrote letter in expressed sorrow engagement for present prevented from having power to entertain friend doubt letter be cold unfriendly a read over to herself declared that must have be much hurt to have received letter from friend declared again that under circumstance must have offered a miss altifiorla have done nevertheless felt ashamed of letter of however became quite unnecessary when in course of afternoon miss altifiorla appeared at durton lodge arrived with torrent of reason have come up to london on business admitted of excuse be sure that friend letter must have gone astray that letter for last three day have be expecting to return from london to exeter without seeing dear friend must be so unfeeling unnatural must have come to durton lodge must have returned to exeter in fact so put a to make appear impossible that must not have come dear miss altifiorla said mr western be sure that cecilia be delighted to see a for be quite welcome a fact there be there be sending away again getting out of house without sojourn of day mischief might do might be done at once there must be doubt that must begin to talk of sir francis geraldine declare secret be now one care of cecilia mind to keep away from husband mattered not that presence there showed to be vulgar impertinent obtrusive there be must be dealt with a friend a enemy again cecilia almost made up mind a to better course let go to husband tell tell also why be that told now let endure anger then there must be end of there be nothing else a to have need to dread again when found with be happy jocund jested with about friend must not get into humour in be proper that must be told did not tell went down to dinner with terrible load about heart three four time during evening conversation be on point of turning to matter in name of sir francis geraldine must surely be mentioned with infinite care without showing care contrived to master subject to force friend husband to talk of other thing struggle be very great be aware that must not be repeated reader will remember perhaps stern thought miss holt have entertained a to friend when friend have thought proper to give idea of what duty ought to be in regard to present husband remembered well that miss altifiorla have written to asking whether mr western have forgiven that episode mother too have in writing dropped word word intended to be only half intelligible a to question miss altifiorla have asked after wedding breakfast knew well what have be in woman mind knew also what have be in own remembered how proudly have disdained advice of woman when have be given to yet now must go to ask for mercy saw other way out of immediate trouble did not believe that friend must be silent when told to be silent yet how painfully disgraceful to bride must be telling went up to miss altifiorla room after have gone for night found friend getting into bed happy with assistance of strange maid oh dear said miss altifiorla hair be not half done yet be in hurry for mary will go to own room said mr western when mary will tell that be ready will come to there be something have to tell have not be five minute in own room before mary summoned something to be told took immediate hold of miss altifiorla imagination induced to be ready for bed with hair may suppose half done francesca said mr western a soon a entered room have favour to ask favour yes favour have come prepared with request down to very word in must be uttered wish while remain here to make allusion to sir francis geraldine miss altifiorla almost whistled a heard word spoken understand do not wish word to be said may by chance lead to mention of sir francis geraldine name if will understand that will be able to comply with wish request made almost in stern word of absolute order there be nothing humble in demeanour nothing seemed to tell of suppliant having given command remained quiet waiting for answer then be reason why did answer did not want to see therefore remained silent did not want to see be not on account remained silent must have written to indeed have written to letter must have gone to day wrote to putting off a be here have to tell wish be sure that will do a must have have to think of duty said miss altifiorla then there came black frown on mr western brow duty what duty must have in such matter except to suspected woman of desire to make mischief felt confident that woman must do so unless repressed by extraction from of promise to contrary did believe that woman must keep word that must feel bound to preserve from accusation of direct falsehood from good feeling from kindness from affection from feminine bond ought to have made silent expected nothing duty francesca in matter be to said mr western assuming wonderful severity of manner have known many year be bound to by many tie tell what wish be can not quite explain reason doubt that will guess have kept secret said miss altifiorla with devilish mixture of malice fun cunning doe not matter what have done there be reason made wish to avoid immediate coming at present moment must interfere gravely with happiness with mine be to learn circumstance of sir francis geraldine courtship of course be painful to to have to say to be so painful that to avoid have absolutely written to telling not to come have done not to avoid coming must otherwise have be pleasure to to save from great pain now know know also what be that expect from miss altifiorla listened to in silence be seated in easy bedroom chair clothed from head to foot in pale pink dressing gown from colour be nearly washed out hair a have said be half done in trouble to collect thought became quite unaware of accessory dear friend cecilia have put matter to so strongly that did not quite dare to refuse yet what fund of gratification might there not be in telling such story under such circumstance to husband sat silent for while meditating on till mr western roughly forced reply from lip desire to have promise said mr western oh yes of course will carefully avoid allusion to subject since wish will do so be sufficient now good night know that be doing wrong said miss altifiorla must indeed be doing wrong said mr western if be to take upon to destroy happiness on matter after having be duly warned chapter viii lady grant be literally true that tongue will itch with desire to tell secret miss altifiorla tongue did itch upon whole endured suffering kept promise did not say word in mr western hearing led to sir francis geraldine a topic of conversation in reward for exacted from mr western undertaking to keep at durton lodge for fortnight bargain be not exactly struck in word be so made that mr western understood how great be price paid how valuable article received in return fortnight mr western said when wife told of promise have made thought three day must have be too much for three hour be too much a interrupting happiness a be here a have be very intimate for many year a have named time have not liked to contradict so be will interfere much more with than with suppose that coming will not be frequently repeated two day after guest proposed to visit be only for two night coming have in fact be expected from period before marriage lady grant be mr western younger sister person of whom in world seemed to think most indeed have assured wife that next to herself be nearest dearest to be widow went little into society according to account be clever agreeable beautiful lived altogether in scotland where time be devoted to child be now coming up to england chiefly with purpose of seeing brother wife be to be at durton lodge now only for couple of night then to return remain with understood purpose of taking with back to scotland of lady grant cecilia have become much afraid a thinking more than probable that secret might be known have seemed that a yet lady grant knew nothing of corresponded frequently with brother a far a cecilia must tell subject have not yet be mentioned between must be possible that time secret be known to husband to husband sister if so silence to be almost cruel up to morning of coming miss altifiorla have certainly kept promise have kept promise though there have be twenty little opening a to must have be so easy for to lead way to matter a to tongue longed to be speaking when mention be made of baronet married unmarried of former lover of broken vow of second engagement miss altifiorla must look with meaning glance at hostess of glance cecilia must apparently take heed have soon got to know miss altifiorla promise must be kept unless be led by other person into indirect breach of cecilia life during period be one of great agony still endured without allowing husband to perceive that be so now on coming of lady grant what step must take must ask friend to be silent also to second person must presume promise to be so extended must not bring to make second request task of doing so be too ponderous miss altifiorla manner of receiving request made such burden that must not submit to woman looked at spoke to in manner be obliged to endure without seeming to endure aught be unnatural looked back to own struggle during evening in bedroom must see woman a sat struggling in pale pink dressing gown to escape from necessity of promising must not have such scene a thought that perhaps with one added word promise might be made to suffice when be alone together miss altifiorla must constantly refer to geraldine affair be to be expected to be endured there must come end to fortnight woman must be gone do think that lady grant know said in whisper have become usual to on such occasion be sure know nothing about said cecilia how can be sure know have never seen will be very odd if have not heard at rate nothing need be said to in house hint need be made to either by think must have heard happen to know that have great correspondence law when think of who sir francis be of manner in life be almost impossible to conceive that person must not have heard of need not tell be quite safe with have given word ought to be enough nobody must have be more studious to avoid matter though indeed have sometimes be difficult then there have be feeling of doubt whether duty ought not to make divulge there be something in be peculiarly painful to cecilia duty of woman to husband to whom loved so truly to with whom be in very core of heart to have everything in common francesca altifiorla to speak of duty to even have to be borne indeed feel day that be staying here that be sacrificing duty to friendship oh into what trouble have fallen without sin of own a told without at least great sin when be moment at ought to have told story thought that must remember exact moment when have come back to for answer at end of week then have not told simply from dislike to repeat back to story have heard from lady grant came nothing must be sweeter more gracious than meeting miss altifiorla be not there two lady in presence of husband brother received other with quick intimacy immediate loving friendship be given only to woman to entertain lady grant be ten year senior widow have that air of living through evening of life instead of still enjoying morning be peculiar to widow who have loved husband be very lovely even in mitigated widow weed with tall figure pale oval face rather thin not meagre attenuated cecilia thought that saw in determination to love on side at once determined that must return lady grant affection not for reason be secret to be known looked on lady grant a one whom must so willingly have made friend in thing still a one whom a to single matter must not regard a enemy sat together for couple of hour before dinner then at night there be sitting from miss altifiorla be again banished there be joking question asked answer given a to miss altifiorla presence there be something in manner gait of lady grant made cecilia almost ashamed of exeter friend be not that miss altifiorla be ignorant unladylike ill dressed that knew friend too well miss altifiorla be little mean whereas cecilia be ready to accept sister in law a great noble miss altifiorla be not therefore spoken of in highest term mode of coming to durton lodge without invitation be subjected to little ridicule mr western when went to room be comforted at rate in thinking that lady grant did not know secret how poor must have be state of comfort may be judged from fact that must add to on following morning met at breakfast went well lady grant must not notice that young lady from devonshire seemed to exercise authority incommensurate with tone in have be described day passed by happily enough cecilia be strong in hope that lady grant might take departure without reference to one subject of sorrow night however comfort such a be be brought to end a be sitting together in lady grant bedroom cecilia ear be suddenly wounded by mention of name of sir francis geraldine in immediate agony must hardly tell how occurred be rapidly asked question a to former engagement in asking of there be nothing rough nothing unkind nothing intended to wound nothing to show feeling that must not be so question have be asked there be fact that lady grant knew whole story there be fact also that husband did not know else that other fact must have given world to know to be fact that knew have willingly held peace respecting even to sister if must be so then must be happy if must be so if must know that be so then must afford to despise miss altifiorla tyranny though word have be not yet moment uttered must not at first remember how have be said there be simply knowledge that name of sir francis geraldine have be used that have be declared that have be engaged to up to moment have be very brave very powerful too over up to have never betrayed now courage gave way colour came to cheek forehead neck then passed rapidly away betrayed doe not know asked lady grant a said word put out hand pressed cecilia in own tone of voice be loving friendly sisterly though there be reproach in be not so bitter a cecilia be constantly addressing to herself reproach be in ear not in lady grant voice word be repeated before cecilia must answer doe not know hope be thus abolished almost from moment of lady grant coming into house have taught to think that must know be impossible that two must be ignorant impossible also a thought that sister must know that must not be now at end be necessary that must answer sister question yet so difficult to find word in to do so attempted to speak word must not come even one word must not form on lip fell upon knee burying face in lady grant lap thus told secret have never heard of again asked lady grant oh dear must not have be so must not be so if must tell if must tell tell what be sure there be nothing for to tell need blush to speak nothing nothing then why must not know why must not have known cecilia will tell to night before go to rest not to night be impossible must wait till woman have gone miss altifiorla know oh yes know too that doe not know question cecilia answered only by sign fancied that might be so thought that there be something between

same thing of too have have lover have jilted if please to call so be to tell that must hardly have be true think must have be true true to letter said cecilia determined that sir francis geraldine lie must not prevail at moment have done to sir francis just what girl have done to brother be guided by other motif have think behaved properly be to tell to then why not own story back again must not do then after that from time to time occasion have gone by word have be said by have made impossible twenty time have determined to do twenty time opportunity have be lost be obliged to tell woman not to mention in presence must know wish did be man who will not bear to be kept in dark on question know have read character know can not know a do said lady grant though be wife have not be so long enough to know how true be how affectionate how honest yet how jealous be to say that be unforgiving must belie without many thought must forgive man who have robbed of fortune health be hard for to forgive considers to be offence against self love know longer be kept in dark deeper will be wound of such man be impossible to say what suspect will not think that have loved le that be le true to there will be something will rankle will not endeavour to define be noblest man on earth most generous till be offended then be most bitter describe character just a have read if be so must be careful

injured may know may not know may hear tale at period of married life harm will follow man expects to see thought in breast of woman to whose love be trust a though be written there for in clear light written in letter one else will read have nothing that may not read said mr western there be something that have not read something that have not be invited to read let not remain so tell to even though may have to support anger for time to pine in shadow of displeasure mr western a went away to own room felt relief at rate in conviction that with lady grant secret must be safe strong a be bond bound to brother there must be on tongue itching desire to tell secret simply because be there to be told have not threatened spoken of duty boasted of friendship have simply given advice in strongest language be within power to use on next morning took leave started on journey without showing even by glance that be possessed of secret doe know asked miss altifiorla a soon a two be in drawing room together using kind of whisper have now become habitual to may almost be said that mr western have come to hate friend looked forward to time of going a liberation from misery miss

study have wandered forth alone in way have increased wife feeling of anger against visitor have made look forward to departure with increasing impatience event happened have at once disturbed plan be sitting in drawing room with miss altifiorla at about five in evening discussing in most disagreeable manner secrecy of first engagement be to say miss altifiorla be persisting in discussion whereas mr western be positively refusing to make subject of conversation think be demanding too much from said miss altifiorla have given way be afraid wrongly a to husband must not do duty by be not to

ill will will do honour of asking mr western to come dine with at criterion be little place that lord tomahawk have last year then departed without word from cecilia western now must be told whispered miss altifiorla moment door be closed dear if will think of round will perceive that can be done by one so well a by myself will go to mr western moment come in get through in hour will hing of kind

exeter there will be in case additional fib use of such word applied to herself by woman be intolerable must only answer by involuntary frown upon brow then continued miss altifiorla of course will refer to will conclude that a knew sir francis at exeter must have known can not tell fib must not tell fib be uttered in such way a to declare that mr western have be fibbing can not tell fib will leave at rate to mind own business said cecilia in indignant tone a left room mr western be at hall door coming of sir francis have to be explained at once must not be left to be told when miss

did know miss altifiorla oh yes said that lady looking at cecilia with peculiar eye only that mr western be man not woman among men least suspicious till suspicion be aroused must have discovered at once from miss altifiorla manner that there be secret seems to have lived in very good clerical society down in exeter very different class from with whom have be intimate here of course be staying at

marries have to put up with husband friend said mr western gravely be nothing on earth to never wish to see again a long a live be unfortunate that must have turned out to be so near neighbour said miss altifiorla then for moment sir francis geraldine be allowed to be forgotten did not like to say before said afterwards in own room now cecilia be able to observe that manner be altogether altered

boasted of with such violent vulgarity be almost more than mr western must stand came down stair then underwent additional purgatory of listening to silver tongued farewell that with high idea of woman duty woman dignity must have put into condition be marvel to herself have one year since told that must become thus afraid of fellow creature of one loved best in world must have repelled who have told with disdain so be how be to tell husband that have be engaged to one whom have described to a gambler swindler chapter x sir francis travel with miss altifiorla miss altifiorla be at

have declined advice with scorn yet one word spoken by must have be destructive seeing that have be so treated have not be wrong to abstain from word anger against mr western be le hot in nature be still constant have not liked though have be formally civil dislike have be apparent be man proud of who ought to be punished for pride be quite proper that must learn that wife have be engaged to man

without much forethought not only must tell story must give reason more le plausible for telling of did not think that must at once make idea of justice plain to mr western must not put forth case so clearly a to make husband understand that be done in fair honour honesty a thought of came to conclusion that did not much care what impression might leave on mind of mr western still le what

injustice must not marvel at own folly have in truth known from first moment in have resolved to accept offer that be duty to tell story of adventure with sir francis geraldine must have be told indeed before have accepted offer must not now forgive in have be silent must know story must have said before there can be word more spoken between then with clear brow without tremor in voice must have told have allowed to be silent simply because have told same story then moment have never come must not forgive must never entirely forgive even though day must come in might pardon must ever pardon then mind must fly away to injustice of condemnation have spoken to darkly a though have intended to accuse of secret understanding with sir francis have believed to be guilty of underhand plot against happiness carried on with man to whom have be engaged of what be that have imagined to be guilty what be plot of in heart accused then imagination looked out seemed to tell that there must be one husband suspected of having married while heart be still property of other man a thought of indignation for time almost choked grief must be possible that to whom have given everything with such utter unreserve whom have made god of idolatry to whom have be exactly that have known so well how to describe must be that must have have thought concerning changed in moment that from believing to be pure innocent must have come to regard a thing so vile a almost tore hair in agony a said that must be so have told that respect esteem veneration have passed away must never consent to live with

grievous when have first received letter from sir francis have not believed to be true from first to last have be fiction when once wife have told that engagement have existed believed be a though have owned to circumstance of still existing intimate friendship have be kept in dark did not know how far still there loomed to a to future vaguely idea by deed be doing now at present moment be sacrificing happiness own for ever a regarded world people must say that have done so people whose voice must not regard must say so mother must acknowledge lady grant must know that have be so mr gray must always think so to end heart became tender even towards what must be fate a wife therefore debarred from prospect of other future must live with mother a widow must live with much le of hope with le chance of enjoying life than must other widow when mother must die must be alone to what punishment be not dooming if must die must be well for party have taken great step in life have failed why must doom who be differently constituted to similar failure have be great mistake have made now there be escape then again pity for welled up in heart why have be so allured so deceived so cozened have intended to have given good thing very essence of own being have bestowed upon while moment that back be turned be corresponding with sir francis geraldine that thought must not stand in truth have be greatly in error in first view of character of sir francis geraldine must be question whether be not so also baronet be poor creature not probably so utterly vile a thought a turned over in mind while wandering to fro came to conclusion that mr gray be wrong that be impossible that who have be sharer of thought of sir francis geraldine must now remain to share chapter xv once more at exeter three week have passed much have be done for mr western to fix fate in life be now august be already living at exeter a wife separated from husband of much have have to think much to determine before have found that haven of rest twice during time have received letter from husband letter have be short though not absolutely without affection in language letter have be absolutely obdurate have be made quite sure that be not for benefit of of that must attempt to live together having come to decision represented a unchangeable be willing said to do anything might demand for future satisfaction comfort there be nothing can do have said when have written last a have refused to do duty have made again angry what right have to talk to of duty seeing that have so grossly neglected own said to then have suddenly gone from england leaving address even with sister with lawyer during time mind be not quiet for one instant how must have treated so who have be so absolutely devoted to who have so entirely given up to happiness lady grant when have heard what be to be done have hurried up to london have not found have gone to exeter there have in vain endeavoured to comfort cecilia have declared that brother must in time forgive cecilia whole nature have by time apparently be changed forgive have said what will forgive there be nothing that can forgive nothing can be spoken of in same breath with perfidy cruelty can forgive ask that lady grant be possible must forgive after two day spent in conversation such a lady grant went back to town discussed matter with mr gray did not at present know brother address still there be hope that might induce to hear reason again to consent to live with wife of men said to lawyer be most honest most affectionate of men most self willed obstinate injustice be with like running sore ala be not always injustice something that have believed to be unjust cecilia have written at great length to mother telling with detail story a be to be told sparing in nothing that wicked man have contrived oh that one a husband must have be weak enough to have fallen into pit so prepared then mr holt have come up to town taken daughter back with to exeter now at last on occasion old lady be energetic passionate there have be much discussion before have decided that must again venture to live together among old friend in old home here cecilia have shown to be once again stronger than mother why not said what have done to make necessary that must be torn away from house be not at ashamed of what have done in have blazoned forth courage with almost false conviction knew that have done wrong that have done that of among wife ought to be ashamed sin have be so small in comparison with punishment inflicted upon that sunk to nothing even in own eye felt that have be barbarously used people of exeter people of world at large might sympathise with not a pleased under such mountain of wrong a have endured must not show by conduct of own that must have in least deserved mamma said let stay away let come will be ready for be poor wretched woman whom to crush utterly have be within power of man have loved have chosen to exercise must suffer will not make ashamed have done nothing to deserve cruelty then when have be at exeter few day there came source of trouble though not of unmitigated trouble told mother that in due course of time cruel husband must become father of child must not write to have not chosen to let know address be fitting to feeling to communicate fact in letter must address secretly to banker to club yet fact be of such nature that be imperative that must know at last be told by mr holt to lady grant cecilia have attempted have found that must not do must not write letter without word of tenderness be resolved that word of tenderness must go from to must seem a though be asking for money be putting forward coming of little stranger a plea for must ask for money have appealed to love have appealed in vain if be hard must be so too in heart of heart probably entertained idea of possible future in might yet put child into father arm must be done not at request must be at prayer at least there be comfort to that no longer dreaded power have so contrived that to thinking fault be altogether on side forgive oh yes must forgive oh yes must forgive so readily so sweetly with full determination that must all be like blank nightmare have come between troubled joy in bottom of heart of must be understood that have be hers to pardon to be pardoned if not so then must continue to live widowed life at exeter mr holt be energetic passionate rather than discreet must not admit that child have done wrong must not be got to understand that law must make husband live with wife in proper way be monstrous to thinking that daughter must be married taken away then sent back without offence on part in resentment felt against mr western filled quite new part among people of exeter oh mamma be so loving so good said daughter let talk about can not understand angry a be can not endure to have abused abused said mr holt kindling in wrath can not hold without abusing very soon did come to pas that mr western name be not mentioned between mr holt must now again clench fist shake head cecilia knew that in thought be executing vengeance against mr western there be truce to spoken word cecilia indeed often executed vengeance against husband after fashion of own mother did not perceive among exeter friend there soon came to be actual breach with miss altifiorla miss altifiorla a soon a be known that mr western have reappeared in exeter have rushed down to greet friend there have be received coldly by cecilia more than coldly by cecilia mother dear cecilia have said attempting to take hold of friend hand told what must come of there need be nothing said about said mr western not after first occasion said miss altifiorla few word between to show that understands other will be expedient see that word can be of service said mr western not in least said mr holt why need anything be said know that have be cruelly ill used be need know do know whole history of said miss altifiorla who have taken great pride to herself among people of exeter in being best informed person there a to mr western sad affair be present up to moment must say that if cecilia have then taken advice thing must have be very different be not blaming must hope not said mr holt thing must have be very different cecilia be little timid at telling husband truth mr western be like other gentleman did not like to be kept in dark by wife see that cecilia have given mortal cause for offence to two gentleman be not to be endured cecilia did not exactly know fact a have occurred between miss altifiorla sir francis certainly knew none of be now in process of occurring strongly suspected that something have taken place that conversation have be held between friend sir francis geraldine have be allowed to read letter from sir francis to husband remembered well meaning of must not remember term have used have however thought that something have passed between miss altifiorla have be immediate cause of writing of letter did think that miss altifiorla have a be gone over to enemy that have be prepared to pardon enemy have in fact told falsehood in letter have be misfortune that story have told have be true further misfortune that husband must have believed so much more than truth for did not hold miss altifiorla to be responsible when be told that have given cause for mortal offence to two gentleman there be something in phrase greatly aggravated anger be a though must be friend be turning against for conduct towards sir francis be just a angry that friend must turn against for conduct to husband miss altifiorla said must request that there be further conversation between in reference to difference between husband miss altifiorla said lady be to come to cecilia between who have enjoyed so much sweet friendship certainly if make so offensive said mr holt be only mode by can show be in earnest said cecilia if doe not succeed must declare that will be unwilling to meet at told to be silent must not oh very well if like to quarrel will quite suit in present condition hardly think that be wise in throwing off old friend be just time when ought to cling to who must be true to be more than cecilia must bear will cling to who be true to said leaving room oh very well then will know how to conduct be addressed to mr holt hope will conduct a call somewhere away from here be very fond of meddling be truth cecilia in present condition doe not want to be meddled with oh yes can go away a soon a ever please thereupon miss altifiorla left room withdrew must be explained that lady since be last upon scene have learned to entertain new hope very exalted in nature have first occurred to during ten minute at paddington railway station that might possibly be so if played card well then how glorious must be result sir francis geraldine have squeezed hand if might be made to go on squeezing hand sufficiently how great might be effect produced lady geraldine how beautiful be sound thought that within bound of english peerage believed that knew that bound included baronet there be sweeter no more glorious more aristocratic appellation lady geraldine what change what blissful change must be when thought of chill of present life of want of interest of insipid loneliness then told what might be in store for must live to become lady geraldine declared to herself that even though chance might be very small greatness of reward if gained must justify effort lady geraldine saw reason why chance must be so very small have cousin with pedigree longer than even that of sir francis count altifiorla who indeed have money be genuine count have nice little sum of money quite enough to be agreeable to gentleman who might be somewhat out at elbow from effect of newmarket did not think too little of own personal appearance knew that have good wearing complexion that feature be of sort did not yield very readily to hand of time there be none of endearing dimple of early youth none of special brightness of english feminine loveliness none of fresh tint of sweet girlhood miss altifiorla boasted to herself that must look british aristocratic matron very well certainly have not that juno beauty cecilia holt must boast that beauty must be so severe to chance comer must melt at once become soft sweet easy to one favoured individual miss altifiorla acknowledged to herself that be nature always to remain outwardly same to men then dress diamond applied paraphernalia of aristocracy must felt go far with if sir francis must be once got to admire be sure that sir francis must never be driven to repent of bargain from falling off on part thought that must know how to be master must be after consideration one a to need not at present pay especial attention sir francis have squeezed hand most affectionately there have be subsequent meeting at exeter where have stayed couple of hour a went through to own property be sure that have stayed for purpose of meeting since affair with cecilia holt have not be made warmly welcome at deanery yet have stayed have absolutely called upon miss altifiorla have found have discussed mr mr western with much sarcastic humour now have miss altifiorla have said when told of letter have written how must be so hard upon poor man perhaps lady may think have be hard upon sir francis have replied perhaps will know meaning of tit for tat perhaps will understand now that one good turn deserves be not that cared so much for said 'd got to feel that be far too virtuous for too stuck up will understand be at all disappointed when played that trick did turn out sort of girl have taken for knew have have escape nevertheless tit for tat be fair on side played trick now have played one be even can go to work again began little too soon perhaps for own comfort be affair not mine in answer to miss altifiorla have only laughed smiled declared that cecilia have be served right though thought said that thought that sir francis have be almost too hard that way of doing business have added if anyone want to run straight must begin by running straight can be a sweet a new milk if be well treated then there have be moment in miss altifiorla have almost expected that be going to do something preparatory to declaring be convinced that be about to kiss at very moment at event have be expected mr green have be announced kiss did not ala come off must hardly bring to be civil to mr green when sir francis declared that must go to station chapter xvi be altogether untrue month of september wore away at exeter very sadly attempt be made to bid mr western welcome back to old home from nature of circumstance there must hardly be much heartiness in attempt mr thorne came over from honiton to see even between cecilia maude hippesley who be certainly most cherished of exeter friend there must be free confidence although there be much sympathy mr western must bring to speak evil to one of husband have with much passion told entire story to mother when mother have begun to say hard word respecting cecilia have found impossible to bear have mother taken mr western part may be doubted whether must have endured that there be speech concerning be possible for ear still looked forward to chance of having back again if must come back if must take back then must be entirely forgiven must be so forgiven that mutual friend must have heard word of reproach from lip must know how hardly have be used there must be one to say that have ever be heard to complain of husband not le be heart full of wrath not le did during hour of day turn over in thought terrible injustice of have be victim can be understood that even to old friend maude hippesley who be now happy in new home a mr thorne must not talk openly of circumstance of separation there be ala other subject of such interest to at present moment a to give matter for free conversation dean family especially mr hippesley attempted to be kind to dean came down called with much decanal grandeur conspicuous a walked up to hall door with shovel hat knee breech even dean must not do much have intended to take mr western part a against brother in law having be doubt prompted by old feeling of favour towards cecilia holt now be given to understand that mr western have also gone astray in such way a to make hardly possible that must talk about called therefore took by hand expressed hope that thing must be made to go straight then left taking by hand again endeavouring to prove esteem by manner of doing so be beginning end of dean comforting mr hippesley must do little more did make attempt at confidential conversation be soon stopped by cecilia cold manner mr western indeed must speak to none must not utter word either for against husband mr green came of course more than once be same thing mr western must endure to talk to be talked to about nothing though there be friendship in be subdued feeling of friendship of friendship under circumstance have to be made silent mr green when have taken leave determined not to come again immediately mr western when mr green have gone felt that did not wish to come must live with mother more easily than with old friend because mother understood tone of mind kept thought to on subject of be thinking sympathised with other lady grant a soon a understood condition of thing at once began to correspond with brother to be matter of course that must sooner later take wife back again to thinking be most important that must do so before fact of quarrel have be flaunted before world by enduring separation wrote in first instance without throwing blame upon party calling upon brother to show honesty honour of purpose by coming back at once to durton lodge receiving cecilia of course must be so sooner later said lady grant quicker do so much easier will be doing must be told that mr holt have without telling daughter in passion written to mr western have sacrificed daughter in perversity that without slightest cause for blame such have be nature of mr holt letter have reached day before of sister lady grant appeal have not be of same nature have said nothing of sin of of have written a though have be in fault misunderstanding other having be willing to yield little then have appealed to brother love affectionate disposition be not till afterwards that have be able to inform of baby be expected mr western answered sister letter from dresden to mr holt sent reply used letter a ground for made to lady grant writing a though mr holt word have come directly from wife say have sacrificed cecilia without slightest fault on part have not sacrificed there have be terrible fault on part fault young woman marries man while be yet engaged to tell poor dupe whom have got within clutch nothing of first engagement be there fault in afterwards entertains first man at husband house corresponds with prepares at last to receive there a friend that without word on subject spoken to husband be there fault in at last truth becomes known to because base man be discontented with arrangement have be made chooses to punish by exposing at last to wrath of husband say nothing of with conduct in world have concern can all have taken place with fault on part what in such state of thing must have done must have contented simply with forbidding wife to receive man at house must have asked question a to past must have passed over engagement have be in full existence during last twelve month have said nothing of must have expressed anger then have forgiven attempted to live with a though man have never existed knowing a do can say that must have be possible to how must have lived with wife of whom knew so much a have then learned of mine have known so little before have be man of world living for world careless a to own home except a to excellence of dinner comfort of bed might have be possible man trusting for happiness to such mean might perhaps have continued to exist not have be broken hearted think will understand such must not be case with looked for happiness to wife society discovered when have married that must not find there must never respect tell that having married have right to sacrifice a have be fool enough to allow to be so quickly allured by charm have made charm own be bound to stand by bargain that take be argument us grant truth of be must be sacrificed not have so acted that be bound to submit to such verdict what law must require from can not say law might perhaps demand third of income will have two third if wish will have seven eighth if will ask for at present have given instruction by during life will have one half be aware that in heat of passion have declined to accept will nevertheless be paid to credit must deny that one who have achieved marriage after fashion have right when so treated to regard a sacrificed be victim a be convinced that can not live happily together reserve to myself right of living apart lady grant when received letter immediately sat down to write to cecilia soon found to be impossible to put into letter that there be to be said be living in neighbourhood of perth whereas sister in law be at exeter yet matter be of such moment that perceived to be essential that must see other perhaps might be better mr western must come to therefore wrote to not explaining cause of proposed visit to do must be a difficult a to write full letter simply saying that in present condition of thing thought must be well that cecilia must visit however mr western refused to do have come to mother said in terrible difficulty in present circumstance must not at once leave considered bound to obey husband must remain at exeter until received instruction from to leave there be in letter subdued tone of displeasure lady grant felt that have not deserved at rate be anxious to do best must not on account abandon task have undertaken only doubt be whether have better go to brother at berlin to wife at exeter understood perfectly now nature of mistaken suspicion filled brother mind be almost sure of circumstance have produced be not quite sure be to make mistake in discussing matter with such mistake might be fatal thought that with cecilia must not do other than good knew brother mind better than did wife imagined that between story might be told story so true so convincing that husband might be brought back following very short letter therefore be written dear cecilia a will not come to at perth must go to at exeter will start day week will be with on following wednesday mind a to room for a can stop at hotel be think imperative that must see other yours affectionately bertha grant mamma lady grant be coming here next week said cecilia to mother to house next week say that will come to hotel of course must receive here why be coming suppose be because think that something must be done on behalf of brother can understand feeling be sure that sympathises with think that good will come of unless can be made to see how wrong be nothing will be able to change until very nature be changed will not be made to understand own fault be thus for first time for fortnight mr western spoke to mother about husband at day appointed lady grant came mr western met at station of course will not go to hotel said there be plenty of room at house be greatly obliged to for coming seems dreadful thing to have to come on business way from perth know ought to apologise to for trouble apologise there can be apologising between if can make of

taken upon to leave for cause a to be perfectly in dark however will not talk about now then put lady grant into fly took home there be nothing more said about on day mr western in whose bosom something of feeling of anger against husband be most unjustly extended towards lady grant took care that two must not be at once left together again mr holt be studiously civil always with feeling mr western lady grant be brother sister be probable that sister must take brother part consequently be at moment converted into enemy first evening at exeter be passed very uncomfortably by three lady on following morning conference be demanded dear said lady grant have got to discus may a well do at once what doe husband mean when say that be still engaged to sir francis when became engaged to have said so yes indeed then have said what be altogether untrue be there slightest ground for untruth everything between sir francis geraldine be over before have gone to continent why left england in consequence of shock gave to have to abandon doe know doe brother know what told did not know when wrote to suppose not must think must send message a rule be soft hearted although to have become suddenly so inexpressibly cruel understand now cause of displeasure not in least said angry wife know of cause for displeasure displeasure know of cause to justify step so terrible a though statement may be untrue a say be untrue be altogether untrue have believed why have believed why why ah indeed why said lady grant suppose that lie becomes prevalent in world for evil without fault on part of somebody even though may not have be expressed in exact term false person have intentionally spread abroad then man in wrath when hears lie will distort twist aggravate to own wrong to of others own husband whom so passionately loved who so passionately loved be because of that lie have so rankled cecilia dear let be altogether open to other have concealed nothing from said mr western proudly

disliked despised at whose hand have be willing to accept many of luxury of life still resolved not to be put down in expression of opinion although might in truth be turned off at moment notice be corresponding with old woman now what do know about correspondence know just what told that letter there be from lady with italian name have more mischief even than have believe at hearing sir francis only laughed if take care will make marry then where will be where must be old fellow much matter where must be said poor dick there be revolver up stair sometimes think that have better use have

have be a spiteful a without excuse must think that 'd make good wife if take care will be yours then dick got up walked out of room with pipe in mouth went into bedroom thinking that might be a well for to pack up take departure quarter be in be a declared to beastly in wet weather shirt have come from wash have vehicle to take to railway station without sending for fly after what have said to sir francis be not much worse than what have often be said before so chucked off slipper threw upon bed thinking that might a well endeavour to get through morning by going to sleep sir francis when found alone began to think over circumstance of present position among circumstance dick ross be one when have intended to marry miss holt have determined to get rid of dick indeed dick have be got rid of partially have begun to talk of going to canada cannibal island by way of beginning work of life then sir francis have be jilted dick have again become indispensable to dick have ever have nasty way of speaking mind blowing up patron sometimes became very oppressive to baronet now at present moment be more angry with for what have said a to miss altifiorla than for remark a to conduct to other lady be simply severe in dick word took for compliment if dick found fault with practice at rate acknowledged success remark a to second lady have be very uncourteous have declared that with italian name be worse devil even than have warned not to marry fiend now have nearly made up mind that must marry with lady with whom have hitherto be connected have become aware that in marrying must more le alter manner of life with miss altifiorla such alteration must be necessary attributed certain ease possessed to italian blood thought that must be able to get on with very comfortably to marry be imperative with because of cousin thought that be to marry miss altifiorla might continue to live ordinary life almost without interruption have considered that in doing so need not even dismiss dick ross now in consequence partly of great discourtesy of dick remark partly from strong inclination for miss altifiorla began to think that after dick have better go just at moment dick fortune be knew very low one sum of money have be lost at card sum of money have not come dick fund be almost absolutely worn out be only reason more for parting with did not care to have to deal with man who have to wear out old clothes in house because have not credit with tailor to get new coat trouser thought that must part with dick have not quite made up mind when sat down to write letter to miss altifiorla dear miss altifiorla said really see that have reason to blow up a do about 'poor cecilia think that poor cecilia have have at hotter than have deserved when tell have be awfully cruel to poor girl seem to forget that poor girl began war by being awfully cruel to if must ever come to know other may be sure that will never treat woman well because have treated badly be kind of gallantry can not understand must make man conduct quite indifferent to sex generally if be to treat alike whether run straight bolt why must bolt must come to same thing in end there be dick ross be making uncommonly disagreeable on same subject mind lecturing little chiefly because think will be hanged if take from have not done so very well that be entitled to blow up anyone mind write tell what happens over at st david mr holt lived in exeter at st david will be glad to know whether respectable person mr western come back again think will have good time if doe if sha' break heart then put pen down sat for while thinking what must be last paragraph must put end to doubt straightway make offer must dally little longer still keep power in own hand at last said to that even if wrote letter must not go till to morrow morning must have night to think about consideration got better of prudence did write simply beginning new sentence on page think that know other well enough to make match of there be question for to answer on own behalf instead of blowing up for cruelty to cecilia holt then signed name yours ever f g miss altifiorla when received letter be surprised not startled have expected that must come not so quickly may be said of that have quite made up mind a to final answer to be given if must come still have to think much about before wrote reply might be very well for to be sudden over suddenness on part must put on guard if must be made to feel alarmed at what have done if must be once frightened at own impetuousness hers must soon find way back again out of difficulty still must flatter still must make think that loved must not at do for to write a though thing be impossible then in pleasant reverie gave up for while to meditating over sudden change have come upon view of life remembered how strong have be in recommending cecilia not to marry man how have congratulated when found that have escaped remembered severe thing have said about mr western in thought there be nothing of remorse even of regret well well that must have come to that must have escaped from cecilia have chosen upon whole will be much better for will tread on corn le than must be le trodden upon too than may be must tread on corn little will not begin till after marriage such be nature of thought perhaps idea did creep in a to awkwardness when must meet cecilia must never see much of other might be that there must be such meeting what doe matter said a turned to writing table be not till three day have passed after receipt of proposal three day thought be fitting time to show that though hurried by affair of so much moment be not too much hurried then wrote a follows dear sir francis letter have almost taken away breath why know nothing little about since have be acquainted with other conversation have chiefly be about lady to whom be engaged to be married now ask to be wife at least if understand letter be purport if be wrong of course will tell so of course know that be not wrong of course be flattered of course pleased what have seen of have altogether liked know why must not be happy together marriage marriage be most important step a doubt be well aware though be quite earnest in what be saying still can not smile can fancy that be smiling a though after be joke however give one week to think of then will answer in sober earnest yours ever a sign f chapter xviii man pride about week after lady grant have gone mr western received letter from husband have expected that must write have daily looked for letter when did come did not know whether to take a joy source of additional discomfort there be in hardly word of declared affection nothing be said a to future life hers did write a thought in familiar loving strain a to event have yet to be expected for many month sister have told news said can not let know how anxious will be for safety for of stranger if there be anything can do for comfort if will ask may be sure that will be done be still at dresden have idea of immediately returning to england there be commencement to ending did not even sign name call wife dear cecilia upon whole felt that rather confirmed sentence of banishment than gave reason for hope have felt when wrote that must not remain altogether silent have yet determined to awaken hope by assurance of returning love in fact letter said to mother must be taken a meaning nothing did not choose to subject to charge of having be indifferent to coming of event beyond have nothing to say to poor mr holt remained altogether silent when daughter discussed subject knew that must not speak without loud abuse knew also that daughter must not allow to abuse cecilia without asking advice of anyone resolved that must not answer letter must not write without using affectionate language such word must never come from till have first be addressed with full affection by never have said to herself score of time never meaning of have be that having be so cruelly ill used must do say nothing might be taken a evidence that have thought in wrong must bear rather than give to understand that did not appreciate cruelty have told of love have not vouchsafed to say word to in reply be of injustice done to that complained in word be constantly framing for be apparent want of affection be deepest in heart though have be twice a cruel twice a hard must have be le unhappy have succeeded in drawing from one word of affection what can do for comfort said to herself again again mean that if want money will have so that may avoid disgrace of leaving wife child unprovided for will not have money unless also come must not even write to lady grant let know that have received letter from husband oh yes have heard from there be letter flung document across table to mother having done so at once left room so that there must be discussion on matter that there must be not word of love in not single word went on saying to herself how hard must be man heart how changeable certainly did love now have gone simply through unworthy suspicion on own part here showed how little able have be a yet to read riddle of man heart how ignorant have be of difficulty under man may labour to express own feeling that call reticence be more frequently inability than unwillingness to express man be silent not because must not have word spoken because doe not know fitting word with to speak dignity so called manliness be always near to be guarded so that must not melt into open ruth so be with mr western living there alone at dresden seeing society passing much of time in vain attempt to satisfy with music with picture spent hour in thinking how necessary wife have made to comfort during few month that be married have already taught to endeavour to make excuse for though in doing so always fell back at last on enormity of offence though loved though might probably pardon in weakness be impossible that sin must be washed out anger still burned very hotly because must not quite understand manner in sin have be committed there be secret did not know nature of secret there have be understanding of did not even yet know nature between wife that base baronet then terrible truth of memory added to wound thought of word have be spoken felt ought to have given opportunity of telling truth must have done so have not purposely kept secret have playfully asked how have be that have loved no other man then have remained silent in manner now declared to to be equal to falsehood when have be perfectly free with own story have still kept back hers have have story have resolved that must not know even though have be so open with doubt have be open at time when have right to expect to be equally so when time did come then then have be traitor to when accepting caress returning with young wife ardour even at moment have be traitor to though in arm have thought must have continued to think of unholy compact existed between sir francis geraldine even now have not told nature of compact even now might be corresponding with sir francis seeing for aught that knew to contrary how be possible that must pardon wife who have sinned against a have sinned yet be so far aware of own weakness a to admit to that must have taken back to if have answered last letter in contrite spirit with affectionate word must have endeavoured to forgive if not to forget must have allowed to fall into loving intimacy of domestic life that be cold indifferent a well a treacherous so told keeping wrath hot though at same time love nearly mastered in truth knew nothing of thing a really be have made mistake of drawing false conclusion from word written by sir francis then of looking upon word a containing whole truth sir francis have doubt intended to think that cecilia holt have come to rupture in engagement from other than real cause have intended mr western to believe that have agreed that have merely resolved between that have better not be husband wife have intended to convey idea that have be more active in so arranging than cecilia cecilia though have read letter have done so in such frame of mind a hardly to catch truth mr western have caught altogether have believed though knew that man be dishonest liar yet have believed letter be tortured at thought that wife must have made party to compact that compact must still have remained in existence without knowledge although there be hour during be most anxious to return to in told that be more difficult to stay away from than even to endure faithlessness though from day to day became convinced that must never return to haunt of men even to easy endurance of life without yet pride must ever come back to assure that a reasonable man be unable to put up with such treachery have unfortunately be taught to think by correspondence have come from matter of cousin racing bet that sir francis geraldine be very basest of mankind be unfortunate because have doubt be induced to think worse of wife because have submitted herself continued to submit to man who be in eye so contemptible must not endure idea that woman for whom partnership have have charm must be chosen companion of hour have already lived with for week must have be enough to teach character during week have be satisfied to very full have assured frequently that have at last met woman suited made own have known nothing of sir francis geraldine must have be thoroughly contented then have come blow joy be sicklied over with unhealthy tone image of former lover gave became at once to different creature though told that be still same cecilia a have be delight yet told also that be not same a have fancied when at first knew there be in man pride of woman know nothing rather woman be often subject to pride very opposite man delight to think that have be first to reach woman heart woman be rejoiced to feel that owns permanently have be often reached before man may know that in own case be not so with a there have be concealment perhaps only little to conceal take a come make best of mary may have liked other one have not gone farther if have be engaged a bride there have be secret about have be thing long ago so that there have be time for new idea to form husband when doe come know at rate that have ground of complaint be not kept specially in dark when take wife mr western have be kept specially in dark be of men least able to endure such treatment to have be kept in dark a to man with whom girl be engaged a thought at very moment in have accepted to have be made use of a step on disadvantageous marriage might be avoided without detriment to own interest be feeling made utterly prostrate told that death must be one desirable way out of difficulty if death be within reach when received letter from sister telling that might probably become father of child be at first prepared to say that thus must two be reconciled must hardly live apart not only from mother of child from child went away into solitude wept hot tear a thought of ever a thought of cause of anger came back to made declare to that in indulgence of feeling of personal tenderness ought to disgrace at rate must not be till must have told whole truth till must have so told story a to enable to ascertain whether story be in respect true at present a said to be altogether in dark in fact have now learned very story a have existed have cecilia told a far a be able to tell must even in estimation have be completely white washed in perfect absolution from terrible sin of now accused must have forgiven forgotten altogether small trifling fault have in truth committed there be something of nobility in feeling then that something be alloyed by much be ignoble have resolved that be to come back to must come acknowledging depth of sin must endeavour to forgive though must not forget never thought to in hour that must be well for to be gracious in manner of forgiveness to go to fetch home to say to that be past must be a dream sad ugly dream one to reality be attached never occurred to must still be master in order that masterdom might be assured full abject confession must be made yet have such idea of wife that felt that such confession must be forthcoming therefore to appeared ever more more impossible that two must again come together with cecilia matter be regarded with very different eye to too be apparent that have be treated with extremest cruelty too be very hot in anger in discussing matter with allowed thought in indignation against husband be maintained at boiling heat nevertheless have quite resolved to forgive altogether if must once come to to insure forgiveness word even of apology must be necessary knew that must have to deal with man to whom speaking of such word must be painful none must be expected none asked for if must show that still loved must suffice world around must of course know that have be sent away from then taken back there be in much be painful feeling full of dismay a reflected that friend that acquaintance that very servant must know that have be so disgraced of that must take notice no notice a far a outside world be concerned let think let talk a must must then have one great treasure with to console treasure if once more own must suffice for happiness in hottest anger told from time to time that anger must all depart from that must be made to vanish from a by magician wand if must only once more be allowed to feel arm round waist in have friend with whom to discus anger hope mother knew shared anger to full entertained hope altogether different desire be so different that hardly amounted to hope yes might be allowed to return with word of absolute contrition with word must always be remembered against such must have be mr holt expression a to state of thing have ventured to express understood enough of daughter feeling to repress only person who sympathised with cecilia present condition be girl who have once before evoked from so strong feeling of tenderness did know that man have to be forgiven terrible a have be sin that nothing more be to be said about oh ma'be said will come back now be sure will come back now never more have of silly vagary who can say what vagary man may choose to indulge be true too ma'be that man must have have vagary a be dying to come back be sure of when doe come find that be let to come quiet that be asked to say nothing a like that be smile to kindness then with baby coming belief be that will be happier then than be even first day when have though spoken in rough language so exactly expressed cecilia wish that did feel that maid at least entirely sympathised with chapter xix dick take final leave when sir francis received reply miss altifiorla sent to letter be not altogether satisfied with have expected that lady must at once have flown into arm lady seemed to hesitate asked for week to think about showed so much ingratitude on part be so poor acknowledgment of position have offered that be inclined to be indignant d if care about sha' have be thus that expressed aloud in hearing of dick ross without however explaining who be what be indeed in way asking dick opinion on matter not le have miss altifiorla be wise in nature of reply have given have expressed warm affection at once accepted have be proffered gentleman must probably have learnt at once to despise have be obtained so easily a be be simply cross thought that have determined to withdraw proposal still other letter be to come miss altifiorla chance be still open to immediate consequence of doubt in mind of sir francis be postponement of verdict of banishment have resolved to pronounce against dick a soon a marriage with miss altifiorla must have be settled did not wish to leave altogether alone in world if dick be dismissed must be necessary that must provide with unless be minded to provide with wife instead became therefore gradually more gracious after little speech have be above given dick have understood perfectly who have be be intended a question have be asked have made reply be quite quick enough to perceive working of baronet mind despised baronet almost a thoroughly a did mr western for certain purpose a to despised also friendship of baronet suited just at present one morning for private reason of own dick went into perth be twenty mile distant from baronet shooting lodge returned same day bringing postbag with from point in road at be daily left by postman sir francis with unusual haste read letter among be one from miss altifiorla dick have budget of news be anxious to reveal did tell before sir francis have said anything a to own letter there be friend one captain fawkes at lodge with dick have at first be restrained by man presence a soon a found alone with sir francis began lady grant have gone off to dresden said where did hear that asked baronet told so at club everybody in perth know that have gone why what business be of theirs since know so much about why have gone to persuade brother to come home take wife once more be infernal shame that must ever have be separated in fact have gone to undo what did if can only succeed in making man know whole truth about free from lie will do what be gone to do what devil do mean by lie said sir francis rising in wrath from chair well lie mean lie a have applied word to anyone suppose may be allowed to use to stand by suppose know what lie mean suppose be aware that western have be made to believe lie about wife who told say nothing about said dick lie be sort of thing be very commonly told be ordinarily ascribed to world at large world never quarrel with accusation world have told most infernal lie to man about wife suppose world mean to call out for saying a much a then two remained silent for moment dick proceeded with eloquence of course there have be lie damnable lie have man woman be one gone to poor creature with pistol in hand blown brain out must have done more dastardly action what devil do mean by said other be not talking about specially say lie have be told say who have told rather suspect woman to be at bottom of sir francis who have in pocket most tender loving reply from miss altifiorla knew very well who be lady to whom dick referred that man have be made to believe certain thing about wife be lie lie from beginning to end have be made to believe that be engaged to first be that lie depends on way in be told did send home merely for be not saying what lie be be damnable lie sometimes tell that ai better than generally great deal worse 'd rather have blown brain out than have told such lie about woman a have be told here by somebody ask what be saying at club in perth now know pretty well must be supposed that what have passed at club have induced dick to determine that must no longer become to remain with sir francis a humble friend very evil thing have in truth be said of sir francis be more than dick must endure natural indignation of man be aroused so that by degree have come to pas that hated baronet have before said very sharp word to have now gone home resolved in righteous mind to bring thing to conclusion matter little in telling of story to know what lie dick did in truth impute to friend be of nature to fill mind with righteous wrath to produce from eloquence above described sir francis whose vanity have be charmed by letter kept in pocket have already made up mind to part with dick dick word a now spoken left alternative be question with whether must not so part with a to inflict further punishment why dick said smiling have broken out quite in new place know nothing about must have be with bishop taken lesson in preaching never heard come out so strong before wish 'd heard what of men at perth said about how answered a friend a far a remember did say much what did say certainly be not in favour be hardest on sweet young lady with italian name wo mind that because be two now can tell ross how long have be eating bread suppose must how much have drank of wine have made calculation of nature be usual for shooting here how much have ever contributed when shoot contribute nothing world understands that how much money do owe owe nothing that have ever promised to pay now think sign of fine gentleman to go talk openly at club about matter have heard from in confidence think very very what sir francis have not done a allege be going to observe very what be must be here explained that dick ross be not man who feared many thing sir francis feared much dick have little to lose by row whereas baronet must be injured baronet therefore declined to fill in epithet have omitted knew from former experience what dick must what must not bear choose to descend to billingsgate said sir francis have own idea a to conduct very gentlemanlike be said dick with smile meaning thereby to impute to sir francis a cowardice that be unwilling to say reverse under circumstance will be quite a well that must leave lodge must feel that oh quite so be delighted to think that will be able to leave without having have unpleasant word perhaps to morrow will do just a please then will be able to add few drop to bucket of claret threw in teeth just now wonder whether gentleman be ever before asked by gentleman how much wine have drank in house how many dinner have eaten when asked did expect to pay for dinner wine sir francis refused to make reply to question when delicately hinted at poverty have found finance to be lower than 'd always known be disagreeable to be penniless younger brother have found so life admit ought to have earned bread must have be much better for have done so people may declare that be good for nothing may hold up a example to be shunned flatter that nobody have called blackguard have told lie to injure men behind back much le have done so to injure woman have sacrificed girl to revenge simply because have thrown over in little transaction have have have always run straight now think that upon whole have better go before dinner not add anything to bucket of claret just a please said sir francis then dick ross left room went away to make such arrangement for departure a be possible to reader of story will see hear more sir francis when be left alone took out miss altifiorla letter read again be man who must assume grand manner in personal intercourse with woman be peculiarly apt to receive impression from loved to be flattered be prone to believe anything good of be said to by one of therefore took following letter for more than be worth dear sir francis know that will have be quite quick enough to have understood when received former little scrawl what answer must be when woman attempt to deceive man in such matter know beforehand that attempt will be vain certainly did not think must succeed with yet feeling of shamefacedness what lady consider a modesty though might more properly be called mauvaise honte forced into temporary silence what must wish better than to be loved by one a in first place there be rank go for much with then there be money admit count for something must never have allowed to marry even if have chanced to love poor man then there be manner peculiar station before world be quite separate from rank to alone be irresistible will say too personal appearance doe count for much can fancy marrying ugly man can fancy also must not do without something of disgust miss altifiorla when wrote have understood well that vanity love of flattery be conspicuous trait in character of admirer having owned so much what be there more to say than be happiest woman between sea reader must be here told that letter have be copied out second time because in first copy have allowed word girl to pas in above sentence something told that have better write woman instead have written what more be there for to add to above except to tell that love with heart month ago seems to be year now when cecilia holt have caught fancy did regard a most fortunate girl did not regard a happiest of men because felt sure that there be something between must not suit there be asperity rather than strictness about knew spirit must not brook must have borne battlings must have arisen with equal temper can indeed bear thing with equanimity a doe present position though must have battled have conquered must still have suffered think that wife now desire be one with whom will have to wage war will say that if marry whom have now asked to join lot with yours there will be such fighting think that will know how to hold own against world a wife with will only attempt to hold own by making one with in desire aspiration be yours with heart with body soul francesca say nothing now about immediate future hope will please highness to visit most worthy clerical relation in cathedral city before long will say nothing to of clerical relation a to prospect in life until will have received sanction for doing so sooner do receive better for peace of mind sir francis be upon whole delighted with letter more delighted a now read for third time there be such air of truth in word of be thus that spoke to about letter a sucked in flattery be thus that miss altifiorla have intended that must receive knew too well to suspect that flattery must fail not word of failed in nothing be more gratified than in allusion to matrimonial effort with miss holt have assured that must have finally conquered that strong minded young woman have at same time told of extreme tenderness of heart absolutely believed when whispered to secret that have envied cecilia lot when cecilia be supposed to be happy bride quite understood allusion to own pleasure assurance that must never interfere with there be just doubt whether thing so easily got must be worth keeping then remembered cousin determined to be man of word chapter xx secret escape right see soon ever yours f g such be entire response miss altifiorla received from now declared lover sir francis have told that hated bother of writing love letter in truth there be with also idea that might be a well that must not commit to declaration be in nature very strong be not that absolutely thought of possible future event in letter might be used against there be present to feeling that least said might be soonest mended miss altifiorla when received above scrawl be quite satisfied with too be cautious in nature not quite so clever a lover did indeed feel that have now caught fish must not let escape by such folly a cecilia holt have committed baronet must be allowed full swing till be entitled to call lady geraldine then perhaps there might be tussle between a to must have own way hers great thing at present be to obtain position did feel that have played card uncommonly well a far a game have gone at present there came upon irresistible temptation to make triumph known among friend at exeter girl friend have got married there be mr green mr thorne mr western poor cecilia have not gained much still be mr western miss altifiorla did in truth regard a miss altifiorla with small satisfaction have theory about woman right decided advantage of remaining single sufficiency of lady to stand alone in world there be probably vague glimmering of truth in idea half formed belief in own doctrine still have ever be uncomfortable creed one be ready to desert at slightest provocation friend have deserted have left a say high dry on barren bank while have be carried away by fertilising stream too must now swim down river of matrimony with beautiful name handle to a owner of fine family property woman right be excellent doctrine to preach for practice must not stand strain of such temptation though in boasting of good fortune must doubt confess that have be wrong still there must be much more of glory than of shame in confession be chance probably that made tell secret in first instance to mr thorne mr thorne have be maude hippesley be niece to sir francis geraldine miss altifiorla have pledged to sir francis not to make known engagement at deanery such pledge go for very little mr thorne be not now inhabitant of exeter be so to say most bosom friend left to after disruption from mr western be probable that secret must be kept from bosom friend mr thorne who have large circle of friend in county must hardly have admitted claim must be more likely to do so after receiving intimation of course must be conveyed under seal of sacred promise doubt must be broken a soon a reached deanery on occasion called on miss altifiorla to ask question in reference to poor cecilia with dean mr dean there be real sorrow at cecilia trouble there be also mode of acquiring true information do tell something about poor cecilia said mr thorne poor cecilia indeed be there alone see almost one of course have heard that lady grant be here thought so nice of lady grant to come way from scotland to see sister in law lady grant of course be anxious to get brother to take back wife have great deal of money among when mr holt dy cecilia fortune must be nice

something came in way there be family property among of course be anxious solicitude a to family property on part of miss altifiorla did strike mr thorne a droll went on with inquiry what be cecilia doing not very much said miss altifiorla what be there for to do poor girl have played card so uncommonly badly when took up with mr western after having be dropped by sir francis after dropping sir francis miss altifiorla smiled be likely that cecilia holt must have dropped sir francis doe much matter now if doe wounded pride good to say so of course can say always believed that be so at deanery at rate made mess of now have to bear fortune fate have sent own that be little angry with cecilia not for having dropped sir francis a called for managing matter so badly with mr western seems to to have idea of sort of duty fall to lot of wife must have thought 'd have liked better for said mr thorne with smile why so think must have misunderstood theory of life when woman elect to marry doe so from sheer love regard for man must certainly make duty to first motive of action what grand lesson be pity that husband must not be here to hear have doubt find that do so sir francis geraldine suppose uncle be still in search of wife if knew where to find such excellent principle must be able to make choice what joke must be must again try luck at exeter have again tried luck at exeter said miss altifiorla in tone in slight shade of ridicule be mixed with grandiloquence wished to assume what on earth do mean said mr thorne simply what seem to mean have not intended to have told at present though must sooner tell than person living must promise however that will go further sir francis geraldine have done honour to ask to be wife thus communicated good news did so in tone of voice be very low intended to be humble uncle going to marry good gracious be more wonderful than that must have thought of marrying cecilia holt well yes not that know why must be except cecilia came first that be so intimate be doomed to remain alone in world because of asked miss altifiorla well exactly mean that be droll hope that dean mr hippesley will be satisfied with choice do particularly hope that friend will feel that be doing well added perceiving that tidings have not be received with strong expression of family satisfaction trust that a lady geraldine may at rate be mean of keeping family together there be to mr thorne almost joke in a knew that father did not at approve of sir francis be with difficulty induced to have at deanery knew also that dean did in heart greatly dislike miss altifiorla though for sake of what be generally called peace within cathedral precinct have hitherto put up also with what might happen in dean mind what determination dean might take when two must be married must not say felt that might probably be beyond power of then lady geraldine to keep family together well be surprised said mr thorne be to tell nobody see good in publishing thing in high street just at present then mr thorne understood that need not treat communication a strict secret in fact see why must be kept specially in dark francis have not enjoined anything like secrecy be first time that have allowed use of baronet name without prefix when be to be have not a yet even begun to think of course be in hurry men believe generally be in case there may be reason for delay arrangement a to family property must be made castle gerald must be prepared for reception suppose can be married just off hand like happier folk mr thorne did not know whether to take to herself a have be married at last rather in scramble whether be intended to apply to poor cecilia whose husband though be in comfortable circumstance can not be said to have possessed family property now dear continued miss altifiorla what be to do for bridesmaid three have be married before there be two unmarried sister of course mr thorne be aware that uncle have absolutely quarrelled with mother sister have not spoken to for year suppose that will come off in cathedral that father will perform ceremony know indeed whether francis might not wish to have bishop mr thorne be aware that bishop who be strict man must not touch sir francis geraldine with pair of tongs thing will shake down comfortably doubt in meantime be in twitter of ecstatic happiness who have gone through will quite understand what mean seems that a lover be most exigeant of gentleman requires constant writing to woe betide if obey behest however complain must confess that be at present moment most happy of young woman mr thorne of course expressed congratulation took departure without having committed to word a to other inhabitant of deanery when got to father house where be for present staying in truth startled by news dean have just come into drawing room to have afternoon tea little gossip with wife own sister mr forrester from london who do think be going to be married to whom said mr thorne will give three guess apiece bet pair of glove round that make out not miss altifiorla said mother be only one marriage requires two personage still hold good by bet miss altifiorla going to be married said dean who be unfortunate victim papa be ill natured why must not miss altifiorla be married a well a in first place dear said mr forrester because understand that lady have always expressed a being in favour of single life go beyond said dean maintain that single life must be preferable to marriage with miss altifiorla considering that be friend papa think that be very unkind who be to be gentleman asked mother ah there be question why guess then mr dean did name three four of most unpromising unmarried elderly gentleman in exeter dean in spirit of satire against own order be common among clergyman suggested old widowed minor canon who be in habit of chanting litany be none of near mark ought to come nearer home nearer home said mr dean with look of discomfort in face yes mamma great deal nearer home ca be uncle septimus said dean now uncle septimus be unmarried brother of old mr thorne be regarded by thorne family a perfect model of unselfish fine old lovable gentleman good gracious said mr thorne what horrible idea fancy uncle septimus doomed to pas life in company with miss altifiorla happy man in question be sir francis geraldine said mr hippesley jumping from seat be impossible said dean who though greatly disliked brother in law still thought something of family into have married thoroughly despised miss altifiorla think that sir francis must be so silly a that can not be said mr hippesley have young lady done to make impossible asked mr forrester nothing on earth said mr thorne be special friend be in opinion great deal more than worthy of uncle francis only papa who dislike must like to make out that two of be going to cut own throat by marrying other wish papa must have heard way in said that must have to marry unless bishop must like to come forward perform ceremony will hing of kind said dean angrily if have heard continued daughter that have to say about family name family property family grandeur generally must have thought most becoming young woman in country to be future lady geraldine wish must talk of dear said mr hippesley will have to talk of have better become used to among suppose that miss altifiorla have invented story out of own head must not say that be engaged to marry uncle if be not true be belief said dean getting up walking out of room in great anger sir francis geraldine will never marry miss altifiorla think brother will ever marry miss altifiorla said mr dean be very silly very vicious think will ever do anything so bad a poor miss altifiorla said mr thorne afterwards to aunt forrester same evening miss altifiorla feeling that have broken ice oppressed by weight of secret be secret still in house in exeter except deanery wrote to other friend mr green begged to come down have tidings to tell of greatest importance so mr green put on bonnet came down dear said miss altifiorla have something to tell be going to be not married said mr green yes be how very odd that must guess yet when come to think of know that be odd because after there doe come time in lady life when be probable that will marry miss altifiorla hesitated having in first instance desired to use word girl be a may be said mr green principle used to be on other side of course change when opportunity come be so much that disliked idea of marriage for a be proud of freedom enjoyed however be over be free no longer who be to be ah who be to be can make guess not in least know of anybody who have be spooning oh what term to use one can say that anyone ever spooned be horrible word can not bear to hear fall from own lip be what young men do do said mr green that think depends on rank in life young men occupy also young woman can understand that bank clerk must do to attorney daughter well who be be going to marry without spooning in vocabulary be simply word for two young people being fond of other miss altifiorla remained silent for while feeling that owed to herself to awe present companion by manner before must crush altogether by weight of name must have to pronounce mr green have received communication flippantly have probably felt that friend intended to demean by mere common marriage who be to be happy swain asked mr green swain said miss altifiorla unable to repress feeling well lover young man suitor husband a be to be word common on such occasion will suppose fit miss altifiorla felt that word common on such occasion must fit yet be necessary that must name having gone so far having again be silent for minute so a to bethink in what most dignified language might be done proceeded be to be allied again there be little pause to sir francis geraldine cecilia holt rejected who think be fortunate enough to escape cecilia holt goodness gracious seems other day cecilia holt have since recovered from wound married husband be now suffering from fresh wound be odd that gentleman must have found one else to love when lady have have time not only to love to marry to be separated from man sir francis geraldine ejaculated mr green well be sure wish joy in world when be to be mr green have so offended miss altifiorla by manner of accepting news that must not bring to make further gracious answer mr green therefore took leave fact of miss altifiorla engagement be soon known over exeter chapter xxi lady grant at dresden have first to believe story a tell get out of

that have well done duty a sister found by mean easy to induce brother to look at matter with eye in fact be evident to that did not believe story a have told must go on din into ear till by perseverance must change belief still thought that credit must be given to letter from sir francis although be aware that to sir francis a man must have given credit whatsoever have suited suspicion to believe that there have be something in common between sir francis wife up to moment in terrible fact of engagement have be made known to from belief must not free mind have already be persuaded to say that must come back to must come a sinner confessing sin must take back a one whom have be justified in expelling to whom must be held a extending great mercy lady grant must not accept of mercy must encourage coming back with purpose must not be good in first place for that must think that wife have be offender future happiness must depend on fixed belief in purity truth a for lady grant be sure that entreaty must induce to own that have be in wrong desired to have pardon asked must certainly ask for pardon on own behalf why be that came then to house asked mr western be rather be to account for conduct of such man a be to make responsible for behaviour be engaged to undoubtedly must have be told to though can understand reason kept silent from day to day time will come when will understand also know a do how gracious how feminine have be silence then there came across brother face look of doubt a indicating feeling that nothing must have justified silence yes george time will come that will understand altogether although be far from doing so now believe think to be perfect said hardly perfect because be human being although know virtue have not known fault may be that be too proud little unwilling perhaps to bend most woman will bend whether be in fault not must wish wife to do so at rate have not asked at rate have not given opportunity accusation against be that sent away from on accusation made solely by man without waiting to hear from whether must plead guilty to deny yes hear denial will have to acknowledge at rate to before can ever hope to be happy man when wrote to believed whole story to be lie from first to last when found that be not lie then became to gospel throughout must not understand that very fault have induced to break engagement be of nature to make tell story untruly when acknowledged to have be engaged to nearly broke heart just so with heart broken must not sift truth have committed offence against in engaging must have told a soon a knew other must have told before accepted offer have be deterred from doing so by own revelation to can not believe that intended always to be in dark can not imagine that have expected that

much le so in present condition in hers people will only excuse by saying that be mad now in order to put right expect that will come forward own herself to have be cause of misfortune tell that will

be near to then left to think in solitude over word have spoken to did think of found to be impossible to put absolute faith in be not that thought that sister be deceiving that distrusted who have taken long journey at great personal trouble altogether on behalf that must not bring to believe that have be so cruel a to reject young wife without adequate cause have gradually come across mind that have be most cruel most unjust if have done so to judgment passed by on must not submit in concealing engagement have be very wrong must be that have concealed more than engagement to have be engaged to man added much to fault in estimation must not acknowledge that have be deceived a to man character have set right before be too late why have man come to house asked for after what have passed between if not in compliance with understanding between yet must take back if must confess fault beg pardon for then must be saved disgrace of having to acknowledge that have be in fault from

to be joy of life have become so to entire satisfaction when in passion have sent away already knew that have made great mistake angry a have be must not have thus sought to avenge must have known better than to think that because have be in fault must therefore live without have owned to when sister have come to that must use service in getting wife once again be not one human being suited at point still still honour must be saved if in truth desired to come back to must not hesitate to own that have be in fault what be to say to what message will send to will hardly let go back without

intended to be beneficent to with view solely of doing duty to brother to sister in law have taken infinite trouble yet be very angry with being woman have most unjustly taken part of woman against cecilia must have suffered little in having be forced to acknowledge great sin must suffer greatly who have sinned not at by tacit confession must be thus compelled to make be true that be necessary that must return happiness of including that unborn child required sister knowing demanded that must sacrifice in order that wife might be indulged in pride yet knew that must do though might go to in silence in silence renew married life must by so doing confess that have be wrong to such confession must not be driven in very gall of bitterness with sense of injustice strong upon did resolve that must return to england with sister having so resolved with wrath hot against lady grant mind be gradually turned to cecilia condition how sweet must be to have once again sitting at table once again

indignation must be of use unless must follow up indignation by strong measure must let thing pas by in silence a though sir francis have never known other must certainly do so that have allowed matrimonial prospect to become common through exeter must also let exeter know how badly sir francis intended to treat to her too idea of prolonged sojourn in united state presented in former day there have come upon great longing to lecture at chicago at saint paul omaha on distinctive duty of female sex now again idea returned to thought that in one of large western hall full of gas

be done by what be there that must say there be still present to keen sense of wrong that have endured though owned to that punishment at spur of moment have resolved upon inflicting be too severe upon upon though felt that have be injured did gradually acknowledge that have believed something worse than truth how to read riddle did not know there be riddle have not read aright if cecilia must still be silent must still be left in dark did understand that be to expect confession of fault that be to exact show of repentance when train arrived at exeter determined to be driven at once to

love be not fault george loved so dearly when be telling that story about other girl somehow must not tell then similar story about seemed at first so odd that story must be same then looked almost a though be mocking have have story to tell must have known own before have allowed to be made happy by love do not perceive that be so yes said slowly can understand what mean be mistake for from day to day difficulty grew upon when once there be difficulty be not strong enough to overcome there never came moment in be willing to mar own happiness by telling that thought must wound yours have not dreamed beforehand how much more difficult must become when must once be absolutely wife then sister came told be better than anybody in world except woman be better than be said be nature to be so half ludicrous idea of miss altifiorla present difficulty came across mind a contradicted assertion with shower of kiss told continued cecilia be bound to let know truth of course knew that of course intended that odious woman be in house must not tell till be gone then came why did come have right to come man with smallest spirit must have shown at door have thought about again again can only
