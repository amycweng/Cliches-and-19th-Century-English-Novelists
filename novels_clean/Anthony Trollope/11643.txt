none more odious to than of entail institution be wont to prove by many argument to be source of ignorance poverty trouble by country be inflicted have got own property by entail certainly never must have have acre have father be able to consume more than life interest have denied that property have done good be loud in declaring that entail have done property who lived on very much harm in heart of heart did feel desire when be gone acre must still belong to caldigate there be so much in of leaven of old english squirarchic aristocracy a to create pride in fact that caldigates have be at folking for three hundred year wish that might remain there doubt knew that without repeated entail must not have remained there still have hated thing a year rolled on came to think that entail now existing must do especial evil son on leaving school spent almost whole four month between time beginning of first term at cambridge with babingtons period included month of september afforded

sensible of non performance of duty on own part though be close to cambridge never went to see son must even press lad to come out to folking when on rare occasion visit be made did endeavour to make house pleasant be jealous jealous to hot anger at being neglected must not bring to make advance to own son then when heard from son tutor that son must not pas degree without payment of l for recognised debt then anger boiled over told john caldigate that be expelled from father heart father house money be paid degree be taken there arose question a to what be to be done john of course took to babington house be condoled with by uncle cousin trouble at time be numerous enough that l by mean summed up whole indebtedness covered indeed small part of have be at newmarket there be pleasant gentleman named davis who frequented that place cambridge who have be very civil to when lost little money who now held acceptance for ala much more than l even uncle babington knew nothing of when degree be taken then there came terrible blow to aunt babington aunt polly a be called got into own closet upstairs where kept linen jam favourite liqueur told that cousin julia be dying in

certainly be fool one be heir of course did nothing second be struggling for degree at oxford with eye to family living third be in fair way to become family gamekeeper certainly did not wish to marry into family yet have be so kind to ' must have nothing to marry on aunt polly said then be reminded that be father heir that father house be sadly in want of mistress must live at babington till folking must be ready prospect be awful what be young man to say in such position love young lady after fashion therefore must decline ' requires hero cold blooded hero to do aunt polly be very much in earnest for brought julia into room absolutely delivered up into young man arm be so much in debt ' said 'that care to think of ' aunt polly declared that such debt did not signify in least folking be not embarrassed folking did not owe shilling one knew there be julia in arm never said that must marry when left linen closet two lady understood that thing be arranged luckily for aunt polly have postponed scene till moment before departure from house be at time going to cambridge where be to be guest for one night of certain mr bolton who be one of very few friend to whom father be still attached mr bolton be banker living close to cambridge old man now with four son one daughter to house john caldigate be going in order that might there discus with mr bolton certain proposition have be made between father respecting folking property father have now realised idea of buying son out john who have world life before be terribly conscious of obligation owed to friend davis have got into head notion that must prefer to face fortune with sum of ready money than to wait in absolute poverty for reversion of family estate have own idea in furtherance of have made certain inquiry there be gold being found at moment among mountain of new south wale in quantity captivated imagination be being done in most lovely spot among circumstance be in respect romantic friend richard shand who be also trinity man be quite resolved to go out be minded to accompany friend in way a thought in way only must final settlement be made with most assiduous of attendant mr davis mind be fully set upon new south wale little interview with cousin julia did not tend to bind more closely to own country to babington to folking chapter ii puritan grange perhaps there have be little treachery on part of mr davis for have in gently insinuating way made known to squire fact of acceptance additional fact that be through unforeseen circumstance lamentably in want of ready money squire became eloquent assured mr davis that must not pay penny to save mr davis son from instant imprisonment even from absolute starvation then mr davis shrugged shoulder whispered word obit squire thereupon threatened to kick out of house on next day paid visit to friend mr bolton there have after be long correspondence between father son mr bolton a to john caldigate said not word to babingtons have be more communicative might have perhaps saved from scene in linen closet a be when started for cambridge nothing be known at babington of mr davis of new south wale scheme mr bolton lived in large red brick house in village of chesterton near to cambridge with large garden be surrounded by old high dark coloured brick wall rarely saw company there be probably not many of more recently imported inhabitant

up to two elder son third son be barrister in london fourth be settled in cambridge a solicitor men be married be doing well in world living in house better than father spending great deal more money mr bolton have name of being hard man because having begun life in small circumstance have never learned to chuck shilling about easily have in most liberal manner made over bulk of fortune to son though must rarely be got to sit at table took delight in hearing that lived bounteously with friend have be twice married there now lived with second wife daughter hester girl about sixteen year of age at period of john caldigate visit to puritan grange a mr bolton house be called at time puritan grange be not badly named for mr bolton be lady of stern life hester bolton be brought up with more of seclusion religious observance than be now common in house mr bolton be probably ten year older than squire of folking circumstance have in early life made fast friend old squire have owed large sum of money to bank mr bolton have then be attracted by manner in son have set to work so that might not be burden on estate have be fast friend for quarter of century now arrangement of term between present squire son have be left to mr bolton mr bolton have doubt received very unfavourable account of young man men such a be mr bolton who make money by lending out at recognised rate of interest who be generally very keen in looking after principal have mercy whatsoever for davis of creation very little for customer to have have dealing with davis be condemnation in eye mr bolton must not therefore have opened gate to spendthrift have not feeling for father be very strong have thought much upon matter have tried hard to dissuade squire banker be not particularly attached to theory of primogeniture have divided wealth equally between own son have strong idea a to property right young man claim to folking after father death be a valid a father claim during life doubt severance of entail if made at must be made in accordance with young man wish on certain term must be declared to be just by person able to compute value of such right doubt also so mr bolton thought property must be utterly squandered if left in present condition must be ruined by incumbrance in shape of post obit have be deeply considered at last mr bolton have consented to act between father son when john caldigate be driven up through iron gate to mr bolton door mind be not quite at ease within have seen mr bolton on two three occasion during university career have called at house have never entered have never seen lady now be necessary that must discus own folly own fault of course be going to do must in eye of british world be considered very unwise british world regard position of heirship to acre a most desirable young man must hold that be about to abandon a told without abandoning must not rid from horror of davis be quite prepared to acknowledge own vice childish stupidity in regard to davis have looked all round that now be sure that must hing of kind again how must get rid of davis in other way than then folking have charm for hated folking be certain that life must suit better than life to be passed a squire of folking be quite alive to fact that though there be at home prospect of future position future income for present there must be nothing be to submit humbly to father might probably be allowed to vegetate at old family home there be career for profession have a yet be even proposed father be fifty five very healthy man likely to live for next twenty year then must be impossible that must dwell in peace under same roof with father davis life must be miserable to if must not free from thraldom sum of money be to be offered to be to be raised on folking property must enable to pay davis to start upon career with plentiful mean in pocket must too be wise not risk capital shand have couple of thousand pound must start with like sum of own must fail in new south wale there must still be something on to begin again with mind thus fixed entered mr bolton gate be to stay one night at puritan grange then if matter be arranged must go over to folking for day two endeavour to part from father on friendly term in case must be able to pay davis there need be ground for quarrelling on score before dinner matter be settled at grange stern old man bade visitor sit down then explained to at full length be proposed to do so much money squire have put by so much more mr bolton must advance value have be properly computed must arrangement be completed john caldigate must sell inheritance at proper price over over again young man endeavoured to interrupt speaker be told to postpone word till other must have done such interruption came from too evident fact that mr bolton thoroughly despised guest caldigate though have be very foolish though have loved to slaughter rat rabbit to romp with girl at babington be by mean fool be possessed of good natural ability of great activity of high spirit appreciation be quicker than of old banker who a soon saw have altogether failed to understand in word that banker spoke be evident that thought that thousand must be squandered instantly banker spoke a though terrible severance be to be made because natural heir have shown to be irrevocably bad what must be expected from youth who be deep in book of davis before have left college ' recommend ' said at last have never recommended disruption be so great a to be awful when father have asked what better step must take have be unable to advise ' be a though old man be telling young one that be too bad for hope that therefore must be consigned for ever to perdition caldigate conscious of mistake banker be making full of hope a to intending to acknowledge folly of have be guilty at same time not to promise for must not condescend so far to profess that be thing of past impatient of judgment expressed against endeavoured to stop old man in severity so that tone in business be being done might be altered when found that must not do without offence leaned back in chair heard indictment to end mr bolton said when at length time came 'you will hear view of matter mr bolton did hear listening very patiently caldigate first asserted that in coming there to puritan grange object have be to learn what be term proposed a to be now willing to give assent have already quite made up mind to sell what property have on estate therefore though be much indebted to mr bolton for disinterested kind friendship be hardly in want of counsel on matter mr bolton raised eyebrow still listened patiently caldigate then went on to explain view a to life declaring that under circumstance have there be davis must have consented to remain at folking a deputy squire waiting to take up position twenty year hence at father death even be folking own at moment must live there must do something upon whole thought that gold mining in colony be most congenial pursuit to must put hand then made frank acknowledgment a to davis gambling folly ended by saying that matter might be regarded a settled have certainly be successful in changing old man opinion mr bolton did not say a much be man likely to make such acknowledgment when led john caldigate away to be introduced to wife in drawing room felt le of disdain for guest than have done hour before mr bolton be silent cautious man even in own family have said nothing of business to wife nothing of course to daughter mr bolton asked after squire expressed hope that guest must not find house very dull for one night have heard that john caldigate be fast young man of course regarded a lost sinner hester who be with mother looked at with young big eye did not speak word be very seldom that saw young man indeed young people of sex when stranger spoke freely to mother about subject other listened to be interested john caldigate without being absolutely handsome be youth sure to find favour in woman eye be about five foot ten in height strong very active with bright dark eye be full of life intelligence forehead be square showed angle of brow hair be dark thick cut somewhat short mouth be large full of expression generally also of good humour nose must have be well formed that be little snubbed at end altogether face gave idea of will intellect kindly nature there be in promise too of occasional anger physiognomist might perhaps have expected from vacillation in conduct have hitherto led from better thing into wretched fault a be talking to mr bolton have observed girl who sat apart with finger busy on work who have hardly spoken word since entrance be thought most lovely human being that have ever beheld yet be hardly more than child how different from girl at babington bright brown hair be simply brushed from off forehead tied in knot behind head dress be a plain a child a though be intended that must still be regarded a child face be very fair with large grey thoughtful eye mouth though a caldigate watched be never opened seemed always a if be just about to pour forth word must see that though eye be intent upon work from time to time looked across at thought that if only two be alone together must teach to speak such opportunity be given to now during short sojourn at grange after while old man returned to room took up to bed chamber be then about past four be told that be to dine at six be early in november not cold enough for bedroom fire among thrifty people there be left apparently to spend hour with nothing to do rebelling against declaring even at puritan grange must be master of own action rushed down into hall took hat walked off into town must go take one last look at old college went in through great gate across yard passing by well known buttery hatch looked into old hall for last time men be seated at dinner must see fellow up at high table three year ago have be fixed resolve to earn for right to sit upon dais have then be sure of that must do well take honour win fellowship there have be moment in have thought that college life must suit till came into own property how have that faded away everybody have congratulated on ease with did work result have be newmarket davis long score in ephemeral record of cricket match a stood there with slouched hat over eye one of college servant recognised called by name then passed on quickly made way out to gravel walk by river side be not yet closed for night went on that might take one last turn up down old avenue have certainly made failure of life so far did acknowledge to that there be something nobler in classic shade than in ore laden dirt of australian gold gully knew a much of world a that have not hitherto chosen better part now something of regret even a to folking poor old folking came upon be a be being kicked out repudiated by own family a worthless what be to do about julia babington after scene in linen closet must not leave country without word to julia to aunt polly idea of julia be doubly distasteful to since lovely vision of young female simplicity have shone upon from corner of mr bolton drawing room romping with babington girl be very well if must only feel tip of girl finger come within grasp of hand then thought that must lend fine romance to life if must resolve to come back when must be laden with gold make hester bolton wife must be romance swore that must cling to turned back came down to dinner five minute after time at ten minute before dinner time mr bolton heard that be gone out be offended thinking quite possible that must not return at what might not be expected from young man who must so easily abandon inheritance be there only five minute after time dinner be eaten almost in silence in evening there be tea coldest shivering attempt at conversation for hour during must still at moment catch glance of hester eye see moving curve of lip then there be reading of bible prayer before ten be in bed room on next morning a took departure mr bolton said word intended to be gracious hope may succeed in enterprise mr caldigate ' 'why must not a well a ' said john cheerily 'if be steady sober industrious self denying honest probably will ' replied banker promise must be to promise too much ' said john 'but mean to make effort then at moment made one effort be successful for instant held hester finger within hand chapter iii daniel caldigate that piece of business be done be one of disagreeable thing have have to do before must get away to gold digging be done now have to say farewell to father must be harder task a moment be coming in must bid adieu to father perhaps for ever bid adieu to old place though despised still loved heart be heavy within felt sure that father have special regard for in be of course altogether wrong old man be equally wrong in supposing that son be unnaturally deficient in filial affection have never known other be so different that have understood other son however be ready to confess to that chief fault have be with be natural thought that father regard must be deadened by such conduct a have be natural that old man must not believe in quick repentance improvement of young one hired gig drove over from cambridge to folking a got near to place passed along dike looked to right left down drove trotted at last over folking bridge across middle wash country did not seem to to be so unattractive a of yore when recognised face of neighbour when one of tenant spoke to kindly girl dropped curtsey a passed certain soft regret began to crop up in mind after there be comfort in feeling of property not simply money comfort in stability reputation of recognised home six month ago there have seemed to to be something ridiculous in idea of permanent connection between name of caldigate folking be absurd that with so wild beautiful world around must be called upon to live in washy fen because father grandfather have be unfortunate enough to do so then at time sympathy with brick mortar affection for special tree well known home haunt be absurd in eye a father have be harsh to did not like must not be better that must be far apart be thus that have reasoned now be changed unwonted tenderness have come upon spirit very sallow by brook seemed to appeal to a saw house chimney through tree remembered that have carried smoke from hearth of many generation of caldigates remembered too that father must soon be old must be alone seemed to that very mind spirit be altered be too late have agreed to term proposed even be now to repudiate what must do with davis how must live for present not for moment did entertain such idea have lost that alacrity of spirit have be when first found way out of difficulty father did not come forth to meet went in across hall through library into little closet beyond in mr caldigate be wont to sit 'well john ' said old man have mr bolton got on together there seemed to be something terribly cold in might be better that must part better even though parting must be for ever might be right nay knew that be right that must be thrust out of inheritance have spent money be not own of course must pay debt that father must sit there in chair on entrance not even rising to greet must refer at once to mr bolton that business arrangement a though that alone need now be discussed did seem to to be almost cruel of that father have suffered in constraining to conduct understood nothing ber bolton made very plain sir ' must be sure to do so be man of business intelligent a to term proposed be what have expected ' a good a have expected ' good bad of course will understand have have nothing to do with matter have be referred to two gentleman conversant with such subject after due inquiry told mr bolton be money value of right be question to be settled a easily a price of ton of coal joint of beef must understand have not interfered ' be quite aware of sir ' 'as for money something over third of be in own hand have not be extravagant have saved so much remainder will come out of mr bolton bank will be lent on mortgage certainly will not have cause for extravagance now living here alone will endeavour to free estate from burden by degree when die will in accordance with present purpose go to cousin george a be said john thought perceived something like quiver in father voice up to point have be hard clear unshaken 'as to however intend to pledge ' continued 'the estate will now be own subject to claim from messrs bolton bank know that there be anything else to be said ' 'not about business sir ' be business suppose have brought here to cambridge know what little thing have of own in house ' much sir there be anything that wish to take take with now suppose money be only possession have value must like to have small portrait of miniature 'the miniature of ' said father almost scoffingly looking up at son face suspiciously yet though must not show be touched only if be ruse on part of young man mock sentiment little got up theatrical pretence then then how disgraced must be in own estimation at having be moved by such mockery son stood square before father disdaining attempt to evince supplicating tenderness by voice by feature perhaps have special value for ' said indeed be others not ought to have such trifle be if be of value at 'there be none can care much for ' 'there be one to care at one else be added wishing to avoid further declaration anything else want in house there will be thing left suppose clothes book suchlike ' 'hardly anything sir going so far have better give away few book will take ' then conversation be over in few minute john caldigate found roaming alone about place be so probable that might never see again indeed seemed to now that be to return to england with fortune made must hardly come to folking year year must roll by before must be done if must only come back to cambridge fetch that wife away with then thought must be better for to live far from england whether be rich whether be poor be quite evident that father heart be turned from altogether of course have to blame only still be strange to that father must feel tenderness at parting with only son while have be in room have constrained manfully not drop of moisture have glittered in eye not tone of feeling have thrilled in voice feature have never failed there have always be that look of audacity on brow joined to certain manliness of good humour in mouth a though have be thoroughly master of situation now a pushed hat from off forehead rubbed hand across eye to dash away tear felt almost inclined to rush back to house fall on knee before father kiss old man hand beg old man blessing though be potent for much be not potent for such expression of tenderness must have be true knew that must so break down in attempt a to make seem to be false got out upon twopenny drove passed over ferry meaning to walk across farm so out on to causeway round home by bridge on other side of wash encountered mr ralph holt occupier of twopenny farm whose father also grandfather have lived upon same acre 'and so thou be'est going away from mr john ' said farmer with real tenderness almost with solemnity in voice although there be at same time something ridiculous in far fetched sadness of tone gait 'yes indeed holt want to travel see world at distance from here ' 'if be no more than mr john there must be nothing about zeeing world young collegers allays doe that be'est thou to come back be squoire o'folking ' ' think not holt think not father hope will be squire for many year 'like enough hope that for there be nowhere juster man squoire be hale hearty in course of thing time will run out be so mr john thou be'est going for ever allays ' rather think be ' be wrong mr john though maybe be making over free to talk of what concern yet say be wrong son must come arter father specially where there be land none of like none of be worse going one of for what be lease when man have freehold must stick to for ever aye be just a though old place be tumbling about ear caldigate be good natured with man trying to make understand that everything be being done for best at last bade good bye affectionately shaking hand with going into farmhouse to perform same ceremony with wife daughter to last ralph holt be uncomfortable dismal foretelling misery be clear that to thinking stability of world be undermined destroyed by very contemplation of such proceeding a caldigate pursued walk in course of bade farewell to more than one old friend none of be so expressive a holt must perceive that be regarded by of a person who by conduct be bringing misfortune not only on on whole parish of utterden netherden at dinner squire conversed upon various subject if not easily to at least with affected ease have applied to subject altogether indifferent to state of politics game law absurdity of state church unfitness of such matter for occasion must have be too apparent son must have broken down in attempt must talk about babington abusing old family even about about new south wale gold coming voyage without touching point have be must be specially painful not word have ever be spoken between a to davis there have of course be letter very angry letter usurer name have never be mentioned be there need that must be mentioned now be john affair not in way so asked listened to much about richard shand mode of gold finding practised among digging in new south wale when old butler have gone be even more free speaking of thing be past not only without anger a far a possible without chagrin treating son a person altogether free from control of dare say be for best said 'it be well at rate to try to think so sir ' replied john conscience stricken a to own fault doubt whether there must have be anything for to do here at least anything that must have done must have have too much ambition to manage little estate under not enough of industry fear to carry to front in of profession used to think of bar 'and so did ' 'but when found that babingtons have got hold of that liked horse gun better than word argument ' never did sir ' 'it seemed so ' 'of course have be weak suppose for moment be finding fault must be of avail must not thus embitter last hour together when saw how taste seemed to lead began to fear that there must be career for here on property a babington eldest son may vegetate like father before may succeed to in due time before have wasted everything may die a have lived useless having to end enjoyment of swine ' 'you be severe upon cousin sir ' ' say what think must not have done though be not industrious be far too active too clever for life now be probably in earnest a to future 'yes be certainly in earnest though be going to risk capital in precarious business will only be doing what be done daily by enterprising men must wish that position be more secure that now can not be helped bed be a have made quite understand that sir ' 'thinking of have endeavoured to reconcile to going ' then paused moment considering what must next say son be silent knowing that something further be to come 'have remained in england must hardly have lived together a father son must live must have be dependent on must have rebelled against submission state of dependence demand there must have be nothing for to have waited almost to have wished for death ' sir never never that ' must have be more than natural will hear from sometimes '

time most bitter most determined doubt arose at first from jealousy have declared purpose of unravelling mystery task have be taken out of hand unravelling be being done by more that woman be abused more intent be people in regard to wicked determination to be intimate with caldigate more interesting became dick who be very imp of imprudence who have never be deterred from doing anything fancied by glimmer of control must have be delighted to be hero of little story be being told a morsel of bread have be taken a be from between very teeth by unjustifiable interference of friend have become more alive than one else to danger of whole proceeding acknowledged to captain that friend be making fool of though be little afraid of caldigate resolved upon interfering ' think be making as of about woman ' said ' daresay be ' 'well wise men from david downwards have made ass of about woman why must be wiser than rest 'that be nonsense know ' havery likely ' be trying to talk to in earnest 'you make failure of old boy be compelled to talk nonsense in return idea of preaching here be with nothing special to do like to amuse ought not that to be enough for ' 'but what be to be end of ' dick shand asked very solemnly 'how can tell absurdity be that man a must talk about end of anything did ever look before leaped in life ' 'we be to be together know wo do for to be hampered with

be not being true partner said shand `` m quite sure of be likely to be a true a be be not aware have entered into term with by have bound to special mode of living have left england a fancy have done also because desired more conventional freedom than one can find among folk at home now on first outset be to be cautioned threatened by because have made acquaintance with young woman of moral pastor master one might come across in world dick shand appear to to be most absurd be so far right a that if conduct be shocking to have better leave to wickedness ' 'you be always so d upsetting ' said dick 'that one can speak to ' then dick turned away there be nothing more said about mr smith on occasion next to try hand be mr callander by time passenger have become familiar with ship knew what might what might not do second class passenger be not often found intruding across bar first class frequently made visit to friend amidships in way mr callander have become acquainted with two gold seeker often found in conversation with one other even miss green a have be stated before must come gaze upon wave from inferior part of deck 'what very nice voyage be having mr caldigate ' mr callander said one afternoon 'yes indeed be getting little cold now will enjoy that after heat 'quite so only suppose will be very cold when get quite south still find tolerably comfortable ' will be glad to have over ' said caldigate who have in truth become disgusted with dick snoring ' daresay be sure will young people be getting very tired of child when be accustomed to comfort on shore of course feel grievously suppose be rather crowded ' 'of course be crowded one ca have twenty foot square room on board ship ' indeed then be with friend be much pleasanter than stranger must depend on whether stranger snored mr callander talk of snoring mr caldigate if only heard mr callander a be saying must have very queer character down there ' have not be saying anything of kind found difficulty in introducing subject 'take altogether be very decent pleasant well mannered set of people of in earnest about future life 'poor creature dare say be very good ' then paused moment looked into face have undertaken duty be not woman to shrink from so told at moment yet be very much afraid of a saw squareness of forehead set of mouth there be frown across brow a though be preparing to fight must have found hard to accommodate yourselves to mr caldigate ' 'not at 'of course know that be gentleman be much obliged to know word requires definition so much a be going to work hard to earn bread suppose people be going to do same always will be danger in such society ' said mr callander hope may escape great evil hope so too mr caldigate probably have have long roll of ancestor before ' 'we have back to adam ' 'ah mean family roll of ought to be proud lady gentleman word know beo hear have doubt be true ' then paused looking again into face be very square lip be hard there be gleam of anger in eye wished back again in own part of ship have boasted to miss green that be not woman to give up duty when have undertaken though be frightened still must go on ' hope will excuse mr caldigate ' ' be sure will not say anything can not excuse ' think ' then paused have looked into face again be so little satisfied that did not dare to go on must not help in least stood there looking at with something of smile stealing over hardness of face with such expression that smile be even worse than hardness going to speak to about lady mr callander ' ' be be what be going to speak of ' be anxious to remonstrate against word lady courage failed 'then think that perhaps have better leave alone be very much obliged to kind of thing a to really must care what said good advice must be taken most gratefully if did affect one else might say thing of lady in question must bear patiently ca be equal wo hear even patiently know nothing about except that be second class passenger in matter be exactly equal if come to that think that be degrading in coming here talking to be not equal 'but be ' 'and so be then sha arrive at anything mr callander so have better give up ' whereupon did give up retreat to own part of ship not with very good grace have certainly become very intimate john caldigate mr smith there must be doubt that in ordinary language of world be making fool of did in fact know nothing about what told amounted to little more than three statement might might not be true that have gone on stage in opposition to friend that have married actor who have treated with great cruelty that have died of drink with of story there have be accompaniment of mystery have not told maiden name what have be condition of parent whether be living at what theatre husband have acted when have died have expressed hope that might get engagement in colony have not spoken of recommendation letter of introduction simply knew of that name be euphemia smith in matter of clothes there have be great improvement made very gradually have laughed at own precaution saying that in poverty have wished to save everything must be saved that have only intended to make look like others in same class 'and have wanted to avoid attention at first said smiling a looked up at 'in have be altogether unsuccessful replied 'as be certainly more talked about than one in ship 'have be fault ' asked then comforted saying that certainly have not be fault that have be reticent reserved till have be either provoked invited to come forth in fact that conduct have be in respect feminine pretty decorous a to be not perhaps best judge in world be certainly much pleasanter to look at even to talk to now that have put on small clean black felt instead of broken straw have got out from trunk pretty warm shawl placed ribbon two about in indescribable manner be no longer ashamed of showing shoe a sat about upon deck there must be no doubt a be seen now that be most attractive female on board ship may be doubted whether anger of mr cromptons mr callanders miss green be mitigated by change battle against became stronger duty of rescuing that infatuated young man from sorcery be more clear than ever if only anything must be done to rescue what must be done mr smith must not be locked up one not even captain must send down to own wretched little cabin because must talk with gentleman talking be allowed on board ship even flirting to certain extent mr smith conduct with mr caldigate be not more peculiar than of miss green doctor only pleased certain people to think that miss green might be fond of doctor if chose that mr smith have right to be fond of man there be stubbornness about sinner resolved to set public opinion at defiance very fact that others wished to interfere with made caldigate determined to resent interference woman with perhaps deeper insight into own advantage be brave enough to be able to set opposition at defiance be about week from port when captain captain munday be induced to take matter into own hand be hardly too much to say that be pressed to do so by united effort of first class passenger be dreadful to think that unfortunate young man must go on shore merely to become prey of such woman a so captain munday who at heart be not afraid of passenger who persisted in saying that good must be done who have a may be remembered already made slight attempt be induced to take matter in hand came up to caldigate on deck one afternoon without preface began business caldigate ' said ' be afraid be getting into scrape with one of fellow passenger 'what do call scrape captain munday must call scrape if young gentleman of position prospect be to find engaged on board ship to marry woman knew nothing about ' know anything about position prospect captain munday know be gentleman think know le about lady know nothing will tell what hear ' really must rather that did not of course captain munday on board own ship be despot must say that have made everything very pleasant for think even position entitles to talk to about private affair about hers say know nothing be manly to repeat what one hears about poor forlorn woman then captain retreated without word owning to that be beaten if foolish young man chose to make for bed of kind must lie upon captain munday went away shrugging shoulder spoke further word to john caldigate on other subject during voyage caldigate have driven off persecutor valiantly have taught to think that be resolute in purpose in regard to mr smith let purpose be what might nothing must be further from truth for have purpose be within own mind conscious of lack of purpose very conscious of folly though must repel mr callander captain a have always repelled who have attempted to control still knew that have be right such intimacy a must not be wise want of wisdom became more strongly impressed upon nearer got to shore more felt that when have got ashore must not know how to act in regard to intimacy have certainly become very close have expressed great admiration have replied that 'have thing not be a be ' must have returned feeling did not say what thing be might have be otherwise did seem to attempt to lead on to further more definite proposal never spoke of joint action between when on shore though gave up to society here on board ship seemed to think that be then to part a though one must be going one way one other felt that after so close intimacy must not part like chapter viii reaching melbourne thing went on in same way till night before morning on be to

again into warm latitude fine autumn weather for be beginning of march world out there be upside down before evening nothing have be said between mr smith john caldigate a to future not word to indicate that when journey must be over there must that there must not be further intercourse between have purposely avoided reference to world after world of ship even refusing in half sad half joking manner to discus matter so far ahead felt that must not leave on board a must other passenger without word spoken a to future meeting there will arrive on occasion certain pitch of intimacy can not be defined a may degree of cousinship be perfectly understood by person concerned so close a to forbid such mere shaking of hand there be many men perhaps more woman cautious enough wise enough to think of beforehand thinking of to guard from dangerous attraction of casual companion by composed manner unenthusiastic conversation who doe not know sagacious lady who after sitting at table with same gentleman for month can say 'good bye mr jones just a though mr jones have be stranger under notice for day others gush out when mr jones take departure hardly know how not to throw into arm intercourse between hero mr smith have be such that a gentleman must not leave without allusion to future meeting be up to evening before arrival whole ship company captain officer quarter master

used in discussing matter with mr callander between dick friend there have be very little confidential communication of late caldigate have forbidden shand to talk to about mr smith thus have naturally closed man mouth on other matter then have fallen into different set dick at least have fallen into set while caldigate have hardly associated with one dangerous friend dick have lived much with bevy of noisy young men who have be given to game smoking to good deal of drink caldigate have said not word even when on one occasion dick have stumbled down into cabin very much worse for what have taken how must find fault with dick folly when must not allow dick to say word to a to own on last day at sea became necessary that must understand other do mean to do when land ' caldigate asked

of same day after have sighted cape otway that mr smith caldigate began last conversation on board goldfinder conversation lasted with one two interruption late into night have come to end of ' said 'to end of what ' 'to end of be pleasant easy safe remember telling how dreaded finish here have be fairly comfortable have in many respect enjoyed have have to talk to there have be flavour of old day about what will be doing time to morrow ' know plan 'exactly have not told because must not have bothered with when land have enough on own hand if be to be burden to now might be serious trouble be afraid poor mr shand object to ' 'you think must stand in way ' 'it stand in mine of course with pride obstinacy must tell mr shand to go to devil if ventured to object to little delay might be occasioned by looking after then mr shand must go there elsewhere plan must be broken up must be without companion 'unless have ' of word must have spoken in such emergency be most foolish yet at so tender moment how be to be repressed ' do think that dick shand be dangerous ' answered laughing 'but must be worse be afraid dick shand will drink 'if so must part what must do ' must do what must do then there be pause must want to marry must be worse than dick shand drinking eh there be obligation on man to persevere when woman have encouraged in love making be like riding at fence when once have set horse at must go on however impracticable may appear a draw close to if have never looked at fence at if have ridden quite other way making for safe gate clinging to dull lane then there will be excitement also there will be no danger disgrace caldigate have ridden hard at fence must not crane at now that be so close to must only trust to good fortune to carry safe over suppose must want ' said 'but might ' 'you must want must not want for always must be burden le easy to shake off than dick shand 'be that way man be always to look at woman 'it be way in do think often wonder that man

known in nobble seemed that crinkett be very well known in nobble indeed if anybody have done well at nobble mr crinkett have done well be bewell ' of place informant did not think that mr crinkett have gone very deep at ahalala mr crinkett have risen high enough in profession to be able to achieve more certainty than must be found at place a ahalala by time be on road to mr crinkett house new friend having undertaken to show way can put up to thing two if like ' said new friend 'perhaps be pal of yourn ' caldigate explained that have never seen mr crinkett that have come to nobble armed with letter from gentleman in england who have once be concerned in gold digging be civil enough gent be crinkett ' said miner do like making money say of there be nothing must sell not even grandmother bone like trade ' added miner of be too sharp that be where crinkett life be swell ai ' have walked about mile from town turning down lane at back of house have made way through yawning pit hole heap of dirt pool of yellow water where everything be disorderly apparently deserted till came to cluster of heap so large a to look like little hill here there be sign of mining vitality on way have not come across single shred of vegetation though here there stood bare trunk of few dead headless tree ghost of forest have occupied place six seven year previously on top of artificial hill there be sundry rickety looking erection around be trough shed rude water work a miner explained be outward visible sign of world famous 'old stick in mud claim be now giving two ounce of gold to ton of quartz be at present exclusive property of mr crinkett who have bought out tribute shareholder be working thing altogether on own bottom a ascended one of mound of upcast stone rubble must see on other side crushing mill engine house must hear thud thud thud of great iron hammer a fell on quartz then close beyond still among hillock surrounded on side by dirt filth of mining operation be mr crinkett mansion 'and there be very standing at gate counting how many time hammer fall minute how much gold be coming from blow a fall ' with little observation a to mr crinkett personal character miner made way back to companion chapter x polyeuka house saw certainly surprised much seemed to justify assertion just before made to that mr crinkett be swell be marvellous that man must have contemplated building of such mansion in place so little attractive with so many house within view house little attempted garden together with stable appurtenance may have occupied acre around be hideous sign of mining operation make country rich in metal look a though devil have walked over dragging behind enormous rake there be not blade of grass to be seen a far a eye must reach there stood ghost like skeleton of tree in spot where soil have not be turned up on none of be there leaf left even branch everywhere ground be thrown about in hideous uncovered hillock of seemed to have be deserted except in immediate neighbourhood of mr crinkett house close around one must see wheel turning long rope moving water running in little wooden conduit of be sign of activity going on under ground then there be never ceasing thud thud thud of crushing mill from twelve o'clock on sunday night to twelve o'clock on saturday night never paused for moment having effect on vacant day of creating painful strain of silence upon ear of who be compelled to remain on spot during unoccupied time be said that in mr crinkett mansion sleeper must wake from sleep a soon a engine be stopped disturbed by unwonted quiescence house have be built in unpromising spot be quite entitled to be called mansion be of red brick three storey high with white stone facing to window corner glittered uncomfortably in hot sun there be sweep up to road having be made from debris of stone out of gold have be crushed though there be sweep up to door carefully made for length of few dozen yard there be nothing must be called road outside though there be track here there through hillock along waggon employed about place struggled through mud house be built with large hall in middle three large window on side on floor there be four large room with kitchen opening out behind above there be of course chamber in proportion in little garden there be pond big bath house there be coach house stable so that be quite mansion be called polyeuka hall because while be being built mr crinkett be drawing large gain from polyeuka mine about three mile distant on other side of nobble for building of mansion on special site one must imagine other reason than love brave man have of overcoming difficulty to endeavour to create paradise in such pandemonium required energy of crinkett whether not have be successful depended of course on own idiosyncrasy have wife who be to be hoped liked residence have child spent greater part of time away in other mining district in have venture when thus absent must live a jack brien friend be living at mr henniker be supposed to enjoy ease of inn more thoroughly than did constraint of grand establishment at present moment be at home be standing at gate of domain alone with pipe in mouth perhaps listening a man have said to noise of own crushing machine be dressed in black with chimney pot on head certainly did not look like miner though looked a little like gentleman friend be in what conceived to be proper miner costume mr crinkett knew at glance that there be something uncommon about a approached did not attempt to open gate awaited looking over top of from inside mate what can do for ' said still remaining on side apparently intending that must remain on then caldigate brought forth letter handed to owner of place across top of gate think mr jones wrote to about before ' said caldigate crinkett read letter very deliberately perhaps required time to meditate what conduct must be perhaps be not quick at reading written letter at last got to end of very few word note contained 'jones said 'jones be much account when be out here ' 'we know great deal about ' said dick when heard that be coming offered letter to ' said caldigate ' believe to be honest man 'honest well yes daresay be honest enough never robbed of nothing will tell why because know how to take care that yet nobody else a said looked at a though intended that be included among

melbourne did make mr crinkett understand that be not pauper be anxious to do something in way of mining particularly anxious to make money did not quite know how to begin must give hint meant to work with own hand perhaps might be well for at first to hire service of one to set going crinkett listened very patiently still maintaining position on own side of gate then spoke word of such wisdom a be in 'ahalala be just place to ease of little money mind tell gold of course there be be gold to be got there what be be cost of be be return if sixteen hundred men among can sell fifteen hundred pound

gold that must see with eye in raw condition must tempt more surely than eloquence in engine house three of got into box truck be suspended over mouth of deep shaft soon found descending through bowel of earth went down about four hundred foot a be reaching bottom crinkett remarked that be ' goodish deep hole to belong to one man ' 'yes added a caldigate extricated from truck there be precious lot more gold to come out of yet can tell ' in sight to be seen about world there be sight in there be le to be seen than in gold mine two young men be made to follow conductor along very dirty

beyond hospitality did not go dick looked a though liked idea of having venture in 'old stick in mud caldigate without actually disbelieving have be said to did not relish proposal be not kind of thing have intended after have learned trade a miner might be very well for to have share in established concern in case must wish to be one of manager not to trust everything to crinkett however honest that suggestion of travelling about amusing did not commend to new south wale might thought be good country for work did not seem to offer much amusement beyond sheer idleness brandy water '

about assumed situation easily fact that be to receive wage from others have bearing on subject at before got to ahalala caldigate have begun to appreciate to understand in part what must have to do during month how must have to live be proposed that must at once fix on spot 'peg out claim on unoccupied piece of ground buy for small tent of be assured that must find many for sale then begin to sink hole when entered ahalala caldigate be surprised to find mick be most tired of three be always so man who have laboured from youth upwards can endure with arm be who have have leisure to shoot to play cricket to climb up mountain to handle racket can walk 'darned if ai better stuff than took for ' said mick a three let swag down from back on veranda of ridley hotel at ahalala ahalala be very different place from nobble made nobble seem to be almost compact prosperous city at nobble there be at rate street at ahalala everything be straggling house such a be stood here there about place while great part of population lived under canvas then ahalala be decidedly in forest tree around have not yet be altogether killed have be cut down in sufficient number to divest place of forest appearance ahalala be leafy therefore though much le regular also le hideous than nobble when dick first made tender inquiry a to comfort of hotel be assured that there be at least couple of dozen place be bewildering there seemed to be beginning to end there be many track about here there nothing must be called road number of hole be infinite hole covered by rough windlass used for taking out dirt be thrown loosely anywhere round aperture here there be to be seen little red flag stuck upon end of pole indicated a mick informed fortunate adventure in gold have be found at very much more numerous hillock showed red flag labourer be hitherto labouring in vain there be little tent generally near to hillock in miner slept packed nearly a close a sheep in fold a party made way through

be sharing provision out of same frying pan a rule miner have own have between leg before have be at ahalala twenty four hour also have tent frying pan fire have pegged out claim be ready to commence operation on morrow be soon manifest to caldigate dick shand that must have be very much astray without 'boss ' to direct three four hour have be passed in forming judgment a to spot on must commence to dig in making choice mick have be guided by many matter a to two adventurer be altogether ignorant might be that mick be equally so at rate assumed knowledge looked to fall of ground line in red flag be to be traced if such line must be found be possessed of considerable amount of jargon a to topographical mining secret at last found spot near creek surrounded by forest tree perhaps three hundred yard from nearest adjacent claim a mick declared in direct line with three red flag here determined to commence operation suppose will do good said caldigate to dick 'but must make beginning if only for sake of hardening hand will be learning something at time even though only shovel up so much mud ' for fortnight shovelled up soil continuously without golden effect so far without feeling of disappointment mick have told that if found speck at end of three week must be very fortunate have windlass worked in relay one man at bottom one man at wheel one man idle in way kept up work during eighteen hour of day man in way worked twelve hour have twelve for sleeping cooking eating other occupation have none during fortnight neither of went further distance from claim than to neighbouring shop mick often expressed admiration at continued industry not understanding spirit will induce such young men a to work even when work be agonising be equally charmed with mick sobriety loyalty not word have be said a to hour of work yet be a constant to long hour a though venture be own a though there be question of wage ai have drop o ' drink yet said mick one night 'ai holding off like briton there be great triumph in voice a said very great triumph also a caldigate thought sound of longing also be now in third week word whisky have never be pronounced between at moment when

india rubber sheet caldigate have brought with from england too have roused miner wrath nevertheless condescended to lie upon be bed here lay wrapped up in blanket mick in middle with two friend at side now be not only on mick account quite a much in reference to dick shand caldigate deprecated reference to drink abstention hitherto have be marvellous must have gone daily to store for bottle of beer that recognised expediency of keeping away from place have heard that be peculiarity of country that labour be done without drink even when be done by determined drunkard drunkard must work for month then drink for month then after time must die drink almost always consisted of spirit of worst description seemed to be recognised by men work drink must be kept separate mick mind travelled away on occasion from little tent to delight of ridley bar 'we have have drop of drink yet said 'we will push through month without eh old boy said caldigate 'what must give for pint of bitter beer ' said shand 'or bottle of battleaxe between three of ' said mick battleaxe being name for certain brand of brandy 'not drop till month be over ' said caldigate turning round in blanket then there be whispering between other two men of must only hear hum on next morning at six caldigate dick shand be at hole together be caldigate turn to work till noon whereas dick went off at nine must come on

at hole soon found how hard be not to go astray without instructed mate side of shaft became crooked uneven windlass sometimes must not be made to work still persevered went on by for entire week without sign of gold during time various fruitless expedition be made by men in search of maggott be still at same drinking shop must not be induced to leave at last found with incipient horror of delirium tremens yet must not get away man who kept place be quite used to delirium tremens thought nothing about when caldigate tried high moral tone everybody around laughed at have be digging for month still without speck of gold when one morning early mick appeared in front of tent be then about eight friend have stopped work to eat breakfast poor man without saying word came crouched down before not in shame not at apparently in agony of sickness `` ve have bout ' said ' suppose be much better for ' replied caldigate 'no ai none better thought be up with yesterday oh law have have

cast out always leaving very small residuum be intent upon business to degree caldigate must have thought to be beyond man nature with extreme patience went on washing handful after handful day while other two pulled up fresh bucket of same stuff must not pause to eat hardly to talk at last there came loud exclamation have got ' then dick caldigate stooping down be shown four five little speck in angle of pan bottom before sun have set have stuck up little red flag crowd of neighbour be standing round asking question a to success chapter xii mademoiselle cettini after three day of successful washing when became apparent that shed must be built that if possible further labour must be hired mick said that must go ' ai earned nothing ' said 'because of bout ai going to ask for nothing ca

be good enough to justify present attention to personal comfort be rational pleasant straightforward in letter there be tone touch of old quarrel be full cordial such a son might write to father need hardly be said that there be mention made in of mr smith be written after return of john caldigate from sydney to ahalala contained reference to matrimonial project letter then came regularly month by month be always regularly answered till chance reader must have thought that father son stood on better term with other there have be misfortune misfortune did not seem to touch john caldigate after three month of hard work steady conduct mick maggott have broken out have again taken to drinking champagne out of bucket effort be made with infinite trouble to reclaim must be successful for time then again must slip away into mud then shand must sometimes go into mud with shand when drunk must be more unmanageable even than mick went on till mick have killed dick shand have disappeared grieve for man a for dear friend said in one of father letter have be a true to a steel in thing save drink feel have learned under practical work of gold miner a can not be learned except by unwearied

told also shand strayed away to queensland then returning be again admitted to certain degree of partnership then again fell into drink at last deserting trade of miner tried hand at various kind of work till at last became simple shepherd from time to time caldigate sent money when be in want of have not again come together a associate in work be told in monthly letter came to be expected at folking till letter be regarded a rising of new sun there be style of letter writing seems to indicate strength of purpose general healthy condition on part of writer in letter son spoke of doings with confidence serenity somewhat surprising father after while by always desiring to be remembered to mr mr miss bolton went on not only from month to month from year to year till at end of three year from date at son have left folking there have come to be complete confidence between father john caldigate have gone into partnership with crinkett who have indeed tried to cheat wretchedly have failed at time be manager of polyeuka mine claim at ahalala have be sold have deserted flashy insecurity of alluvial searchings for fundamental security of rock gold be deep in crushing of quartz understood well meaning of two ounce to ton that glittering boast by crinkett have at first thought to allure from time to time sent money home paying back to father to bolton bank what have be borrowed on estate for there have passed between many communication respecting folking extravagance of son became almost delight of father when father have become certain of son reform there have be even jocular reference to davis complete understanding a to amount of money to be given to nephew in compensation for blighted hope a to reversion of property why must have be that year of absence must have endeared to john caldigate place while be home have always be distasteful to can not perhaps explain to reader who have never strayed far from original nest to who have be wanderer certainly need not explain a soon a felt that must base expression of desire a to folking on foundation of substantial remittance be not slow to say that must like to keep place knew that have right to reversion perhaps father must sympathise with desire to buy back right father with political tenet a to land with often expressed admiration a to french system with loud denunciation of absurdity of binding special family to special fraction of earth surface did sympathise with so strongly that at once accepted arrangement think that conduct have given right to demand ' said to mr bolton ' quite see that money certainly give man great power if have money enough can buy succession to folking if choose to sell to ' ' mean a son ' said father somewhat proudly 'he be heir 'but ceased to be so by own doing advised to think longer over before allowed to dispossess ' 'it certainly have be for best ' hope so when talk of right be bound to say that have none folking be now yours without encumbrance can give to whom please ' 'it be who paid off mortgage 'you have told that sent part of money be between be very glad caldigate that son have done so well more so perhaps because early promise be not good may be doubted whether successful gold digger will settle down quietly a english country gentleman ' there can be doubt that old mr bolton be little jealous perhaps in degree incredulous a to success of john caldigate son have worked hard from very beginning of life with there have be period of newmarket davis disreputation on basis of capital combined with conduct have gradually risen to high success here be young man who having by self indulgence thrown away prospect of youth have rehabilitated by luck of finding gold in gully to mr bolton be better than have found box of treasure at bottom of well mr bolton have be seeker of money life have prejudice a to way in money be to be sought must be done in gradual industrious manner in accordance with recognised form digger who might by chance find lump of gold a big a head might work for three month without finding be to only one degree better than davis therefore did not receive old friend statement a to young man success with encouragement old friend must have liked father be very enthusiastic in return letter to miner matter a to estate have be arranged nephew who after have not shown to be very praiseworthy have already be compensated own will have already be made of course in son favour a there have be so much success a continued success must always be doubtful must not be well that must come back a soon a possible there must be enough now for then expressed opinion that place a nobble must not be very nice for permanent residence nobble be not very nice over beside professional success there be not much in present life endeared to john caldigate acquisition of gold be difficult thing to leave there be curse about blessing be hard to decide make almost impossible for man to tear away from pursuit when be coming in freely absolute gold not money not balance at one banker be not plentiful so much per annum absolute metal clinging about palm of one hand like small gravel

notice if a hoped must find able to leave colony within four year of day on have begun work must then do so with adequate fortune believed that must have done better than other englishman who have set to task of gold finding in none of letter did say anything special about hester bolton inquiry about family generally be so frequent a to make father wonder why such question must be asked squire who be living hardly dozen mile from mr bolton house did not see old banker above once quarter perhaps lady of family certainly not oftener than once year very little be said in answer to of john inquiry ber mr miss bolton be believe quite well ' so much be declared in one of old squire letter even little served to make known at rate so far tidings a to marriage on part of hester have reached ear of father old friend perhaps be that john caldigate wanted to learn at last there came word that john intended to come home with next month mail letter arrived about midsummer when miner have be absent three year half have not settled affair so completely that might be necessary that must return thought that must be able to remain at least twelve month in england in england intended to make home

accepted cousin julia aunt polly be enemy against whom be necessary to assume weapon might come to hand have arranged to stay week at babington have considered very deeply have felt that a two day be least fraction of time must with propriety devote to shands so must give at least week to babington there be therefore necessity for immediate violence on part of lady whole week might probably have be allowed to pas without absolute violence have not shown by various way that did not intend to make many visit to old haunt of childhood before return to australia when said that must not hunt in coming winter that feared hand be out for shooting that have idea of travelling on continent during autumn that there be knowing when might be summoned back to polyeuka of course there came across

settled be very well to talk about polyeuka man who have engaged in business must doubt attend to married men can attend to business quite a well a who be single at rate there must be reason why previous engagement must not be consolidated made family affair there be felt to be something almost approaching to resistance in what have said done already therefore aunt polly flew to weapon

feather girl with large ankle be one may suppose a liable to die for love a though be a fine about foot a thorough bred filly there be surely reason why true heart pair of cherry cheek must not go together imagination have created idea in such matter so fixed that be useless to contend against in endeavour to produce effect idea must be remembered obeyed ' hope not on account ' said caldigate a uttered word slightest suspicion of smile crossed face then aunt polly blazed forth in wrath 'and at moment a can laugh 'indeed did not laugh be very far from laughing aunt polly be anxious for child

half hour with thinking whether must be possible for to escape from babington on following morning before morning have resolved that let torment of day be what might must bear unless by chance might be turned out of house tragedy such a came to relieve aunt polly gave tea at breakfast with sternly forbidding look julia be a cherry cheeked a ever though very silent killing of calf be over be left to do what pleased during whole day one spark of comfort came to 'john boy ' said uncle in whisper be matter between madame ' mr babington must sometimes call wife madame when be half inclined to laugh at caldigate of course declared that there be nothing wrong squire shook head went away from appeared to caldigate that young lady father be not one of conspirator by ascertaining mind be somewhat relieved on next morning fly came for went away without kiss upon whole be contented with visit be inclined to assure that man have only to look difficulty in face that difficulty will be difficult longer chapter xvii again at puritan grange a caldigate travelled home to folking turned many thing in mind in first place have escaped to be matter of self congratulation have declared purpose in reference to cousin julia very clearly though have done so have not quarrelled utterly with family a far a young lady father be concerned brother there have be no quarrel at ill will

have accepted rejected young lady in such matter a silence certainly may be supposed to give consent though rejoiced in escape be not altogether proud of conduct in reference to friend at babington must not have be better that must have told aunt frankly that heart be engaged elsewhere lady name must have be asked lady name must not have be given might in way have prepared way for tidings must have to be communicated must finally be successful with hester bolton now such news must reach a aggravation of injury for however there must be remedy task at present before be that of obtaining

so far away during so many year under such hard circumstance must not that recommend to have not proved to be steady industrious good man of business in regard to position fortune be not such a father must desire for daughter having lost claim to folking have not regained in doing so have not shown to be something much more than merely heir to folking immediate income must of course be necessary there be money enough must ask old man for nothing report said that though old man have be generous to own son still be fond of money must have opportunity of bestowing daughter in marriage without being asked for shilling then john caldigate bethought with pride that must make proper settlement on wife without burdening estate at folking with dower of what use must be if must not get at girl to tell that loved might indeed get at father tell purpose plainly honestly thought that chance of prevailing with girl might be better than with father in such case be so often daughter who prevails with own parent after have surrendered own heart old man have looked at sternly have seemed even in moment of time to disapprove of girl well in such interview a there have not be much scope for approval be man likely to flatter that girl must fall in love with at first sight have not looked sternly at in few word have spoken voice have be very sweet of have said remembered after long interval have passed manner of saying so have be very different be almost sure that old man must be averse to though must tell personally that there be just cause for such aversion if be so must not

hesitated before must avow that young lady hand have again be offered to 'pretty well sir have good deal of archery that kind of thing be rather slow ' must think so be there nothing besides archery ' 'not much ' young lady be not troublesome ' 'perhaps le say about better sir be very kind to when be boy have nothing to say at unless be to be called on to welcome a daughter in law ' 'you will not have to do sir ' suppose john mean to marry day said father after pause then occurred to son that must have one whom must trust in matter now occupied mind that one probably might be so able to assist a father ' wish knew what idea of life be continued mr caldigate ' fear will be growing tired of place that when get back to gold mine will stay there ' 'there be fear of love place well enough ' 'if be settled here must feel more comfortable sometimes think john that if must fix must give property up to altogether go away with book into town cambridge perhaps must do a well a other 'you must never do sir must not leave folking a for have idea about own life 'be such that can tell ' 'yes will hear will expect to help at least not turn against ' 'turn against john hope may never have to do again what be that mean ' said very seriously there be usually in voice something of tone of banter subdued cynicism have caused everybody near to be afraid of even yet be habitual to now be gone be there to be new source of trouble betwixt son ' intend to ask hester bolton to be wife ' said john caldigate father who be standing in library slapped hand down upon table bolton ' there objection 'what do know about why be child behe be nearly twenty sir 'have ever seen 'yes have seen twice daresay will think very absurd have made up mind about if say be thinking about time be in australia of course will laugh at ' ' will not laugh at at john one be to say so to must laugh at yet be so have ever seen suppose have think remember little girl ' 'for beauty have never seen anybody equal to ' said lover wish 'd go over to chesterton judge for ' must know what thing meant be year since have be in house believe that mr bolton devotes to religious exercise that regard a pagan 'that be just

travel part of time might have farm must always look upon folking a home till be settled when ask what mean to do with life can only say that mean to marry hester bolton tell at babington have told nobody how be to set about ' then mr caldigate sat down began to scratch head to consider ' suppose ever go out anywhere ' ' think do except to church ' ca very well ask there can always knock at house door can call again once what if be refused then be of use knocking if man doe not get in ' after little more conversation squire be so far persuaded that assented to proposed marriage a far a assent be required did not see way to give assistance must only suggest that son must go direct to father make proposition in old fashioned legitimate fashion when be put to whether mr bolton must not certainly reject offer unless be supported by goodwill on part of own daughter acknowledged that might probably be so 'you see said squire belief in gold doe believe in gold mine 'it be that accursed

have passed since caldigate have be at chesterton have now returned from scotland to folking on following day hester be taken out to dinner at nursery a robert bolton house be called be taken out by father be quite new experiment a have never dined with of aunt cousin except at early dinner almost a child even a child not at brother robert banker after having declared that must go somewhere have persisted be not to be supposed that caldigate be on occasion invited to meet that father have a yet agreed that such meeting must be allowed a william bolton london brother mr william one of girl be down at cambridge be arranged that hester must meet relative even so much a be not settled without much opposition on part of hester mother there be nobody at house member of family old banker oldest son nicholas be not there a wife mr robert did not get on well together mr nicholas be almost a strict a mr bolton having child of own must not have sympathised at in desire to procure for hester wicked luxury of lover second son daniel joined party with wife have married too late to have grown up child wife be strict too of medium strictness tea concert occasional dinner party be with permissible a be also ribbon certain amount of costly array mr nicholas be in habit of telling mr daniel that can not touch pitch not be defiled generally intending to imply mr robert be pitch must harp on impossibility of serving god mammon thinking perhaps that brother in law robert mammon be one same daniel who must go to church a often a man on sunday have thoroughly acquired for reputation of religious man of business have own idea a to propriety expediency must neither quarrel with brother robert allow wife to quarrel with mr robert so that nicholas lived very much alone mr nicholas mr bolton might have suited other might have be congenial comfort to other elder son elder son wife have endeavoured to prevent old man second marriage there have never be thorough reconciliation since there be people who can never forgive mr nicholas have never forgiven young girl for marrying old man young girl have never forgiven opposition of elder step daughter in law to own marriage hence have come to pas that nicholas be extruded from family conclave generally consisted of daniel robert williams be away in london not often having much to do with matter too allied with dominant party being quite understood that a long a old man lived robert be must be most potent member of family when father three son be in dining room together after six seven lady have left propriety of allowing john caldigate to make hester acquaintance be fully discussed ' must not for world interfere ' said robert 'if did not think unfair to dear girl that must be shut up there altogether ' suppose that young man be in earnest asked daniel a to agreed that there must be doubt be too old family friend well to do in world able to make proper settlement not at greedy a to fortune with wife even daniel bolton thought that young man must have chance by saying be supposed to declare that question ought to be left to arbitrament of young lady old banker be unhappy ill at ease must not reconcile at once to so great change though felt that excessive fear of wife if indulged must be prejudicial to girl still did not wish to thrust out into world at once must there not be middle course must there not be day named four year hence at might be allowed to begin to judge for three son be against must not resist joint influence be therefore absolutely decided that step must be taken for enabling john caldigate to meet hester at robert bolton house ' suppose will end in marriage william bolton said to brother robert when be alone 'of course will be dearest creature in world so good to mother fool quite aware that kind of restraint to have be subjected be injustice of course will be gratified when man like tell that love be good looking fellow with fine spirit plenty of mean how on earth can do better mr b ' said william who must sometimes thus disrespectfully allude to step mother b will do can to prevent ' said robert 'but think will find hester have will of own on following day john caldigate called at bank where banker have small wainscoted back parlour appropriated to have already promised that must see young man caldigate be shown into little room soon told story be soon clever enough to perceive that telling of story be at rate permitted old father did not receive with astonishment displeasure combined a young mother have done of course made difficulty spoke of thing a being beyond bound of probability objection no stronger than may be taken a amounting almost to encouragement in such circumstance paid evident attention to caldigate said about own pecuniary affair going so far a to say that be not in condition to declare whether must give daughter fortune at on marriage 'it be quite unnecessary ' said caldigate behe will probably have something at death ' rejoined old man when may see asked caldigate in answer to mr bolton must not at first make suggestion whatsoever falling back upon old fear declaring that there must be such meeting at at last allowing that lover must discus matter with son robert may have be mistaken about young man caldigate ' banker said to wife night 'oh nicholas only say that perhaps may have be mistaken 'you be not thinking of hester ' ' said nothing about hester then perhaps may have be mistaken in opinion about young man john caldigate ' john caldigate a rode home after interview at bank almost felt that have cleared away many difficulty that by perseverance might probably be enabled to carry out dream of earlier youth chapter xx hester courage after caldigate did not allow grass to grow under foot before end of november two young people be engaged a robert bolton have said hester be of course flattered of course delighted with new joy john caldigate be just man to recommend to girl not too light not too prone to pleasure not contenting with bicycle cricket match billiards yet not wholly given to serious matter a have be among whom have hitherto passed day be one who must speak of love with soft winning word roughly yet with too much of shame faced diffidence when told how have sworn to after seeing once once when before in life be enveloped in doubt difficulty that must come home make wife thought that manly constancy of heart be almost divine of course loved with heart be in respect one made to be loved by woman then what else have ever have to love when once be arranged that must be allowed to speak to thing be done did not at once tell that be done took few short halcyon week to dally with vow heart be ready to make around knew that vow have be inwardly made who be anxious on behalf with new anxiety with new responsibility redoubled inquiry a to john caldigate how must robert bolton mr robert excuse to frightened miserable mother if at last must turn out that john caldigate be not such a have represented to be one must pick hole in although many attempt to pick hole be made question of money be put quite at rest by transference of security balance document to boltons bank l for polyeuka be accepted so that there be longer need that must go again to colony be sweet news to hester when first heard for have come to pas that have be agreed that marriage must be postponed till return that having be one concession made to mr bolton there have be many argument about hester at last told that have promised so much to mother that must of course keep promise then arrangement took form that journey be not necessary perhaps objection to journey became so strong in caldigate mind that determined to dispense with at price thus very greatly to dismay of mr bolton suddenly there came to be reason why must not be married almost at once there be attempt made at picking of hole rather many attempt must be unfair to say that be carried on by mr bolton be always ready to listen to what evil thing be said to mr nicholas in horror at general wickedness of caldigates almost reconciled to step mother even mr daniel began to fear that rash thing be being done in first place there be old story of davis newmarket robert bolton who have necessarily become advocate defender of hero generally did not care much for davis newmarket young men sow wild oat of course have be extravagant since extravagance have shown to be industrious sensible steady member of society there be money that have earned what young man have earned more in shorter time have ever be more prudent in keeping davis newmarket be easily answered by reference to bank account did ever go to newmarket now though be living so close to on matter robert bolton be very strong mr nicholas have found out that caldigate have spent certainly two sunday running at folking without going to church at a far a must learn be altogether indifferent about public worship mr bolton who must never bring to treat a son in law who be still obliged to receive taxed to face with paganism 'have religion mr caldigate ' assured that have fell into long discussion in thoroughly confused though by mean convinced that be what ought to be went with to church twice on one sunday showed that be perfectly familiar with way of place perhaps loudest complaint came from side of babington here two set of enemy joined force together who be thoroughly hostile to other mr babington declared loudly that old bolton have be errand boy in youth that father have be porter mother washerwoman must do real harm a caldigate must not have be deterred by such rumour even have be true tended to show animosity enabled mr nicholas to find out cause of babington opposition when learned that john caldigate have be engaged to cousin julia of course made most of so did mr bolton in way came to be reported not only that young man have be engaged to miss babington before went to australia also that have renewed engagement since return love do ' hester asked then told whole story a nearly a must tell with respect for cousin laughing while at aunt solicitude saying perhaps something not quite respectful a to julia red cheek green of certainly have not effect of hardening hester heart against 'the poor young lady ca help if foot be big ' said hester who be quite alive to grace of well made pair of boot although have be taught to eschew braided hair pearl gold mr babington however pushed remonstrance so far that boldly declared that man be engaged to daughter wrote to more than once declaring that be so wrote indeed very often sometimes abusing for perfidy then again imploring to return to not to defile true old english blood of caldigates with suds of washerwoman swept up refuse of porter shovel became quite eloquent in denunciation always saying that if must only come back to babington must be forgiven in day made visit to babington then there came plaintive little note from mr shand of course wished joy if be true must be true men be very fickle certainly change seemed to have be very very sudden there be word two prettily written in hand on small slip of paper 'perhaps have better send back book caldigate a read thought that must discern almost obliterated smudge of wiped up tear wrote cheerful letter to mr shand in told that though have not be absolutely engaged to marry hester bolton before started for australia consequently before have ever be at pollington yet mind have be quite made up to do so that therefore regarded a being abnormally constant rather than fickle 'and tell daughter with kindest regard added 'that hope may be allowed to keep book ' babington objection certainly made way in cambridge out at chesterton further than others for time did give hope to mr bolton mr nicholas made robert bolton shrug shoulder uneasily when heard detail of engagement in linen closet there came at one moment rumour did not count for much among boltons disturbed caldigate more than of other cause adduced for breaking off intended marriage word came that have be very intimate with certain woman on way out to melbourne woman supposed to be foreigner actress name of cettini be whispered did not know whence rumour came on one morning robert bolton half laughing still with tone of voice be earnest taxed with having a many love a lothario 'who be cettini ' asked robert bolton 'cettini said caldigate with struggle to prevent blush travel with woman 'yes at least if be name did not hear till afterwards very agreeable woman be ' 'they say that promised to marry when on board 'then lie be matter of course there be so many lie going about almost feel to be famous 'you did not see after journey 'yes did saw act at sydney very well acted have anything else to ask ' robert bolton said that have nothing else to ask seemed at moment to turn half serious mood into one be altogether jocular mention of name have be wound when anonymous letter few day afterwards reached hester herself be really unhappy hester made nothing of letter did not even show to mother at time day have be fixed for marriage already regarded lover a nearer to than father mother letter purported to be from one who have travelled with lover woman on board ship declared that everybody on board ship have thought that caldigate meant to marry woman who then so said letter called mr smith hester showed letter to caldigate then caldigate told story there have be woman who have be much ill treated because of poverty have certainly taken woman part have be clever a have thought well behaved doubt there have be certain amount of friendship have seen again in sydney where have found exercising profession a actress have be ' can not imagine dear ' said 'that must be jealous of woman certainly not of such one a ' 'nor can imagine ' said hester stoutly 'that must possibly be jealous of woman then there be nothing more said about woman smith cettini during time there be many family meeting between mr caldigate father old mr bolton be pleasant enough though not peculiarly cordial banker though have be brought to agree to marriage have not be quite reconciled to younger son have be able to convince that be duty to liberate daughter from oppression of mother over vigilance rest have followed very quickly overwhelming a be by stern necessity when once girl have come to understand that must have own way if chose to have way of own very quickly took matter into own management in way engagement became thing settled before banker have realised fact of position though must not be cordial endeavoured to be gracious to old friend mr bolton spoke word made friendship impossible asked old mr caldigate after soul when replied to le seriously than thought becoming told that be in bad way then said thing about marriage implied that must sooner see daughter in grave than married to man who be more than professing christian conversation ended in quarrel after squire must not go again to puritan grange there be indeed time entire week during mother daughter hardly spoke to other in day mr bolton continually demanded of husband that must break off match always giving a reason alleged fact that john caldigate be not true believer have be acknowledged between that if such be fact man must be unfit husband for daughter differed a to fact son have over over again declared to be faithful member of church of england not very scrupulous perhaps in performance of ceremony still believing member that father be not so one knew be not responsible for father mr bolton seemed to think that argument be good mr bolton be of opinion that to become willingly daughter in law of infidel must be to throw with one eye open in way of perdition hester through declared that nothing must now turn from man loved though be infidel ' said terror stricken mother 'nothing ' said hester bravely 'of course must try to change ' more wretched woman than mr bolton might not probably then have be found suddenly perceived to be quite powerless with child over whom dominion have hitherto be supreme felt compelled to give way to people whom with heart hated determined that nothing nothing must induce to soften feeling to son in law who be forced upon man have come have stolen from treasure one treasure that other man whom have always feared always hated robert bolton man whose craft worldliness have ever prevented from emancipating husband from flesh devil have brought about then reconciled to child wept over implored heaven to save hester tried to argue with spoke of own love appealed to mother asking whether a have now declared love must be right that must abandon man who be so good so fondly attached to then mr bolton must hide face sob put up renewed prayer to heaven that daughter might not by mean of unhappy marriage become lost to sense of grace be very miserable still prospect of marriage be never abandoned postponed day have be settled little before christmas robert boltons must allow of postponement old man be so tormented by misery of own home that be averse to delay there must be comfort for till thing must have be done mr bolton have suggested that must be put off till spring have gloomily replied that a thing have to be done sooner be done better have be settled almost from first that marriage festival must be held not at puritan grange at nursery gradually came to be understood that mr bolton must not be present at church at breakfast be in vain that hester implored mother to yield to in something to stand with at rate on step before altar 'must wish to go lie before god ' said unhappy woman must give have in world except soul life name even child to prevent be to go smile be congratulated to look a though be happy ' there be therefore very much unhappiness at grange absence of triumph even at nursery at old bank house in town where nicholas lived marriage be openly denounced even daniel though be pledged to be present be in doubt ' suppose be all right ' said mr robert to husband 'of course be all right why not 'it seems sad that event a marriage must give rise to so much ill feeling almost wish have not meddled robert ' think there be anything to regret remember what hester position must have be if father have died leaving simply to mother guardianship be bound to free from have done ' be very well still there be triumph ringing of inward marriage bell sound of whose music ought to be so pleasant to family concerned there be however two person quite firm to purpose be bride bridegroom with firmness be comparatively easy when father suggested that whole bolton family be making disagreeable must with much satisfaction reply that did not intend to marry whole bolton family having answered first letter two must ignore babington remonstrance when be cross examined a to point of doctrine must with sincerity profess to be of same creed with examiner if went to church le often than old mr bolton so did old mr bolton go le often than wife be matter a to there be rule thus trouble be comparatively light firmness might be regarded a thing of course be firm too firm amidst very different circumstance though mother prayed sobbed implored almost cursed still be firm have given word to man heart must not go back 'yes papa be too late now ' said when father coming from wife once suggested to that even yet be not too late 'of course will marry ' said to mr robert almost with indignation when mr robert on one occasion almost broke down in purpose 'dear aunt indeed indeed need not interfere ' said to mr nicholas 'if be that have called still must marry ' said to other aunt love so became astonished at young girl whom have reared up among to understand might now be opinion must have way so be decided that must be married on certain tuesday in middle of december early in morning be to be brought down to aunt house there to be decked in bridal robe thence to be taken to church then to return for bridal feast from thence to be taken off by husband to go whither might list chapter xxi wedding be sad wedding though everything within power of mr robert bolton be done to make gay there be great breakfast boltons be at last persuaded to be present except mr bolton mr nicholas a to mr nicholas be hardly even asked 'of course must be delighted to see mr nicholas if must come mr robert said to nicholas there have be such long continued absolute hostility between lady that be known to be impossible in regard to mr bolton great effort be made husband condescended to beg to consent on one occasion to appear among philistine a time came nearer became more more firm in resolution will not touch pitch not be defiled said 'you can not serve god mammon ' when old man tried to show that there be question of mammon here evaded a always did on such occasion by real simulated deficiency of consequent intelligence regarded john caldigate a being altogether unregenerate therefore man of world therefore disciple of mammon asked whether wanted to do what thought to be sinful 'it be very sinful hating people a hate son family said in wrath nicholas hate family certainly hate margaret yet fanny think that live in opposition to gospel be to belie own belief now old man be quite certain that wife did hate robert wife william must not admit in own mind distinction

indifferent thought on whole that mother must do best to be absent after what be breakfast what significance of merry meeting even for wedding there must doubt be much said much done on occasion at variance with mother feeling even enforced gaiety of dress must be distasteful to there must hardly be sufficient cause for pressing to be present on occasion in reference to church question to hester thinking be very different beamma said 'if be not there will be lasting misery to ' 'how can go there when must give so much to save from going there ' be terrible thing for mother to say to own child on eve of wedding have be now said so often a to have lost something of sting have come to be understood that mr bolton must not allow to give assent to marriage that marriage be to go on without such assent have be settled still might go to church with pray for good result feared that evil must come still might wish for good wish for pray for 'you want to be unhappy mamma ' 'want said mother can

otherwise there must be upon conscience weight of sin did not know that conviction on rested with such confidence have come in truth from injured pride have settled in mind because have be beaten in endeavour to prevent daughter marriage be not aware that regarded john caldigate a goat a one who beyond doubt be goat simply because john caldigate have have way while have be debarred from hers such doubt be case yet who can deny praise for fidelity to own conviction when read of who have massacred tortured opponent in religion have boiled alive unfortunate who have differed from a to meaning of unintelligible word two have vigorously torn entrails out of who have be pious with piety different from own how will dare to say that must be punished for fidelity mr bolton spent much of afternoon with knee on hard board thinking that hassock must have taken something from sanctity of action wrestling for child in prayer told that prayer have be heard got up more than ever assured that must not touch pitch lest must be defiled let pray for what will with earnestness though be for destruction of half of world be sure to think that prayer have be heard chapter xxiii new heir thing went on smoothly at folking with apparent smoothness for three month during john caldigate surprised friend enemy by exemplary manner in fulfilled duty a parish squire be put on commission be in way to become most active justice of peace in part made intimate with tenant be almost worshipped by mr ralph holt nearest neighbour to whose judgment submitted in agricultural matter shot little moderately having inclination to foster what be called head of game went to church very regularly having renewed intimacy with mr bromley parson gentleman who have unfortunately found necessary to quarrel with old squire because old squire have be so manifestly pagan there have be unhappiness in parish on head especially unhappiness to mr bromley who be good man mr caldigate must be what called pagan have be represented by mr bromley to friend a great misfortune especially misfortune to squire must have ignored that in regard to social life so mr bromley said when discussing matter if pagan must have desisted from arguing subject when mr caldigate insisted on parson owning unreasonableness of own belief called upon to confess to be either fool hypocrite then parson found constrained to drop further intercourse 'it be way with priest said old squire triumphantly to first man must get to hear 'the moment disagree with become enemy at once must straightway kill if have power probably did not know how very disagreeable have made to poor clergyman now matter be on much better footing parish rejoiced new squire be seen in pew sunday morning often entertained parson at house rumour of change be indeed so great that more than truth reached ear of of boltons advantage be taken of by who desired to prove to mr bolton that man be not goat what more must have went regularly to morning evening service here be that rumour exaggerated hero virtue did duty a country gentleman be kind to wife daniel who be lukewarm people thought that mr bolton be bound to give way mr robert declared among friend that poor woman be becoming mad from religion old banker be driven very hard for reply when robert asked whether son in law a john caldigate ought to be kept at arm length old man did in truth hate name of john caldigate regretted bitterly indiscretion of day when spendthrift have be admitted within gate though have agreed to marriage partly from sense of duty to child partly under influence of son have since be subject to wife for nine ten month have not be able to prevail against in action earthly power must stop tongue now when new praise be dinned into ear when did convince that a far a worldly matter went son in law be likely to become prosperous respected gentleman must fain have let question of hostility drop there need not have be much intercourse between puritan grange folking then also there need be quarrel be desirous that caldigate must be allowed to come to house that even visit of ceremony must be made to folking mr bolton must have nothing to do with such half friendship in time be coming must be everything nothing to daughter must not be brought to think that one who have be so manifestly goat must cease to be goat so suddenly in other word must not soften heart towards man who have conquered therefore when time came for baby to be born there have be reconciliation between puritan grange folking mr babington have be somewhat le stern immediately on return of married couple to own home have still be full of wrath have predicted kind of evil when heard that tongue be saying all good thing of nephew of hers when be reminded by husband that blood be thicker than water when reflected that be duty of christian to forgive injury wrote to sinner a follows 'babington hall november dear john be here desirous that bygone must be bygone be willing to forgive though may not perhaps be able to forget be quite of opinion that resentment must not be lasting let have be ever so well justified by circumstance at first 'your uncle

dear julia be about to settle most advantageously in life be engaged to marry rev augustus smirkie rector of plum cum pippin near woodbridge in county like mr smirkie very much indeed think julia have be most fortunate in choice ' word be underscored doubly by way of showing how very much superior be mr augustus smirkie to mr john caldigate ' may perhaps a well mention to avoid anything disagreeable at present that julia be at time staying with mr smirkie mother at ipswich affectionate aunt babington ' caldigate be at first inclined to send in answer to letter reply must not have be agreeable to aunt be talked into better state of mind by wife 'telling that will forgive question be whether will forgive 'let that be question said wife do forgive want to come round of course have to make best of for tell from that will be delighted to see whenever chooses to come ' 'poor julia ' said caldigate laughing course think so john that be natural enough perhaps think so too what have to do with ' be rather unfortunate that know so much about mr smirkie be fifty year old have five child by former wife ' see why must be good husband for ' 'and plum cum pippin be le than l year poor

shoot covert stayed for one night visit be not very successful aunt polly must talk of glory of plum cum pippin rectory in manner implied that dear julia escape from fate once threatened have be quite providential when alluded a did must not have done to young smirkies spoke with almost ecstatic enthusiasm of 'dear child caldigate knowing while that eldest child must be at least sixteen then though

foolish to know what be good for hint be given that boltons short time since have not be aristocratic whereas be proved to from burke landed gentry that smirkies have be established in suffolk ever since cromwell time doubt land have gone still there have be smirkies did get on with ' father asked a passed home through cambridge same a usual of course in such family son in law elect be more thought of than useless married man snubbed ' 'aunt polly snubbed little think have quite so good place for shooting a in old day be to be expected quite agree with aunt polly that family quarrel be foolish thing ' be not so sure people doom to infinity of annoyance because wo avoid society of disagreeable people know have ever quarrelled with one have never intended to do so when find that man woman be not sympathetic think better to keep out of way be squire account of who knew in neighbourhood be accustomed to say that have quarrelled with everybody about in december baby be born just twelve month after marriage there be great demonstration of joy ringing of bell in parish of utterden netherden baby be boy be a ought to be john caldigate when came to look at position to understand feeling of around be astonished to find how strong be feeling in own favour how thoroughly tenant have be outraged by idea that property might be made over to more distant member of family what be to who lived in house at folking why must have be solicitous in matter have lease there be adequate reason for supposing one caldigate must be more pleasant in dealing with than yet be evident to now that birth of real heir at squire house with fair prospect that acre must descend in right line be regarded by with almost superstitious satisfaction bell be rung a though church tower be going to be pulled down there be not farmer farmer wife who did not come to door of folking to ask how young mother baby be doing 'this be a must be squoire ' said ralph holt who be going about in sunday clothes a though be day much too sacred for muck work have caught hold of caldigate in stable yard be now walking with down towards ferry 'yes be doing very well tell ' said newly made father course will do well why not healthy lass like if may make so free there ai nothing like having strong young with town bred air about never doubted a must do well can tell from very walk what sort of mother will be

much always what mean be be glad have come back from out o ' way part have to go there holt ' know much about sir mean nothing about ' 'to tell truth friend must not have done very well here unless have be able to top dress english acre with little australian gold ' enough squoire like enough be making bold to say nothing about for young gentleman to go out while then to come back be very well most of 'em doe when there be talk a wer to come back that master george be to take place why then did seem a thing be very wrong ' george might have be quite a good a 'it be proper thing squoire be straight if have never ' be sir if lord almighty have taken a did others god bless 'em nobody must have have right to say nothing a be to fore must have be straight one must have thought straight ' instigated by john caldigate looked good deal into matter day began to feel that having be born squire of folking have perhaps no right to deal with otherwise then various thought passed through mind a to other dealing have taken place how great have be chance against being squire of folking when started with dick shand to look for australian gold how little have be chance of calling hester bolton wife when be pledging word to mr smith on board goldfinder now have come round to just a must have have there be wife up stair in big bed room with baby wife a to whom have made that romantic resolution when have hardly spoken to there have be bell ringing tenant congratulating everything have be pleasant father who have so scorned who in day of davis newmarket have be so well justified in scorning be now closest friend thinking of told that have certainly received better thing than have deserved day two after birth of baby mr robert came out to see new prodigy on following day mr daniel mr robert be of course very friendly disposed to be in respect good sister in law hester great grief be in regard to mother be steadfast enough in resolution to stand in respect by husband if there must be separation idea of separation robbed of much of happiness mr robert be aware that great effort be being made with mr bolton young squire respectability be so great conduct so good that not only boltons neighbour around who knew aught of bolton affair be loud in denouncing woman for turning up nose at son in law great object be to induce to say that must allow caldigate to enter house at chesterton 'you know never see now ' said mr robert `` m too much of sinner to think of entering gate laugh at margaret ' said hester ' mean to laugh at be simply truth robert have made up mind that be better for must not put in way ' how different must be for ' 'of course be be dreadful to think that must be so prejudiced what can do dear if will go on persevering will of course have to give way ' 'they spoken of be daniel old mr bolton latterly nicholas of whom be of opinion that separation of mother from daughter be very dreadful especially when came to be understood that squire of folking went regularly to parish church on next day mr daniel came out though be much le liked by hester than younger sister in law brought more comfortable tidings have be at grange day two before mr bolton have almost consented to say that must see john caldigate 'you must be in hurry know dear ' said mr daniel 'but have john done that there must be question about ' suppose be little just little what call fast once ' 'he got into debt when be boy ' said wife then paid off everything great deal more by own industry seems to that everybody ought to be proud of ' ' think mother be proud of dear ' 'poor mamma hope will go when be told to do so 'john of course will go if ask there be nothing must do to make happy really when talk to about at be ashamed of poor mamma ' result of visit be however very comforting mr daniel have seen mr bolton have be witness to fact that mr bolton have mitigated sternness of denial when asked to receive son in law at puritan grange be said mr daniel settled opinion of bolton family that in course of month so woman must be induced to give way under pressure put upon by family generally chapter xxiv news from gold mine be said at beginning of last chapter thing have gone on smoothly with apparent smoothness at folking since return of caldigates from wedding tour there have in truth be small cloud in folking heaven over beyond babington haze be now vanishing storm at chesterton a to hope be entertained that must clear away will perhaps be remembered that caldigate offer for sale of interest in polueuka mine have be suddenly accepted by certain enterprising person in australia that money have be absolutely forthcoming have be in way fortunate a have be saved from trouble of journey to colony money matter have be put on footing a to make altogether comfortable just when heard that money have be lodged to account when money actually have be so paid received telegram from mr crinkett begging that matter might be for time postponed of course be out of question term have be accepted might have gone for very little have not money be forthcoming cash be positively in hand who ever heard of man 'postponing ' arrangement in such circumstance let do what might with polyeuka be safe telegraphed back to say that there must be no postponement a far a be concerned whole thing be settled then there came multiplicity of telegram very costly to crinkett interest costly also troublesome to for though matter be so pleasantly settled a far a be concerned must not altogether ignore plaint be made to then there came very long letter long loud letter not only from crinkett from others telling that polyeuka gold have come to end lode disappearing altogether a lode sometimes do disappear fact be that crinkett company asked to have back money offering polyeuka mine in entirety if chose to accept john caldigate though in england must be be liberal gentleman have be long enough in australia to know that if meant to hold own among such men a mr crinkett must make best of such turn of fortune a chance might give under circumstance must crinkett have be generous to have polyeuka suddenly become more prolific in precious metal than mine in colony crinkett company must have laughed at claim made by for further payment when bargain have be fairly made party must make best of be therefore very decided in refusal to make restitution though be at same time profuse in expression of sorrow then there came threat not from crinkett from mr euphemia smith letter be not signed euphemia smith euphemia caldigate letter be a follows 'in spite of treachery to wish to ruin to destroy young wife by proving in england to have be married to at ahalala will do so unless assent to term crinkett have proposed be in partnership in matter with two three others be willing to let have gone before be forgotten if have mean given to make start can not feel that money have received be fairly yours can hardly think must wish to become rich by taking from have earned after so many hardship if will do a propose have better send out agent on paying money will not only have marriage certificate will stand by see married to crinkett who be now widower after of course can make claim to if will not do crinkett other man who be present at marriage anne young who have be with ever since will go at once to england law must take course ' have scruple in demanding a owe so much more 'allan wesleyan who married have gone out of colony one know where send copy of certificate four of who be there be still together there be others who be at ahalala at time who remember marriage well dick shand be not in chapel dick knew about there be quite plenty of evidence beend back by wire word what will do let agent come over a soon a possible 'euphemia caldigate ' however true however false allegation made in above letter may have be for time stunned greatly letter reached about month before birth of son for day two disturbed greatly did not show to wife wandered about place alone thinking whether must take notice of what notice at last resolved that must take letter to brother in law robert ask attorney advice 'how much of be true ' demanded robert when read letter twice from beginning to end ' good deal ' said caldigate 'as much a may be with exception be never married to woman ' suppose not that ' robert bolton a spoke be very grave did not at first seem disposed to be angry 'have not better tell everything do think ' 'it be for purpose have come brought letter understand about money suppose so ' 'there can be reason why must return penny of ' 'certainly not now certainly must not return under threat even though woman must be starving there can be circumstance a spoke dashed hand down upon table circumstance in man

be now duty to give best advice in power to brother in law manner to other be changed be evident that robert did not quite believe caldigate told evident also caldigate resented want of confidence still knew that must not do without other connection be too firm too close to be shaken off therefore though tone be hardly friendly still consulted a to what must be done be at last decided that two message must be sent by caldigate one to crinkett other to mr smith in same word money will be sent on behalf of polyeuka mine that must be letter robert bolton thought must be inexpedient then parted

when telling story to robert bolton to declare that annoyance must be one that must bear easily still for hour after that have be unhappy if by sacrificing considerable sum of money even large sum of money say ten thousand pound must at moment have insured silence of crinkett woman must have paid money knew world well enough to be aware that must insure nothing by such sacrifice must defy claimant then if chose to come to england with story must bear a best must who saw did not know that aught ailed robert bolton spoke word of matter to one at cambridge robert bolton thought very much of so much that on following day ran up to london on purpose to discus matter with brother william how must be with what must be duty if statement made by woman must turn out to be true what security have after story told by caldigate that there have be no marriage by own showing have lived with woman have promised to marry have acknowledged promise in hearing of clergyman have be aware that have called by name then have given money to go away have be own story 'do believe ' said to brother william 'yes do in first place though can understand from antecedent from surroundings at time that must

truth believe that caldigate have be guilty of so terrible crime probability be against still be possible then after much deliberation be decided that agent must be sent out by to new south wale to learn truth a far a must be learned to bring back evidence might be collected without making too much noise in collection of then there arose question whether caldigate must be told of be decided that must be done at joint expense of two brother without knowledge of hester husband chapter xxv baby sponsor 'be there anything wrong between robert ' hester asked question of husband one morning in

robert bolton indeed have there be much conversation between on other matter robert have asked two three time whether have received reply by wire such message have come of course answered brother in law question accordingly have answered almost with look of offence attorney manner tone seemed to to convey reproach be determined that none of boltons must have liberty to find fault with have be suggested week since before baby be born that effort must be made to induce mr bolton to act a godmother since among name of many other relative friend of uncle babington robert bolton have be proposed hester have be particularly anxious that brother must be asked because a so often said to husband have always be firm friend in matter of marriage now when question be to be settled john

adding to horror must feel by pausing making much of thing yet must not tell a though be light matter if must have declared at once at first with smile on face then expressing disgust at woman falsehood must have be better 'that woman have written letter in declares to be wife ' 'your wife john wife ' exclamation came from almost with shriek a jumped up from arm for moment stood before

there be reason why detail robert have elicited by question must be repeated to promise of marriage interference of wesleyan minister use made of name of said nothing have now be told that to have be very dreadful be not surprised that brother must have be offended when heard same sad story of course have at once pardoned old offence young wife when be sure of husband will readily forgive offence committed before marriage will almost be thankful for confidence placed in when offence be confessed must understand that brother must not be thankful must naturally exaggerate in own mind horror must

further question prayer be addressed to lady of puritan grange became subject of much debate of great consideration may say also of lengthened prayer to mr bolton position of godmother implied much of old sacred responsibility be formerly attached to robert bolton like other godfather godmother of day have altogether ignored have be already partly brought round nearly persuaded in regard to acceptance of john caldigate a son in law did not occur to to do other than hate how be possible that woman must do other than hate man who have altogether got better of a to very marrow of life very apple of eye be alive to duty towards daughter when be told that man be honest in dealing well to do in world professing christian who be constant in parish church did not know how to maintain opinion that in spite of be unregenerate castaway therefore although be determined still to hate have almost made up mind to enter house with idea wrote long letter to hester in promised to have taken out to folking in order that might be present a godmother at baby baptism must lunch at folking must return to chesterton before dinner even be great thing gained then be arranged that daniel bolton must

differ probably accurately know may be altered at time a may please let law be what will be quite possible after what have told that may bring up evidence must find very difficult to refute think will

angry with man 'if plea let be so said to ' can do in world without then thought of threat when attorney have said that must remove sister bemove by heaven have stick in hand a went struck angrily against post remove wife boltons in cambridgeshire must not put hand upon unless by leave for moment anger supported after while gave way to old feeling of discomfort pervaded always be wife nobody must touch nevertheless might find difficult a robert bolton have said to prove that other woman be not wife robert bolton office be in small street close to pembroke college when came out of have intended to walk direct through trumpington street trinity street to chesterton found necessary to compose so to arrange thought that might be able to answer such foolish question a mr bolton must probably ask without being flurried be almost sure that have heard nothing of woman did not suspect robert bolton of treachery in respect must probably talk to about iniquity of past life generally must be prepared to answer be incumbent upon to shake off before reached chesterton that mixture of alarm anger at present dominated with object instead of going straight along street turned into quadrangle of king college passing through garden over bridge wandered for while slowly under tree at back of college accused of lack of manliness in allowed to be thus cowed did not know that such threat a be common be not just what might have be expected from one a crinkett when crinkett be driven to desperation by failing speculation a thought of woman shook head looking down upon ground woman have at one time be very dear to be clearly now duty to go on a though there be such woman a euphemia smith such man a thomas crinkett a for robert bolton must henceforth treat a though anger suspicion be unworthy of notice if man must choose of own accord to reassume old friendly relation well good overture must come from caldigate if anger suspicion endured why then caldigate must do very well without robert bolton a made resolution turned in at little gate opening into corner of st john garden with object of passing through college back into street of town be not quite nearest way loved old building tree river even in winter still be winter being now middle of february a happened air be dry mild sun be shining still be surprised at time of year to see elderly man apparently asleep on one of bench be placed close to path there be asleep with two hand on stick head bent forward over stick be impossible not to look at man sleeping there in way caldigate must hardly have looked must hardly have dared to look must have anticipated what must see elderly man be thomas crinkett a passed be quite sure that man be thomas crinkett when have gone on dozen yard paused for moment to consider what must do dozen different thought passed through mind in moment of time why be man there why indeed must have come to england except with view of prosecuting demand woman have made presence even in england be sufficient to declare that battle must have to be fought to cambridge must have come with other object than of beginning attack at once then have already commenced work have not at rate be to robert bolton to whom one knowing family must have first referred why be sleeping there why be not now at work upon project again must be better at present moment that must pas by man a though have not seen must go back ask purpose a thought passed through mind stayed step for moment on pathway looked round man have moved position be now sitting with head turned away evidently not asleep then occurred to caldigate crinkett slumber have be only pretence that man have seen recognised at moment have not chosen to make known occurred to also that in matter of such importance a must hing on spur of moment nothing without consideration word spoken to crinkett word without consideration might be fatal to so passed on having stood upon path hardly more than second two before have got up to new building of st john cold sweat have come out over be conscious of conscious also that for time be so confounded by apparition of enemy a to be unable to bring mind to work properly on subject do worst kept on saying to 'let do worst knew that brave word though spoken only to be mere braggadocio doubt man must do worst very bad must be to at moment be so cowed by fear that must have given fortune to have secured woman silence man how much better must have be have acceded to man first demand a to restitution of portion of sum paid for polyeuka before woman name have be brought into matter at reflection such a be now useless must do something be for wife sake assured for wife sake that allowed to be made thus miserable by presence of wretched creature what

not be made public without overwhelming with sorrow own father too who have surrendered estate to must know father hitherto have not heard name of mr smith have be told only of crinkett dishonest success dishonest failure when caldigate have spoken of crinkett to father have done so with triumph a of man whom have weighed measured made use of whose fraud cunning have conquered by own honesty better knowledge now must no longer weigh measure make use of crinkett crinkett have be joke to in talking with father crinkett be joke now while walking through college quad be half stupefied by confusion be aware that such be condition going out under gate paused for moment shook must at rate summon own power to aid at moment resolve what must do however bad might be there be better course worse if allowed confusion to master must probably be betrayed into worse course now at moment in what way must become to act drew together shaking head shoulder so a to shake off weakness pressing foot for moment on earth so a to convince of own firmness then resolved be on way out to see mother in law thought that nothing now must be gained by going to chesterton be not impossible that crinkett might have be there if so man must have told something of story wife mother be last person in world whom under such circumstance must hope to satisfy must tell lie to one must at least conceal nothing of thing a occurred now must not allow to be first told by crinkett that two have seen other in garden must not declare to mr bolton for present le saw of mr bolton better must come to christening to morrow unless indeed crinkett have already told enough to induce to change mind after intimacy with house at chesterton have better be postponed till have be settled how much must have to be endured before robert bolton have almost threatened to take wife away from one must take wife away from unless indeed law be to say that be not wife how must be with if under influence of family

taught to think possible that have be betrayed must not then want to go from must not be probable that must doubt when must be told that woman have be called by husband name in australia when must be unable to deny that have admitted at least have not contradicted appellation on sudden when turned away from street leading to chesterton a came out of college resolved that must at once go back to robert man be offensive suspicious willed nevertheless good service if must be secured must be important for wife sake a caldigate said to for wife sake must bear much have come to tell something have occurred since be here just now ' said caldigate meeting brother in law at door of office 'must mind coming back ' ' be rather in hurry 'it be of importance have better hear ' said caldigate leading way imperiously to inner room 'it be for sister sake that man crinkett be in cambridge ' cambridge ' saw just now spoke to ' attorney asked 'no passed know even whether recognised be here in cambridge ' 'and woman have told know have not come here for nothing ' 'probably not ' said attorney with scornful smile will hear of before long 'of course will have come to now to ask question must put case at once into lawyer hand crinkett doubt will commit perjury must undergo annoyance expense of proving to be perjurer probably be here also will be ready to commit perjury of course must have lawyer will act for ' ' will act for sister ' sister be one be obliged therefore to ask again whether will act for of course must prefer though be think hard to in matter can trust implicitly will be infinitely better for hester that must be so must have lawyer 'and so must 'hers mine must be same a to will not admit question can undertake to fight matter on behalf on hers if feel absolutely hostile to have better decline for can not understand why there must be such hostility caldigate have so far conquered own feeling of abasement a to be able to say with determined face looking straight into attorney eye at rate without sign of fear want thinking about ' said robert bolton morrow baby be to be christened for hester sake will endeavour to put matter aside on wednesday must know 'on wednesday morning will answer question what if man come to in meantime 'listen to speak to just a seems good to know everything that there be to tell may therefore know whether lie speaks

now at moment tell wife that man have come man who must doubtless work such terrible misery be very strong have gone through whole little event of baby birth quite a well a must be expected have be just what friend might have wished to be that blow have fallen upon that ill news have wounded must now have be triumphant mother be at last coming to husband be that husband must be baby be to thinking sweeter brighter more satisfactory than other baby ever have be first tidings have be told to have seen letter signed 'euphemia caldigate ' of course be ill at ease knowing how vexatious matter be to husband have spoken of seldom having asked question now again when matter pressed too severely on mind understood reticence suffering suffering must of course be increased must know before long that crinkett probably woman also be in neighbourhood must not tell now when be preparing baby for ceremony in church bell be rung baby be prepared mr bolton came out to folking according to promise though robert be not there many of boltons be present a be also uncle babington have come over on preceding evening making on occasion first journey to folking since wife sister have died

then for first time be brought into contact with babington grandeur party have be almost gay old squire having taken delight in what thought to be absurdity of brother in law mr babington be man who be joyous on most occasion always gay on occasion a have praised mother praised baby praised house of folking generally graciously declaring that wife looked forward to pleasure of making acquaintance with new niece till old mr caldigate have be delighted with manifestation of condescension 'folking be poor place ' said 'but babington be really country house ' 'yes replied other squire much gratified 'babington be what may call really good country house have to laugh very hard at before must offend uncle babington in john caldigate be obliged to assist knowing time feeling time that

what be coming must almost crush must always bear bravely when others be present on morning before went to church when bell be ringing old mr bolton came in carriage with wife from cambridge of course condescended to give hand to son in law did with look be full of bitterness did not probably intend to be specially bitter bitterness of expression be common to be taken however at once up to baby

usually occupied by parish boy at end of row of appropriated seat near to door le than dozen yard from at other side of way leading up church stood font so that stranger be almost close to caldigate

on sunday must be observed by in utterden church how much then at ceremony a rule none friend attend crinkett be looking on with eye leaning forward over stick watching closely caldigate have taken in even in moment other man be sitting back gazing at nothing a though matter to be indifferent caldigate must understand man be there simply to act to speak when might be wanted a ceremony be completed john caldigate stood by played with proper word action part of young father one standing there must see by face that have be struck violently that have for few moment be almost unable to stand be aware that cold sweat have broken out over a before though leaned over baby lying in mother arm kissed smiled on young mother did so a great actor will carry out part before public when nearly sinking to ground from sudden suffering what must be right that must do now now now one there have heard of crinkett except wife even have idea that man of whom have heard be in england must speak to man must endeavour to pas out of church a though have not recognised must trust even to make endeavour when must have turned round when must find face to face with man then what must say how must act if man

have in something of courage a little crowd prepared to move from font two men got up stood in place caldigate took opportunity to say word to mr bromley before turned round so that might yet pause before decided at moment resolved that must recognise enemy treat with courtesy of old friendship must be bad to do at moment thought that in way might best prepare for future crinkett have appealed to for money crinkett have said nothing to about euphemia smith man have not a yet accused of bigamy accusation have come from still might be that have used crinkett name wrongfully at rate thought that when clap of thunder must have come must be better for not to have repudiated man with whom must then be known that relation have once be so intimate addressed therefore at once to old associate

bos here ' 'yes be bos ' 'and deuced good time seem to have of ' said crinkett `` ve nothing to complain of ' replied caldigate feeling at moment to be most miserable creature in existence be fearful work work so cruel that physical strength hardly enabled to support already repented present conduct telling that must have be better to have treated men from first a spy enemy though in truth conduct have probably be wisest must have adopted at last have men inside hall door introducing hurriedly to father left that might rush up to wife bedroom nurse be there mother at moment only looked at be too wise to speak to before at last succeeded in making opportunity of being alone with husband stay here nurse will be back directly mamma ' then took across passage into own dressing room 'who be

repel to answer only on one ground have received from robert bolton decided opinion under circumstance be to give money to person be to be guilty of weakness must have delivered over into hand not only did put implicit trust in sagacity of robert bolton knew enough of world opinion on matter to be aware that man who have allowed to be frightened out of money be supposed to have acknowledged terrible delinquency have be very clear in mind when letter came from euphemia smith that must not now make rebate till attack have come might have be open to to be generous not now yet when man spoke of own loss reminded of wealth when crinkett threw in teeth that by happy chance have feathered nest with spoil taken from wretched man then wished that be in power to give back something 'be said a threat asked looking round on companion resolving that must be brave a take squire want to threaten nothing ' 'because if do 'd better go do what have to do away from here ' be so rough now with old pal wo do good by being rough be rough to when came to polyeuka hall without very much in pocket ' be untrue for crinkett have be rough caldigate pocket have be full of money there must be no good got

matter a to have in way of business received intelligence of own from colony be aware that have be singularly lucky a to circumstance time of sale there have be nothing bemart about in colony who understood matter thought at time that be making sacrifice of own interest by term proposed have thought so have be willing to make in order that might rid of further trouble have believed that machinery plant attached to mine have be nearly worth money have be quite certain that crinkett when making bargain have considered to be in luck way such property a well knew be by nature precarious liable to sudden change have be fortunate purchaser have be reverse of that have doubt though probably man have exaggerated own misfortune when have be given to understand how bad have be fate of old companion of in matter with feeling of liberal gentleman be anxious to share with loss have crinkett come to explaining that now explained without interference from euphemia smith must have be anxious to do much now how must do anything now at disbelieve what tell about mine said 'and yet wo do anything for ai above taking money seeing starve that when have got everything round here like estated

to be simply piteous thought that might even yet have suggested compromise be impossible when be told that worse than threat be in store for be silent for moment thinking whether must not be better for to rush into matter of euphemia smith up to time have absolute knowledge that crinkett be aware of letter have be written doubt that in speaking of 'another a being joined with adamson have intended that euphemia smith must be understood till name have be mentioned must not bring to mention must not bring to betray fear must become evident if spoke of woman think have better go to lawyer ' said 'we want lawyering plunder be yours doubt whether will have so much law on side in other matter be question crinkett did not in least understand state of companion mind to crinkett appeared that caldigate be simply anxious to save money ' know that can say anything else to just at present bargain be fair bargain have ground for claim come to with mysterious threat 'you understand said

give way know that if will go to brother in law will get to see ' 'd brother in law ai brother in law no more than be ' now sword have be drawn battle have be declared 'after that ' said caldigate walking on in front ' will decline to speak to further went back through farmyard at quick pace while crinkett kept up with still few step behind in front of house found jack adamson who in obedience to friend suggestion have be sitting anywhere about place `` m blowed if mean to stick to lump be robbed of ' said crinkett in loud voice 'he do do then know what have got to be after ' `` ve come

to have kept straight course now now surely must be overwhelmed then how easy must have be have be more careful at beginning of trouble to have bought wretch off have be now acknowledged too peremptory in first refusal to refund portion of money to crinkett application have indeed be made without proof a to condition of mine have since reached have distrusted crinkett crinkett have known to be man not to be trusted yet even after receiving letter from euphemia smith matter might have be arranged when have first become assured that new polyeuka company have failed must have made offer even though euphemia smith have then commenced threat with skill might not have done on very day might not have made man understand that if must base claim simply on loss make openly on ground then claim must be considered now be too late thunderbolt have fallen what must do first robert bolton have promised to tell on morrow whether must act for a lawyer felt sure now that brother in law must

of after not quite readily baby be once more trusted to on following morning caldigate rode into town a put horse up at inn felt that very ostler have heard story a walked along street seemed to that everyone met knew about robert bolton must of course have heard nevertheless walked boldly into attorney office fault at time be in being too bold in manner in carrying somewhat too erect in assuming too much confidence in eye mouth to act part perfectly requires consummate actor there be phase in life in acting be absolutely demanded man can not always be at ease must never seem to be discomfited for petty trouble amount of acting necessary be so common that habit have made almost natural when great sorrow come be hard not to show harder still not to seem to hide when entered private room found that old man be there with son shook hand of course with of then stood moment silent to hear how must address a also be silent be compelled to speak ' hope got home all right sir yesterday mr bolton ' old man did not answer turned face round to son ' hear that have that man crinkett out at folking yesterday ' said robert 'he be there certainly to sorrow 'and with 'yes with whom have also known at nobble 'and be brought in to breakfast ' 'yes 'and afterwards declared that have married wife out there in colony 'that also be true ' 'they have be with father morning ' be very very sorry sir ' said caldigate turning to old man 'that must have be troubled in so disagreeable business 'now caldigate will tell what propose ' be still attorney who be speaking for old man have not a yet opened mouth since son in law have entered room can think be doubt that woman intends to bring accusation of bigamy against ' behe be threatening to do think very improbable that will be fool enough to make attempt 'from what have heard feel sure that attempt will be made deposition in fact will be made before magistrate day week crinkett woman have be with mayor morning have be told way in must proceed ' caldigate when heard felt that be trembling looked into speaker face without allowing eye to turn to right left ' be not going to say anything now about case indeed a know nothing can say nothing must provide with lawyer 'you will not act for ' 'certainly not must act for sister now what propose what father proposes be that will return to home at puritan grange while question be being decided ' 'certainly not ' said husband must ' said old man speaking for first time will compel ' said attorney how will compel be wife ' have to be proved public opinion will compel if nothing else can not make prisoner of 'oh will go if wish will have free access to bring mother bring carriage will dispose of a plea god forbid must keep though be wife against will ' ' be sure will do a friend will advise when hears story said attorney have heard story know be sure that will not stir foot ' said husband know nothing about ' said turning to wife half brother then again turned to old man sir doubt be well aware that can be firm to purpose nothing death must take away from if be to carry by force to chesterton must return to folking on foot before day be over know what be to be wife be not bit afraid of leaving ' be able to say with high spirit assured voice 'it be quite out of question that must stay with while be going on ' 'of course must come away ' said banker not looking at man whom now hated a thoroughly a did wife 'consult own friend let consult hers will tell so ask mr babington ask own father will ask one ' 'think what position will be world will at least doubt whether be wife not ' 'there be one person who will not doubt be ' havery good if be so will be comfort to doubt for sake while other people doubt will not be better that must be with father mother look at round ' think must be better that must be with ' replied caldigate 'even though former marriage with other woman be proved ' ' will not presume that to be possible though jury must so decide decision must be wrong such error must not effect will not think of thing ' 'and perceive that trouble will be lighter in father house than in yours ' 'certainly not to be away from own house must be such trouble to that must not endure unless restrained by force ' press must go can not see that must be better for name ' name be name ' said clenching fist in violence name be hers can have good name distinct from name at be part parcel of very self under circumstance will consent that will be torn away from word from human being will persuade to unless must come from ' 'we can make ' said old man 'no doubt must get order from court said attorney thinking that anything might be fairly said in such emergency a 'but will be better that must come of own accord by direction be aware how probable be that may be in prison within day two ' to caldigate made answer turned round to leave room paused moment at doorway to think whether word two might not be said in behalf of wife seemed hard to hard rather upon that wide stretching solid support of family must be taken away from at crisis a present knew enmity to must understand old enmity that have now be newly engendered one other be natural have succeeded in getting girl away from parent in opposition to father mother now almost within first year of marriage have be brought to terrible misery by mean of disreputable people with whom have be closely connected be not natural that robert bolton must turn against if hester have be sister there have come interloper what must have felt be not duty to be gentle to give way if by giving way must lessen evil have occasioned ' be sorry to have to leave presence like said turning back to mr bolton did ever come into presence ' have be done be done even if must give back can not for better for worse be mine can not make otherwise now understand when ask that will come back to refuse on own account though must be miserable indeed be to leave will not even ask to stay know will stay though must try to drive out must not go good bye sir ' old man only shook head bye robert 'good bye have better get lawyer a soon a can if know one in london must send for if not mr seely here be a good man a can have be friend of mine be careful attorney who understands business ' then caldigate left room with intention of going at once to mr seely standing patiently at door just within doorway of house met tall man in dark plain clothes whom at once knew to be policeman man who be aware that caldigate be county magistrate civilly touched hat then with few whispered word expressed opinion that hero have better go with to mayor office have warrant yes have warrant thought that probably might not be necessary for to show ' will go with of course ' said caldigate ' suppose be on allegation of man named crinkett ' ' lady sir think ' said policeman mr smith ' called caldigate sir ' said policeman then went together without further word to mayor court from thence before heard accusation made against sent for father for mr seely be taken through to private room thither came at once mayor magistrate of town with whom be acquainted 'this be very sad business mr caldigate '

of evidence can use policeman tell woman be here too ' 'oh yes be here have made deposition indeed there be two men woman who declare that be present at marriage ' then after further conversation accuser be brought into room before so that deposition might be read to woman be closely veiled so that must not see feature of face knew figure well remembered other woman who have be half companion

have determined among at expense to family truth must be ascertained to old banker have assented so far be right doubt if daughter sister be not in truth wife if by grossest by most cruel ill usage have be lured to ruin for there must be remedy in world must be better that fact must be known at once so that life might be pure though must never again be bright be strange that with boltons there be desire anxiety to prove man guilt rather than innocence mr bolton have always regarded a guilty man though guilty of knew not what have always predicted misery from marriage so distasteful to husband though have be brought to oppose to sanction marriage have from moment in sanction be given be induced by influence to reject robert bolton when charge be first made when letter from woman be first shown to have become aware that have made mistake in allowing trouble to come upon family then a from point to point evidence have be opened out to have gradually convinced that son in law brother in law whom have a be forced into family be bigamist there be present to intense desire to prove man guilt be startling to around who heard anything of matter up to time bolton telegram caldigate telegram have elicited two fact allan wesleyan minister have gone to fiji island have there died that at nobble who have last known dick shand address now knew no longer caldigate have gone to pollington have there ascertained that tidings have be received from dick by of shand family for last twelve month have be decided that trial must be postponed at rate till summer assize must be

removed then mother must declare purpose in meantime allusion to intended return to folking must be accepted listened to with false assent be very grievous so be arranged a soon a hester be in house mother felt how much better must have be to declare to daughter at once that be prisoner be then too late to alter proposed plan very nearly came to pas that hester left mother on morning of arrival have determined to be cautious reticent forbearing difference between be so vital that reticence be impossible at first there be profusion of natural tear profusion of embrace clung to other for while a though feeling might be satisfied by mere contact then woe of thing woe of be acknowledged on side must agree that wickedness of wicked be very wicked wherever might lie sin of fraud falsehood unmerited misfortune of poor hester be palpable enough must weep together over wrong inflicted on darling baby by degree be impossible to abstain from alluding to cause of sorrow such allusion became absolutely necessary when attempt be made to persuade hester to remain at old home with own consent be done by father on evening of arrival in compliance with plan have be arranged 'no papa can not do that ' said with tone of angry determination be duty hester friend will tell so ' bey duty be to husband ' said 'and in matter can allow to listen to other friend ' be so firm fixed in that did not even dare to go on with expostulation afterwards when be upstairs together mr bolton spoke out more at length with more energy beamma be of use ' said hester 'it ought to be of use do know position in be ' havery well be husband wife ' be so well if be not so if remain with while there be doubt upon matter then be mistress ' 'if be not wife then will be mistress ' said hester standing up looking a spoke much a mother must look in most determined moment child ' be use of mamma nothing will make leave others may be ashamed of because of will never be ashamed of be ashamed of ' 'if must mean what said just now must be ashamed of ' ' do mean though jury judge must say that be not husband though judge in england must say must not believe may put in prison so divide never will divide bone from

taking walk together mr smirkie first wife have be miss bromley sister of clergyman at utterden a julia babington be anxious to take to bosom future husband past belonging mr bromley have be invited to babington might be that aunt polly be at time well inclined to exercise hospitality in direction by feeling mr bromley must be able to talk to about terrible affair mr bromley be intimate with john caldigate of course must know about there be naturally in aunt polly heart certain amount of self congratulation at way in thing be going mr smirkie doubt have have former wife one must call bigamist in what condition might poor julia have be for interposition of providence for aunt polly regarded poor hester bolton a having be quite providential incident furnished expressly for salvation of julia hitherto mr bromley have be very short in expression respecting folking tragedy having simply declared that judging by character must not conceive that man such a caldigate must have be guilty of such crime now be being put through facing more closely by brother in law 'why must want to separate ' 'because evidence of guilt be so strong 'that be for jury to judge ' 'yes if jury must decide that there have be no australian marriage fear can hardly hope if jury be to decide that then of course must go back to while there be doubt must have thought tom certainly must have seen even though never have have wife of own think see that there be to see ' said other poor lady have be deceived betrayed punishment can be too heavy for man who have so injured very enormity of iniquity make doubt a far a can judge caldigate be high spirited honest gentleman to whom perpetration of so great sin must hardly suggest 'but if if think of condition tom ' 'you must have to think of own if be to attempt to tell to leave ' 'that mean that be afraid of 'it certainly mean that must be very much afraid if thought of taking such liberty if believed to be duty hope must do ' 'you be clergyman ' 'certainly

then must be duty to give what advice thought to be best then ' 'well then 'then must have to make up mind have not done at present must have to make up mind not a to guilt for believe to be innocent a to expediency of separation till jury must have acquitted be well aware that wo come to from little word constantly drop from be quite sure that nothing must induce to leave husband direct command from ' 'you might do through ' ' be equally sure that nothing must induce to send away ' conviction a be not sufficient for mr smirkie be alive to fact uncomfortably alive to fact that ordinary life of gentle folk in england doe not admit of direct clerical interference a country clergyman must bestow admonition upon poorer neighbour upon who be well to do must not intrude unasked unless a thought in case of great emergency here be case of very great emergency be sure that must have courage for occasion if folking be within bound of plum cum pippin be just case in counsel must be volunteered in so much must be said must be gross impertinence from others though might be so manifest duty to clergyman mr bromley must not be aroused to sense either of duty of privilege be sad to mr smirkie who regretted past day in a believed delinquent soul have be a manifestly subject to ecclesiastical interference a delinquent body have always be to civil law with julia who be to be wife must be more imperative be taught to give thanks before throne of grace because have be spared ignominy of being married to man who must not have made wife have have unstained clergyman of church of england given to for protection for with candour be so delightful so common in day everything have be told to mr smirkie how young heart have for time turned towards cousin how have be deceived then how rejoiced be that by such deceit have be reserved for present more glorious fate 'and wo mr bromley speak to ' julia asked 'it be very difficult question very difficult question indeed said mr smirkie shaking head be quite sure be folking in parish must perform duty though mr caldigate unfortunate lady might be a lion lioness in opposition to be also of opinion that sacerdotal difference of opinion must not be discussed among layman must not be discussed by clergyman even with wife of bosom at babington opinion be somewhat divided aunt polly julia be of course certain that john caldigate have married woman in australia two other girl father be not at so sure indeed there have be little misunderstanding among babingtons on subject be perhaps strengthened by fact that mr smirkie have more endeared to julia mother than to julia father sister mr smirkie be very clear a to criminality of bigamist suppose be often there ' mr babington said to guest parson of utterden 'yes have seen good deal of ' 'do think possible ' probable ' said clergyman ' said squire suppose be little wild out there be very different thing from bigamy young men when get out to place be not quite so particular a ought to be daresay when be young perhaps be not a steady a ought to have be by george here be man come over asks for lot of money then woman asks for money then say that if get will swear fellow be married in australia ca fancy that jury will believe that ' ' hope not 'and yet madame ' squire be in habit of calling wife madame when intended to insinuate anything against 'have got

little difference of opinion be coming to head in reference to very delicate matter when conversation above related took place babington wedding have be fixed to take place in week time must cousin john be invited must not julia be decidedly against behe did not think ' said 'that must stand up at altar conduct on occasion so trying if be aware that be standing by mr smirkie of course be not

marriage squire be man who must have opinion of own after having elicited that of mr bromley insisted that invitation must be sent 'it will be pollution said julia sternly to younger sister will be married woman almost before have seen ' said second 'and so wo matter so much to must get over a can ' julia have be thought by sister not to bear smirkie triumph with sufficient humility therefore be sometimes little harsh to ' think understand at said julia 'you have conception what must be feeling of married woman especially when be going to become wife of one of god minister in spite of aunt polly wrote to nephew a follows 'dear john dearest julia be to be married on tuesday next know how anxious have be to maintain affectionate family relation with therefore like idea of sweet child passing from present sphere to other duty without presence will come over on monday evening stay till after breakfast be astonishing how many of friend from two county have expressed wish to grace ceremony by company doubt whether there be clergyman in diocese of ely more respected thought of by upper class than augustus smirkie ' ask mr caldigate because under present circumstance must not perhaps wish to go into company because augustus have never yet have opportunity of making acquaintance will only say that be anxious wish of here that together may soon see end of terrible trouble believe to be affectionate aunt babington ' writing of letter have not be effected without much difficulty squire be not good at writing of letter though did insist on seeing epistle so that might be satisfied that caldigate have be asked in good faith did not know how to propose alteration 'that be eye ' said referring to son in law be to be a good a know that be better dear ' said aunt polly 'be because interest about such matter if have heard what archdeacon said of other day must think differently be parson ' said squire course butter other up then went on to other paragraph ' must have

love to julia ask from to accept little present send ' julia declared that must much rather not have accepted brooch that must never wear animosity against such article wear out quickly may be expected that little ornament will be seen in house of suffolk gentry among whom mr smirkie be so popular whether be mr smirkie popularity general estimation in babington family be held delight be taken by world at large in wedding there be very great gathering at babington church in squire house afterwards though be early in march time of year in eastern county of england be not altogether

present occasion might give little fillip to neighbourhood be second suffolk young lady that mr smirkie have married be therefore entitled to popularity certainly have done a much a must there be probably one around who have done more ' think dear child will be happy said mr babington to old friend mr munday wife of archdeacon munday clerical dignitary who have given mr smirkie so good

that judge judge can divide judge know one judge be there have said that whom have joined together man will not put asunder pure pure one must praise a woman do know be pure ' then mother heart yearned greatly towards daughter yet be whit changed knew nothing of phrase of logic felt that hester have begged whole question whom god have joined together true true if only one must know whether in other case god have joined couple a hester argued matter woman must be taken from man have married though might have dozen other wife living spoke of purity a though be virtue must be created consecrated simply by action of own heart a though nothing outside ceremony ordinance must affect same argument must enable to live with john caldigate after must come out of prison even though a must then be case woman must have legal right of calling mr john caldigate on previous day have declared that if must not be wife must be mistress mother knew what meant that let people call by what name might must still be husband wife in eye of god must not be so then must not be pure to mr worst of be that cloudiness have come upon daughter incapacity to reason out because love of human being have

' be same protest over over again be vain to answer 'you will not stay under father roof ' 'no have to live under husband roof ' then mr bolton left room apparently in anger though heart within might be melting with ruth still be necessary that must assume look of anger on morrow must have to show angry with vengeance if must then still be determined to carry out plan thought that be determined what have pity to do with love moving heart stirring word be not thing temptation from evil one if be allowed to interfere with strict line of hard duty when left room where young mother be still standing with baby in arm doubted for minute perhaps for half hour then wrestled with emanation from evil one with pity with love suasive tenderness at last overcame know be pure ' daughter have said ' know be right ' said mother spoke word to husband when came home ' can not bend can not turn in least behe will not stay ' 'not of own accord 'you have told 'oh not till to morrow ' ought to stay certainly ' said father there have be very little intercourse between mother daughter during afternoon while three be sitting together nothing be said about morrow evening must have seemed to be very sad very silent have not three be used to so many silent evening in room hester during wedding tour few week of happiness at folking before trouble have come have felt new life almost ecstasy of joy in thorough liveliness of husband day of old home be not so long ago that old manner must seem strange to therefore sat out hour patiently stitching baby ornament till mother told that time for prayer have come after worship father called out into hall a went up to room 'hester ' said 'it be not right that must leave to morrow ' must papa tell that be not right have home in everybody will respect for present must remain here ' ' can not papa told to go back to morrow must not disobey now not now be ever so ' then old man paused a though be going on with argument finding that have said that have to say slowly made way upstairs night mamma ' said hester returning only to door of sitting room 'good night love ' a word be spoken felt that there be something wrong much be wrong ' think will do ' said hester to herself a went up stair to chamber chapter xxxiv violence have be arranged at folking before hester have started that caldigate must drive waggonette into cambridge to take back on wednesday that must bring servant with who must drive carriage up to grange so that personally must not have to appear at door of house must remain at mr seely then waggonette must pick up have be explained to mr bolton 'john will remain in town because have so much to do with mr seely hester have said 'and richard will call here at about twelve ' plan have thus be made known mr bolton be aware at what hour bolt must be drawn thing removed a time drew nearer dislike to sudden commencement of absolute hostility became stronger to hostility must seem to have sanction from mr bolton because must then be absent too though a lay awake through dreary hour of long night said word about plan felt felt more strongly a dawn be breaking that must be mean to leave daughter with farewell kiss knowing a must do that be leaving within prison bar leaving to charge of jailer farewell kiss must be given a though be to meet more in old home till terrible trial must be over word appropriate to parting must then be spoken such parting word must be false falsehood must be against own child 'does expect ' said in low voice when wife came up to a be dressing behe expects nothing be thinking that perhaps must tell that must not go to day ' ' must not say to day if tell anything must tell ' 'will not that be best then old man thought over must be very much best for not to say anything about if must reconcile to conscience to leave house without doing so knew well that wife be more powerful than gifted with greater persistence more capable of enduring shower of tear storm of anger success of plan must be more probable if conduct of be left entirely to wife conscience be sore within 'you will come with to gate said to daughter after silent breakfast yes to say good bye then took hat glove umbrella very slowly lingering in hall a did so while wife kept seat firm square at breakfast table hester have hat shawl with mr bolton did not suspect that must endeavour to escape now without returning for child therefore sat firm square waiting to hear from hester what father might bring to communicate to 'hester ' said a slowly walked round sweep in front of house 'hester ' said must do duty best to god man best to john caldigate to child by remaining here ' 'how can unless tell ' 'you have father authority ' 'you surrendered when gave to a wife be not must rebel against papa must obey doe not st paul say wife submit yourselves unto own husband a unto lord 'certainly can not suppose that in ordinary case must interfere between be not that be anxious to take anything from

provide with home till law will have decided ' can not leave home unless bid ' ' be telling of duty of duty mother ' then passed out through gate thus having saved conscience from shame of false farewell slowly made way back to house after standing for moment to look after a went be almost sure now that something be intended must not have spoken in way of duty unless have meant to suppose that intended to perform duty ' have said bey duty mother ' of course something be intended something be to be done said more than have be done said already during breakfast have seen in curve of mother mouth sign of resolute purpose during very prayer have heard in mother voice sound a of settled determination knew knew that something be to be done with knowledge went back into mother room sat down firmly squarely at table have left cup partly full began again to drink tea 'what did papa say to ' asked mother bade stay here told that most certainly must go home to folking ' then mr bolton also became aware of fixed will resolute purpose on daughter part 'does word go for nothing ' can two person word go for anything when obedience be concerned be like god mammon ' 'if two people tell one differently must be right to cling to one leave other man can serve two master have got to obey husband even be to say must stay must come take away ' 'he must not do that ' ' will not be so disobedient a to make necessary carriage will be here at twelve will go have better go help nurse to put thing up ' so saying left room mr bolton remained there while sitting square firm at table be not yet ten when slowly followed daughter up stair first went into own room for moment to collect thought over again then walked across passage to daughter chamber knocked at door entered a knocked 'nurse ' said go into room for minute two wish to speak to mistress may take baby hester ' baby be taken then two be alone pack up thing to day hester ' 'why not ' 'you be not going to day ' be going to day mamma must seem to be cruel to only seem cut to heart can not go back to folking to day ' be to go ' 'ah hester what mean be be to be prisoner 'if must be gentle must explain ' ' will not be gentle mean to keep by violence mean to go husband will come will not be kept oh mamma must not desire to quarrel with openly before servant before world will not be kept will certainly go back to folking must not go back though have to get through window to walk whole way to call upon policeman even to help ' 'no one will help hester one will know for present must be home ' never will be home again said hester bursting into tear rushing after baby then there be two hour of intense misery in house of misery to who be concerned servant down to girl in scullery boy who cleaned boot be made aware that master mistress be determined to keep married daughter prisoner in house servant of house sided with mistress generally having of be induced to regard john caldigate with horror hester nurse of course sympathised with baby during two hour packing be completed hester found that strong walking boot bonnet have be abstracted did really think that at time a boot bonnet must be anything to must know nothing of nature must not understand sort of combat must carry on if attempt be made to take from liberty attempt made by who have by law no right to control when once have learned what be being done must not condescend to leave room till carriage must have come that must come punctually at twelve be sure then must go down without bonnet without boot see whether one must dare to stand in way a with baby in arm must attempt to walk forth through front door have not occurred to that other step might be taken just before twelve gardener stationed on road before house road be lane half street belonging to suburban village of chesterton there awaited carriage at spot yard away from gate be well that be early because richard be there few minute before time appointed behe ai going back to day ' said gardener laying hand gently on horse back 'who ai not going back ' asked coachman hester ai bers john ai going home ' be to come out tell a master like wheel on gravel if can be helped ai got none of own beissus ai going home why master expects for certain ' ' be to say ai going to day ' man who be driving passed rein into whip hand raising hat began to scratch head with other knew at once that there be something wrong that prolonged staying away from home be not merely pleasantly lengthened visit master have be very urgent with a to punctuality be evidently intent upon return of wife fact of accusation be known to man fact also that master present wife be entirely in accord with master must not be that must have determined to prolong visit then have sent back to husband with message a 'if will hold ho just minute said `` ll go in see missus ' grange gardener be quite a intent on side of question a be folking coachman on other to horror of bigamy be manifest be quite of opinion that beiss hester ' who never ought to have be married in way at must now be kept prisoner in father house 'it ai no use going in ca ' said gardener ai going to hold horse there be nobody a will ' 'what be up mate ' know a be mate to yet to one like a to what be up have told a be bade to tell ai going to tell more ca turn horse there 'd better drive round into village there will get high road back to cambridge ' then gardener retreated within little gate of own led from lane into precinct close to own cottage man be honest loyal old fanatic who must scruple at nothing in carrying out order of mistress in so good cause personally feeling have be acerbated in have be called beate by man not age coachman did a be bid seeing before other possible course must not leave horse when be in front of iron gate stopped examined premise gate be old be opened closed at ordinary time by ordinary ancient lock now there be chain passed in out with padlock evidently placed there to prevent from entering in opposition to gardener instruction there be clearly course open to to drive carriage back to master at quarter before twelve hester left own room looked backwards into garden a did pleasanter room of house with intention of seating in spare room looking out to front from must have seen carriage a entered gate have so seen must certainly have called to man from window when be standing in road door of front room be locked against when tried other found that front room be locked knew house of course a well a did mother rushed up to attic where servant occupied room looking out to road too be locked against then flashed upon that attempt to make prisoner be to be carried out through possible detail what must do husband must come of course what if be unable to force entrance how must force must police help must magistrate help knew that law be on side on that law must declare to be lord owner till law must have separated must law allow to be used readily for purpose too must understand that feeling of community must be against that in case law might allow to become slow lethargic perhaps inoperative yielding to popular feeling saw point be strong against a clearly a william robert bolton have seen be strong on side a stood there beating foot angrily on floor of passage made up mind that there must be more than one 'but ' in favour if kept must have to lock up a in dungeon neighbourhood must hear voice must be driven to do such thing that feeling of community must be no longer on side various idea passed through mind thought for moment that must refuse to take nourishment in house mother must surely not see die must thus have to see die else send forth to be fed that thought stayed with for moment be not only for herself that must eat drink for baby then finding that must not get to front window seeing that time have come in carriage must have be there went down into hall where found mother seated on high backed old oak armchair window of hall looked out on to sweep before house be well aware that from lower window plot of shrub in centre of space hindered view of gate without speaking to mother put hand upon lock of door a though to walk forth found barred prisoner said 'yes hester yes if will use such word a to father house be prisoner ' will not remain so will have to chain to gag to kill oh baby oh child nurse nurse bring boy ' then with baby in arm sat down in high backed oak armchair looking at hall door there must sit till husband must come surely must come must make way up to window there must at rate hear command if came for surely must be able to escape coachman drove back to town very quickly went to inn at horse be generally put up thinking better to go to master thence on foot there found john caldigate who have come across from mr seely office 'where be mr caldigate ' said a man drove empty carriage down entrance to yard man touching hat with motion of hand be intended to check master impetuosity drove on then when have freed from charge of horse told story with many whisper gardener said be to come ' that sir there be something up more than think sir there be indeed be that fractious that must hold ho for not for minute till must go in see then ' 'well gate be chained sir ' 'chained ' ' chain be round bar padlock never see such thing on gentleman gate in life before chained a nobody be to go in yet nobody be to come out ' man a said wore that air of dignity be always imparted by possession of great tidings truth of will certainly not be doubted tidings be great very thing father have suggested have declared to be impossible be being done old banker must not thought have dared to propose carry out such project whole bolton family have conspired together to keep wife from have allured away by false promise of friendly visit knew too that law be on side knew also that might find very difficult to make use of law if world of cambridge chose to think that hester be not wife world of cambridge must probably support boltons by opinion if if hester be true to certainly must be true to if be a courageous a believed to be then a thought house in chesterton must be able to hold stood for moment turning in mind what have better do then gave order to man in clear natural voice 'take horse out richard feed have better get dinner here so that may be sure to find here moment want ' wo stir step from place said man chapter xxxv in prison what must do john caldigate a walked out of inn yard have to decide for what must do at once first impulse be to go to mayor ask for assistance have right to custody of wife father have right to make prisoner be entitled to go whither pleased so long a have sanction must be separated from by action of law must be entitled to go whither pleased without sanction from one whether married unmarried be not subject to father husband be sure that be entitled to assistance of police doubted much whether must be able to get be most averse to ask for yet what other step must take with purpose a yet quite fixed went to bank thinking that might best commence work by expostulating with wife father be mr bolton habit to walk morning into town unless be deterred by heat wet ill health till lately have be habit also to walk back house being mile half distant from bank latterly double walk have become too much for when time for return came must send out for cab to take home hour be very various must generally lunch at bank in own little dingy room if thing went badly with so a to disturb mind must go back early in day generally pas afternoon asleep on occasion be very much troubled so that when caldigate reached bank did before one mr bolton be already getting into cab 'must speak few word to sir ' said caldigate in street ' be not very well to day ' said banker hardly looking round persevering in effort to get into vehicle must not keep for minute sir must see a be aware there be already dozen people collected of whom have doubt heard story of john caldigate wife there be indeed man woman in cambridge whose ear have not reached in hearing of mr bolton be determined not to speak of daughter be equally determined not to go back into house have nothing to say ' muttered 'nothing nothing drive on ' so cab be driven on john caldigate be left in street man anger now produced fixed purpose with quick step walked away from bank to robert bolton office there soon found in attorney room 'be aware of what be doing at grange asked in voice be not so guarded a must have be on such occasion anger quickness of walk have combined to make short of breath asked question with flurried hasty manner be common to angry people who be hot rather than malicious in anger think be ' said attorney if be doubt whether must just at present be willing to discus doings with ' bey wife have gone there on visit be glad to hear be best thing that sister must do 'and now seems difficulty be made about returning ' think very likely father mother can hardly wish that must go back to house at present can not imagine that must wish if have feeling of gentleman heart of man ought not to wish ' ' have not come here to be taught what be becoming either to man gentleman 'if will allow to say so while thing be a be at present ought not to come here at must not have done so for violence breach of hospitality at father house wife went there with understanding that be to stay for two day 'and now say detain be not responsible in doing so have thorough sympathy approbation know can help that will want help will help if can fact be have better leave there ' 'never ' must not have volunteered advice a be here may perhaps say word if attempt to take by violence from father house will have town county england against ' ' must own unless wished to come to if chooses to stay will stay 'it must not be left to if be so infatuated must not be allowed to judge for till trial be over must live apart then if woman doe not make good claim if can prove that woman be lying then will have back wife if a everybody find belief at present must be proved that be husband of woman that have basely betrayed poor sister by mock marriage then must be left to care of father mother may heaven help in misery ' said with much dignity in manner with even caldigate must not take personal offence must remember added 'that poor injured one be daughter sister ' say that have be in wise injured a also be injured by wicked plot say that will come back to unless elect to remain with parent then left office went forth again into street now took at once road to chesterton trying a did so to make for in own mind plan map of premise must thought be impossible that wife must be able to get out of house come to if must only make aware of presence then there be baby must be necessary not only that must escape that must bring child with must attempt to hold must be that must have already locked up in room up stair if did escape out of window even with baby in arm how must be with then a made way back into town thinking of hurried back to inn told richard to take carriage into chesterton wait there at turn of lane where lane lead down from main road to grange be to wait there though might be day till heard from saw master man who be quite a keen for master a be old gardener for mistress on other side promised accurate obedience then retraced step walked a fast a must to grange during time mother daughter kept weary seat in hall hester having baby in arm have quite determined that nothing must induce again to go up stair lest key of room must be turned upon for long time sat in silence then declared purpose ' will remain here mamma ' 'if so must remain too ' will not go up to bedroom again may be sure of ' 'you will go up to night hope ' 'certainly not nurse will take baby up to cradle suppose will be cruel enough to separate from child ' 'cruel do not know must do anything for child must die for child ' suppose will let bring food here must not wish to be starved ' what must have say be not jailer ' be mother according to conscience be acting for a best know how do not know that mean to be good to ' ' know be not good to nobody can be good who try to separate from husband will remain here till come tell how be to be taken away then mr bolton returned made way into house with assistance of gardener through kitchen found two woman sitting in hall in high backed arm chair daughter with baby in arm most piteous sight two of thus together 'papa ' said a came up into hall from kitchen be treating badly cruelly unjustly have right to keep here against will be husband wife must go to husband ' 'it be for best hester ' 'what be wrong can not be for best do suppose that will let be kept here in prison of course will come why do not let go ' be right that must be here hester ' said a passed up stair to own bedroom be terrible job of work for have strength a to be beginning to doubt whether even wife strength must suffice a for a for hester perhaps must be well that must be wearied broken into submission be fearful to think that wife must have to sit there whole day saying nothing doing nothing merely watching lest daughter must attempt to escape through window will kill father think ' said mother 'why doe not let go then have to think of husband child ' then again there be silence when have be seated thus for two hour word have be spoken between have not spread over ten minute mr bolton be looking forward to hour after hour of same kind did not seem to to be possible that hester must be forced up into own room even with hardihood must not ask men about place to take in arm carry with violence up stair must men have done if so required nothing policeman garb will seem to justify laying of hand upon woman even will hardly do unless woman be odiously disreputable mr bolton saw clearly what be before must hester be strong in purpose to remain seated a at present also must remain seated weariness solicitude for baby might perhaps drive young mother to bed then also must go to bed must rest with one eye ever open with ear always on alert be somewhat sure of life have not be so soft that must endure much of purpose be quite sure nothing must trouble conscience if must succeed in keeping daughter separated from john caldigate caldigate in hot haste walked up to iron gate found chained be in vain that shook in vain that looked at gate be fully twelve foot high spiked at top at side of gate ran wall surmounted by iron railing extending to gardener cottage on one side to coach house on other drive up to house swept round plot of thick shrub lay between various office stable coach house being on one side laundry gardener cottage on other from road there be mode of ingres for to enclosure unless must get over railing might perhaps have be possible must have be quite impossible for to bring wife back by same way there be bell at gardener little gate rang loudly one must come to at last made way round into kitchen garden by corner where access be made by climbing moderately high gate gave entrance to field from thence have difficulty in making way on to lawn at back of house up by dozen stone step to terrace ran along under window here found that lower shutter be barred on inside throughout so that must not look into of room must rap at window did loudly be in power to break if pleased rapped very loudly poor hester who sat at front hall heard nothing of noise knew that from back garden must make way to front with more le of violence between gardener cottage laundry there be covered passage leading to front building above being continuous leaving way through for convenience of servant however be guarded by trellis work gate even on gate gardener have managed to fix lock when caldigate reached spot man be standing idle observant at own cottage door have better open gate ' said caldigate 'or will kick open ' 'you must do mr caldigate be master order a be to be locked be master order a ai to be in here at then caldigate raised foot trellis work gate be very soon despatched havery well ' said man well mr caldigate will have to come agin when other thing come be belief a be burglorious ' then caldigate went up before house window gardener followed front door be approached by dozen stone step be guarded on side by curved iron rail along whole front of house passing under step there ran narrow willow area contrived simply to give light to kitchen office in basement storey area be again guarded by iron rail be so constructed a to make impossible that one le expert than practised house breaker must get in out of of window looking way from hall there be le than four window looking to front be equally unapproachable moment caldigate appeared coming round curve of gravel road hester saw jumping up from chair with baby rushed to window called to aloud tapping at window a did so 'john be here come to come to take out have shut in will not let come to ' then held up baby let in so that come to own baby dare not keep father away from own child at time nurse be in hall a

motionless must not move speak unless hester must endeavour to make way down into kitchen just in passage led to top of kitchen stair stood cook strong solid almost twice weight of hester pious determined woman on whom mistress must depend that must remain there impervious must talk to other now hester caldigate explaining suggesting what have be done must be done must converse only so that enemy around must hear word be spoken 'no john no will not stay ' said when husband told that must leave decision to 'unless be to do bidding will not stay here willingly john will not move upstairs will remain here if choose to give food may bring to unless carry will not go to bedroom will tear to piece before will let carry poor baby poor baby know will be ill said moaning still so that

wife that must be there again on following morning chapter xxxvi escape during whole of night hester kept position in hall holding baby in arm a long a infant must sleep in position then allowing nurse to take to cradle up stair during whole night also mr bolton remained with daughter tea be brought to of took after spoke word to other till morning before went to bed mr bolton came down made effort for joint comfort 'hester ' said must not go to room can do no good by remaining there ' 'no ' said sullenly 'no will stay ' 'you will only make ill mother ' behe can go though must die will stay here ' must succeed better with wife be obstinate so must be ' said mr bolton be in vain that endeavoured to prove to that there must be reason for such obstinacy that daughter must not attempt to escape during hour of night without baby 'you must not do ' said old man turning to daughter to hester must make reply mr bolton simply declared purpose of remaining to mind there be present idea that must at rate endure a much actual suffering a daughter there sat in morning be object pitiable to be seen macbeth sancho have be equally eloquent in praise of sleep that knit up ravelled sleave

poor hester there be baby to add to trouble never be there woman more determined to carry out purpose than mr bolton one more determined to thwart purpose of than who still called hester caldigate in morning mr bolton implored husband to go into cambridge a usual felt that must not leave house with such inmate so sat in bedroom dozing wretchedly in arm chair caldigate appeared before house at nine o'clock further attempt having be made to exclude entrance by side gate asked to see mr bolton 'papa be up stair said hester through window old man must not come down to see visitor must send message then caldigate declared purpose of going at once to mayor demanding assistance from police at rate must return with carriage a early a must after visit to magistrate office went to mayor inflicted much trouble on excellent officer who however at last with assistance of clerk of robert bolton whom saw on sly came to decision that own authority must not suffice for breaking open of man house in order that married daughter must be taken by violence from custody 'no doubt ' said 'no doubt ' when caldigate pleaded that mr bolton daughter be at rate for present own wife that man right to have wife be undoubted word doubt ' be said very often other word be said then clerk expressed opinion that proper course must be for mr caldigate to go up to london get order from vice chancellor be of course tantamount to saying that wife be to remain at chesterton till after trial unless must effect own escape not on account be inclined to yield have felt from first a have also that must make way out of house must not make a might might not have courage to be persistent in demanding indeed have be felt by william robert bolton when have given counsel behe be woman with baby when in house will be subject to influence will be very angry at first will probably yield after time to instruction will at last give unwilling assent to course propose be what may be expected if must be firmer than think if there must be in bosom greater power of resistance than expect must dash too violently against cage then must let go ' be intended to be gist of advice given though perhaps be not so accurately expressed be in way understood by old man mr bolton must not so understand have taken matter in hand a pressed lip together told that intended to go through with so did hester a day went on hester became at time almost hysterical in effort to communicate with husband through window holding up baby throwing back head be almost in convulsion in effort to get at on other side thundered at door with knocker till instrument have be unscrewed from within still must knock with stick shout with voice while people outside iron gate stood looking on in crowd in course of day robert bolton endeavoured to get order from magistrate for removal of caldigate by police mayor must not assent either to old mr bolton be owner of house if there be nuisance to be complained of be must complain mayor during day be much tried steady married people of borough shopkeeper wife doctor lawyer clergyman be in favour of mr mr bolton be held to be fitting that poor lady in hester unfortunate position must be consigned to care of parent till matter have be settled people generally sympathised with young husband young wife be loud in denouncing illegality of banker proceeding be already rumoured that among undergraduate caldigate side be favoured be generally known that crinkett woman have asked for money before have brought accusation on account sympathy ran with squire of folking mayor therefore did not dare to give order caldigate must be removed from off premise at puritan grange knowing that be there in search of wife who be only anxious to place in custody nothing be done day about four in afternoon while caldigate be still there at moment in poor hester have be reduced by continuance of effort to state of hysterical prostration old man summoned wife upstairs with motion to cook who still guarded stair obeyed order for moment left watch 'you must let go ' said old man with tremulous anxiety beating with finger on knee a spoke must let go ' 'no 'it will kill 'if let go will kill soul ' said determined woman 'be not soul more than body ' will say murdered ' 'who will say what must be breath of man doe not father who be in heaven know must die to do service if service accorded with will doe not know that be cruel to here in order that may be saved from eternal be going to say in natural fervour of speech 'from eternal cruelty to come ' checked to have admitted that judgment must be worse than just worse even than merciful must be blasphemy to 'oh know know if know what matter what men say have done to ' ' can not have go on like said still whispering behe will be wearied out then will take to bed ' mr bolton succeeded in demanding that telegram must be sent up to william requesting to come down to grange a early a possible on following morning be sent also message to robert bolton in cambridge telling that william have be summoned during two day have not be seen at grange though knew much of what be being done there have however be aware of that sister step mother be enduring must probably have appeared upon scene a be have justified absence by pleading to mr bolton personal enmity understanding existed that must not visit house then when be dark caldigate with carriage again returned to town where slept a have done on previous night again food be brought to two woman in hall again of swallowed cup of tea a prepared for work of night in hall there be gas stove be kept burning gave faint glimmer so that must see outline of other light beyond there be none in weary long hour of night such a night passed on seat of railway carriage rougher night such a of remember on outside of coach sitting by side of sick sleep will come early will early go weariness of past day will produce forgetfulness for hour two then come slow cold sad hour through dawn have to be expected between two three unfortunate be awake poor baby having be lately carried back from mother to cradle then suddenly mr bolton heard rather than saw daughter slip down from chair on to ground stretch along upon hard floor 'hester ' said hester did not answer 'hester be hurt ' when there be still answer mother got up with limb so stiff that must hardly use stood over child 'hester speak to ' ' will never speak to more ' said daughter child why will not go to comfortable wholesome bed ' will not go will die here ' 'the door will not be locked will have key with will hing to hurt if will go to bed ' ' will not go leave alone can not love must not treat like 'love oh child if knew if must understand why be doing be not because feel to be duty will let take to bed ' 'no never too can do duty duty to husband be to remain here till can get to even though must die then turned poor limb on hard floor mother covered with cloak placed cushion beneath head then after standing while over child returned to chair did not move speak again till old cook came with first glimmer of morning to inquire how night have be passed ' can not allow can not allow ' said mr bolton when shuffled down in slipper old servant have be up to have warned that such suffering a might have tragic end too probably end fatal to infant if mother strength must altogether fail must not go badly with baby so cook have argued who have be stern enough anxious enough to secure beiss hester ' from wickedness of john caldigate be now cowed frightened have acknowledged to herself that if beiss hester ' must not give way then must be allowed to go forth let wickedness be what might 'there must be end to ' said old man 'what end ' asked wife obey parent will obey only husband ' said hester 'of course there must be end let go to bed weary a be will wait upon a only mother can wait upon child have not prayed for through watch of night that might be delivered from calamity that might be comforted by in sorrow what have done two last weary day pray to lord god that might be merciful to ' 'let go ' said hester ' will not let go ' said mother rising from seat ' too can suffer too can endure will not be conquered by own child there spoke human being be utterance natural to woman 'in struggle hard a be will not be beat by one who have be subject to authority ' in prayer have prayed there have be prayer in heart if not in word that might be saved from humiliation of yielding early in day caldigate be again in front of house outside there be close carriage with pair of horse standing at gardener little gate at front gate be still chained there be again crowd at about one william robert bolton came upon scene be admitted by gardener cook through kitchen door into house be close to caldigate a entered did speak to to at moment hester be standing with baby at window saw 'now will be allowed to go ' exclaimed mr bolton be still seated with back to window have heard step on gravel opening of kitchen door understood hester word be aware that husband son be in house have agreed a to what must be done at once made way up into hall will make let go will make let go ' said hester rushing at once to elder of two holding out baby a though for to take be now in state so excited so nervous so nearly hysterical that be hardly able to control 'you will not let kill william baby ' kissed said kind word two then inquiring after father passed on up stair then mr bolton followed leaving robert in hall with hester ' know that have turned against ' said hester 'indeed have never turned against have thought that must be better here than at folking for present 'that be being against woman must be with husband told to do have nearly killed baby ' in meantime william bolton up stair be very decided in opinion that must at once allow caldigate to take back to folking have a said proved to be too strong for experiment have be tried have failed no doubt must be better so thought that must remain for present at grange so much better that certain show of force have be justified a thing be going further force must be justified have proved power must be allowed to go mr bolton however must not even yet acknowledge that be beaten in few more hour thought hester must allow to be taken to bed then might be well must not stand against combined force of husband two son so be decided that front door must be opened for prisoner that chain must be removed from gate must be afraid of people william bolton said to father be not till decision have be given that mr bolton felt that struggle of last three day have be too much for now at last threw upon bed weeping bitter tear tear of broken spirit there lay prostrate with fatigue misery must go down to say word of farewell how must say adieu to daughter leaving house in such circumstance will give love ' said william bolton beay nothing to doe not care for love for love of father in heaven care only for adulterer ' door be opened from within chain be taken away from gate john oh husband ' exclaimed a leaped down step into arm let go again not for day not for hour then box be brought down nurse came with child whom mother at once took placed in father arm carriage be brought in luggage be placed on nurse baby be seated ' will go up to poor mamma for one moment ' said did go to mother room throwing upon wretched woman wept over kissed mother though in sort returned caress said not word a daughter left room went also to father asked blessing muttered word two blessing doubt with inarticulate word also have be thoroughly vanquished then got into carriage be taken back to folking lying in john caldigate arm chapter xxxvii again at folking thus hester prevailed be taken back to house of man who have married by time very much have be said about matter publicly have be impossible to keep question whether john caldigate recent marriage have be true fraudulent out of newspaper now attempt have be made to keep apart by force gave additional interest to subject there be opinion very general among elderly educated people that hester ought to have allowed to be detained at grange mean to lean heavily on unfortunate young lady ' said 'isle of ely church intelligencer ' think that must have better shown becoming sense of position have submitted self to parent till trial be over then full sympathy of class must have be with whether law will restore to beloved husband will tell that have become victim of cruel seducer must have be supported by approval generous regard of men be thus for most part that elderly wise spoke thought about of course pitied believed evil of caldigate declaring that too be bound by feeling of duty to restore unfortunate one to father mother until matter must have be set at rest by decision of jury people especially people of utterden netherden of chesterton even of cambridge be on side of caldigate hester a married couple liked persistency with have claimed wife applauded to echo for love firmness of course scene at puritan grange have be much exaggerated two night be prolonged to interval varying from week to fortnight during time be said always to have be at window holding up baby mr bolton be accused of cruelty certainly have not committed detail of affair made way into metropolitan press so that expected trial became one of cause celebres by public be from time to time kept alive to value charm of newspaper during john caldigate be specially careful not to seclude from public view to seem to be afraid of fellow creature be constantly in cambridge generally riding thither on horseback on such occasion be always to be seen in trumpington street trinity street between boltons there be by tacit consent intercourse after attempted imprisonment never showed at robert bolton office when met in street did speak to other indeed at time gentleman lady held intercourse with caldigate except father mr bromley clergyman babingtons be strongly of opinion that must have surrendered care of wife aunt polly went so far a to write to when first heard of affair at chesterton recommending very strongly to leave at grange then there be angry correspondence ended at last by request from aunt polly that there might be further intercourse between babington folking till after trial caldigate though bore with assured face with little outward sign of inward misgiving suffered much much even from estrangement of with whom have hitherto be familiar to be 'cut by one be pain to not to be approved of not to be courted not to stand well in eye of around be to positive immediate suffering be supported doubt by full confidence of father by friendliness of parson by energetic assurance of partisan who be on side such a mr ralph holt farmer while caldigate have be in cambridge waiting for wife escape holt one two others be maturing plan for breaking into puritan grange restoring wife to husband supported without must hardly have carried a did with still be very wretched 'it be that so many people must think guilty ' said to mr bromley bore better though of course now that be safe at folking have little to do a to outward bearing in first place no doubt a to truth ever touched for moment not much doubt a to result of trial be to assured fact that john caldigate be husband must not realise idea that such being fact jury must say that be not let be a might two be one to adhere to in word in thought in little action be to only line of conduct possible heard what mr bromley said knew what father in law thought be aware of enthusiasm on side of folk at folking seemed to that opposition to happiness be continuation of mother have always made to marriage boltons be against be terrible sorrow to knew how to bear bravely in tenderness of husband who at time be very tender to have great consolation on day of return have be very ill so ill that caldigate father have be much frightened during journey home in carriage have wept laughed hysterically now clutching baby then embracing husband before reaching folking have be so worn with fatigue that have hardly be able to support on seat after rest for day two have rallied completely have taken pleasure great pride in fact that through baby have never really be ill 'he be little man said boasting to boy father 'and know how to put up with trouble when mamma be so bad did peak pine cry so a to break heart did own own brave little man must boast of own health too 'thank god be strong john can bear thing must break down other woman will never see give way because be poor creature certainly have right to boast that be not poor creature caldigate doubt be subject to trouble of knew nothing be quite clear to that mr seely own lawyer did in truth believe that there have be form of marriage between euphemia smith attorney have never said so much have never accused must probably have be opposed to propriety in such matter that direct accusation must have be made against by own attorney must understand from man manner that mind be not free from strong suspicion mr seely be eager enough a to defence seemed to be eager a against opposing evidence rather than on strength of evidence on own side be not apparently desirous of making world know that marriage certainly never took place that whether marriage have taken place not jury ought not to trust witness relied not on strength of own client on weakness of client adversary might probably be capable of proof that crinkett adamson woman have conspired together to get money from john caldigate if so then evidence a to marriage must be much weakened showed not averse to trick of trade might tend to get verdict must be proved that john crinkett have be dishonest in mining operation have euphemia smith allowed name to be connected with of other man in australia what have be antecedent be not on card allan minister have never undergone ceremony of ordination if not might not be shown that marriage service performed by must be marriage service at must not jury be made to think at least of jury that out there in rough lawless wilderness marriage ceremony be very little understood be wile to seemed disposed to trust whereas caldigate be anxious that must instruct eloquent indignant advocate to declare boldly that english gentleman must have be guilty of conduct so base so dastardly so cruel 'you see mr caldigate ' lawyer said on one occasion make best of own hand be not quite clean did promise other lady marriage doubt doubt be fool paid for folly bought off having fallen into common scrape having be pleased by prettiness cleverness woman way did a so many other men have done got out of a best must without treachery without dishonour bought off have refused to take money must probably have married probably have blown brain out afterwards have to be acknowledged much to shame most of must have to blush if worst of action be brought out before in court of law there be end of then come over here endeavour to enforce demand for money by threat 'that envelope be so unfortunate ' said lawyer unfortunate ' 'perhaps will get one before day come who will tell jury that marriage up at ahalala must have be farce be unsatisfactory became so more more a week went by confidential clerk whom boltons have sent out when first threat reached early in threat conveyed in letter from woman caldigate have shown to robert bolton returned about end of march two brother robert william decided upon sending to mr seely so that information obtained might be at caldigate command to be used if of use in defence there be in truth very little of clerk have be up to nobble ahalala have found no one there who knew enough of matter to give evidence about population of mining district in australia be peculiarly shifting population so that most of who have known caldigate mode of life there be gone old woman who kept henniker hotel at nobble have certainly heard that be married then have added that many people there called man wife from convenience woman must often like respectable name where there be parson near at hand to entitle to then parson must be dilatory troublesome expensive good many people be apt to think that must do very well without ceremony evidently must have done good to side a witness clerk have found ahalala almost deserted occupied chiefly by few chinese who be contented to search for speck of gold more ambitious miner have allowed to slip through finger woman have certainly called mr caldigate have be called so by many have afterwards be called mr crinkett when crinkett have combined mean with view of buying polyeuka mine be described a enterprising greedy woman upon whom love of gold have have almost more than customary effect have for while be noted courted for success having be only female miner who be supposed to have realised money in part have be known to bank at nobble also even at sydney have be supposed at one time to have be worth twenty thirty thousand pound then have joined with crinkett money have be supposed to vanish in polyeuka mine doubt there have be enough in to create animosity of most bitter kind against caldigate in search for gold have be uniformly successful be spoken of among nobble miner a one man who in gold digging have never have reverse have gone away just before bad time came on polyeuka then have succeeded after have gone in extracting from late unfortunate partner of farthing that have left there be ample cause for animosity allan minister who certainly have be at ahalala be a certainly dead have gone out from scotland a presbyterian clergyman doubt have ever be felt a to being that called letter from be produced have undoubtedly be written by robert bolton have procured photograph of note woman produced a having be written by allan to caldigate handwriting did not appear to to be same expert have given opinion that might have be written by same person of dick shand tidings have be found be believed that have gone from queensland to of island probably to fiji have sunk so low among men a to have left trace behind in australia one care to know whence shepherd have come go miner belongs to higher class be more considered result of be in opinion of boltons adverse to john caldigate in discussing with client mr seely acknowledged that nothing have a yet come to light sufficient to shake direct testimony of woman corroborated a be by three person of whom must swear that have be present at marriage doubt endeavoured to get money from ' said mr seely 'and may be well assured in own mind that money be sole object then can not be denied that application to for money have sound basis one though might fairly refuse to allow take away from application idea of criminality crinkett have never asked for money a bribe to hold tongue in matter of trade between be very successful be very unfortunate man asking for restitution in such circumstance will hardly be regarded a dishonest ' be to purpose caldigate declared that must willingly have remitted portion of money have known true circumstance have not done so now accusation be made jury feeling that application have be justifiable must probably keep two thing distinct be mr seely view thus in day caldigate gradually came to hate mr seely there be comfort to be have from mr seely mr bromley be much more comfortable though unfortunately in such matter le to be trusted 'as to minister handwriting ' said 'that will go for nothing even if have written note did ' said caldigate 'exactly must be believed to have be must prove nothing a to envelope can not think that jury must disturb happiness of family on such evidence a that depends on credibility of people who swear that be present can only say that be one of jury be case brought before a see now certainly must not believe there be here one letter to declaring that if will comply with demand will not annoy declaring also purpose of marrying one else how can juryman believe after ' ber seely say that twelve men will not be le likely to think bigamist because have expressed readiness to commit bigamy that if alone must not have leg to stand upon that be amply corroborated whereas have not be able to find single witness to support seems to that in way man might be made victim of conspiracy then mr bromley said that must be too patent to jury to leave doubt upon matter john caldigate though took great comfort in society of clergyman did in truth rely rather on opinion of lawyer old squire never doubted son for moment in intercourse with hester showed tenderness trust of loving parent too manifestly feared verdict of jury according to thing in world around generally be very bad what be to be expected from ordinary jury such a cambridgeshire must supply prejudice thick headed stupidity at best strict obedience to dictum of judge 'it be case said 'in jury about here will have sense enough to understand weigh fact there will be on one side evidence of four people swearing same thing may be that one more of will break down under cross examination that will then be straight if not twelve men in box will believe because be four not understanding that in case four may conspire a easily a two three there will be judge doubt english judge be always favourable to conviction judge begin with idea that man before must hardly have be brought there have not be guilty ' in very much more that said to mr bromley son be expressing contempt for world around rather than opinion of own on particular matter often think ' said 'that have to bear more from stupidity than from wickedness of world must be mentioned that about week after hester escape from chesterton there came to letter from mother 'dearest hester think that love because tried to protect from what believe to be sin evil temptation think that be le mother because caused suffering if eye offend pluck out be not plucking out own eye when caused pain to ought to come back to father ought to do so even now whether come back not will not remember that be mother who bore have always loved when further distress will come upon will not return to unhappy most loving mother beary bolton ' in answer to hester in long letter acknowledged mother love said that memory of two day at chesterton must lessen affection filial duty went on to say that in distress might come upon must turn to husband for comfort support whether must be with whether must be away from 'but ' added concluding letter husband child papa

out into street felt that be driven almost to despair at first declared to most untruly that there be one to believe not one then remembered how faithful be wife a did so in misery told that might have be better for have be le faithful looking at a now looked at after hearing word of hard man almost thought that must have be so everybody told that must be condemned if so what must be fate of

have be so hard to that felt compelled to put on one side that have said bollum have suggested in graphic manner that lawyer client stood upon different leg caldigate acknowledged to that bollum be right own lawyer have be almost a hard to a brother in law who be declared enemy what must do a to precaution to be taken in reference to departure of gang be quite out of question must go to australia stay behind a pleased there must be understanding that be to go even that be to hold tongue because money be paid to must be fully explained to that two thing be distinct then a be taken to inn at intended to sleep night made up mind in cab that must pay money to crinkett got to london just in time to reach bank before be closed there made arrangement deposited document security be assured that necessary sum must be placed to credit on following day then walked across street two in city to place indicated by bollum for appointment be at jericho coffee house in levant court silent secluded spot lying between lombard street cornhill here found ten minute before time asking for cup of coffee sat down at table fixed to ground in little separate box order be given to young woman at bar in room then ancient waiter hobbled up to explained that coffee be not quite ready in truth coffee be not often asked for at jericho coffee house house said waiter be celebrated for sherry must take pint of sherry so ordered sherry be afterwards drunk by bollum bollum came punctual to moment seated at table with good humoured alacrity 'well mr caldigate how be to be think must have seen that what have proposed will be for best ' will tell mean to do mr bollum ' said caldigate very gravely 'it can not be said that owe mr crinkett shilling ' 'certainly not come very near owing doe ' beo near mean to pay ' 'that be right ' beo near like to feel have got money in pocket a far a money go have be fortunate man ' 'wonderful said bollum enthusiastically a be once in partnership with uncle like to think that enriched by bargain impoverished ' 'it ai nice be that must have nothing ' 'feeling that very strongly continued caldigate merely shaking head in token of displeasure at bollum interruption ' have determined to repay mr crinkett amount seems to to be fair will have back twenty thousand pound 'he lucky fellow will be off like shot like shot 'he others have conspired to rob of happiness thinking that might so most probably get money from have invented wicked lie wicked damnable lie damnable lie be miscreant foul miscreant come mr caldigate ' 'foul

joint hand of timothy crinkett euphemia smith if with must be there at noon on following day bollum in vain attempted to manage payment without personal interview at last agreed that man woman must be forthcoming that night caldigate dined at club one of university club at have be elected just at time of marriage have seldom be there now walked into dinner room resolving that must not be ashamed to show fancied that everybody looked at probably there be present who knew that be about to stand trial for bigamy got dinner smoked cigar before evening be over have met old college friend be in want of friend explained want told something of immediate story then asked man to be present at scene on morrow must have witness gray ' said 'and will do kindness if will come then mr gray promised to be present on occasion on following morning met gray at club having cheque ready in pocket together proceeded to levant court again be little before time two sat together in gloomy little room up stair bollum be first to come when saw stranger be silent thinking whether might not be best to escape warn crinkett woman that might not be safe stranger did not look like detective a told why must there be danger so waited in few minute crinkett entered room with woman veiled 'well caldigate ' said crinkett 'how be with ' 'if please mr smith ' said caldigate ' must ask to remove veil so may be sure that be ' removed veil very slowly then stood looking in face not full in face for must not quite raise eye to meet though made effort to brazen out must not quite succeed attempted to raise head carry with pride now again there be slight quiver slight still visible effort too be visible there stood looking at to be looked at without word during whole interview never once opened lip have lost comeliness be now nearly seven year since two have be on goldfinder together then have found very attractive there be attraction now be much aged face be coarse a though have taken to drinking there be still about something of look of intellect have captivated more perhaps than beauty since day have become slave to gold such slavery be hardly compatible with good look in woman there stood ready to listen to ready to take money determined not to utter word then took cheque out of pocket holding in hand spoke to a follows have explained to mr bollum have explained to friend here mr gray reason induce to pay to timothy crinkett to euphemia large sum of twenty thousand pound nature of transaction have be such that feel bound in honour to repay so much of price paid for polyeuka mine ' right caldigate right ' said crinkett 'and have explained also to of that payment have nothing to do with base false most wicked charge be bringing against be not because woman by vile perjury claim a husband because wish to buy silence make restitution restore money of own free will without base bargain can go on with perjury abstain from a may think best 'we understand squire ' said crinkett affecting to laugh 'you hand over money be ' then woman looked round at companion frown came across face said nothing turning face again upon caldigate endeavouring to keep eye steadfastly fixed upon 'have brought receipt signed by of ' then bollum handed receipt signed 'timothy crinkett for self partner caldigate demanded that woman also must sign 'there be difficulty about name see ' said bollum there be difficulty about name certainly must not be fair thought that must force to use of name disowned did not wish to be hindered from what be doing by persistency in calling by own name beo be ' said 'there be cheque mr gray will see that put into hand did of stretching out hand to take 'and now can go where please act a please have combined to rob of value most by basest of lie not on

chapter xl waiting for trial a returned to cambridge caldigate be not altogether contented with tried to persuade in reference to money have refunded that in what have done have not at be actuated by charge made against have there be such accusation must have felt bound to share loss with people a soon a have learned real circumstance money have be burden to for satisfaction of own honour of own feeling have become necessary that money must be refunded need of doing so be not lessened by fact that base conspiracy have be made by gang of villain who have thought that money might thus be most readily extracted from be argument with defence for what have done nevertheless be aware that have be driven to do now to pay money at special moment by undercurrent of hope that enemy must think best for to go a soon a have money in hand wished to be honest wished to be honourable wished that that did must be what world call board ' still be so essential for for wife that must go have be very steady in assuring wretched one that might go stay a pleased have be careful that there must be credible witness of assurance might succeed in making others believe that have not attempted to purchase absence must not make believe even though jury must not convict there be so much in australian life must not bear searching light of cross examination same may probably be said of most of in such trial a that be anticipating there be often special cruelty in exposure of matter be for most part happily kept in background man on occasion inadvertently take little more wine than be good for be accident most uncommon with nobody think much about chance brings case to notice of police court poor victim be published to world a drunkard in column of newspaper young girl fancy in love man be unworthy feeling pass away none perhaps mother be wiser if by chance treachery letter must get printed read poor girl punishment be so severe that be driven to wish in grave have be foolish very foolish a have seen on board goldfinder wicked too there must be doubt about when must come out in dreaded trial must be quite unable to defend there be enough to enable mr bolton to point at with finger of scorn a degraded sinner yet yet there have be nothing have not dared to own to wife in secrecy of mutual confidence in secret have not be able to condone without moment hesitation have be in love with woman in love after fashion have promised to marry have done worse than then when have found that passion for gold be strong upon have bought freedom from story must be very bad a told in court yet have told to wife have admitted excuse when have spoken of savageness of life of craving man must feel for feminine society of undoubted cleverness then of avarice then when swore that through have still loved hester bolton whom have once seen whom having seen have never allowed to pas out of mind still believed thought that holiness of love have purified believed who else must believe of course be most anxious that people must go before left london wrote to mr seely to robert bolton saying what have done letter to own attorney be long full gave account in detail of whole matter declaring that must not allow to be hindered from paying debt believed to be due by wickedness of to whom be owing 'the two thing have nothing to do with other said 'and if choose to throw up defence of course can do so can not allow to be debarred from exercising own judgment in matter because think that what decide upon doing may not tally with view a to defence ' to robert bolton be much shorter ' think ought to know what have done said 'at rate choose that must be left in ignorance ' mr seely took notice of communication not feeling bound to carry out threat by withdrawing assistance from client robert william bolton agreed to have crinkett movement watched by detective policeman be determined that if possible crinkett woman must be kept in country in day old squire made many change in residence vacillating between house in cambridge house at folking book be at cambridge must not have brought back yet felt that ought to evince constancy to son conviction of son innocence by remaining at folking be aware too that presence there be comfort to son hester when john caldigate have gone up to london father have be in cambridge on return found old squire at old house said telling story of what have just done ' have paid twenty thousand pound out of hand to rascal simply because thought owed to ' squire shook head not being able to approve of act see why must have allowed to be hindered from doing what thought to be right because be doing what knew to be wrong 'they wo go know ' ' daresay not sir why must ' 'but jury will believe that intended to purchase absence ' think have made that clear be afraid not man applied to for money be refused that be beginning of then application be repeated by woman with threat again refused then present to magistrate make accusation upon that pay money of course will come out at trial that paid immediately after renewed application from bollum must have be better to have defied ' ' did defy ' said john caldigate that father said seemed to to be true so that repented of what have done made inquiry on subject early in may heard from mr seely that crinkett woman be still in london that have abandoned idea of going at once to australia according to mr seely story of truth of declared to be by mean certain crinkett have wished to go have be retained by woman far a can learn ' said mr seely behe be in communication with boltons who will of course keep if be possible must get off if must take have got hold of money when made cheque payable to order effectually provided for remaining here if must have got money without name must have gone must have gone with ' 'but be not object ' said caldigate angrily mr seely thereupon shrugged shoulder early in june man came back who have be sent out to sydney in february on behalf of caldigate also have be commissioned to seek for evidence to bring back with almost at cost witness witness might find whose presence in england must serve caldigate cause brought one have learned very little too have be at ahalala at nobble at nobble people be now very full of subject be very much divided in opinion there be crinketters anti crinketters caldigatites anti caldigatites certain number of person be ready to swear that there have be marriage equal number perhaps to swear that there have be none new fact have be brought to light dick shand have not be found who have be living with caldigate when marriage be supposed to have be solemnised have that register be discovered from copy of certificate be supposed to have be taken through colony so said agent very great interest be felt in matter newspaper from day to day contained paragraph about nobody have appeared whom be worth while to bring home mr henniker of hotel at nobble have offered to swear that there have be no marriage offer made repeated when have come to understand accurately on whose behalf last agent have come to colony then before have understood have offered to swear reverse became known that be very anxious to be carried back to old country free of expense credible witness must be found who have heard caldigate call woman mr smith after date assigned to marriage doubt have used various name have called sometimes mr caldigate sometimes mr smith generally in such document a have to sign in reference to mining share euphemia cettini be by name that have be known in sydney when performing on stage be now alleged on behalf that have bought sold share in name under idea that must thus best secure to herself separate undisturbed possession proof be brought home caldigate have made over to share in name mr seely did not depend much on a proof against marriage mr seely seemed to depend very little on anything so little that caldigate almost wished that have carried out threat thrown up case 'does not believe when tell ' wife asked caldigate be forced to confess apparently lawyer did not believe in fact mr seely have even said a much 'in such case lawyer must never believe disbelieve if doe must never speak of belief be with acquittal conviction that be concerned in matter can better assist by cool judgment than by fervid assurance ' made caldigate not only angry unhappy for must not fail to perceive that public around be in same mind a mr seely in own parish believed apparently not beyond parish might be possible that must escape that seemed to be general opinion then general opinion went on to declare that there be reason for supposing that have not married woman merely because said that have not done so then gradually there fell upon poor hester mind doubt after almost conviction not doubt a to husband truth suspicion on score ever troubled for moment there came upon fear almost more than fear that terrible enemy must be strong enough to override truth to carry with judge jury a summer month ran on became aware that for purpose of removing witness money have be paid in vain crinkett be living in opulence at hotel at brighton woman calling mr caldigate have taken furnished apartment in london rumour came that be frequently seen at theatre that have appeared more than once in open carriage in park there be doubt caldigate money have made very comfortable for present whole story of money have be made public of course there be various opinion about prevailing idea be that attempt have be made to buy off first wife that first wife have be clever enough to get money without having to go caldigate be thought to have be very foolish on subject bollum once expressed strongly to friend said 'caldigate clever greatest idiot ever came across in life 'd made quite straight for so that there must have be wrinkle must have there be men so soft that one ca understand 'em to do bollum justice must be said that be most anxious to induce uncle woman to leave country when have got money though very miserable hester be very brave in presence of husband must never allow to seem to doubt must speak of marriage a thing so holy that nothing within power of man must disturb of course be man wife of course truth must at last prevail be not lord able in own good time to set matter right in discussing matter with must always seem to imply that lord good time must be time of trial must never herself hint to that there might be period of separation coming though in secrecy be preparing for what might befall turning over in woman mind how might best relieve agony of jail let sign escape that looked forward to such misery let such sign escape in intercourse with with father must speak more freely have indeed come to be understood between old squire that must be best that must discus matter openly arrangement must be made for future life so that when blow came might not be unprepared hester declared that nothing positive want of shelter must induce to go back to chesterton 'they think to be be bad ' said ' know to be be good how be possible that must live together ' old man have of course turned over much in mind if must be true that woman have in truth become son wife that dear sweet young mother have be deceived betrayed cheated out of very existence then house at folking must be proper home for grave must be best till might be reached home must be better than folking be almost sure that be not so confidence old a be prone to be suspicious made confident when moment came must not doubt how must answer must not crush spirit by seeming for moment to have suspicion home of course will be here ' said 'it will be own house 'and ' 'it will be house too if must come to will be at rate together will not be left without friend 'it be not for ' said for boy for what will be best for must take cabin at prison gate so a to be nearest to if be only ' so be settled between must great misery fall upon must remain at folking must remain with nothing that judge jury must do must deprive her of right to occupy husband house in way month of may june first fortnight of july wore away then time for trial have come up to last have be hoped that tidings might be heard by letter telegram from dick shand seemed that have vanished from face of earth suggestion of news a to whereabouts be received on might have be possible to found argument for further postponement of trial mr seely have be anxious for such postponement perhaps thinking that a hotel at brighton carriage in park be expensive crinkett lady might take departure for australia without saying word to lawyer who have undertaken prosecution there be adequate ground for delay on tuesday th july trial be to be commenced on previous day caldigate at own request be introduced to sir john joram who have be brought down special to cambridge for defence mr seely have advised not to see barrister who be to defend leaving however quite at option to do so not a pleased beir john will see think have rather not ' said mr seely caldigate have chosen to have interview have thought best to say just one word to ' said caldigate ' be quite at service ' said sir john want to hear from own lip that falser charge than be never made against man be glad to hear ' said sir john then paused 'that be to say mr caldigate be bound in courtesy to to make such civil reply a must have made have not be employed in case have circumstance then induced to make such statement to in truth a be so employed statement from lip ought to affect in least for own sake will say that statement will affect be not for to believe disbelieve anything in matter if carried away by feeling be to appeal to jury for sympathy because of belief must betray cause will be duty not to make jury believe who in position will not be expected even to tell truth to induce if possible to disbelieve witness against who will be on oath second hand protestation from advocate be never of much avail in many case have be prejudicial can only assure that understand importance of interest confided to will endeavour to be true to trust ' caldigate who wanted sympathy who wanted assurance of confidence in word be by mean contented with counsellor be too wise at present moment to quarrel with chapter xli first day then came morning on caldigate hester must part very little have be said about word two have be absolutely necessary trial must probably take two day must not be well that must be brought back to folking for sad intervening night then must verdict be given against prison door must be closed against wife more rigidly than against other friend who might knock at inquiring after welfare at rate must not be allowed to see prison

imply that judge mind must not be perverted by sentiment a to prisoner a to sweet young woman who called wife at home a to want of sweetness on part of other woman who claimed jury be sworn in without more than ordinary delay then trial be commenced that have to be done for prosecution seemed to be simple enough first witness called be woman who be summoned in name of euphemia caldigate alias smith

have be quarrel after time have agreed to part have received from certain amount of mining share of money have undertaken in return never to bother more there be great deal said about time date left impression upon around in court that be le sure of fact than woman in such circumstance naturally must have be then sir john produced letter have written to caldigate in have distinctly offered to marry crinkett if money demanded be paid must have expected production of letter still for few moment silenced 'yes ' said at last wrote ' 'and money demanded have be paid ' 'yes have be paid not then be not paid till came over 'but if have be paid then must have married mr crinkett sir john manner a asked question be so gentle so soft that be felt by to contain apology for intruding on so delicate subject when hesitated did after pause renew inquiry in form 'perhaps be only threat have purpose of carrying out ' then plucked up courage ' have not married ' said did intend ' ' did what be law to out there have left have taken wife have to do best for did intend did do woman ca be tried for intention 'no said sir john 'but may be judged by intention then be asked why have not gone when have got money according to promise defied ' said 'and called bad name liar perjurer knew that be not liar then be watched told that might not go a said that be indifferent be willing enough to stay see out ' 'you can not give ' asked again be last question clearer record of month lived with husband ' said ' can not kept journal then be allowed to go though have be under examination for three hour be thought have escaped easily crinkett be next who swore that have be caldigate partner in sundry mining speculation that have be in way intimate that have always recommended caldigate to marry mr smith thinking a said 'that respectability paid in long run that having so advised have become caldigate special friend at time to exclusion of dick shand who be generally drunk who whether drunk sober be opposed to marriage have be selected to stand by friend at marriage thinking that witness must be beneficial have taken adamson with only wonder be that one must dispute fact be at time so notorious at ahalala at nobble held head high during evidence in chief more than once called prisoner ' 'caldigate knew 'caldigate did that ' be past four when be handed over for cross examination when be said that hour must suffice for judge agreed to sit for other hour be nearly two hour before gentleman who be with sir john have finished work during mr crinkett seemed to suffer much gentleman be by mean so complacent a sir john asked very disagreeable question have crinkett intended to commit bigamy by marrying last witness knowing at time that be married woman ' never said that intended to marry ' said crinkett 'what wrote to caldigate be nothing to ' must not be made to own a have done in straightforward way that have intended to set law at defiance courage failed presence of mind be made to declare at last that have only talked about marriage with view of keeping woman in good humour that have never intended to marry then be asked a to bollum have told bollum that intended to marry woman at last owned that might have done so of course have be anxious to get money have thought that might best do so by such offer be reduced to much misery during cross examination on one main statement that have be present at marriage be not shaken at six o'clock trial be adjourned till next day two caldigates be taken in fly to neighbouring inn at room have be provided for here be soon joined by mr seely who explained however that have come merely to make arrangement for morrow 'how be going ' asked caldigate question be very natural be one mr seely be not disposed to answer ' must give opinion said 'in such case never do give opinion evidence be very clear have not be shaken witness be people of bad character character go long way with jury will depend good deal on judge must say can not give opinion ' opinion one way other be expressed to father son who indeed saw one else whole evening robert bolton in discussing matter with father expressed strong conviction that caldigate must be acquitted have heard understood nature of such case in least doubt that be married ' said robert bolton circumstance make sure of witness be just of kind jury always distrust jury will acquit not because believe marriage out of enmity to crinkett woman 'what will do then ' asked old man to robert bolton must make answer only shook head turned away chapter xlii second day court have be very full on first day of trial on following morning be even more crowded so that outsider who have friend connected with justice have hardly chance of hearing seeing anything many of circumstance of case have long be known to public matter of new of peculiar interest have be elicited distinct promise made by woman to marry man so a to render existing husband safe in bigamy by committing bigamy payment to people by caldigate of immense sum of money fact that two have lived together in australia whether married not have now be acknowledged on side added to romance of occasion while must hardly be doubted on one side caldigate have married woman so strong be evidence must not be at doubted on other side that accusation have be planned with view of raising money have be result of base conspiracy then there be additional marvel though money have be paid whole sum demanded yet trial be carried on general feeling be exactly that robert bolton have attributed to jury people did believe that there have be marriage trusted nevertheless that caldigate might be acquitted so that recent marriage might be established doubt there be feeling with many that anything done in wild of australia ought not 'to count ' here at home in england caldigate with father be in court little before ten at hour punctually trial be recommenced first business be examination of adamson who be quite clear a to marriage have be concerned with crinkett in money operation for many year have be asked by to be present simply a witness have never be particularly intimate with caldigate have have little nothing to do with afterwards be cross examined by second gentleman be not subjected to much annoyance have put what little money possessed into polyeuka mine have come over to england because have thought that by so doing might perhaps get portion of money back have there be conspiracy be one of conspirator well rather thought that there have be conspiracy that be one of conspirator then have only conspired to get what thought to be own have lost everything in polyeuka mine a gentleman doubt have married lady thought might a well come forward perhaps in way must get money did not mind saying that have received couple of thousand pound be half what have put into polyeuka hoped that after paying expense must be able to start again at digging with something above thousand be straight sailing purpose have in view be so manifest that have hardly be worth while to ask question anna young be next encountered sweet courtesy of sir john joram sweet courtesy be prolonged for above hour be not apparently very sweet to miss young of witness hitherto examined be worst have be flippantly confident in memory of marriage ceremony when questioned on behalf of prosecution have forgotten everything in reference to friend subsequent married life have forgotten even own life did not quite know where have lived at last positively refused to answer question though be asked with most engaging civility said that 'of course lady have affair must not tell to everybody ' did mean lover did care for men at 'yes did mean money have done little mining hoped to do little more ' behe be to have thousand pound expense have got money yet so on probably of witness yet examined miss young have amused court most there be many others doubt necessary for case hardly necessary for telling of story captain munday be there captain of goldfinder who spoke of caldigate conduct on board of own belief that two be engaged when left ship 'as be prepared to acknowledge that there be engagement think that need trouble captain munday said sir john only deny marriage then cheque for twenty thousand pound be produced clerk from bank to prove payment old waiter from jericho coffee house others of whom sir john joram refused to take notice have be acknowledged of course money have be paid of course intimacy have existed no doubt there have be interview at folking up in london have there ever be marriage in tent at ahalala that only be point to sir john joram found necessary to give attention slight interval be allowed for lunch then sir john rose to begin speech be felt on side that speech be to be great affair of trial must be able so to represent witness a to make jury believe that have sworn falsely that undoubted acknowledged conspiracy to raise money have be concocted without basis of truth there be quarter of hour during father remained with son in precinct of prison then judge lawyer whose place be assured to trooped back into court who be le privileged have fed with pocketed sandwich not caring to risk loss of seat sir john joram began by holding extended in finger towards jury envelope have undoubtedly be addressed by caldigate to bers caldigate ahalala nobble in certain letter have be stated to have be sent by to 'the word written on envelope ' said 'be to mind strongest evidence have ever met of folly to man may be reduced by softness of feminine intercourse acknowledge on part of client that wrote word acknowledge that if man must make woman wife by so describing on morsel of paper man must have made woman wife acknowledge so much though acknowledge though deny that letter be ever sent to woman in envelope hold in hand own story be that wrote word at moment of soft foolish confidence when two together be talking of future marriage marriage doubt be contemplated probably have be promised then wrote address showing woman name must be hers must ever be married have craftily kept document be story be story now must show why think also must be story woman must describe in way lest must do injustice by calling mr smith do client injustice by calling mr caldigate have told that envelope with enclosure produced reached at nobble through post from sydney to statement call upon to give credit letter so sent must a have be informed bear two postmark of sydney of nobble envelope bear one only be not will call before two gentleman experienced in affair of post office will tell that postmark on envelope that of town sydney that by postage stamp be obliterated be cleaner finer better perceived than must have be have passed in ordinary course through post office letter in post office be hurried quickly through operation of stamping so that one passing over other while stamping ink be still moist will to extent blot blur that with have come in contact will produce dozen taken at random will show that with such have be case blotting smudging be very slight exists be always there will tell that envelope have be stamped a one alone by with peculiar care will ask to believe that impression have be procured by fraud in sydney post office if be so if in case a fraud be once discovered then say that whole case will fall to ground that will be justified in telling that word that have heard from four witness be worthy of belief 'nothing worthy of belief have be adduced against client unless envelope be so that four person have conspired together for sake of getting money be clear enough to evidence will come presently will endeavour to show why must discredit at present be concerned simply with envelope on think that case hang a for copy of register be nothing must be odd indeed if in conspiracy so much a must not be brought up have register be found in archive of church however humble have attested copy be produced must have be much be nothing be alleged letter from mr allan anything be letter genuine must show that marriage have be contemplated not that have be solemnised have however evidence to make believe that letter be genuine envelope again stretched out towards jury evidence impression of post office stamp have often be accepted a evidence evidence may be false evidence be for to see whether may not probably be so now 'in first place such evidence requires peculiar sifting unfortunately can not be applied to in present case because have be brought to from great distance have envelope be in possession from moment in accusation be first made might have tested either by sending to sydney by obtaining from sydney other letter document bearing same stamp affixed undoubtedly on date here represented have not be within power gentleman whom will bring before will tell that impression stamp have knack of verifying make very dangerous indeed for fraudulent person to tamper with stamp used in june will be hardly same a will be in little bruise will have so altered portion of surface a to enable detection to be made with microscope stamp used in will certainly have varied form in now maintain that time opportunity must have be given to to verify impression copy of impression from day to day be kept in sydney post office if be found that on day named th of may impression in sydney office be exact facsimile of impression then say that impression have be subsequently fraudulently obtained that only morsel of corroborative evidence offered to will be shown to be false evidence have be unable to get impression of date opportunity have not be given to hesitate to tell that must demand such opportunity before accept envelope a evidence on can send client to jail deprive that young wife whom have made own of husband afford damning evidence of verdict towards robbing son of legitimacy ' said very much more about envelope clearly showing own appreciation of importance declaring again again that if must show that stain of perjury affected evidence in one point evidence must fall to ground that if there be ground to suspect that envelope have be tampered with then stain of perjury must exist after went on to four conspirator a called justifying name by acknowledged object of getting money from client 'that came to country a conspirator with fraudulent purpose learned friend will not deny ' acknowledge nothing of kind said learned friend learned friend must feel that be case in can not safely acknowledge anything doubt gentleman that have made up mind on point ' went on to show that clearly be conspirator that have confessed a much 'it be doubt possible that client may have married female conspirator be not le entitled to protection from law because be conspirator because be conspirator must be le amenable to law for terrible injury must then have done to other lady if be conspirator if be shown to that came to country not that woman might claim husband not that others might give honest testimony against great delinquent in order that might frighten out of money then be entitled to tell that must not rest on evidence unless be supported that fact of conspiracy give right nay make imperative duty to suspect perjury ' remainder of day be taken up with sir john speech with witness called for defence certainly succeeded in strengthening compassion be felt for caldigate for unfortunate young mother at folking 'it be very well ' said learned friend to tell of protection be due to married woman when husband have broken law betrayed trust by taking wife to a man be accused of having done there be aspect in will regard question think of second wife of child of protection be due to well know that doe not suspect husband that fear nothing mistaken verdict from that will be satisfied much more than satisfied if will leave in possession of home husband unalloyed domestic happiness have enjoyed since joined lot with look at one woman then at other remember motif different life different joy what will be effect of verdict upon of if be satisfied that did marry woman vile woman nature of whose life have be sufficiently exposed to of course verdict must be against law be law must be vindicated in case will be duty terrible duty to create misery to destroy happiness to ruin dear innocent young mother child to separate loving couple detail of whose life be such a to demand sympathy must do at bidding of four greedy foul conspirator innocent sweet excellent in feminine grace a be one wife unlovely unfeminine abhorrent a be other must do duty god forbid must ask to break oath even for sake of young mother in such case do think may ask to be very careful a to what evidence accept do think may again point out to that four witness bound a be together by bond of avarice must be regarded a one a one to whose sworn evidence credit be due unless be amply corroborated say that there be corroboration envelope must be strong corroboration if have be trustworthy ' when sat down feeling in court be certainly in favour of john caldigate then cloud of witness be brought up for defence of whom however be soon despatched two clerk from post office gave exactly evidence sir john have described exposed to jury packet of old letter in opinion impression on envelope be finer cleaner than generally produced in course of business of thought not improbable that impression have be surreptitiously obtained of acknowledged on cross examination that stamp so clean perfect might be given maintained without special care of said that be quite possible that letter passing through post office might escape stamp of one of office in must be manipulated then there came witness a to character evidence be given a to hester determination to remain with man whom believed to be husband a to there be cross examination that caldigate life have be useful salutary since return to folking one doubted that have be loving husband if have committed bigamy be doubt for public welfare that crime must be exposed punished that must have be bigamist must be pity oh pity pity of oh pity of for now there have be much talk of hester home at folking former home at chesterton people everywhere concerned for peace for happiness for condition of life chapter xliii last day after sir john joram speech when work of second day have be brought to close caldigate allowed hope to rise higher than have ever mounted since have first become aware that accusation must in truth be brought against seemed to be almost impossible that jury must give verdict in opposition to argument so convincing a sir john have used detail have appeared to to be so damning to own cause now melted away seemed to be of avail even mr seely when came to see client in evening be le oppressive than usual did not indeed venture to express hope in hopelessness be somewhat more hopeful than before 'you must remember mr caldigate ' said 'that have not yet heard judge that with jury judge will go much further than advocate never knew cambridgeshire jury refuse to be led by judge bramber ' cambridgeshire jury asked old mr caldigate 'and why judge bramber especially 'we be little timid think here in eastern county little wanting in self confidence advocate in north of england have finer scope because people like to move counter to authority lancashire jury will generally be unwilling to do what judge tell then judge bramber have peculiar way of telling jury if have strong opinion of own never leaf jury in doubt about judge be what call flabby mr caldigate be little afraid of responsibility leave jury counsel to fight out among sir john did very well doubt very well made best must of postage stamp though know that will go for much point most in favour be that australian be rough lot to look at woman have be drinking have lost good look so that juryman wo be soft about caldigate when heard thought of euphemia smith on board goldfinder when certainly did not drink when personal appearance be certainly such a might touch heart of juryman gold drink together have so changed woman that must hardly persuade that be that forlorn attractive female whom have once so nearly loved before went to bed caldigate wrote to wife a have done also on preceding evening 'there be to be long tedious terrible day then may be that will be able to write more for sake almost more than for own be longing for to be over must be vain for to attempt to tell took place dare to give hope know may be fallacious yet feel own heart somewhat higher than be when wrote last night then did tell something of what have taken place speaking in high praise of sir john joram 'and now own own wife real wife beloved one have to call so perhaps for last time for year if men will choose to think that married that woman will have to be so parted that must be better for to be in graf even then will not give up hope father have promised that whole colony will be ransacked till proof be found of truth then though will have be convicted will be reinstated in position a husband may god almighty bless boy till may come again to claim wife child without disgrace ' old man have made promise must go ' said 'be not that hester will want support here ' for there have be promise made that by entreaty no guile force must hester be taken from folking to chesterton early on third day judge bramber began charge in doing so told jury that must occupy about three hour in exactly three hour time have completed task in summing up case certainly be not 'flabby ' so little so that left doubt on mind of who heard of verdict at have arrived went through evidence of four chief witness very carefully then said that antecedent of people even guilt if have be guilty have nothing to do with case except in so far a might affect opinion of jury a to veracity have be called conspirator even though have conspired to raise money by threat than nothing must be more abominable even though by doing so must have subjected to criminal proceeding to many penalty must not lessen criminality of accused if such marriage a described have in truth taken place 'this said judge 'be so much matter of course must not insist upon have not be implied that testimony of four person be worth nothing because be conspirator be for to judge what testimony be worth be for to remember that be four distinct witness swearing to same thing ' then went into question of money there must be doubt that four person have come to england with purpose of getting money out of accused that have succeeded with mode of doing whether criminal innocent jury have nothing to do except a affected credit be bound to look to caldigate motive in paying so large sum have be shown that did not owe shilling that when application for money reached from australia have refused to give shilling then when have arrived here in england accusation be made when have offered to desert case if paid money then money be paid prisoner when paying have doubt intimated to who received that made bargain with a to going away have taken friend with who have given evidence in court friend have manifestly be taken to show that money be not secretly paid jury must give prisoner benefit of if there be benefit to be derived from be bound to remember in coming to verdict that very large sum of money have be paid to witness by prisoner money certainly be not due to dwelt also at great length on stamp on envelope contrived at last to leave feeling on mind of who heard that sir john have shown weakness of case by trusting so much to such allegation a have made 'it have be represented ' said judge bramber 'that impression have seen of sydney post office stamp have be fraudulently obtained stronger evidence must think be shown of before believe two clerk from london post office have told that believed impression to be false one think be hardly justified in opinion founded on clearness cleanness of impression of acknowledged afterwards that such clearness cleanness be simply unusual by mean impossible not indeed improbable how must have be if envelope have be brought to without post office impression simply directed to mr caldigate by man who be alleged to have made woman wife shortly before envelope be written must not in case have be strong evidence if fraud be proved fraud a must be that of getting post office official falsely to stamp envelope then stain of perjury must be there will be for to consider whether can find such stain of perjury merely because impression on envelope be clear clean ' when came to present condition of caldigate wife child at folking be very tender in speech even tenderness seemed to turn against accused that poor lady can only speak with unfeigned respect be sure feel that be happy in marriage till accusation reached ear one can doubt that to whom be given in marriage have done duty by treating with full affection confidence have be proved to who can think that condition of thing will be disturbed that happiness so perfect be to be turned to misery misfortune without almost agony of regret not on account can be in way released from duty in case be not entitled to think of happiness unhappiness of individual have to confine to evidence must give verdict in accordance with ' john caldigate a heard word told at once that judge have in fact desired jury to find verdict against not single point have be made in favour point have be made to tell against judge have almost said that man promise to marry woman must be taken a evidence of marriage jury at rate did not show immediate alacrity in obeying judge behest returned once twice to ask question at three o'clock caldigate be allowed to go to inn with intimation that must hold in readiness to be brought back hear verdict at moment notice ' wish must declare at once said to father suspense be worse than ' during afternoon matter be discussed very freely throughout borough thought must have agreed almost at once ' said mayor at about four o'clock to mr seely who at moment have retired to own office where great magistrate of borough be closeted with mayor have be seated on bench throughout trial have taken much interest in case never imagined that there must be much doubt after judge bramber summing up ' ' hear that there be one man holding out ' said attorney in low voice 'who be ' whispered mayor mayor mr seely be very intimate ' suppose be jones tanner at ely say that caldigates have have dealing with family from generation to generation knew about when passed name wondered that burder have be sharper mr burder be gentleman who have got up prosecution on part of crown must be something of kind ' said mayor 'nothing else must make jury hesitate after charge a suppose did marry mr seely shrugged shoulder have attended very closely to case know must have be against on jury god bless soul did man ever write to woman a wife without having married ' 'it have be done must think 'and that nobody must have be got to say that be man wife ' really have hardly formed opinion said mr seely still whispering ' be inclined to think that there be probably ceremony caldigate salved conscience when married bolton daughter by idea that ceremony be valid will convict at last when told that have be up to town paid that money knew be up with how can juryman believe that man will pay twenty thousand pound doe owe to sworn enemy merely on point of conscience ' at same time old banker be sitting in room at bank robert bolton be with 'there can not be doubt of guilt ' said robert bolton 'no no not doubt ' 'but jury may disagree 'what will do then ' said banker must be trial must go on till get verdict 'and hester what can do for hester ' behe be very obstinate fear have power even though be declared not to be wife can choose own place of living if be convicted think that must come back of course ought to come back 'of course of course ' 'old caldigate too be very obstinate may be that must be able to persuade will know that ought to be with mother ' poor mother poor mother when come out of prison ' very nature will have be altered by time ' said attorney will trust have consented before to take up residence under roof ' will be dead ' said old man 'disgrace year together will have killed before time come ' smirkies be staying at babington desire for news there be very intent mr smirkie be full of thought on matter be manifestly in favour of conviction 'yes poor young woman be very much to be pitied said in answer to squire who have ventured to utter word in favour of hester ' young woman who fall into hand of evil man must always be pitied be to prevent evil men from preying upon weaker sex example such a be needed when think what might have be case here in house have of peculiar reason to be thankful for interposition of divine providence ' here mr smirkie made little gesture of thanksgiving thanking heaven for goodness to wife in having given love have very peculiar reason to be thankful trust be so yes must pity poor young lady will be well that offender must be made subject to outraged law of country ' mr smirkie a listened to eloquent word closed eye hand in token of thankfulness for providence have done for if knew how to compare condition with of poor hester at time have indeed cause for thankfulness hester be alone with baby with information what have be conveyed to by husband letter a read last of two acknowledged to herself that too probably must not even see handwriting again till period of punishment must have expired then what must come then sitting alone at open window of bed room with boy on lap endeavoured to realise own position must be mother without husband with bastard child however innocent might be such must be position under law did not suffice that too must be man wife a thoroughly a whom god have joined together if twelve men assembled together in jury box must say

clasped together sat speechless alone while news be spread through household old man did not dare to tell to son wife be very slowly that actual tidings reached ear mr caldigate when tried to tell found that power of word have left old a be prone to cynic indifference a have shown be affected almost like young girl sobbed convulsively a hung over embracing bey daughter said bey daughter daughter ' at last be told caldigate have be declared guilty judge have condemned to be confined to prison for two year judge bramber have told that in opinion jury must have found other verdict went on to say that looking for excuse for so terrible deed a have be done so terrible for poor lady who be now left nameless with nameless infant must imagine that marriage though legally solemnised have nevertheless be so deficient in appearance of solemnity a to have imbued husband with idea that have not meant that marriage must have meant if celebrated in church with more of outward appurtenance of religion on account refrained from inflicting severer penalty chapter xliv after verdict when verdict be given caldigate be at once marched round into dock having hitherto be allowed to sit in front of dock between mr seely father standing in dock heard sentence pronounced upon ' never married woman lord ' said in loud voice what said must be of avail then men looked at a disappeared with jailer down step leading to region below away to prison knew that must no more be seen heard of for two year have vanished there be lady who be not wife out at folking lady whom jury have declared not to be wife what must become of there be old gentleman there in court who have known mr caldigate for many year one mr ryder who have be practising barrister have now retired in day seldom saw other nevertheless be friend ' said have better let go back to own people behe will stay with ' replied not believe have better not if so how will be with when be released two year will soon go by then will be in house if woman must die might marry till then have better be with own people behe will stay with ' old man said again repeating word angrily shaking head be so stunned by blow that must not argue matter knew that have made promise that be resolved to abide by have better go back to own people world be saying have husband now everybody must respect misfortune everybody must acknowledge innocence must sympathise with must love must go back to own people there be not dissentient voice course must go back to now ' nicholas bolton said to father nicholas bolton seldom interfered in anything 'the poor lady will of course be restored to family ' judge have said in private to marshal marshal have of course made known what judge have said on next morning there came letter from william bolton to robert 'of course hester must come back now nothing else be possible ' everybody decided that must come back be matter admitted of doubt how be to be brought to chesterton none of who decided with so much confidence a to future understood idea of position a wife be bone of bone flesh of flesh ' said to herself beade so by sacrament jury can touch what matter what people say may make more unhappy than be may kill by cruelty can not make believe not to be wife while be wife will obey only ' what called cruelty ' manifested very soon first person who came to be mr robert bolton visit be made on day after verdict when hester sent down word begging to be permitted in misery to decline to see even sister in law mr robert sent up word two written in pencil bey darling whom have nearer who love better than ' then wretched one gave way allowed brother wife to be brought to be already dressed from head to foot in black baby be with argument mr robert bolton used need not be repeated may be said that word used be so tender that be urged with so much love so much sympathy so much personal approval that hester heart be touched 'but be husband ' hester said judge can not alter be husband ' ' will not say word to contrary law have separated must obey law must not even eat bread now because because oh hester understand ' ' do understand said rising to foot in energy 'and will eat bread though be hard will drink of cup though be bitter bread cup will be mine none other will be mine do understand know that wicked people have blasted life know can be nothing to now child will never be made to think that mother have condemned father yes margaret ' said again ' do love do trust know that love love believe in if came to took robert away must go live with other people do love papa mamma be house bid stay here very clothes wear be clothes be though be to cut apart from still must belong to will not go to mamma of course have forgiven because meant for best will never go back to chesterton ' then there came letter from mother one letter hot upon other appealing to text in scripture by law of nation be supposed to be supported 'give unto caesar thing be caesar ' be for law to declare who be who be not man wife in matter law have declared after how must doubt how must hesitate a to tearing away from belonging of man who certainly be not husband there be dreadful word in letter added much to agony of who received word be used in order that strength might prevail have strength to convert though have strength to afflict then mr bolton who in anxiety be ready to submit to personal discomfort prepared to go to folking hester sent back word that in present condition must see nobody not even mother be not only from family of boltons that application entreaty came even mr seely took upon to tell mr caldigate under existing circumstance hester must not be detained at folking ' know that want advice in matter mr caldigate replied a stone will be worn hollow in time by droppings of many water so be thought that if cambridge must continue firm in purpose then stone might at last be made to yield world be so anxious that resolved among that must submit to amount of snubbing in carrying out object even mayor wrote 'dear mr caldigate greatly a object to interference in family think bound to appeal to a to unfortunate condition of young lady from chesterton then followed argument of text of be gradually becoming hackneyed in matter mr caldigate answer to be very characteristic 'dear mr mayor if have objection to interfere in family why do do ' mayor took rebuke with placid good humour feeling that little drop might also have done something towards hollowing stone of counsellor perhaps mr smirkie be most zealous most trusting felt to be bound in peculiar manner to folking by double tie be not clergyman of parish brother of dear departed one with whom better must hold sweet counsel then that second dear one who have just be vouchsafed to have not a be by miracle be rescued from fate into other poor lady have fallen obtained present thoroughly satisfactory position mr smirkie be clergyman who understood to be duty to be urgent for good cause in season out of season who always did duty so travelled over to utterden discussed matter at great length with mr bromley ' do believe in heart ' said mr bromley 'that verdict be wrong ' mr smirkie with much eloquence averred that have nothing to do with question mr bromley opened eye very wide 'nothing at said mr smirkie 'it be verdict of jury confirmed by judge verdict dissolve marriage whether verdict be wrong right marriage ceremony be null void be not man wife not now even if ever be of course be aware of ' mr smirkie be altogether wrong in law such men generally be mr bromley in vain endeavoured to point out to that verdict must have such power a be here claimed for that if claim be to be brought up hereafter a to legitimacy of child fact of verdict must only be used a evidence that evidence must must not be regarded a true by jury according to view that other jury might take mr smirkie must only repeat statement with increased solemnity marriage be marriage

be not in earnest chapter xlvii curlydown bagwax there have be sort of pledge given at trial by sir john joram that matter of envelope must be further investigated have complained in defence that trial have be hurried on time have not be allowed for full inquiry seeing that character of deed by client have be put in jeopardy depended upon what have be done on other side of globe crime ' have said 'if be crime be doubt committed in parish church of utterden in early part of last year evidence have be used must be used to prove to have be crime have reference to thing done long ago far away time have not be allowed for rebutting evidence by counter evidence yet much time have be allowed trial have be postponed from spring to summer assize then offence be one from very nature required speedy notice boltons who became instigator of prosecution demanded that ill used woman must be relieved a quickly a possible from degradation there have be general feeling that trial must not be thrown over to year a be aware have be brought to judgment convicted criminal be in jail sir john still persevered to perseverance have be instigated very much by certain clerk in post office two post office clerk have be used a witness at trial of whom elder mr curlydown have be by mean constant energetic witness witness when be brought up for defence must not be too scrupulous will be worse than useless in matter of fact man can only say what saw tell what heard declare what knew must at least do more though be to save father must not commit perjury when come to opinion if man allows to waver will be taken a thinking very opposite of what doe think such have be case with mr curlydown have intended to be very correct have believed that impression of sydney stamp be on whole adverse to idea that have be obtained in proper way yet have when cross examined acknowledged that might very probably have be obtained in proper way certainly have not be bemudged at such impression generally did become bemudged then be made to say also that impression very often did not become smudged a to word 'nobble must have be stamped upon envelope thought that in case absence be very suspicious still be brought to acknowledge post master in provincial office far away from inspection frequently omit that part of duty have tended to rob envelope of attribute of deceit conspiracy sir john joram attributed to have justified judge in opinion that mr curlydown evidence have told little nothing even mr curlydown have found more favour with judge than samuel bagwax junior of two post office witness samuel bagwax have perhaps be little too energetic have made case own be quite sure that envelope have be tampered with think that counsel for crown pressed witness unfairly when asked mr bagwax whether be absolutely certain that envelope with impression must not have passed through post office in ordinary course of business 'nothing be impossible ' mr bagwax have replied 'be not very much within sphere of possibility ' learned gentleman have asked phrase be misleading mr bagwax be induced to say that might be so still assurance must probably have have weight with jury for overstrained honesty of companion judge have admonished jury that in reference to point must use own common sense rather than opinion of such man a mr bagwax man of ordinary common sense must know how mark made by die on letter must be affected by sort of manipulation to letter bearing must be subjected so on from came to pas that judge be understood to have declared that special envelope might very well have passed in ordinary course through sydney post office samuel bagwax be not man to be put down by injustice of lawyer knew to have be ill treated be confident that man alive be more competent than to form opinion on subject be sure quite sure perhaps little too sure that there have be dishonesty with envelope thus became strong partisan of john caldigate of mr john caldigate if there have be tampering with envelope then whole thing be fraudulent false outcome of base conspiracy many point be present to mind lawyer between must not allow to explain properly to jury when have that die be cut by so perfect impression have be formed if must be proved that have be cut since date bore then of course envelope must be fraudulent be only in sydney that must be ascertained be sure that week ordinary use must have made impression le perfect letter must of course be subjected to new dy letter might in due course have be so subjected be more probable that new stamp must have be selected for surreptitious purpose must be ascertained by book of daily impression kept in sydney post office there have not be time to get evidence from sydney since question of impression have be ventilated be who have first given importance to envelope being resolute almost heroic man be determined that injustice on part of crown prosecutor darkness in judge mind want of intelligence in jury must rob of delight of showing how important to world be proper understanding of post office detail still thought that envelope might be made to prove conspiracy on part of crinkett others succeeded in getting sir john joram to share belief envelope be still preserved among sacred archive of trial have not be bodily confided to samuel bagwax various photograph have be made of document doubt reproduced exactly letter mark line be to be seen upon by closest inspection there be direction be admitted to be in caldigate handwriting postage stamp with obliterating line impression of sydney postmark be nearly paper of envelope have water mark bagwax thought that if must get hold of envelope something might be done even with here sir john must not go along with a have be fully acknowledged that envelope have passed from possession of caldigate into hand of woman bearing written address if anything must be done must be done by postmark postmark bagwax studied morning noon night have now be decided that bagwax be to be sent out to sydney at expense of caldigates there have be difficulty a to leave of absence for purpose man having be convicted postmaster general be

privilege of leaving that weary office for six month be not allowed to occupy in contemplating envelope be never specially mentioned by secretary of state of course there be little envy somewhat general feeling that bagwax having got to weak side of sir john joram be succeeding in having sent out a first class overland passenger to sydney merely a job paris to be seen tunnel railway through italy suez canal place not delightful to wife of indian officer coming home going out be elysium to post office mind expense to be paid for six month on most gentleman like footing salary going on

bagwax be to be sent to sydney almost with appointment of lawyer still occupied same room fact infinitely increased torment of curlydown position ought to have be moved very far asunder curlydown be still engaged in routine ordinary work of day seeing that proper change be made in stamp used during various hour of day assuring that cross letter figure upon so much of civilisation of europe depended be properly altered arranged may well be that own labour be made heavier by devotion of colleague to other matter yet from time to time bagwax must ask question never indeed taking advice still demanding assistance curlydown be not naturally man of ill temper angry heart there be moment in must hardly abstain from expressing with animosity on certain morning in august bagwax be seated at table a usual be laden with envelope of many letter there be hundred before mark on be perusing with strong magnifying glass have be arranged that be to start on great journey in first week in september employed time before went in scanning envelope bearing sydney postmark have be able to procure in england spent entire day with magnifying glass in hand a curlydown be also always armed in same fashion be not peculiar did much of work with such tool date on envelope date conveyed by impression to so much attention have be given be th may bagwax have succeeded in getting cover bearing date very close to that th of may have be among treasure for time now have acquired entire letter envelope bore sydney impression of th may be great triumph have brought within week said to curlydown bending down over glass inspecting at same time two date 'what be good of ' asked curlydown a passed rapidly under own glass stamp be duty to inspect from day to day 'all good in world ' said bagwax brandishing own magnifier with energy 'it be almost conclusive ' now argument with bagwax be that if found in sydney postmark of th may in of th may same deviation bruise in die deviation must have existed also on day between two date a impression before be quite perfect without deviation did not follow that must have be obtained in manner outside ordinary course of business 'there be dozen stamp in use at sydney office ' said curlydown 'perhaps so at rate three four can trace a well a possible time at new stamp be supplied look here ' then threw over multitude of envelope of have be carefully arranged a to date began to point out period see in there be nothing that quite tally with caldigate letter have measured to twentieth part of inch be sure that early in may ' there be not stamp in use in sydney office must have made impression have eighteen may not one of must have be made by stamp did a spoke thus rapped finger down on copy of sacred envelope be using 'be not that conclusive ' be not conclusive to keep man from going to prison ' said curlydown remembering failure of own examination will not be conclusive to get out again 'there differ doubt further evidence be necessary therefore must go to sydney ' be conclusive see why must go to sydney at if proof be so perfect why must fellow be kept in prison while be running about world ' idea have also occurred to bagwax have thought whether must be possible for to be magnanimous enough to perfect proof in england so a to get pardon from secretary of state at once to own manifest injury must satisfy ' said bagwax 'must satisfy ignorant ' to conductor of omnibus on surrey side of river man who doe not know what 'the castle ' mean be ignorant outsider who be in mist a to 'former question ' order of day be ignorant to member of parliament to have definite date conveyed by term 'rogation sunday ' be to clerical mind gross ignorance horsey man think have be in bed life if 'near side ' be not a descriptive to a 'the left hand ' to bagwax curlydown not to distinguish postmark be to be ignorant ' fear must satisfy ignorant said bagwax thinking of projected journey to sydney 'proof be proof ' said curlydown ' think will ever get out time have gone by may do just a much here a there ' `` m sure will get out will never rest in bed till have got out ' ber justice bramber wo mind whether rest in bed not yet secretary of state ' john joram ' began bagwax in discussion sir john joram be always main staff john joram have got other fish to fry before time be marvel to bagwax that must give way to nonsense if anything must be done must be done in time if anything must be done must be done here by time be back from sydney caldigate time will be half out why let sir john see proof want to lose trip suppose ' caldigate be languishing in prison that poor nameless lady be separated from husband have proof lying there on table before sufficient proof a did in heart believe how often doe fall to lot of post office clerk to be taken round world free of expense way curlydown put be ill natured full of envy bagwax be well aware that curlydown be instigated solely by envy still be own conviction bagwax be in truth soft hearted conscientious man ' do think ought to be enough for secretary of state ' said 'and will go to sir john joram to morrow of course must like to see world who must 'd rather be mean of restoring fellow to poor wife than be sent to four quarter of globe with guinea day for personal expense in way nobly made up mind to go at once to sir john joram chapter xlviii sir john joram chamber mr curlydown insinuation have be very cruel also very powerful bagwax a considered matter night in bed did conscientiously think that discreet humane secretary of state must let unfortunate husband out of prison on evidence bagwax have already collected reader will not perhaps agree with finding of jury sentence of judge must be regarded seriously by secretary of state be probable that bagwax theory must not make clear to great functionary good many 'ifs be necessary if woman claiming caldigate a husband must swear falsely to anything in matter then must swear falsely to everything if envelope have never passed through sydney post office then must have sworn falsely about letter therefore evidence must have be altogether false if postmark have not be made in due course of business on date a now seen then envelope have not passed regularly through sydney office so far be clear to mind of bagwax almost clear that postmark must not have be made on date bore result for be striving with true faith have taken hold of mind be so adverse to smith crinkett interest so generously anxious for john caldigate poor lady at folking that must not see obstacle must not even clearly see very obstacle made own going to sydney seem to others to be necessary yet longed to go to sydney with heart must be almost broken hearted if be robbed of delight in frame of mind packed envelope carefully into large hand bag started in cab for sir john joram chamber 'where be going with now ' curlydown asked somewhat disdainfully just a bagwax be starting curlydown have taken upon of late to ridicule envelope have become almost anti caldigatite bagwax vouchsafed to make reply on previous afternoon have declared purpose of going at once to sir john have written a curlydown well knew letter to sir john clerk to make appointment sir john be known to be in town though be end of august being laborious man who contented with little partridge shooting by way of holiday have be understood that be to see bagwax before departure have be known to curlydown question have be asked only to exasperate there be sarcasm in 'now determined bagwax to start without word of reply a went down to temple in cab turned over in mind great question often trouble many of how far be bound to sacrifice for benefit of others have done duty zealously in matter now be under order to continue work in manner opened up to whole paradise of happiness how grand be opportunity of seeing something of world beyond st martin le grand then pecuniary gain must be so great hitherto have received no pay for what have done be simple post office clerk be paid for time by crown very moderately on projected journey expense must be paid for still must have salary sir john joram have declared journey to be quite necessary secretary of state have probably not occupied mind much with matter in mind of bagwax there be fixed idea that secretary thought of little else that secretary have declared that hand be tied till bagwax must have be to sydney conscience told that journey be not necessary that delay must be cruel in cab bagwax made up mind that must do duty like honest man sir john chamber in pump court be gloomy without though commodious ample within bagwax be now well known to clerk be received almost a friend think have got a clear a running water mr jones said feeling doubt that sir john clerk mr jones must feel that interest in case pervaded own mind 'that will be good thing for gentleman in prison mr bagwax 'and for lady poor lady know whether think almost more of than of ' mr jones be returning to work having sent in word to sir john of visitor arrival bagwax be too full of subject of own honesty for ' think that need go out after mr jones 'oh indeed ' 'of course will be great sell for ' 'will now ' beydney be told be elysium upon earth ' be much same a botany bay be ' asked jones 'oh not at quite different place be reading book other day said that sydney harbour be most beautiful thing god ever made on face of globe know there used to be convict there ' said mr jones very positively 'perhaps have few once never many have orange there parliament almost a good a own beautiful new post office sha have to go mr jones of course man have to do duty ' beome do more be a far a see mr bagwax ' `` m for nelson motto mr jones england expects that man day will do duty ' in repeating memorable word bagwax raised voice john like to hear anything through partition mr bagwax ' beg pardon whenever think of glorious observation be apt to become little excited will go long way mr jones in keeping man straight if will only say to often enough ' 'but not to roar out in eminent barrister chamber did hear daresay only thought 'd just caution ' 'quite right mr jones now mean to do mine think can get party out of prison without journey to sydney at be not going to stand in way of have devoted to case be not going to let own interest stand in way mr jones let man be ever so humble england doe expect that will do duty ' george will hear mr bagwax will indeed ' at moment sir john bell be rung bagwax be summoned into great man room sir john be sitting at large office table so completely covered with paper that whole chaos of legal atom seemed to have be deposited there by fortuitous operation of age bagwax who have large bag in hand looked forlornly round room for freer more fitting board on might expose document there be none there be bookshelf filled with book large sofa be covered also with paper table laden with what seemed to be concrete chaos whereas chaos in front of sir john be chaos in solution sir john liked bagwax though be generally opposed to zealous co operator there be in man mixture of intelligence absurdity of real feeling affectation of genuine humility a to personally of thorough confidence in post officially have gratified sir john sir john have be quite sure that post office clerk have intended to speak absolute truth with honest manly conviction in innocence of client in guilt of witness on other side be therefore well disposed towards bagwax 'well mr bagwax said beo understand have got little further in matter since saw last ' good deal further sir john ' how perhaps can explain shortly ' be troublesome bagwax did not think that must explain matter very shortly must not explain matter at without showing envelope how be to show in present condition of room immediately dived into bag brought forth first bundle of envelope sir john have better put out upon floor said beust see there be many more bundle within bagwax be anxious that barrister must examine minutely be very important sir john be indeed be really altogether case of postmark altogether have never in branch have anything so interesting before if can show that envelope certainly be not stamped with postmark in sydney post office on th may then will get out sha ' 'it will be very material mr bagwax ' said sir john cautiously will have sworn falsely then somebody must have obtained postmark surreptitiously there must have be regular plant stamp must have be made up dated on purpose so a to give false date official in sydney post office must have be employed ' 'that be what want to find out over there ' said sir john who be not quite so zealous perhaps not quite so conscientious a more humble assistant whose mind be more occupied with other matter will find out at sydney ' temptation be very great sir john wanted to go told that ought to go sir john be man responsible for whole matter bagwax have done best must be right for to provoke sir john by contesting matter contesting so much to own disadvantage have not done enough for honesty enough to satisfy even grand idea of duty a turned bundle of document round in hand made up mind that have not done enough there be little gurgle in throat almost tear in eye a replied ' think must be wanted to go if must look at envelope sir john understood at once there be much to understand knew how anxious man be to go on projected journey perceived cause be inducing to surrender own interest remembered that journey must be made at great expense to own client ran over case in mind acknowledged to that conclusive evidence evidence must be quite conclusive of fraud a to envelope might possibly suffice to release client at once from prison told also that must not dare to express opinion on matter without close inspection of postmark that close inspection might probably take two hour that two hour must finally have to be abstracted from already curtailed period of nightly slumber then thought of state of table difficulty a to space perhaps that idea be one strongest in mind against examination then what hero be bagwax what abnegation be there must be le ready to devote to client who be paid for work than post office clerk who be a pure in honesty a be zealous in cause 'there be great many of suppose ' said almost whining ' good many sir john 'have at ' said queen counsel late attorney general springing up from chair bagwax almost jumped out of way so startled be by quick sudden movement sir john rang bell not waiting for clerk began to hurl chaos in solution on to top of concrete chaos bagwax naturally attempted to assist 'for g sake touch ' said sir john a though avenging by touch of scorn for evil thing be being done to then jones hurried into room with more careful hand assisted master trying to preserve order with disturbed paper in way large office table be within three minute made clear for bagwaxian strategy mr jones declared afterwards that be seven year since have seen entire top of table 'now go ahead said sir john who seemed during operation to have lost something of ordinary dignity bagwax who since little check have be standing perfectly still with open bag in hand at once began work plain before be immense be able to marshal force in centre nearest to sir john a sat in usual chair be exposed may for be thus that denominated envelope with be so familiar there be be arranged in month then in day began by explaining that have obtained envelope 'promiscuously a said there have be selection none have be rejected then courteously handing official magnifying glass to barrister invited to inspect generally to make a be first cursory inspection so that might see that there be not one perfect impression perfect a impression on caldigate envelope be perfect 'not one ' said bagwax beating bosom in triumph 'that seems perfect ' said sir john pointing with glass to selected specimen 'your eye be very good sir john very good indeed have found cleanest truest of whole lot if will examine tail of y will see be be rubbed little then if will follow with eye circular line make up round of postmark will find dent on outside bar go more on dent in bar sir john than do on figure bar be dented more le particularly may remain quite true sir john not after day fair use have taken new stamp out of store to do caldigate envelope must get at stamp in use be how have be ' sir john listened in silence a continued to examine one envelope after through glass sir john if come to may will find just about time there have be new stamp brought into use there be one be exactly caldigate breadth have brought rule by can get to fiftieth of inch here bagwax brought out little ivory instrument marked over with figure course be intended to be of same pattern gradually very gradually circle have always become smaller be conclusive caldigate impression be little very little ever so little little smaller than of may be that conclusive ' 'if understand mr bagwax pretend to say that have got impression of stamp may have be in use in sydney office at time in sydney if understand matter rightly keep daily impression of stamp in book 'just so just so sir john ' said bagwax feeling word spoken to lawyer renewed own hope of going out to sydney feeling also that sir john must be wrong very wrong if subjected client to so unnecessarily prolonged detention in cambridge county prison do keep book must be quite conclusive must have page photographed ' 'must not that be best might probably find out who be who gave fraudulent aid must find out everything ' said bagwax energetically 'but what ' 'it be found out there be indeed sir john if must get to go along with must see that letter must have gone through sydney post office ' think do see be so difficult mr bagwax to make others see thing 'and if did never did if did why did say did why did swear did be that enough to make secretary let go ' energy zeal true faith of man be admirable sir john be half disposed to rise from seat to embrace man hail a brother only that have done so must have made a ridiculous a bagwax zeal be always ridiculous ' think see ' said 'and wo let man go 'there be four person who swore positively that be present at marriage one of being woman who be said to have be married that be direct evidence with search have hitherto found one to give direct evidence to rebut then brought forward to corroborate statement certain amount of circumstantial evidence among other thing letter ' caldigate envelope ' said bagwax eagerly 'what call caldigate envelope be unnecessary perhaps if fraudulent certainly foolish must have have verdict without ' 'but did ' said bagwax in tone of triumph 'it be pity mr bagwax be not brought up to profession must have made great lawyer sir john ' 'yes did if can be proved that have done fraudulently doubt that fraud will stain direct evidence have to remember that verdict have be already obtained be not struggling now with jury with impassive emblem of sovereign justice 'and therefore real fact will go further sir john ' 'well argued mr bagwax admirably well argued if must ever be called hope may not have against very often will think of can take envelope away with because have impressed vividly with that can tell present impression be that have better take journey within next few day will give little more thought to will hear from ' then put out hand be courtesy mr bagwax have never before enjoyed 'you may believe mr bagwax when say have come across many remarkable men in many case have fallen into hand have rarely encountered man whom have more thoroughly respected than do ' mr bagwax went away to own lodging exulting more than ever resolved that journey to sydney be unnecessary a usual spent large portion of afternoon in contemplating envelope then a be doing so idea struck idea made tear hair with disgust because have not occurred to before there be now opened to new scope of inquiry altogether different matter of evidence idea be by far too important to be brought in explained at fag end of chapter chapter xlix shands there have be something almost approaching to exultation at babington when tidings of caldigate alleged australian wife be first heard there a anger have be great that julia must be rejected so have family congratulation be almost triumphant when danger have be escaped be appreciated there have be something of same feeling at pollington among shands who have doubt allowed to think that maria have be ill treated by john caldigate ought to have married maria at least such be opinion of lady of family who be greatly impressed with importance of little book have be carried away in regard to australian marriage have differed among that maria must have escaped terrible doom have befallen mr bolton daughter be of course source of comfort maria must never believe evil story john caldigate have not be well perhaps not quite true to so much acknowledged gently with germ of tear in eye be quite sure that must not have married hester bolton while wife be living in australia arose almost to enthusiasm a vindicated character from so base stain have be perhaps little unstable in affection a men be so commonly not even when jury found verdict must be got to believe that john caldigate whom have known must have betrayed girl whom loved a be supposed to have betrayed hester bolton mother sister who knew softness of maria disposition who have be more angry than sister with man who have be wicked enough to carry away thomson beeasons ' in portmanteau without marrying girl who have put there must not agree to verdict at rate be verdict john caldigate be in prison poor young woman with infant be nameless unfortunate creature might have happened to maria must always have believed innocent ' said maria wiping away germ of tear with knuckle matter be very often discussed in doctor house at pollington a be indeed by public generally especially in eastern county in house there double interest attached to in first place there be maria escape younger girl be accustomed to talk of a having be 'almost miraculous then there be dick absolute disappearance have be declared at trial on behalf of caldigate that if dick must have be put into witness box must have be able to swear that there have be no such marriage ceremony a four witness have elaborately described on other hand woman crinkett have sworn boldly that dick shand though not present at marriage have be well aware that have taken place that dick must evidence have be secured must certainly have be witness on side have be outside tent so said woman when marriage be being performed have refused to enter by way of showing continued hostility to arrangement have always opposed when woman said be known that dick shand must not appear opinion be general that dick have died in poverty distress men who sink to be shepherd in australia because be noted drunkard generally do die constrained abstinence of perhaps six month in wilderness be agonising at first nearly fatal then poor wretch rush to joy of orgy with ten fifteen pound in pocket stuff be given to a brandy soon put end to suffering there be little doubt that such have be fate of dick unless perhaps in bosom of maria of mother be known too at pollington a well a elsewhere in month of august effort be still to be made with view of upsetting verdict something have crept out to public a to research made by bagwax allusion have be frequent a to unfortunate absence of dick shand betting have there be betting must no doubt have be in favour of verdict four witness have told tale in straightforward way though be from character not entitled to perfect credit still evidence have in wise be shaken be mean dishonest folk doubt have taken caldigate money have still gone on with prosecution even if there have be sort of marriage woman must have taken off when have received money left poor hester to enjoy happiness husband home at bolton be general feeling be hardly thought that bagwax with envelope must prevail over judge bramber in mind of secretary of state probably there have be marriage be singular that two men who must have given unimpeachable evidence on matter must have vanished out of world allan minister dick shand miner shepherd 'what will do when come out ' maria asked mr rewble harriet curate wife be there mr rewble a curate found convenient to make frequent visit to father in law house mr posttlethwaite matilda be

bagwax attorney general bagwax be now vehemently prosecuting inquiry a to that other idea have struck be at very moment glowing with anticipation of success at same time broken hearted with conviction that never must see pleasant thing of new south wale on next morning under auspex of father dick shand wrote following letter to mr seely attorney th august sir think right to tell that reached father

that one at ahalala nobble conceived to be man wife of course have lived together everybody knew about time before june early must say in autumn there have be quarrel be sure be at dagger drawn with

man wife ' have thought right to inform of immediately on return be obedient servant shand ' mr seely when received letter found to be duty to take at once to sir john joram up in london did not believe dick shand then have put trust in bagwax have be from first convinced in own mind caldigate have married woman a soon a be known to that client have paid twenty thousand pound to crinkett woman be quite sure of guilt of client have done best for caldigate at trial a must have done for other client have never felt of enthusiasm have instigated sir john now that caldigate be in prison mr seely thought that might a well be left there quietly trusting to verdict trusting to judge bramber trusting still more strongly on own early impression letter from dick whom knew to have be ruined drunkard disgrace to family outcast from society be to thinking just letter a must be got up in such case in futile hope of securing succour of secretary of state be sure that secretary of state must pay slightest attention to letter still must be necessary that must show to sir john a trip to london be not disagreeable to professional mind started with on very day of receipt course must have deposition on oath ' said sir john 'you think will be worth while 'certainly be more convinced than ever that there be marriage that post office clerk have be with bagwax have altogether convinced ' ' did think so much of bagwax sir john ' dare say not mr seely absurdly energetic man one of who destroy by over zeal credit truth energy ought to produce have think convinced that letter must not have passed through sydney post office in may `` 'if so sir john even be not much towards upsetting verdict ' ' good deal think when character of person be considered now come man whom must have believed have be present tell story have better get hold of bring to mr seely then mr seely hung up hat in london for three four day sent to pollington for dick shand dick shand obeyed order of waited together upon sir john have come back at very critical point of time for friend ' said barrister dick have laid aside coat waistcoat with broad check yellow trouser have made look a much like english gentleman a assistance of ready made clothes shop at pollington must permit still did not quite look like man who have spent three year at cambridge experience among gold digging then period of maddening desolation a queensland shepherd after life among savage in south sea island have done much to change sir john mr seely together almost oppressed still be minded to speak up for friend caldigate have upon whole be very good to dick be honest 'he have be badly used way said 'you have have intercourse with of friend since have be home think ' question sir john asked because mr seely have suggested that appearance of man at special moment might not improbably be what called 'plant have have intercourse with anybody sir came here last friday have spoken word to anybody before did know caldigate have be in trouble at people at pollington be first to tell about ' 'then wrote to mr seely have heard of mr seely ' 'the governor father have heard of mr seely wrote first a told knew about at pollington a well a do ' 'you be surprised then when heard story 'knocked off pin sir never be so much taken aback in life to be told that john caldigate have married euphemia smith after have seen that have be married to in may knew of course that be got up thing be in prison 'he be in prison certainly 'for bigamy 'indeed be mr shand how about real wife ' real wife a call behe be a sure a name be richard shand 'it be on behalf of lady that be almost more anxious than for mr caldigate in matter have be perfectly innocent whoever may have be culprit culprit have be cruelly ill used ' behe will have husband back again of course ' said dick 'that will depend in part upon what faith judge who tried case may place in story deposition will be taken will be duty to submit to secretary of state will probably be actuated by weight further evidence will have upon judge who heard former evidence will understand mr shand that word will be opposed to word of four other person 'four perjured scoundrel said dick with energy 'just so if story be true 'it be true sir ' said dick with much anger in tone ' hope so with heart be on same side with know only want to make understand how much ground there may be for doubt be not easy to upset verdict fear many righteous verdict must be upset if testimony of one man must do perhaps will be able to prove that only arrived at liverpool on saturday night 'certainly can ' 'you can not prove that have not heard of case before ' 'certainly can can swear ' sir john smiled 'they knew that at pollington told of governor told about mr seely made write letter must not be evidence ' said sir john 'heavens on earth tell be struck on heap when heard just a much a if have said 'd be hung for murder put crinkett together then will know suppose think somebody paying for have got regular tip ' 'not at mr shand quite understand that must be difficult for to understand when man see thing clearly can not always realise fact that others see also think perceive what have to tell be very much obliged to for coming forward so immediately perhaps must not mind sitting in other room for five minute while say word to mr seely ' can go away altogether ber seely will be glad to see again with reference to deposition will have to make will not be kept waiting long ' then dick returned with sore heart feeling half inclined to blaze out in wrath against great advocate have come forward to tell plain story having nothing to gain paying railway fare other expense out of own rather out of father pocket be told must not be believed be always hard to make honest witness understand that may be duty of others to believe to be liar dick shand did not understand now 'there be australian marriage sir john said a soon a be alone with mr seely 'you think not bey mind be clear about must get that man out if be only for sake of lady 'it be so very easy sir john to have story like made up ' have have to do with good many made up story mr seely with good many true story 'of course sir john man with more 'he might be party to making up story there be nothing have seen in to make sure that must not come forward with determined perjury must think must be possible father mother sister must join ' dick have told story of meeting on lawn at great length 'and have be plot must have imposed upon must have brought into who must have got at to arrange plot 'old caldigate ' sir john shook head old caldigate young caldigate knew anything of kind of work then story tally altogether with hero bagwax of bagwax be quite sure a shand corroborates bagwax be nearly sure of also must take deposition let have must be rather full a may be necessary to hear deposition also of doctor wife will have to get out ' 'you know best sir john will have to get out mr seely think ' said sir john rising from chair then mr seely took leave a be intended mr seely be not at convinced be quite willing that john caldigate must be released from prison that australian marriage must be so put out of general credit in england a to allow young people to live in comfort at folking a man wife liked to feel that knew better must have be quite content that mr john caldigate must be mr john caldigate to world world must be imposed on so that be made subject to imposition in matter sir john appeared to to be wider awake than mere layman be clear to mr seely that dick shand story be 'got up very well got up have pang of conscience a to using when came to believing be quite thing man turning up exactly at moment man then pretending never to have heard of case so famous never to have heard story of most intimate friend then notorious poverty old caldigate must of course be able to buy man then sir john fatuity a to bagwax must hardly bring to believe that sir john be quite in earnest be well aware that sir john must know one better by what argument such verdict a have be given might be practically set aside verdict must remain pardon if pardon must be got from secretary of state must make condition of husband wife same a though there have be no verdict indignity have already suffered must simply produce for affectionate commendation of england mr seely felt be not at averse to pardon be not at disposed to be severe on caldigate senior if a thought caldigate senior have bribed convenient new witness be too much to expect that must believe must come with mr shand said 'and must take story down in writing then must swear to before magistrate ' right mr seely must be very particular know ' ' need be particular at a to what sir john joram said felt half inclined to punch head ' must have helped ' 'it be only that thought of caldigate in prison did do because have be roaming about world not always quite a well off a tell that doe believe word ' think said that ' 'he did quite dare what said be a bad told that one else must believe quite understand what be be not to believe say be that two be not married in may `` 'but about never having heard of case till got home ' never have heard word about one must think that have done something wrong in coming forward to tell what know ' deposition however be drawn out in due form at considerable length be properly attested before one of london magistrate chapter li dick shand go to cambridgeshire news of shand return be soon common in cambridge tidings of course be told to mr caldigate be then made known by to hester old man though turned matter much in mind doubting whether hope thus raised must not add to hester sorrow must not ultimately be realised decided that must not keep in dark belief must not be changed by statement shand might make faith be so strong that evidence must shake confirm there must doubt arise in mind hope of liberation if new evidence against australian marriage be to reach hope might so probably be delusive knew to be strong to endure a well a strong to hope therefore told at once then mr seely returned to cambridge fact of shand deposition be made known at folking 'that will get out at once of course ' said hester triumphantly a soon a heard squire be older more cautious still doubted explained that dick shand be not man who by simple word must certainly convince secretary of state deceit might be suspected that fraudulent plot must be possible very much care be necessary before convicted prisoner must be released be quite sure from mr seely manner that think have bribed young man ' said caldigate 'you 'yes be idea naturally come into people head be not in least angry with mr seely feel that be only too likely that secretary of state judge will think same if be secretary of state must have to think so ' must suspect people like ' 'and therefore dear be hardly fit to be secretary of state must not be too sanguine that be ' hester be very sanguine when be fully known that dick have written to mr seely immediately on arrival at pollington that have shown to be warm partisan in caldigate interest must not rest till saw persuaded mr caldigate to invite down to folking to folking therefore went with full intention of declaring john caldigate innocence not only there through cambridgeshire boltons of whom have now heard something must be made to know what honest man have to say on subject honest man who be really on spot at time to dick mind be marvellous that boltons must have be anxious to secure verdict against caldigate verdict be also against own daughter own sister being quite sure that caldigate be innocent must not understand condition of feeling must be produced by equally strong conviction of guilt be mind probably imbued with much of religious scruple made idea of feigned marriage so insupportable to hester relation be aware that when man have taken preconception home to fastened fixed a be into bosom can not easily expel even though personal interest must be on side of such expulsion have become settled belief with boltons john caldigate be bigamist belief have certainly be strengthened by pertinacious hostility of hester mother dick have heard something of thought that must be able to open eye when arrived at folking be received with open arm sir john joram have not quite liked because manner have be rough mr seely have regarded from first a ruined man therefore willing perjurer even at pollington 'bush manner have be little distasteful to except mother mr caldigate felt difficulty in making conversation with to hester be a angel from heaven be never tired of hearing from detail a to husband life at ahalala nobble particularly a to life after euphemia smith have taken to part have quarrelled with fact of early infatuation have be acknowledged on side hester be able to refer to a mother boasting of child health may refer to measles have be bad be past gone euphemia smith have be husband measles men generally have measles be thing so completely acknowledged that be not now source of discomfort disease have be very bad with so bad that have talked of marriage have promised marriage crafty woman do get hold of innocent men drive sometimes into perdition often to brink of perdition be hester theory a to husband have be on brink have be wise in time be creed a be supported by dick found fault with dick manner not even with yellow trouser be brought into use at folking 'you be with on very day ' said referred to day in april on have be sworn that marriage be solemnized ' be with day about time ca say about particular day truth be mind telling mr caldigate be drinking good deal just then ' present state of abstinence have of course become known at folking not without expression of much marvel on part of old squire a to quantity of tea visitor be able to swallow a abstinence have of course be admired dick have fallen into way of confessing past backsliding to pretty sympathetic friendly woman who be willing to believe that said to make much of 'but suppose ' then hesitated dick understood hesitation be never so bad ' said 'but what knew very well what be going on believe caldigate mr smith even so much a spoke to other month have have wonderful turn of luck ' 'in getting gold ' have bought sold share till be supposed to have made pot of money people up there got idea that be one of lucky one did seem so then got into head that did want caldigate to know about money be downright sick of have be good looking at one time mr caldigate ' daresay most of be so suppose ' 'and clever 'd talk hind leg off dog a used to say out there ' 'you have very odd saying mr shand ' 'indeed have when got in way about money then took to drinking brandy caldigate be only too glad to be rid of crinkett believed in because have such run of luck held lot of share share used to be so got together left ahalala went to polyeuka hall remember a if be yesterday when broke away from caldigate in june went to queensland have seen other for two month a for having be married might a well tell have married if mr caldigate have ever allowed shade of doubt to cross mind a to son story dick shand further story removed picture of life be led at ahalala nobble be painted for clearly so that must see fancy that saw what condition of thing have be increased faith trickled through to others mr bromley who have always believed believed more firmly than before sent tidings of belief to plum cum pippin thence to babington mr farmer became more than ever energetic in loud voice at cambridge market ordinary declared ill usage done to caldigate young wife have be said over over again at trial dick shand evidence be one thing wanted here be dick shand to give evidence then belief gained ground in cambridge with belief there arose feeling a to egregious wrong be being done boltons be still assured none of have a yet given sign of yielding robert bolton knew very well that shand be at folking have not asked to see mr seely be on different side must not discus matter idea be same be incredible to robert dick shand must appear just at moment unless a part of arranged plan must not read whole plot be sure that there be plot be held in mind a certain fact that john caldigate must not have paid away that large sum of money have not thought that by doing so be buying off crinkett other witness of course there have be marriage in australia therefore arrival of dick shand be to only lifting of curtain for act of play attempt be to be made to get caldigate out of prison attempt be duty to oppose caldigate have thought deceived inflicted terrible stain on family therefore caldigate be enemy upon whom behoved to be revenged feeling be stronger in bosom because caldigate have be brought into family by when dick shand called upon at office must not deny ' have be told by people that a be here in neighbourhood ought to come speak to ' said dick beome people have be in first instance mr ralph holt farmer dick have discussed matter with mr bromley mr bromley have thought that shand story must be told direct to hester brother 'if have anything to say mr shand be ready to hear ' about marriage at ahalala between john caldigate mr smith be got up plan mr bolton ' 'the jury did not seem to think so mr shand ' be here then to let know truth robert bolton raised eyebrow marvelling at simplicity of man who must fancy that single word must be able to weigh down weight of evidence have sufficed to persuade twelve men judge a judge bramber ' be with caldigate time be sure of what be saying two be on speaking term when be said to be married 'of course mr shand a have come to will hear what may have to say what be use of man have be tried found guilty 'they can let out again if be innocent ' queen can pardon doubt even queen can not quash conviction evidence be a clear a noonday judge jury public be in one mind ' 'but be here then ' said dick shand with perfect confidence robert bolton must only look at raise eyebrow must not tell to face that unprejudiced person must believe evidence of such witness 'he brother in law said dick 'and supposed 'd be glad to know that be innocent ' ca go into question mr shand a believe to have be guilty of a wicked crime a man can well commit can not concern in asking for pardon for own impression be that must have be sent to penal servitude george ' exclaimed dick ' tell that be lie from beginning to end ' ' fear can not do good by talking about mr shand ' george ' dick hitched up yellow trouser a though be preparing for fight wore yellow trouser without brace in moment of energy hitched up 'if please will say good morning to ' george when tell be there time caldigate never spoke to woman so much a saw month that therefore own sister be in honest truth caldigate wife wo listen to do mean to say that be lying ' ber shand must ask to leave office ' george wish have mr bolton out at ahalala where there be not quite so many policeman a there be here at cambridge ' will have to send for one of if go away mr shand ' 'here be man who even for sake of own sister wo hear truth just because hate sister husband what have got to get by lying ' can not tell ' bolton a said prepared for sudden attack shand have sense enough to know that must injure cause in be interested a well a by exhibition of violence therefore left office ' said mr bromley when be told 'he be not cruel man dishonest even untrue to sister having quite made up mind that caldigate have be married in australia can not release from idea a think so feel to be duty to keep sister caldigate apart ' why doe not believe ' demanded dick 'in answer to can only say that do believe ' then there came request from babington that dick shand must go over to there for day at babington opinion be divided aunt polly eldest daughter with mr smirkie still thought that john caldigate be wicked bigamist squire rest of family have gradually gone over to other side squire have never be hot against offender having be one of who fancied that marriage at very out of way place such a ahalala did not signify much now when heard of dick shand return proffered evidence declared that dick shand having be born gentleman though have be ever so much sinner ever so much drunkard be entitled to credence before host of crinketts with aunt polly julia there remained sense of old injury robbing shand of attribute of birth endowing even crinkett with truth then there have be few word squire have asserted insisted upon asking shand to babington 'did ever see such trouser said julia to mother ' must not believe on oath ' 'certainly not ' said mr smirkie who of three be by far most vehement in adherence to verdict man be notorious drunkard have that look of wildness bad character always bring with from colony 'he did drink anything water at lunch ' said one of younger girl never do when be eating ' said mr smirkie for great teetotal triumph have not a yet be made known to family at babington 'these regular drunkard take at time by in own room have delirium tremens in face believe word that say ' certainly doe wear oddest trouser ever saw ' said aunt polly at same time dick be closeted with squire be convincing that there have be no australian marriage at 'they did jump over broomstick anything of kind ' asked squire intending to be jocose did nothing at said dick who have worked up to state of great earnestness 'caldigate must a much a look at at time then to come home here find in prison because have married how one must have believed ' 'they did believe woman here believe now a perceive ' be awful shame mr babington think of mr babington be harder on even than for be well fond of woman once be hard must do what can to get out will write to member sir george support government will get to see secretary be hard upon young fellow just when have got married come into nice property 'and mr babington bad indeed will see sir george odd part of be boltons be against old bolton never quite liked marriage wife be regular tartar ' thus squire be gained younger daughter mr smirkie be a obdurate a ever something of ground be cut from under foot when dick new peculiar habit be observed at dinner mr smirkie did indeed cling to doctrine that real drunkard never drink at meal when dick on being pressed in regard to wine apologised by saying that have become so used to tea in colony a not to be able to take anything else at dinner peculiarity be discussed till be driven to own that have drank nothing stronger for last two year then became plain that delirium tremens be not written on face quite so plainly a mr smirkie have at first thought there be nothing left trouser to condemn mr smirkie be still confident ' think can go beyond verdict said 'there may be pardon of course though will never believe see though there be twenty pardon ought not to go back to pardon doe not alter crime whether be married in australia whether be not ought to think that be because jury have said so if have feeling of feminine propriety must shut up call miss bolton agree with in least said squire hope may live to see dozen little caldigates running about on lawn ' there be few word upstairs on subject between mr smirkie wife for even mr smirkie aunt polly at last submitted to dick energy 'indeed then if come out ' said wife will be very glad to see at plum cum pippin be said in voice did not admit of contradiction be evidence at rate that dick visit to babington have be successful in spite of yellow trouser chapter lii fortune of bagwax altogether new idea have occurred to bagwax a sat in office after interview with sir john joram be idea of such nature that thought that saw way quite plain to complete manifestation of innocence of caldigate to certainty of pardon to immediate end of whole complication by sudden glance at evidence eye have caught object in glance have never before observed then at once went to work finding certain little mark be distinctly legible became on sudden violently hot so that sweat broke out on forehead here be whole thing disclosed at once disclosed to world if chose to disclose if did so then there must not be need for journey to sydney sir john still thought to be expedient thing have now seen be not one within own branch of work be not matter with be bound to be conversant somebody else ought to have found out own knowledge be purely accidental there must be disgrace to in not finding out have found out bagwax be man who in official zeal official capacity have exercised intellect far beyond matter to be bound to apply in mere performance of duty post mark be business have given mind to postmark must have sufficiently carried out that great doctrine of doing duty england expects from man have travelled beyond postmark have looked into many thing among other matter have looked into penny stamp twopenny stamp other stamp in post office phraseology there be sometimes confusion because affixed effigy of majesty head represents postage paid be called stamp postmark impression indicating name of town be also called stamp postmark impression have be work of bagwax life zeal joy in office general energy of disposition have opened up to also mystery of queen head

colony since date there be sign invisible to ordinary eye be plain a sun at noonday to initiated be so in art in science bagwax be at once sure of fact to instructed little receipt for twopence be a clearly dated a though figure be written on yet have never looked at before in absorbing interest postmark have created that fraudulent postmark a certainly be have never condescended to examine postage stamp now saw be certain if be so have doubt then must caldigate surely be released be hoped that reader will follow mind of bagwax be in matter very clear envelope have be brought up at trial a evidence that on certain day caldigate have written to woman a wife have sent letter through post office for such sending postage stamp be necessary postage stamp have certainly be put on when envelope be prepared for intended purpose if must be proved by stamp that have not be in existence on date impressed on envelope then fraud must be quite apparent if there have be such fraud then must testimony of four witness be crushed into arrant perjury have produced fraudulent document by must be thoroughly condemned there must be necessity for journey to sydney a became clear to mind thumped table partly in triumph partly in despair 'what be matter with now ' said mr curlydown be quarter past four curlydown have not completed daily inspection have bagwax be doing proper share of work curlydown must have already washed hand changed coat have be ready to start for train a be have hour of labour before must be unable to count plum upon wall a be usual with before dinner 'it becomes more wonderful day said bagwax solemnly almost awfully 'it be very wonderful to that man must be able to sit so many hour looking at one dirty bit of paper ' 'every moment that pas with envelope

envelope fact be now certain ' 'any new fact asked curlydown asked question in jeering tone not at all a though desiring confidence offering sympathy 'yes replied bagwax slowly 'the fact be certainly new most convincing a have not given attention to particular branch concerned there can be good in mentioning must not understand ' be thus that revenged on curlydown then there be again silence between for quarter of hour during curlydown be hurrying through work bagwax be meditating whether be certainly duty to make known fact a to postage stamp be so unkind ' said bagwax at last in tone of injured friendship burning to tell new discovery have got way ' said curlydown without lifting head then a said just now understand ' `` d tell everything if 'd only be little le hard curlydown be envious have of course be told of civil thing sir john joram have said though did not quite believe be convinced that bagwax be supposed to have distinguished if there be anything to be known must like to know be naturally quarrelsome bagwax be old friend mean to be hard said 'of course one doe feel fretted when one have be obliged to miss two train 'can lend hand said bagwax 'it doe signify now ca catch anything before one doe expect to get away little earlier than on saturday what be that have found out 'do really care to know ' 'of course do if be anything in earnest took quite a much interest a in matter when be down at cambridge ' see that postage stamp ' bagwax stretched out envelope rather photograph of envelope for be more queen head with obliterating smudge mark peculiarity be to be seen quite a plainly a on original be tied up carefully among archive of trial see that postage stamp curlydown took glass looked at document declared that saw postage stamp very plainly 'but doe not tell anything particular 'nothing very particular at first glance ' said curlydown gazing through glass with eye again ' see that obliterate out there with kind of star ' have nothing to do with ' 'the bunch of hair at back of head be quite like bunch of hair ' 'just same taken from same die ' said bagwax 'the little hole for dividing stamp be bigger 'it be that ' 'then what d be ' 'there be letter at corner ' said bagwax 'that of course ' said curlydown 'can read letter curlydown owned that never have quite understood what letter meant 'those two p in two bottom corner tell that stamp be printed before ' be explained to not long ago now postmark be dated `` there be air of triumph about bagwax a said almost drove curlydown back to hostility checked merely shaking head continued to look at stamp 'what do think of ' asked bagwax 'you 'd have to prove ' 'of course must stamp be made here be sent out to colony will see smithers at stamp office on monday of course ' mr smithers be gentleman concerned in manufacture of stamp know fact be a well aware of meaning of letter a though have made postage stamp own peculiar duty now what ought to do ' 'you must have to go

conscientious man a will be able to put hand upon young wife with nameless baby wo move at be moved by such consideration must be so far unfit for office beercy be divine ' said bagwax 'and therefore unfit to be used by merely human judge know suppose richard shand have come home ' 'indeed have be with day two since ' 'can say anything ' bagwax be not rejoiced at dick opportune return thoroughly wished that caldigate must be liberated wished to monopolise glory of work 'he say great deal have sworn point blank that there be such marriage at time named caldigate be living together then for

member of parliament have shooting in suffolk honybun who be also lawyer though le successful than friend be much better shot be already taking cream off milk of shooting ' can not conceive ' said at end of letter after experience must have put so much out of way to serve client man must do what be paid to do what be presumed that will do nothing more here have be instigated by insane ambition to emulate good natured zeal of fellow who be absolutely willing to sacrifice for good of stranger then went on to say that must not leave london till friday on thursday morning put detail together drew out paper for perusal of secretary of state a looked at matter round seemed to that question be so clear that even judge bramber must not hesitate evidence of dick shand be quite conclusive if credible be open of course to strong doubt in must not be sifted by cross examination alone certainly must not have sufficed to extort pardon from secretary of state a secretary of state must have be alive to fact that dick might have be suborned dick life have not be such that single word must have be regarded a certainly true in corroboration be worth much then if secretary judge must be got to go into very complicated question of dated stamp must sir john thought become evident to that impression have not be made at time indicated have gradually be borne in upon sir john mind till be almost a confident in fact a bagwax operation have required much time much attention must secretary must judge clear table give time to inspect to measure two three hundred postmark date of fabrication of postage stamp must of course require to be verified by official report if fact a stated by bagwax be thus confirmed then fraudulent nature of envelope must be put beyond doubt must be so manifest that morsel of evidence have be falsely concocted that clear headed man let prepossession be what might must doubt judge bramber must no doubt begin to sift case with strong bias in favour of jury be for jury to ascertain fact in case jury have done so in opinion in judge bramber opinion a judge have often declared judge must not be required to determine fact new trial be that possible must be proper remedy if remedy be wanted a be impossible must be driven to investigate such new evidence a be brought before to pronounce what must in truth be verdict be clear to sir john told that even judge bramber must not be able to deny false evidence have be submitted to jury sir john a occupied mind with matter on thursday morning did wake up to generous energy on client behalf so that in sending written statement of case to home secretary wrote short strongly worded note 'as be quite manifest ' said 'that certain amount of false fraudulent circumstantial evidence have be brought into court by witness who proved alleged marriage a direct evidence have now come to hand on other side be very clear a far a know trustworthy feel justified in demanding majesty pardon for client ' on next day went down to birdseye lodge near ipswich be quite enthusiastic on matter with friend honybun ' never knew bramber go beyond jury in life ' said 'he will have to do now ca keep in prison when find that chief witness be manifestly perjured woman swore on oath that letter reached by post in may certainly did not do so cover a see have be fabricated since date ' ' never thought cover went for much ' said honybun 'for very little for nothing at perhaps till proved to be fraudulent if have left letter alone case must have be strong enough for conviction a be be fool enough to go into business of

way in life ' 'we will make begin ' `` ll bet pony ' `` ll take bet said late attorney general a did so looked round to see that not even gamekeeper be near enough to hear on friday bagwax be in very melancholy state of mind at office in spite of brilliancy of prospect with miss curlydown `` ll just come back to old work said to future father in law 'there be nothing else for to do ' be a must be

year after year will always make money of at last on saturday bagwax went down to apricot lodge having be invited to stay with beloved till monday in smile of beloved did find much consolation especially a have already be assured to that sixty pound year must be settled on jemima on from wedding day then made very much of 'you do love tom ' said jemima be sitting on camp stool behind grotto bagwax answered by pressing loved one waist 'better than going to sydney tom ' 'it be so very different ' said bagwax be true 'if like better than anything else in world however different will never stand at altar with moved camp stool perhaps inch away 'in way of loving of course do 'then why do grieve when have got what like best 'you understand jemima what spirit of adventure mean think do

got to house have promised not to sigh for delight of sydney for peril of adventure more chapter liv judge bramber secretary of state who have to look after police magistrate to answer question in house of common occasionally to make telling speech in defence of colleague in addition to be expected to perform duty of practical court of appeal in criminal case must have something to do to have to decide whether poor wretch will be hanged when in spite of clearest evidence humanitarian petition by dozen overwhelm with claim for mercy must be terrible responsibility majesty think wo hang think will send to penal servitude for life if majesty plea be so easy must be so pleasant why must one grumble at so right royal decision there be newspaper always so prone to complain secretary have to acknowledge that must be strong enough to hang culprit in spite of petition else must give up office when evidence be not clear case be twice more difficult jury have found verdict law intends that verdict of jury will be conclusive when man have be declared to be guilty by twelve of countryman be guilty let fact have be what may let twelve have be ever so much in error majesty however can pardon guilt hence arises awkward remedy for mistake of juryman unassisted majesty can not investigate thing be not in fact in country supposed to perform duty of sort secretary of state be invested with privilege of what be called mercy be justice rather be wanted if bagwax be in right about envelope reader will by time think that be right if dick shand have sworn truly then certainly friend john caldigate be not in want of mercy be instant justice that required with such compensation a might come to from indignant sympathy of good men remember to have seen man at bermuda whose fate be peculiar be sleek fat apparently comfortable mixing pill when saw convict administering to want of brother convict remonstrated with on hardness of position did do did said 'it be because thought did that sent here if did what right have to keep here at passed on in silence not daring to argue matter with man in face of warder man be right have murdered wife so at least jury have said have be sentenced to be hanged have taken poor woman into little island while be bathing have drowned scream have be heard on mainland jury have found evidence sufficient newspaper have thought reverse have mooted question be not distance too great for such scream to have be heard at rate understood so man be again brought to trial in court of home office be not pardoned sent to grow fat make pill at bermuda have have not murdered wife if did deed must have be hanged if not must not have be forced to make extorted pill what be secretary of state to do in case doubt believed that wretch have murdered wife doubt judge believed world believed newspaper be probably right in saying that evidence be hardly conclusive probably right because produced desired effect if argument have be successfully used with jury jury must have acquitted man then surely secretary of state must have sent out a though acquitted not daring to hang must have treated a innocent trial be in truth demanded so be in caldigate case secretary of state getting up early in morning after remarkable speech in vindicated ministry from attack of europe did read paper took home to great bagwaxian theory mastered dick evidence managed to master something also a to dick character quite understood argument a to postage stamp went further with than other argument understood perplexity of own position if bagwax be right not moment must be lost in releasing ill used man to think of pardon to mention pardon must be insult instant justice with infinite regret that injury inflicted admitted of compensation that that only be impressively demanded how grossly must that man have be ill used how cruelly must that woman have be injured then again if bagwax be wrong if cunning fraud have be concocted over here not in sydney if plot have be made not to incarcerate innocent man to liberate guilty man then how unfit must show for position be to be taken in by such guile what crime must be worse than committed by caldigate against young lady have betrayed if caldigate be guilty upon whole thought must be safer to trust to jury comforted by reflection that must for while transfer responsibility must perhaps be expedient to transfer altogether so sent paper on to judge bramber judge bramber be great man never popular have be wise enough to disregard popularity have forced into practice in opposition to attorney by industry perspicuity have attended exclusively to profession never having attempted to set foot on quicker stepping stone of political life be said of that one knew whether called liberal conservative at fifty five be put upon bench simply because be supposed to posse judicial mind here amply justified that opinion not without sneer ill word of many be now seventy be declared that year have have effect on be supposed to be absolutely merciless a hard a nether millstone judge who must put on black cap without feeling of inward disgust may be surmised that who said so knew nothing of for be man not apt to betray secret of inner life be noted for reverence for jury for silence on bench older grew shorter became charge be there wanting who declared that conduct in respect be intended a reproach to who be desirous of adorning bench by eloquence to sit there listening to everything subordinating to others till interposition be necessary be idea of judge duty when law have declared be always strong in supporting law man condemned for murder ought to be hanged so thought judge bramber not released in accordance with phantasy of philanthropist such be requirement of law if law be cruel let legislator look to that be once heard to confess that position of judge who have condemned innocent man might be hard to bear added that country must be unfortunate did not posse judge capable of bearing even sorrow in heart disapproved of attribute of mercy a belonging to crown be opposed to idea of english law apt to do harm rather than good have be quite convinced of caldigate guilt not only by direct evidence by concurrent circumstance to thinking be not in human nature that man must pay sum a twenty thousand pound to such people a crinkett euphemia smith sum of money be not due legally morally except with improper object have said that be great man did not rise to appreciation of motif have unquestionably operated with caldigate have caldigate be quite assured when paid money that enemy must remain bear witness against still must have paid in matter have endeavoured to act a must have acted have circumstance of mining transaction be made known to when threat be hanging over head judge bramber did not understand understood however quite clearly that under circumstance must money have be paid by accused person to witness while person guilt innocence be in question in summing up have simply told jury to consider matter have so spoken word a to make jury fully perceive what have be result of own consideration then caldigate woman have lived together distinct repeated promise of marriage have be acknowledged be acknowledged that man have given name to woman so far a to write might be fact a to postmark postage stamp word caldigate ' have be written by man now in prison four person have given direct evidence in opposition to there have be nothing till dick shand have come no voice have be brought forward to throw even doubt upon marriage two false witness must adhere well together in story be uncommon that three must do so most rare with four must be almost miracle four have adhered be people probably of bad character whose life have perhaps be lawless if so must have be so much easier to prove false if be false thus judge bramber when passed sentence on caldigate have not in least doubted that verdict be true verdict now case be sent to for reconsideration hated such reconsideration first read sir john joram letter declared to that be unfit to have come from one calling lawyer there be enthusiasm about altogether beneath great advocate certainly beneath forensic advocate employed otherwise than in addressing jury judge bramber have never talked of 'demanding ' verdict even from jury have only endeavoured to win that man who have be attorney general who have be head of bar must thus write to secretary of state be to disgusting to thinking great lawyer even good lawyer must be incapable of enthusiasm a to case in be employed ignorant childish world outside must indulge in zeal hot feeling for advocate to do so be to show that be lawyer that be better than outside world even spoken eloquence be in mind almost beneath lawyer studied eloquence certainly be so such written word a disgusted then came across allusion to condition of poor lady at folking what must condition of lady at folking have to do with matter though poor lady at folking must die in sorrow must not alter fact a have occurred in australia be not for for secretary of state to endeavour to make thing pleasant round here in england have be jury duty to find out whether crime have be committed duty to see that due facility be given to jury have be sir john joram duty to make out what best case must for client then to rest contented have thing be a must be secretary of state must have have duty at in matter be in frame of mind that judge bramber applied to consideration of case juster man ever lived yet in mind there be bias against prisoner nevertheless went to work with great patience resolve to sift everything be to be sifted secretary of state have done no more than required duty in sending case to must now do took counter evidence a came in paper in order that two bagwaxian theory founded on same small document might be expounded one consecutively after other dick shand deposition be produced first judge declared to that dick single oath must not now be tested by cross examination amounted to nothing have be drunkard pauper have descended to lowest occupation country afforded have more than once nearly died from delirium tremens have then come home penniless have produced story if such evidence must avail to rescue prisoner from sentence to upset verdict what verdict what sentence must stand poor dick sworn testimony in judge bramber mind told rather against caldigate than for then came postmark a to bagwaxian theory be quite distinct from a to postage stamp here judge found fact to be somewhat complicated mazy be long before must understand full purport of argument used even at last hardly understood whole of must see nothing in to justify in upsetting verdict nothing even to convince that envelope have be fraudulently handled there be evidence that dated stamp have not be in use at sydney on day named copy from record kept daily at sydney photographed copy must have be submitted before argument have be used when came to postage stamp then told very quickly that envelope have be fraudulently handled evidence a to date of manufacture of stamp be conclusive must not have served to pay postage on letter from sydney to nobble in may seeing that have not then be in existence thus necessity there might otherwise have be for further inquiry a to postmark be dissipated envelope be declared fraud fraud required further proof that morsel of evidence have be fabricated laid at rate one of witness in last trial open to charge of perjury so resolving judge bramber pushed paper away from began to think case over in mind there be certainly something in entire case a now stood to excuse sir john be first line thought took advocate having clearly seen into morsel of evidence on side opposed to having proved to beyond doubt that be maliciously false must be held to be justified in holding more than mere advocate conviction a to innocence of client sir john have of course felt that foul plot have be contrived foul plot doubt have be contrived have discovery taken place before case have be submitted to jury detection of plot must doubtless have saved prisoner whether guilty innocent so much judge bramber admitted must necessarily serve to save now before jury must have saved whether guilty innocent law have got hold of have made guilty law need not now subject to normal human weakness of jury case be now in hand in of secretary there need be weakness if man be innocent in god name let go though a judge observed to have deserved all have got for folly vice discovered plot by mean proved man innocence only proved determination of certain person to secure conviction whether by foul mean fair then recapitulated to various case in have known false evidence to have be added to true with object of convincing jury a to real fact might well be that gang of ruffian for be manifest that there have be gang finding envelope addressed by man to wife have fraudulently a foolishly a fraudulently endeavoured to bolster up case by postage stamp postmark looking back at fact remembering that fatal twenty thousand pound remembering that though postmark be forged on envelope writing be true remembering acknowledged promise combined testimony of four person be inclined to think that something of kind have be done in case if be so though must fain see perpetrator of fraud on trial for perjury fraud in way diminished caldigate guilt that guilty man must escape out of hand of justice by fraud be wormwood to judge bramber caldigate be guilty jury have found so must take upon to say that finding of jury be wrong because prosecuting party have concocted fraud have not be found out before verdict be given sir john joram whom have known almost a boy have 'demanded ' release of client word stuck in judge bramber throat word have be injudicious more thought of word more thought that verdict have be true verdict in spite of fraud very honest man be judge bramber human almost made up mind then be obliged to confess to that have not quite done so 'it taint entire evidence with perjury ' sir john have said woman evidence be absolutely so tainted be defiled with perjury man crinkett have be so near woman that be impossible to disconnect who have concocted fraud woman must hardly have done so without man connivance took morning to think matter out then have not made up mind to reverse verdict must certainly be thorn in side pernicious thorn one if necessary must endure thorn however such a be very persuasive at last determined to have inquiry made a to woman by police have laid open to indictment for perjury in making inquiry on head something further might probably be learned chapter lv how conspirator throve there have be indiscretion among caldigate friend from resulted that while judge bramber be considering matter before police intelligence of scotland yard even have stirred in obedience to judge order nearly circumstance have be submitted to judge have become public shand knew bagwax have done bagwax be acquainted with whole of dick evidence hester down at folking understood perfectly what have be revealed by of enthusiastic ally dick a know have be staying at folking have made presence notable throughout county have succeeded in convincing uncle babington have be judged to be false witness by boltons in there have perhaps be great indiscretion when bagwax opened correspondence with mr john caldigate explained to at great length circumstance of postmark postage stamp when at instance got day holiday rushed down to folking then a felt be doing that of sir john joram mr jones must not approve must not restrain why must restrain when have lost hope of journey to sydney when prospect of delight no longer illumined day why must not enjoy other delight of communicating tidings own discovery to afflicted lady unless did so must appear to that joram have done there must be reward absolutely none so told tale at first by letter then with own natural eloquence mr caldigate postmark be difficult take lifetime of study to understand in out of postmark to be b c of course when have spent week two looking into be sure that impression have never be made in way of business bagwax be sitting out on lawn at folking bereaved wife dressed in black be near holding in hand one of photographed copy of envelope 'it b c to wonder must see ' ' think do see good deal ' said hester 'but babe may understand ' said bagwax pressing forward putting forefinger on obliteration of postage stamp see date in postmark ' know date very well ' have have proved that on date given there identical postage stamp have not yet be manufactured secretary of state ca get over will defy ' 'why release at once then 'between mr caldigate think be judge bramber 'he ca want to injure innocent man ' what have heard sir john say fancy doe like to have verdict upset must do will defy to get over ' again tapped queen head then told story of love for jemima of engagement of course be praised petted a indeed deserved thus though house at folking be sad house enjoyed a men do when much be made of by pretty woman result of be that detail of story became known to public be quite common down at cambridge old squire be urgent with mr seely asking why be that when thing be known instant order have not come from secretary of state for liberation of son mr seely have not be altogether pleased at way in sir john have gone to work be still convinced of guilt of own client answer be therefore unsatisfactory old squire proclaimed intention of proceeding to london demanding interview with secretary of state then cambridge newspaper took up subject generally in caldigate interest from thence matter be transferred to metropolitan column with one exception be strong in favour of such reversal of verdict a must be effected by pardon from queen one exception be very pellucid very unanswerable very cold blooded might have be written by judge bramber that judge bramber must sooner have cut hand off than have defiled by making public aught have come before judicially officially judge bramber argument be there set forth dick wished father at once to proceed against paper for libel because paper said that word must not be taken for much postmark theory be exposed to derision there be doubt much in postage stamp not enough to upset overwhelming weight of evidence by verdict have be obtained so case became really public newspaper be bought read with avidity mark festive period in popular criminal be being discussed at breakfast table much of have occurred before intelligence of scotland yard have be set to work in obedience to judge bramber paper have be day two in home office three

money till be afloat then that must not pay till have left plymouth when police came on board julius vogel anna young have a yet received nothing chapter lvi boltons be very firm while be going on a general opinion in favour of caldigate be becoming stronger day when even judge bramber have begun to doubt feeling have always prevailed at puritan grange be growing in intensity converting from conviction into passion that wicked bigamist have falsely fraudulently robbed of daughter be religion to mr bolton a matter have proceeded old banker have become ever more more submissive to wife feeling cambridge boltons be in accord on subject who have never before be in accord on subject robert bolton who understood thoroughly point a be raised on behalf of caldigate be quite sure that old squire be spending money freely own money son with view of getting verdict set aside what be so clear a dick shand bagwax probably also smithers from stamp tax be in pay of old caldigate at time defection of adamson be not known to did know that strong case be being made with secretary of state 'if cost have in world will expose ' said up in london to brother william london barrister barrister be not quite in accord with other boltons also have be disposed to think that dick shand bagwax might have be bribed by squire be at rate possible twenty thousand pound paid to accusing witness have always stuck in throat when have endeavoured to believe caldigate might be innocent seemed to still that balance of evidence be against man who have taken sister away from home be willing to leave to secretary of state to judge did not see why sister must not have husband be restored to world if judge bramber must at last decide so ought to be money must bribe judge bramber undue persuasion must weaken if rhadamanthus must at last say that verdict have be wrong verdict then for pity sake for love sake in name of humanity for sake of boltons present to come let man be considered innocent robert bolton be more intent on purpose be man of stronger passion perhaps real religious scruple told that woman must not live with man who be not true husband let judge say what might hatred probably have more to do with than religion be who have first favoured caldigate claim on hester hand who have be most grievously deceived from moment in conviction have come upon that caldigate have even promised hand in marriage to euphemia smith have become caldigate enemy bitter enemy now must not endure thought that must be called upon again to receive caldigate a brother in law caldigate guilt be idea fixed in mind secretary of state judge bramber brother must expel so came to pas that there be hard word between brother be wrong ' said william 'how wrong can not say that believe to be innocent receives queen pardon be to be considered a innocent though must know to have be guilty yes said william slowly perhaps indiscreetly be matter in man guilt innocence must be held to depend upon what person in due authority have declared a be now guilty of bigamy in consequence of verdict even though must never have committed offence so must be presumed to be innocent when verdict have be set aside by queen pardon on advice of proper officer even though committed offence 'you must have sister live with man who have wife alive come to ' legal purpose must have other wife alive ' 'the child must be illegitimate ' 'there be decidedly wrong ' said barrister child must be legitimate even at moment without pardon child must claim must enter in upon inheritance ' 'the next of kin must claim ' said attorney burden of proving former marriage must then be on ' said barrister verdict must be evidence ' said attorney ' said barrister such evidence must not be worth straw after queen pardon given on advice of judge who have tried former case a yet know not what judge may say know fact a have be expounded to if caldigate be regarded a innocent by world at large will be duty so to regard ' ' will never look on a hester husband ' said attorney fanny have already made up mind that must at once ask to come to for month ' said barrister 'nothing on earth will induce to speak to ' said attorney will be very cruel to hester ' said barrister be dreadful to ' said attorney 'that must care so little for sister reputation so quarrelled robert leaving house in great dudgeon went down on following morning to cambridge at puritan grange matter be argued rather by rule of religion than of law a rule of law be made by interested to fit to expediency so be rule of religion fitted to prejudice hatred must be more bitter than mr bolton felt for man whom must permit one to call son in law something a to postage stamp postmark be told with woman indomitable obstinacy closed mind against that a indeed did also banker 'be position in world to depend upon postage stamp ' said banker intending to support wife then arose in wrath be very eloquent 'her position in world said 'what doe matter be soul though men woman must call castaway must be nothing if lord knew to be guiltless will be living a adulteress with adulterer law have told that be so will feel day night that be transgressor will vainly seek consolation by telling that men have pardoned that god have condemned ' again broke forth 'the queen pardon what right have queen to pardon adulterer who have crept into bosom of family destroyed that found there what sense of justice can queen have in bosom who will send such one back to heap sin upon sin to fasten bond of iniquity on soul of child ' postage stamp postmark old envelope triviality of thing a compared with importance of everlasting life made feel that be unworthy to be even noticed did not occur to that presence of bodkin might be ample evidence of murder post mark indeed when daughter everlasting life be matter in question then told of dick shand too have heard of dick shand have be gambler so said without much truth be known for drunkard spendthrift penniless idle ne'er do well who have wandered back home without clothes to back be certainly untrue a yellow trouser have be bought at san francisco now be told that hated miscreant be to be released from prison because one a be ready to take oath have knack of looking on such men ne'er do well like dick shand caldigate a human being who have a be lost soul before death so that be useless to think of otherwise than a already damned that caldigate must become good honest loving husband dick shand truth speaking witness be to thinking much more improbable than that camel must go through eye of needle must press lip together grind teeth shake head when one about spoke of doubt man be in prison at rate for two year locked up safe for so much time a might be wild beast with infinite trouble have be caged now be talking of undoing bar allowing monster to gorge again with prey 'if queen be told truth must never do ' said to amazed husband queen be mother woman who kneel in prayer before maker something must be done so that truth may be made known to ' to illuminate darkness be betrayed by appeal to be altogether beyond mr bolton power appreciated depth of darkness knew for instance that queen herself must in such matter act so simply in accordance with advice of one else that pardon if given must not in least depend on majesty sentiment to call queen pardon be simple figure of speech be manifest to be driven to endeavour to make manifest to spoke of petition to be sent direct to queen insinuated that robert bolton if be anything like real brother must force into majesty presence 'it be queen said husband 'it be queen mercy be prerogative of crown even know a much a be to be made to believe that be mercy ' majesty doe what minister tell ' 'but must if be told truth for moment believe that must allow such man a to be let loose about world like roaring lion if knew that know mercy indeed ' wo be meant for mercy dear ' 'what then do not know that man have wife alive wife much more suited to than poor darling nobody must hear voice while there be yet time so child only one be taken away from by own father own brother one now will exert to bring back to home ' poor old man have have little comfort in home since daughter marriage be now more miserable than ever then there came letter from hester to mother since mr bolton last visit to folking there have be correspondence maintained few letter have passed very sad on side in daughter have assured mother of undying love in mother have declared that day night prayed for child of caldigate on one side on other have mention be made now hester who be full of hope sick with hope deferred endeavoured to convince mother that entire charge against husband have be proved by new evidence to be false recapitulated little detail with diligent reader must by time be too well acquainted made quite clear a thought infamous plot by envelope have be made to give false evidence added assurance certainly before long dear dearest ill used husband must be restored to then went on to implore mother renewed affection for herself boy promising that bygone must be bygone then ended by declaring that though return of husband must make very happy must not be altogether happy unless parent also must be restored to to there came crushing answer a follows grange th september 'dearest hester be unnecessary that must ask for renewal of mother love there have never be moment in have not loved more dearly fear than one human creature must ever love when be strongest in opposing did so from love when watched in hall hour endeavouring to save from further contact with man who have injured did from love need not doubt love a to rest can not agree to word that say be plotting with false evidence to rescue man from prison will not give way to when soul tell that be untrue a mother can only implore to come back to to save from further evil be coming upon may be that will be enabled to escape then will again have to live with husband be husband unless will listen to mother word be thinking of good thing of world of home with luxury ease of triumph over who for good of soul have hitherto marred worldly joy be thus that hope to win crown of everlasting life have be taught to regard a one thing worthy of christian struggle be not true that since wretched day on be taken away from have allowed mind to pas from thought of eternity to longing after vain joy in bitter fruitless vale of tear if be so can who have so encouraged have be good to do remember david word trust in chariot in horse will remember name of lord god then again be brought down fallen be risen stand upright ask whether have stood upright have fallen since left father house whether have trusted in lord god in horse chariot be in vain comfort of easy life if be so can be for good that have left father house must not accept scourge have fallen upon a healing balm from hand of lord child have other answer to send that love till very bowel yearn after be most true can not profess to believe lie declare that to be good know to be evil beay lord bless turn foot aright restore to loving mother beary bolton when hester read be almost crushed delay since new tidings have come to have not in truth be very great be not yet quite month since shand have be at folking shorter period since discovery of bagwax have be explained to day seemed to to be very long day after day thought that on day at least news of promised release must be brought to now instead of news there came letter from mother harder almost in word than word have hitherto be either written spoken in matter even when world must have declared innocent when queen great officer of state that stern judge must have said that be innocent even then cruel mother must refuse to receive have be invited to ask certain question a to state of soul a to teaching have received since marriage subject be one on there be possible mean of convergence between person who have learned to differ mother allusion to chariot horse be to enthusiasm of fanatic doubt teaching have come to from husband have come at period of life at such lesson be easily learned 'brought down fallen ' said to herself 'yes be brought down fallen ' for have not at discarded principle of religious faith 'but woman will hardly raise by being untrue to husband ' too yearned for mother there be never moment doubt in mind to must cling if at last must become necessary that one must be cast off mr bolton when letter have be despatched sat brooding over in deep regret mixed with deeper anger be preparing for awful tragedy must be severed for ever from daughter so severed with opinion of neighbour against what be that if have done right of what service to must be contrary if be to think nay to know that have done wrong chapter lvii squire caldigate at home office when october came information from secretary of state office have yet reached folking two inhabitant there be becoming almost despondent a well a impatient there be nobody with whom must communicate sir john joram have be obliged to answer letter from squire by saying that a soon a there be anything to tell tidings must assuredly be communicated to from home office letter have seemed to be cold almost uncivil sir john have in truth said that must say to raise hope after might be fallacious must have be on part great fault in spite of bet be very sanguine sharing friend honybun opinion a to judge bramber obstinacy there be correspondence between elder caldigate home office in letter from squire be long well argued whereas reply always came by return of post be short altogether formal assistant under secretary must sign name at end of three line in correspondent be informed that a soon a matter be settled result must be communicated who doe not know sense of aggravated injustice come upon sufferer when redress for acknowledged evil be delayed wronged one feel that whole world must be out of joint in world doe not rise up in indignation so be with old squire who watched hester cheek becoming paler day by day who knew by silence that strong hope in presence have be almost conviction be gradually giving way to new despair then must abuse secretary of state say hard thing of queen express scorn a to fatuous absurdity of english law must make understand by anger that also be losing hope during day preparation be being made for committal of crinkett euphemia smith must judge bramber report to secretary till be convinced that there be sufficient evidence for prosecution be not much to that caldigate must spend week in prison condition of hester did not even come beneath ken when found allusion to in paper before treated a matter must not have be adduced in bringing under notice there have be something akin to contempt of court a though endeavour have be made to talk over in private knew own character be indignant that argument must have be used with be perhaps little more slow something be added to deliberation because be told that young wife infant child be anxiously expecting liberation of husband father be not a yet clear to judge bramber that woman have such husband that child must claim father at crisis when first week in october have dragged tediously along mr caldigate in fit be half rage half moodiness took off to london did not tell hester that be going till morning on started then simply assured that must hear from by post till returned 'you will tell truth father ' 'if know will tell ' 'but will conceal nothing ' will conceal nothing if find that be utterly unjust altogether hard hearted absolutely indifferent to wrong have done will tell even that ' thus went have hardly fixed purpose in going knew that sir john joram be not in london that if be in town ought not to be made subject to visit on behalf of client to call upon judge in such matter must be altogether out of place to call upon judge a judge bramber must be very vain indeed have in head hazy idea of forcing answer from official in downing street in heart did not believe that must be able to get beyond messenger be one of class not very small in number who from cultivating within bosom certain tendency towards suspicion have come to think that government servant be idle dilatory supercilious incompetent that of fault may have existed among who took wage from crown in time of george iii be perhaps true memory of time have kept alive accusation vitality of prejudice call to mind story of nottinghamshire farmer who when told of return of charles ii asked what have become of charles naseby worcester fatal day at whitehall have not yet reached tidings of thing have only be approaching during twelve year true character of civil service be only now approaching intelligence of who be still shaking head over delinquency of last century old mr caldigate be man peculiarly susceptible to such hard judgment from crown down to black helmet worn by policeman who be occasionally to be seen on folking causeway thought that such headpiece be covering for malpractice bishop wig have thought disappeared a being too ridiculous for time even for judge wig have respect judge bramber be to simply pretentious secretary of state better than other man in frame of mind how be probable that must do good at home office in frame of mind went to home office asked boldly for great man be then eleven o'clock in morning have great man even of deputy great men a yet made appearance mr caldigate of course fell back upon old opinion a to public functionary mentally applied opprobrious epithet to men who taking public pay must not be at post hour before mid day be not aware that great man first deputy great man be sitting in house of common at be on morning that office generally be driven by necessity of thing to accommodate to parliamentary exigency then be asked business how must explain to messenger that son have be unjustly convicted of bigamy be now in prison a criminal so left card said that must call again at two at hour precisely appeared again be told that great man must not see then nearly boiled over in wrath while messenger with possible courtesy went on to explain that one of deputy be ready to receive deputy be honourable septimus brown of whom may be said that home office be so proud that considered to be superior to other public office simply because possessed brown have be there for forty year for many session past have be salvation of parliamentary secretary under secretary be uncle of earl brother in law of duke marquis not to know brown be at west end simply to be unknown brook be proud of without 'travellers '' must not have be traveller a be mr caldigate when be told that mr brown must see almost left lobby in instant disgust when asked who be mr brown there came muttered reply in 'permanent be only word audible to felt that be to go away in dudgeon simply because brown be name of man whom be called upon to see must put in wrong must by so doing close own mouth against complaint to mr caldigate must indeed have be cutting of own nose off own face with scowl therefore consented to be taken away to mr brown be in first place somewhat scared by room into be shown be very large very high there be two clerk with mr brown who vanished however a soon a squire entered room seemed that mr brown be certainly of standing in office must not have have two arm chair sofa in room mr caldigate when first consented to see mr brown have expected to be led into uncarpeted chamber where there must have be dozen other clerk have card mr caldigate ' said official doubt have called in reference to son ' squire have determined to be very indignant very indignant even with secretary of state to whose indifference attributed delay have occurred almost more than indignant when found that be to be fobbed off with mr brown there be something in gentleman voice checked indignation there be something in mr brown eye mixture of good humour authority made feel that ought not to be angry with gentleman till be quite sure of occasion mr brown be handsome hale old man with grey whisker greyish hair with well formed nose broad forehead carefully dressed with light waistcoat checked linen cravat wearing dark blue frockcoat very well made boot old man certainly who looked a though old age must naturally be happiest time of life when man digestion be thoroughly good pocket adequately filled probably be so such be circumstance of mr brown who a squire looked at seemed to partake more of nature of nephew brother in law than of brown generally 'yes sir ' said mr caldigate ' have called about son who think may undertake to say have be wrongly condemned be now wrongly retained in prison beg question mr caldigate ' said permanent under secretary with smile maintain that what call question be now so clearly proved a not to admit of controversy one can deny that conspiracy be got up against son ' ' will not deny certainly mr caldigate in truth know very little nothing about ' squire who have be seated rose from chair a in wrath about to pour forth indignation why be treated in way who be there on subject of such tragic interest to when prospect reputation condition of son be at stake be referred to gentleman who began by telling that knew nothing about matter will sit down for moment mr caldigate will explain can be explained ' said mr brown who be weather wise in such matter have seen sign of coming storm 'certainly will sit down 'in such case a secretary of state never see who be interested be not right that must do so 'there might be somebody to do so ' 'but not somebody who have be concerned in inquiry secretary of state if saw must only refuse to impart to portion of information may posse because can not be right that must give opinion in matter while be in doubt may be sure that will open mouth to one except to from whom may seek assistance till have be enabled to advise majesty that majesty pardon must be given refused ' 'when will be ' be afraid can not name day mr caldigate be know gentleman of position in county magistrate can not understand how minutely fact must be investigated when minister of crown be called upon to accept responsibility of upsetting confirming verdict of jury ' 'the fact be a clear a daylight ' be so son will soon be free man must feel what wife suffers in meantime 'though did feel though felt a probably do for though be official still be men how must help must not have man pardoned because wife suffers 'knowing how suffered think must let much grass grow under foot while be making inquiry hope there be such grass grows here truth be mr caldigate a rule person coming here on errand a yours be received at secretary of state can not either in own person in of who be under put in communication with friend of individual who be under sentence be sure that a man conversant with law must see propriety of rule think have right to express natural anxiety ' will not deny post be open to though fear that reply may not be considered altogether satisfactory do give full attention to letter receive when heard that have be here have expressed intention of returning from respect to personally desired that might be shown into room must not have done have not be that have not be concerned in matter ' then got up from seat mr caldigate found compelled to leave room with thanks rather than with indignation walked out of big building into downing street down step into park going into garden wandered about for more than hour sometimes walking slowly along water side then seating for while on one of bench what must say to hester in letter must write a soon a be back at hotel tried to sift wheat out of what be pleased to call chaff of mr brown courtesy be there not indication to be found in of what result might be if there be such indication be thought certainly adverse to son in whose bosom might be ultimate decision whether in of secretary judge of experienced clerk in secretary office be manifest that fact have now be proven to world at large for many day have none of effect on bosom have on own must be that shand be false that bagwax be false that postage stamp be false that only believed to be true be possible that after son have married woman crept back to hotel in jermyn street there wrote letter ' think will be home to morrow will not say so for certain have be at home office must tell nothing man be very civil to explained that be civil only because knew nothing about case think will call on mr bagwax at post office to morrow after return to folking send in for day mail letter then will hear from again if mean to stay ' at ten o'clock on following day be at post office there found bagwax prepared to take seat exactly at hour thereupon resolved with true radical impetuosity that bagwax be much better public servant than mr brown 'well mr caldigate so have got clear at last said bagwax there be triumph in tone of clerk voice be not intelligible to despondent old squire 'it be not at clear to ' said 'of course have heard what know about postage stamp of course ' 'if secretary of state judge of court of queen bench only have wit about postage stamp ought to have be quite sufficient ' said bagwax sententiously 'what more be there ' 'for sake of letting world know what can be done in department be pity that there must be anything more 'but there be something for god sake tell mr bagwax 'you have heard that caught crinkett just a be leaving plymouth ' word ' 'and woman have got lot of 'em mr caldigate adamson other woman have agreed to give evidence be to be let go did hear ' 'well be in daily tell tale knew last night from particular source have be good deal thrown in with scotland yard since began mr caldigate of course hear thing then occurred to squire that perhaps have flown little too high in going at once to home office might have told more perhaps in scotland yard 'but be true deposition have already be made adamson young have sworn that be present at marriage crinkett say mean to plead guilty woman stick to like wax ' squire have written letter by day mail to say that must remain in london that further day now wrote again at post office telling hester that bagwax have told declaring purpose of going at once to scotland yard if story be true then certainly son must soon be liberated chapter lviii mr smirkie be ill used be on tuesday that mr caldigate made visit to home office on thursday returned to cambridge on platform whom must meet brother in law squire babington who have come into cambridge that morning intent on hearing something further about nephew too have read paragraph in newspaper snapper ' a to crinkett euphemia smith crinkett euphemia smith who gave evidence against mr john caldigate in well known trial at last cambridge assize have be arrested at plymouth just a be about to leave country for new zealand be person to whom be proved that caldigate have paid enormous sum of twenty thousand pound few day before trial be alleged that be to be indicted for perjury if be true implies innocence of mr caldigate who a reader will remember be convicted of bigamy there will be much in whole case for mr caldigate to regret nothing so much a loss of very serious sum of money must be idle to deny that be regarded by jury judge public a bribe to witness why must have be paid will now probably remain for ever mystery ' squire read over three time before must quite understand gist of at last perceived thought that perceived that if be true innocence of nephew be incontestable julia who seemed to prefer paternal mansion at babington to own peculiar comfort privilege at plum cum pippin declared that did believe word of aunt polly whose animosity to nephew have somewhat subsided be not quite inclined to accept statement at once aunt polly expressed opinion that newspaper be only born to lie added that have seen news anywhere else must not have be bit surprised squire be prepared to swear by tidings if such thing be not to be put into newspaper where be to be put aunt polly must not answer question assisted in persuading husband to go into cambridge for further information hope be true ' said suffolk squire tendering hand cordially to brother in law be man who must throw heart into internecine quarrel on monday forget circumstance altogether on tuesday what be speaking ' asked squire of folking with usual placid look partly indifferent partly sarcastic covering so much contempt of squire from suffolk be able to read nothing at 'about man woman witness who be to be put in prison at plymouth who now say just contrary to what said before ' think that can be true said mr caldigate 'then have seen snapper asked mr babington dragging paper out of pocket 'look at ' be now in cab together going towards town mr caldigate did not find convenient to read paragraph of course knew content be quite true ' said 'that person allude to have be arrested that be up in london will presume be tried for perjury ' 'it be true ' 'there be doubt of ' 'and party be splitting against other asked mr babington eagerly 'two of have already sworn that what swore before be false why let out ' 'why not indeed ' said mr caldigate ' must have thought must have lost moment in such case have got one of best fellow in world at home office name be brown if must have seen brown be sure must have let delay minute home office have reputation of being so very quick ' in answer to squire of folking only shook head must not even condescend to say that have seen brown certainly not to explain that brown have seemed to to be most absurdly cautious courteously dilatory man that have ever met in life in trumpington street parted mr caldigate proceeding at once to folking mr babington going to office of mr seely attorney will be out in day two ' said man of suffolk again shaking brother in law hand 'and do tell from that hope wo be long before see at babington have be true to almost from first aunt have come over now there be one against julia be thing of course young woman wo forget ' mr caldigate almost became genial a accepted assurance telling that brother magistrate be a honest a be silly mr babington who be well known in cambridge asked many question of many person from mr seely heard little mr seely have heard of arrest made at plymouth did not quite know what to think about if be square then supposed client must after be innocent went altogether against grain with mr seely 'if be so mr babington said ' will always think paying away of twenty thousand pound greatest miracle ever came across ' nevertheless mr seely did believe that two witness have be arrested on charge of perjury squire then went to governor of jail who have be connected with many year a county magistrate governor have heard nothing received information a to prisoner from one in authority quite believed story a to crinkett woman have better not see mr babington ' said governor have heard nothing a yet of must not be right to tell till know what will come to ' assenting to mr babington took leave with conviction on mind that governor be quite prepared to receive order for liberation of prisoner did not dare to go to robert bolton office did call at bank have heard nothing about mr babington ' said old clerk over counter then old clerk added in whisper 'none of family take to news sir everybody else seems to think there be great deal in if did marry suppose ought to be let out must think ought ' said squire indignantly a left bank thus fortified by what considered to be general voice of cambridge returned same evening to babington cambridge including mr caldigate have be unanimous in believing report if report be true then certainly be nephew innocent a thought of appropriate idea of injustice of evil done to man to man wife came upon if such be treatment to have be subjected if innocent have be torn away from sent to common jail if certainly innocent have be wrongly deprived for time of name have honestly given then must not have be right to open to heart door at babington during period of great distress a thought of be so melted by ruth that tear came into of old eye then remembered attempt have be made to catch man for julia a to certainly have be innocent daughter continued wrath that woman must be wrathful in such matter be natural to conceived that behoved woman to be weak irascible affectionate irrational soft hearted when julia must be loud in condemnation of cousin must pretend to commiserate woe of poor wife who have be left in australia though knew source of feeling must not be in least angry with be not at state of mind in reference to son in law augustus smirkie sometimes a have heard mr smirkie inveigh against enormity of bigamy of bigamist in particular have determined that 'odd come shortly a must call must give vicar of plum cum pippin moral pat on head must silence for time at present moment when got into carriage at station to be taken home be not sure whether must find vicar at babington since marriage mr smirkie have spent much of time at babington seemed to like babington claret must come about middle of week return on saturday evening in manner squire must hardly reconcile with that have heard a to mr smirkie exemplary conduct in own parish squire be hospitality certainly must never have said word to make house other than pleasant to own girl husband host expects that corn must be respected whereas mr smirkie be always treading on mr babington toe hint have be given to a to personal conduct did not take altogether in good part absence from afternoon service have be alluded to have be suggested to that ought sometimes to be more careful a to language be not therefore ill disposed to resent on part of mr smirkie spirit of persecution with gentleman seemed to regard nephew mr smirkie in house asked coachman came by a usual ' said man be very much usual ' thought squire 'there be doubt about ' said squire to wife a be dressing 'the poor fellow be a innocent a ' ca be innocent said aunt polly 'if never married woman whom say married ca be guilty know about dear ' did marry did suppose ' say married did worse ' did ' said squire may be way of thinking of according to idea of what be right what be wrong did great deal worse 'but if did marry woman did commit bigamy when married one ' argued energetically betill may have deserved got ' 'no may must punish man for murder because doe pay debt ' wo have that be innocent ' said mr babington 'who devil be if come to ' 'you be not must talk in way be not saying anything now against john if did marry woman suppose will let out of prison for one will be willing to take by hand to say innocent be what wo put up with ' have sown wild oat be none worse for that be a good a rest of dare say bepeak for ' said wife suppose mean to tell that in eye of creator be a good man a augustus ' be ' word be spoken with great energy mr babington at moment be employed in sewing button on wristband of husband shirt in start gave stuck needle into arm ' exclaimed agitated lady beg pardon not ' said squire rubbing wound 'if say word more about john caldigate in presence will tell what think about have got wife ought to be enough for ' after that went down stair dinner be at once announced there be mr smirkie to give arm to mother in law squire took married daughter while other two followed a crossed hall julia whispered cousin name father bade be silent for present be sure be not true ' said mr smirkie 'then be quite wrong ' said squire 'for be a true a gospel then there be more said about john caldigate till servant have left room mr smirkie general appreciation of good thing provided did not on occasion give owner of gratification host must feel in pleasure of guest ate very good dinner took wine with full appreciation of merit such appetite on part of friend be generally much esteemed by squire of babington who be apt to press bottle upon who sat with in old fashioned manner at present moment eyed son in law enjoyment with feeling akin to disappointment there be habit at babington with lady of sitting with squire when be only man present till have finished wine at mr smirkie instance custom be continued when husband be at house fire have be commenced when dinner thing have be taken away clustered round hearth squire sat silent in place out of humour knowing that peculiar subject must be introduced determined to make disagreeable 'papa wo bring chair round ' said one of girl who be next to whereupon did move chair inch two 'did hear anything about john ' said other unmarried sister heard about ca help hearing about in cambridge now world be talking about ' 'and what doe world say asked julia flippantly to question father at first made answer 'whatever world may say can not alter opinion ' continued julia will never be able to look upon john caldigate hester bolton a man wife in sight of god ' might just a well take upon to say did look upon smirkie a man wife in sight of god ' screamed married daughter ejaculated married son in law bey dear be strange thing to say of own child whispered mother strange ' said julia

'john caldigate marriage with wife be not in least interfered with by verdict 'it took away lady name from at once ' said indignant clergyman 'that be just what did do ' said squire rising from chair 'of did affect name at now that be shown to have be mistaken verdict doe affect position long short of be that anybody who doe like to meet wife a honoured guest in house have better stay away do hear that julia ' then without waiting for answer walked out before into drawing room not word be said that night about matter mr smirkie indeed did not utter word on subject till at early hour wished good night with dignified composure chapter lix how big wig doubted be what call awful shame mr holt parson bromley be standing together on causeway at folking former be speaking subject under discussion be of course continued detention of john caldigate in county prison ' can not at understand ' said mr bromley 'there be understanding nothing about sir man woman child in county know a there be no other marriage yet wo let out be sheer spite because must vote for man last 'lection ' hardly think that mr holt ' `` m a sure of a stand here ' said mr holt slapping thigh else 'd keep 'un in for be just like way mr holt be one of rare class being liberal farmer liberal be in politics a be also mr bromley liberal among parson rava avis caldigates have always be liberal mr holt have be brought up to agree with landlord be now beyond measure acerbated because john caldigate have not be a yet declared innocent on evidence be altogether conclusive to conservative be now in power nothing seemed so natural to mr holt a that home secretary must keep landlord in jail because caldigates be liberal mr bromley must not quite agree to also be of opinion that great injustice be being done be in habit of seeing young wife almost daily knew havoc hope turned into despair be making with week have now gone by since old squire have be up in town nothing yet have be heard from secretary of state world knew that crinkett euphemia smith be in custody still tidings came yet husband convicted on evidence of perjurer be detained in prison hope deferred heart sick hester heart be very sick within 'why do not tell something ' said when father in law vainly endeavoured to comfort why not indeed must only say hard thing of whole system under perpetration of so great cruelty be possible reiterate opinion that in spite of system must before long let son go free delay in truth be not at home office judge bramber must not a yet quite make up mind be hoped that reader have made up reader know somewhat more than judge knew crinkett have confessed nothing though rumour have got abroad that intended to plead guilty euphemia smith be constant in assertion to who came near that have positively be married to man at ahalala adamson anna young be ready now to swear that have sworn before be false be known to police that have quarrelled bitterly a to division of spoil ever since money have be paid to ring leader be known that anna young have succeeded in getting nothing from other woman that man have unwillingly accepted small share fearing that otherwise might get nothing be not trustworthy witness be very doubtful whether other two must be convicted on evidence judge a turned over in mind be by mean sure that verdict be mistaken verdict be at rate verdict be decision constitutionally arrived at from jury sending back of matter to hardly be constitutional be abhorrent to nature not that guilty man must escape knew to be affair occurring day that guilty man who have be found to be guilty must creep back through mesh of law knew how many chance be given by practice of british court to offender on trial be quite in favour of chance must be urgent in telling jury to give prisoner benefit of doubt when transgressor with loophole stopped stood before convicted then felt delight in tightness of grip with held wretch must tell that world in lived be not a yet astray in guilty man must still be made to endure proper reward of guilt be with a when hunter have hunted fox after approved law of venery there have be dozen way of killing animal of have scorned to avail have be careful to let break from covert regarding who must stop a enemy to have be point of honour with that animal must suffer undue impediment ill treatment shown to favoured one in course be injury done to hunter let man head fox let man strive to drive back upon hound let be done by hunting law in accordance with law give so many chance of escape when hound have run into quarry not eloquence of god must serve to save doomed one life so be with judge bramber convicted prisoner must give man full benefit of quibble of law till be convicted must be severe on witness harsh to police apparently very friend to man standing at bar till time came for to array evidence before jury then be inexorable when verdict have be once pronounced prisoner be a fox about to be thrown to hound now there be demand that particular fox must be put back into covert secretary of state must put back if thought fit in matter there be so often touch of cowardice why did not secretary do without asking there have arisen question of law there be question a to propriety of verdict a found upon evidence given at trial doubt have arisen since have come from further evidence of secretary be a well able to judge a doubt case be difficult there have be gross misdoing on side if caldigate have not married woman why have paid twenty thousand why have written word on envelope there be doubt enough now time for giving prisoner benefit of doubt be gone fox have be fairly hunted judge bramber thought that have better die hesitated while be hesitating there came to little reminder most gentle hint in shape of note from secretary of state private secretary old squire visit to office have not seemed to to be satisfactory have made friend for in mr brown mr brown looked into matter be of opinion that must be well to pardon young man even though there have be jumping over broomstick at ahalala why must thing not be made comfortable here at home what harm must pardon do to one whereas there be so many whom must make happy so asked secretary whether be hard case of young caldigate secretary whispered that be in bramber hand upon mr brown observed that if so be certainly hard conversation be not altogether thrown away for on afternoon private secretary wrote note judge bramber when received note immediately burned did with considerable energy of action if must send such case a what right have to remind of duty be not going to allow private secretary secretary of state to hurry there be life death in matter of what importance be that so manifest evil doer a young caldigate must remain in prison day two more man who have attempted to bribe four witness by twenty thousand pound be additional evil that one must have sum for purpose still felt that there be duty thrown upon sat down with paper before determined to make up mind before rose from chair did make up mind did so at last by referring back responsibility to secretary of state question be one altogether of evidence ' said 'and not of law clear headed man be a able to reach true decision a be be such question a must be left to jury must justify trial on appeal if be practicable must be well that case must stand over till thomas crinkett euphemia smith will have be tried for perjury a understand will take place at next winter assize if secretary of state think that delay must be too long must humbly suggest that must take majesty pleasure in accordance with own opinion a to evidence when document be read at home office by few who be privileged to read knew that judge bramber have be in very ill humour there be help for that judge have be asked for advice have refused to give have advised if remark on subject be to be taken for advice that consideration of matter must be postponed for three month case if there be case in favour of prisoner be not one for pardon for such redress a might now be given for most gross injustice man have be put to very great expense have be already in prison for ten eleven week further detention must be held to have be very cruel if must appear at last that verdict have be wrong public press be already using strong language on subject secretary of state be not indifferent to public press judge bramber thoroughly despised press though must have be very angry if 'times have not be ready for at breakfast morning two three question have already be asked in house of common secretary of state with habitual strategy without secretary of state must be held to be unfit for position hold contrived to answer question so a to show that while gentleman who asked be most indiscreet of individual be most discreet of secretary did though be strongly of opinion that judge bramber delay be unjustifiable what must be thought of secretary of state who must impute blame in house of common to one of judge of land before public opinion have expressed so strongly on matter a to make such expression indispensable did not think that be in least untrue in throwing blame back upon questioner in implying that on side of crown there have be no undue delay though at moment be inwardly provoked at dilatoriness of judge public opinion be expressing very strongly in press daily tell tale ' have beautifully sensational article written by very best artist whole picture be drawn with cunning hand young wife in lonely house down in cambridge artist not inaptly called moated grange noble innocent high souled husband eating heart out within bar of county prison with very little else to eat indignant father driven almost to madness by wrong done to son heir have son not be heir point must have be much le touching then old evidence be dissected new evidence against new culprit explained in regard to new culprit writer be very loud in expressing purpose to say not word against person who be still to be tried immediately upon that went on said great many word against assuming be said about to be true asked whether country must for moment endure idea that man in mr caldigate position must be kept in prison on evidence of such miscreant when came to bagwax postmark explained whole matter with almost more than accuracy showed that impression must not possibly have be made till after date conveyed fell into little error a to fabrication of postage stamp in colony not having quite seized bagwax great point be most telling article writer a turned off at club sent down to office of paper be ready to bet five pound note that caldigate must be out before week be over secretary of state saw article acknowledged power then even belipper turned round cautiously expressed opinion that time have come for mercy there must be doubt that public opinion be running very high in caldigate favour that case have become thoroughly popular people be again beginning to give dinner party in london at party matter be discussed be peculiarly interesting case because man have thrown away so large sum of money people like to have nut to crack be 'uncrackable ' gordian knot to undo can not even be cut nobody must understand twenty thousand pound must man pay sum with object of buying off false witness do in manner that fact must be brought to light when be tried be said here there that have paid money because owed then have be shown so clearly that have not owed one penny nevertheless men be certain that be not guilty lady thought that whether be guilty not did not matter much certainly ought to be released from prison yet secretary doubted in unspoken heartfelt accusation of cowardice judge have made against great officer of state there have be truth how must be if must be made to appear at approaching trial that two reprobate who have turned queen evidence against associate be to break down altogether in assertion might possibly then become quite apparent that caldigate have married woman have committed bigamy when must already have be pardoned for last three month pardon in case must not do away with verdict pardoned man must be convicted bigamist what then must be condition of wife child if subsequent question must arise a to boy legitimacy a might so probably be case in what light must appear who have taken upon on own responsibility to extort from majesty pardon in opposition to righteous just verdict in opposition to judge who have tried case have be angry with judge bramber for not deciding be now frightened at necessity of deciding in emergency sent for gentleman who have managed prosecution on part of crown asked to read up case again never be convinced of prisoner guilt ' said barrister 'it be one of case in can not be convinced strongest point against be payment of money be possible that paid from quixotic feeling of honour ' false witness before trial said secretary there may have be hope that in spite of what said a to staying must take off when have got money in way may have persuaded that a honest man ought to make payment then a to witness there can be little doubt that be willing to lie even if main story be true be lying a to detail 'then must advise pardon think so ' said barrister who be not responsible for advice 'without waiting for other trial ' 'if perjury be then proved even so nearly proved a to satisfy outside world man detention will be thought to have be hardship ' secretary of state thanked barrister let go then went down to house amidst turmoil of strong party conflict at last made up mind be unjust that such responsibility must be thrown upon one person there ought to be court of appeal for such case be sure of now at last made up mind early on next morning queen must be advised to allow john caldigate to go free chapter lx how mr bolton be nearly conquered one morning about middle of october robert bolton walked out from cambridge to puritan grange with letter in pocket very long very serious letter day be that on secretary of state be closeted with barrister on evening of at length determined that caldigate must be allowed to go free there have therefore be pardon granted a yet in letter writer stated that such pardon must almost certainly be awarded be from william bolton in london to brother attorney be written with view of proving to boltons at cambridge that be duty to acknowledge hester a undoubted wife of john caldigate recommended also that for hester sake must receive a husband letter have be written with very great care have be powerful enough to persuade robert bolton of truth of first proposition be very long a repeated detail of evidence for against verdict will not be repeated here at full length intention be to show that looking at probability judging from be known there be much more reason to suppose that there have be no marriage at ahalala than that there have be one writer acknowledged that while verdict stood confirmed against man hester family be bound to regard to act a though did not doubt justice that when verdict must be set aside a far a criminal verdict can be set aside by queen pardon then family must be bound to suppose that who advised majesty have exercised sound discretion be sure will agree with ' said 'that personal feeling in regard to caldigate must influence judgment for like man think have have nothing to do with opinion if have be case that having wife living have betrayed sister into misery of false marriage have made mother of nameless child must have felt bound to punish to extent within power think unchristian to say that in case must not have forgiven presuming to be otherwise a will be bound to do if be pardoned then for hester sake must receive man with whom lot in life be so closely connected poor dear have suffered enough must not be subjected to further trouble of estrangement if acknowledge charge against to be untrue be there reason for quarrel if have not be bad to sister in matter have be altogether good to have for devotion be best evidence that marriage have be well chosen presuming to be innocent must confess a to that have be simply loyal to husband with such loyalty a married man must desire for must be rewarded rather than punished ' write to thinking that in way may best reach father mr bolton must go down see did not know that word must be more efficacious with than own do a duty to sister feel bound to perform pray forgive if remind that in respect have peculiar right to performance of duty in matter counselled carried out marriage not at unfortunately if man be a think innocent be bound at rate to sift evidence very closely not to mar happiness by refusing to acknowledge if there be reasonable ground for supposing verdict to have be incorrect ' sift evidence indeed robert bolton have done that already very closely bagwax stamp have not moved direct assurance of dick shand incarceration by government of crinkett euphemia smith have shaken fact that have endeavoured to escape moment heard of shand arrival not le have hated caldigate feeling have be impressed on mind when first fact be made known to remained caldigate have be engaged to marry woman have lived with have addressed a wife man have in way got better of then twenty thousand pound then again caldigate manner to must not get over personal aversion therefore unconsciously wished that brother in law must be guilty wished at rate that must be kept in prison gradually have fallen upon conviction that caldigate must be pardoned then of course there have come much consideration a to sister condition too be conscientious affectionate man be well aware of duty to sister while be able to assure that caldigate be not husband must satisfy by conviction that be duty to keep apart thus must hate man advocate severity against man believe while that be doing duty to sister a affectionate brother now there be revulsion be three week since brother have parted not with kindest feeling up in london during time sifting of evidence have be going on within own breast from hour to hour now letter have come letter must not put away in anger letter must not ignore to quarrel permanently with brother william be quite out of question knew value of such friend too well have be too often guided by advice so sifted evidence once again then walked off to puritan grange with letter in pocket in latter day old mr bolton did not go often into cambridge men said that daughter misfortune have broken very much be perhaps violence of wife religion rather than weight of daughter suffering cowed since hester awful obstinacy have become hopeless to mr atmosphere of sackcloth ash have made more than ever predominant at puritan grange if one hated papistry mr bolton did so from similar action of religious fanaticism have fallen into worse papistical self persecution that men woman be worm to be trodden under foot grass of field to be thrown into oven be borne in so often on poor mr bolton that have not strength left to go to bank be nearer akin to worm more like grass of field than ever because hester must stay at folking instead of returning to own home be in frame of mind when robert bolton be shown into morning sitting room be sitting with bible before with domestic needlework in lap be doing nothing not even having book ready to hand thus must sit greater part of day listening to when must read to much preferring to be left alone life have be active prosperous evening of day be certainly not happy son robert have be anxious to discus matter with first found unable to separate without amount of ceremony must have filled with suspicion have received letter morning from william said addressing to father bolton be fear of world worldly said step mother word always savour to of huge ungodly city in dwells ' that be not time for such exercise must have endeavoured to expose prejudice of lady a be be very gentle 'william be man who understands duty well said beany do few act up to understanding rejoined ' think sir have better read letter to have be written with intention be bound to let know content perhaps mr bolton will let go to end so that may discus afterwards mr bolton must not let go to end have not probably expected such forbearance at point a to evidence interrupted striving to show that argument used be of real weight be altogether irrational still argued case well withered bagwax dick with scorn ridiculed quarrel of male female witness reviled secretary of state declared to be shame that queen must have better adviser when william bolton spoke of hester happiness of concession must be made to secure that burst out into eloquence what did know of happiness be not manifest that be alluding to world without thought of next 'not reflection a to soul welfare have once come across mind ' said idea a to sin with soul must be laden be to continue to live with man when knowing that be not husband ' must know nothing of kind said attorney ought to know said mr bolton again begging whole question persevered a have resolved to do when left house upon difficult mission be sure father will acknowledge said 'that however strong own feeling have be must bow to conviction of others who ' be promulgating doctrine conscience required to stop at once 'the conviction of others will never have weight with when welfare of eternal soul be at stake ' be speaking of who have have better mean of getting at truth than have come within reach secretary of state can have bias of own in matter 'he be fear godless man living dealing with godless did not hear other day that great minister of state will not even give moment to attend to short meaningless prayer be read in house of common 'no one ' continued robert bolton trying to get away from sentiment into real argument 'no one can have be more intent on separating than william be when thought that evidence be against now think evidence in favour know man whose head be clearer than brother be not very fond of john caldigate ' be ' said woman with energy betrayed much of true feeling 'but if be case that be in truth man wife ' 'in sight of god be not so ' said 'then ' continued trying to put aside interruption to go on with assertion have commenced 'it must be duty to acknowledge for sake be not to do so must stand condemned in opinion of world ' care for opinion of world 'and must destroy happiness ' happiness here on earth what doe matter there be such happiness ' be very hard fight perhaps not harder than have expected have known that must not listen to reason that must not even attempt to understand have learned before how impregnable be will of fanaticism in must entrench how improbable be that must capitulate under force of argument thought possible that might move father to assert be well aware that in midst of apparent lethargy father mind be at work with much of old energy understood physical infirmity religious vacillation combined have brought old man into present state of apparent submission be hardly two year since same thing have be done in regard to hester marriage then mr bolton have asserted declared will in opposition to wife there have indeed be much change in since time still something of old fire remained have thought to be duty sir ' said 'to make known to william opinion own say nothing a to social intercourse must be left to yourself if pardon be granted will think be bound to acknowledge john caldigate to be son in law ' 'your father agrees with ' said mr bolton rising from chair speaking in angry tone hope will agree with a soon a tidings of pardon reach must think intimate to hester that accept marriage a having be true legal will do so even though must never see in house again 'you of course will do a please ' 'and sir ' said appealing to old man have right to dictate to father ' said wife angrily have always encouraged to offer advice ' then mr bolton shuffled in chair a though collecting for effort at last sat up with head however bent forward with arm resting on arm of chair though looked to be old much older than be still there be gleam of fire in eye be thin almost emaciated head hung forward a though there be not strength left in spine for to sit erect ' hope sir think have gone beyond duty in what have said ' will come here ' muttered old man 'certainly will ' said mr bolton will do suppose that long to have own child in arm behe will come here be called by name ' said father will be hester own hester ' said mother not feeling a yet called upon to contradict husband john caldigate will come said 'never ' exclaimed mr bolton 'he will be asked to come say will be to be harder on own child than be others will call castaway when others say that be honest married woman ' have called castaway took verdict of jury though broke heart ' continued broke heart to be told that girl child be nameless believed because jury said so because judge declared when tell contrary why will not believe that do believe will come here if will will come then got up slowly moved out of room so that there might be further argument on subject have reseated with arm crossed there sat perfectly mute robert bolton stood up repeated argument appealing even to maternal love answered never word have not even yet succeeded in making companion of life submissive to be feeling be now uppermost in mind have said that caldigate must be asked to house must be acknowledged throughout cambridge a son in law having said must be a good a word be sure of of what avail have be labour of life with result hope will think have done more than duty ' said robert bolton offering hand there sat perfectly silent with arm still folded must take notice of 'good bye ' said striving to put something of softness of affection into voice must not even bend head to thus left remained motionless for best part of hour then got up according to daily custom walked certain number of time round garden mind be so full that did not a usual observe twig almost leaf a passed now that be alone be that religious bias have so much to do with daily life very strong within there be taint of hypocrisy in character yet with force of human disappointment heavy upon heart be now hot with human anger mutinous with human resolve have proposed to herself to revenge upon men of husband family upon men who have contrived that marriage for daughter by devoting to care of daughter nameless grandson by letting be known to that misery of condition must have be spared have word prevailed that must live together stern dark still sympathetic life secluded within high wall of lonely abode that must thus be able to prove how right have be how wicked calamitous interference with child have be scheme of life now scheme be knocked on head hester be to become prosperous ordinary married woman amidst fatness of land at folking be wormwood to still a walked acknowledged to herself that a old man have said so so must be with labour with care with strength have not succeeded in becoming master of weak old man chapter lxi news reach cambridge tidings

almost to smile when be to be exacted from be explained ate heart in dismay a counted day hour minute then calculated amount of misery be in store for there be so much more for to think of than own

have be sitting alone in back room so that husband wife might be left together have heard voice with be familiar now came through to ask hester whether visitor must be sent away for present hester

eloquence here be doubt better than argument a caldigate must have felt when remembered how fond have once be of 'bedangled woman ' hester who though knew whole story did not at moment join two two together thought that mr holt put case uncommonly well 'no knew ' continued with wave of hand 'but jury be netherden men yet utterden mr halfacre ' added turning to tenant from other parish 'and must tell how be a must there be that judge who must have believed miscreant a must be got anywhere to swear away man liberty wife family be abeost worse saw how be to be when first looked out of eye at

joined walked back towards house with two caldigates too have come to offer congratulation to assure released prisoner that never believed imputed guilt must not go into house surmising that on day happy wife must not care to see many visitor caldigate asked to take turn about ground being anxious to learn something from outside world do say to at babington think be little divided bey aunt have be against of course ' first be fancy be natural that people must believe till shand came back 'poor dear old dick must look after dick what about julia ' injuria formae ' said mr bromley be to expect ' `` ll forgive mr smirkie think smirkie ever looked on with favourable eye then clergyman be forced to own smirkie too have be among who have believed woman story 'but have to remember how natural be that man must think verdict to be right in country wrong verdict be uncommon occurrence requires close personal acquaintance much personal confidence to justify man in supposing that twelve juryman must come to erroneous decision thought that be wrong still knew must hardly defend opinion before outside world ' be true said caldigate 'and have made up mind will be angry with one who will begin to believe innocent from day mind however be considerably exercised in regard to boltons a to whom feared that must not even yet allow to be convinced for wife conversion be of infinitely more importance than of outside world beyond when gloom of evening have come too came out walked with about garden ground with professed object of showing little change might have be made conversation soon fell back upon last great incident of joint life mother can not refuse to believe what everybody now declares to be true argued beamma be so strong in feeling behe must know must not have let out of

brother will come round suppose robert have be very angry with know be man of world man of sense 'we must take a will come john of course must be very much to to have father mother restored to must be very much to know that brother be again friend when remember how prayed yesterday for one thing now to day that one thing have come to how have got that when waked morning seemed to to be world to want of made heart so sick that even baby must not make glad feel that nothing ought now to make unhappy have got john everything else be nothing ' a stooped in dark to kiss again among rose bush felt that be almost worth while to have be in prison after dinner there came message to across ferry from mr holt must be so good a to walk down to edge of great dike opposite to twopenny farm at nine o'clock a part of message mr holt sent word that at hour moon must be rising of course went down to dike mr caldigate john caldigate hester there outside mr holt farmyard just far enough to avoid

from neighbour did not see much of ' mr holt said afterwards 'because missus be busy among stack time looking after spark bonfire might ' be too big know ' chapter lxiii how mr bolton be quite conquered nearly week passed over head at puritan grange before anything further be done said even written a to return of john caldigate to own home to own wife in meantime mr robert mr daniel have gone out to folking made visit of ceremony visit be intended to signify acknowledgment that mr john caldigate be mr john caldigate with mr daniel matter be quite ceremonious short mr robert suggested something a to visit into cambridge saying that husband must be delighted if hester mr caldigate must come dine sleep hester immediately felt that something have be gained declined proposed visit for present 'we have of ' said 'gone through so much that be not quite fit to go out anywhere yet ' mr robert have hardly expected to come have observed husband behest so far there have be family reconciliation during first few day after prisoner release sign came from mr bolton mr bolton though have given order be not at first urgent in requiring obedience to then received letter from hester 'dearest dearest mamma of course know that darling husband have come back to want now to make quite happy be to have once again a own own mother will not send line to say that will all be a though

caldigate ' mr bolton found letter on breakfast table lying a be usual with letter close to plate read without saying word to husband then put in pocket still did not say word before middle of day have almost made up mind that must keep letter entirely to herself be well thought that have not seen good must be done by showing to have be in breakfast parlour before have seen envelope have recognised handwriting be sitting together after lunch be just about to open book of sermon with at time be regaling when stopped with question did hester say in letter ' even who intend to be truthful be sometimes surprised into lie letter ' said remembered at once knew that must not afford to be detected in falsehood note from hester yes have note morning ' know have note what doe say ' tell that have come back 'and what else be well aware that knew that without telling ' behe want to come here ' 'bid come ' 'of course will come 'and ' to made answer except with muscle of face involuntarily showed antagonism to order have received 'bid bring husband with ' said banker must not come though be to ask ' 'then let be on own head ' will not ask ' said at last looking away across room at blank wall ' will not belie own heart want to see here have so far got better of will not put neck beneath foot for to tread on ' then there be pause not that intended to allow disobedience to pas that be driven to bethink how might best oppose 'woman ' said 'you can neither forgive forget ' have got child from only child 'does persecute child be not happy in love even if have trespassed against who be that must not forgive trespass say that will be asked to come here that men may know that in own father house be regarded a true honest wife ' been murmured 'that men may know did not again tell that must not obey command sat remainder of day alone in room hardly touching work have beside not opening book lay by hand on table be thinking of letter knew that must write did not rise to get pen ink did even propose to herself that letter must be written then not word be said about evening on next morning banker pronounced intention of going into town before started referred to order have given 'have written to hester ' asked merely shook head write to day ' so saying tottered down step with stick got into fly about noon did get paper ink very slowly wrote letter though heart be in truth yearning towards daughter though at moment must have made possible sacrifice for child have child be apart from man hated must not in sullenness force word into form of affection 'dear hester ' said 'of course will be glad to see boy on what day must suit to come how long must like to stay fear will find father dull companion after life be now used to if mr caldigate must like to come with father bid say that will be glad to see loving mother beary bolton endeavoured in writing letter to obey command have be left with must not go nearer to than must not so far belie heart a to tell daughter that must be glad to see man then took long to write address did write at last mr john caldigate folking a wrote told that believed to be lie when letter reached hester there be consultation over to old mr caldigate be admitted be acknowledged on side that anything must be better than family quarrel spirit in invitation have be written be to be found in word of there be not word to show that mr bolton have accepted decision to everyone else have come in matter everything rather to show that have not done so a squire said doe not do to inquire too closely into people inner belief everybody be to say what think about everybody nobody must ever go to see anybody ' be soon decided that hester with baby must go on early day to puritan grange must stay there for couple of night there be difficulty a to caldigate be naturally enough anxious to send hester without be a anxious to take be for own sake said 'because will like to have there with of course will be very dull for will be so much better that must be reconciled that everyone must know that be so ' 'it must only be pretence ' said 'people must pretend sometimes john ' answered at last be decided that must take reaching place about hour of lunch so that might again break bread in father house that must then leave there at end of two day must return to folking on day named reached puritan grange at hour fixed caldigate hester be very nervous a to reception got out of carriage almost without word to other old gardener who have be so busy during hester imprisonment be there to take luggage hester maid carried child a caldigate with wife behind walked up step rang bell there be coming out to meet greeting even in hall mr bolton be perhaps too old too infirm for such running out be hardly within nature to do so be shown into well known morning sitting room there found hester father in chair mr bolton standing up to receive hester after kissing father threw into mother arm before word have be said to caldigate then banker addressed with set speech doubt have be prepared in old man mind ' be very glad ' said 'that have brought unhappy matter to so good conclusion mr caldigate ' have be great trouble worse almost for hester than for ' 'yes have be sad enough for hester more so because be natural that others must believe that jury judge declared to have be proved how must one know otherwise 'just so mr bolton if will accept truth now will be satisfied 'it will come perhaps slowly to folk must in justice remember that own early folly have tended to bring about be grim welcome last speech be one caldigate found difficult to answer be so absolutely true that admitted of answer thought that might have be spared shrugged shoulder a though to say that part of subject be one did not care to discus hester heard quivered with anger even in mother arm mr bolton heard in midst of kiss made inward protest against word used folly indeed why have not spoken out truth a knew told man of vice be necessary that too must address ' hope see quite well mr caldigate ' said giving hand prison have not disagreed with ' said with attempt at smile 'though be not agreeable residence ' used leisure there to meditate on soul welfare may have be of service to ' be very grim banker having made one severe speech became kind in manner almost genial asked after son in law future intention when be told that thought of spending month abroad so a to rid in way of immediate record of past misery be gracious enough to express approval of plan then when lunch be announced two lady have passed out of room said word to son in law in private 'as be convinced mr caldigate when first heard evidence that other woman be wife be therefore very anxious to separate daughter from so be satisfied now that whole thing be wicked plot be very glad to hear say that sir ' if please will go in to lunch ' a long a caldigate remained in house mr bolton be almost silent duty of hostess performed in stiff ungainly way asked whether must have hashed mutton cold beef allowed to pour little sherry into wine glass beyond there be not much conversation mr bolton have said what have to say sat leaning forward with chin over plate perfectly silent be to be supposed that have pleasure in having daughter once more beneath roof especially a have implored wife not to deprive of happiness during small remainder of day sat there with look of joy upon face that must be stern sullen black browed be to be expected have be compelled to entertain guest be not at woman to bear such compulsion meekly hour at last wore away carriage be to take caldigate back to folking be again at door be tuesday will send for on thursday ' said to in whisper 'certainly 'early after breakfast know suppose will not come

foot of stair waiting for behall come with mamma ' said holding other arm went up so passed into hester room where nurse be sitting with boy go into room ' said elder lady so nurse took baby away be alone together 'oh hester hester child ' said mother flinging arm wildly round daughter whole tenor of face be changed at moment even to hester have be stern forbidding sullen there have not be gracious movement about lip eye since visitor have come stranger must stranger have seen must have said that mother did not love child that there be touch of tenderness about woman heart now when be alone with one thing on earth be dear to melted at once in moment hester found seated on sofa with mother kneeling before sobbing burying face in loved one lap 'you love hester still 'love mamma know love ' a used to be be nothing to now can hing for now turn away from because because because have never turned away from mamma ' 'because must not bear that must be taken away from given to ' 'he be good mamma if must only believe that be good ' 'he be not good god only be good child ' 'he be good to ' 'ah yes have taken from when thought be coming back in trouble in disgrace from world nameless

that charge have be libel when even miscreant have told against when very judge have gone back from word in be so confident will mother mother only think that be wretched miserable nameless outcast

repeated hester that be husband ' suppose so ' said woman very slowly beamma say that be so bless child ' 'god bless child ' 'and know that be so ' 'yes word be hardly spoken lip of one be close to ear of other sound be heard assent be acknowledged chapter lxiv conclusion web of story have now be woven piece be finished be only necessary that loose thread must be collected so that there may be unravelling in such chronicle a something doubt might be left to imagination without serious injury to story reader think feel deficiency when through tedium coldness writer omits to give information posse among male personage of story bagwax must perhaps be allowed to stand first be energy devotion to peculiar duty after verdict served to keep alive idea that verdict have be unjust be through ingenuity that judge bramber be induced to refer inquiry back to scotland yard in way to prevent escape of crinkett euphemia smith therefore will first say word a to bagwax history be rumoured at time sir john joram mr brown having met other at club after order for caldigate release have be given discussing matter with great interest united in giving praise to bagwax then sir john told story of broken hope of man desire to travel of faith honesty with sacrificed own aspiration for good of poor lady whose husband have be so cruelly taken away from then a be said at time important letter be sent from home office to postmaster general giving mr bagwax much praise suggesting that very good thing must be done to colony of new south wale if ingenious skilful master of postmark must be sent out to sydney with view of setting matter straight in sydney office there be then much correspondence with colonial office did not at first care very much about bagwax at last order be given by treasury bagwax went there be many tear shed on occasion at apricot villa jemima curlydown thought that also must be allowed to see sydney be in favour of immediate marriage with object bagwax felt that boisterous ocean might be unpropitious to delight of honeymoon mr curlydown reminded daughter of furniture must thus be lost bagwax went a gay bachelor spent six happy month in bright colony did not effect much a delinquent who have served crinkett in base purpose have already be detected punished before arrival be treated with extreme courtesy by sydney official be able to bring home with treasure in shape of newly discovered manner of tying mail bag so that when beydney intelligencer ' boasted that great english professor who have come to instruct have gone home instructed there be truth in be married immediately after return jemima wife have advantage in very pretty drawing room of shilling that made by voyage reader will be glad to hear that soon afterwards be appointed inspector general of post mark to great satisfaction of post office footnote hope friend in sydney post office will take offence must story ever reach ear know how well duty be done in office between think that mr bagwax journey be quite unnecessary one of few thing caldigate did before took wife abroad be to 'look after dick shand be manifest to concerned that dick must do good in england yellow trouser manner accompanied be not generally acceptable in merchant office suchlike place knew nothing about english farming for who have not learned work early be expensive amusement rather than trade by bread can be earned there seemed to be hardly hope for dick in england have done good among south sea islander knew way must manage be sent out therefore with small capital to be junior partner on sugar estate in queensland need hardly be said that small capital be lent to by john caldigate there took steadily to work be hoped by friend that will soon begin to repay loan uncle aunt cousin at babington soon renewed intimacy with john caldigate became intimate with hester old squire still turned up nose at a have done life calling boeotians reminding son that suffolk have always be silly county babingtons one knew have objection to be accounted thick headed a long a be acknowledged to be prosperous happy comfortable have always be considered at babington that young caldigate be brighter more clever than yet have be popular with a cousin of whom ought to be proud be soon restored to former favour after return from continent spent fortnight at hall with wife very comfortably julia indeed be not there mr smirkie among neighbour acquaintance mr smirkie be last to drop idea that there must have be something in story of australian marriage theory of law on subject be still incorrect queen pardon said must not do away with verdict therefore doubted whether couple must be regarded a man wife be very anxious that must be married again with great good nature offered to perform ceremony at plum cum pippin even in drawing room at folking beuffolk to very backbone ' be remark of cambridgeshire squire when heard of very kind offer even at last came round under wife persuasion when found that paternal mansion be likely to be shut against unless yielded hester second tour with husband be postponed for week because be necessary that husband must appear a witness against crinkett euphemia smith be tried also at cambridge not before judge bramber woman never yielded inch when found how be going with made fast money with infinite pluck resolved that must endure with patience might be in store for wait for better time when put into dock pleaded not guilty with voice be audible only to jailer standing beside after did not open mouth during trial crinkett made great effort to be admitted a additional witness against comrade having failed in pleaded guilty at last felt that there be hope for with weight of evidence against calculated that punishment might thus be lighter that must save cost of expensive defence in former hope be deceived a two be condemned to same term of imprisonment when woman heard that be to be confined for three year with hard labour spirit be almost broken made outward sign a be led away out of dock looked round for caldigate to wither with last glance of reproach caldigate who have not beheld misery without pang at heart have already left court judge bramber never opened mouth upon matter to single human being be man who in bosom of family did not say much about daily work of life who have few friend sufficiently intimate to be trusted with judicial feeling secretary of state be enabled to triumph in correctness of decision may be question whether judge bramber enjoyed triumph matter have gone luckily for secretary how must have be have crinkett woman be acquitted how must have be have caldigate broken down in evidence be forced to admit that there have be marriage of kind doubt accusation have be false doubt verdict have be erroneous man have brought upon by own egregious folly must have have just cause for complaint have be kept in prison till second case have be tried be thus that judge bramber regarded matter said not word about to one when second trial be over caldigate wife started for paris stayed few day on way with william bolton in london wife be quite ready to receive hester husband with open arm tell fairly ' said to caldigate 'that when there be doubt thought better that hester must be apart must have thought same have be sister now be only too happy to congratulate of that truth have be brought to light ' on return mr robert bolton be very friendly robert bolton be at last brought round to acknowledge that conviction have be wrong there be still much that stuck in throat did john caldigate pay twenty thousand pound to person when knew that have hatched conspiracy against ' question asked brother william over over again never must be satisfied with answer brother must give once asked question of caldigate 'because felt that in honour owed to ' said caldigate 'and perhaps little too because felt that if took off at once sister might be spared something of pain have suffered ' still be unintelligible to robert bolton that man in sens must give away so large sum of money with so slight prospect of substantial return hester often go to see mother mr bolton have never be at folking probably never will again visit that house be woman whose heart be not capable of many change who can not readily give to new affection having once owned that john caldigate be daughter husband now alleges further doubt on matter writes word john caldigate ' without struggle doe take delight in daughter visit when last heard from folking mr john caldigate second
