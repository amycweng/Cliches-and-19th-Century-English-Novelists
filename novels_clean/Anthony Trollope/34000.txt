pucker saw walking with young man from brewery though mr ray have be strongly inclined to throw what odium must upon miss pucker though hated miss pucker in heart at special moment for having carried tale against darling must not deny even to herself that terrible state of thing have arrived if be really true that rachel have be seen walking with young man be not bitter on subject a be mr prime poor miss pucker be filled full of indefinite horror with regard to young men in general be regarded by a wolf a wolf with without sheep clothing doubt whether ever brought home to herself that whom now recognized a established well credited lord of creation have ever be young men when heard of wedding when learned that struggling son of adam have taken to wife have settled down to sober work of world rejoiced greatly thinking that son of adam have done well to get married whenever be whispered into ear that young man be looking after young woman that be taking only step by must hope to find

nevertheless there be something terrible in very thought of young man though must fain have defended child hardly knew how to do so otherwise than by discrediting word of miss pucker always be very ill natured know mr ray ventured to hint mother said mr prime in peculiarly stern voice of hers there can be reason for supposing miss pucker wish to malign child be belief rachel will be in baslehurst evening if so probably intends to meet again know be going into baslehurst after tea said mr ray because have promised to walk with miss tappitts told so exactly with brewery girl oh mother now be certainly true that three miss be daughter of bungall tappitt old established brewer of baslehurst be at least actual child of mr tappitt who be sole surviving partner in brewery name of

various occasion gone with sister to dorcas meeting once twice have remained at miss pucker house drinking tea there greatly disliked be aware when did so that sister paid for thought that dorothea showed by behaviour that be mistress of entertainment then rachel greatly disliked miss pucker disliked that lady squint disliked tone of voice disliked subservience to mr prime especially disliked vehemence of objection to young men when rachel have last left miss pucker room have resolved that must never again drink tea there have not said to herself positively that must attend more of dorcas

same time uttered hint by strove to impress upon mother that rachel ought to be kept in subordination in fact that power must not belong to rachel of choosing whether must must not go to dorcas meeting in such matter according to dorothea view of case rachel must do a be bidden then how be rachel to be made to do a be bidden how be sister to enforce attendance obedience in world depends a frequently on weakness of who be governed a on strength of who governs that man who be going to left be ordered by with voice of command to go to right when hesitates put more command into voice more command into eye then obeys mr prime have tried rachel have not turned to right when mr prime applied for aid to mother be sign that power of command be going from after dinner elder sister made

about work just a merrily kindly a though there have be no word about young man went across for cream stayed gossiping for few minute with mr sturt then bustled about kitchen making tea toasting bread have never be more anxious to make everything comfortable for mother never more eager in coaxing way of doing honour to good thing have prepared through mother be aware that everything be not right there be something in rachel voice betrayed inward uneasiness something in vivacity of movement be not quite true to usual nature mr ray felt that be so must not therefore be altogether at ease

forth for more than two hour after that widow sat alone thinking of child a regarded mr prime there be at rate cause for trembling timid thought might be regarded a being safe from world wicked allurement be founded like strong rock be with stedfast earnestness staff on weaker mother might lean with security then be so stern very strength be so oppressive rachel be weaker more worldly given terribly to vain desire thought be almost wicked then be so pleasant to live with rachel though weak worldly almost wicked be so very good kind sweet a mr ray thought of began to doubt whether after world be so very bad place whether wickedness of tea toast of other creature comfort must be so very great wonder what sort of young man be said to herself mr prime return be always timed with regularity of clockwork at period of year invariably came in exactly at half past nine mr ray be very anxious that rachel must come in first so that nothing must be said of walk on evening have be unwilling to imply distrust by making special request on occasion have therefore said nothing on subject a rachel went have carefully watched clock have become uneasy a time came round for mr prime

manner be such a to make impossible that mother must not notice be there anything wrong dorothea said rachel have not come home yet of course said mr prime not yet be with miss tappitts mother be not with miss tappitts voice a said word be dreadful to mother ear be thought be do know where be who be to say where be hour since saw alone with with whom not with young man from brewery for be at exeter mother be here in baslehurst hour since rachel be standing alone together beneath elm in churchyard saw with own eye chapter iii arm in cloud there be plenty of time for full inquiry full reply between mr ray mr prime before rachel opened cottage door interrupted be then nearly half past ten rachel have never be so late before last streak of sun reflection in east have vanished last ruddy line of evening light have gone darkness of coming night be upon hour be late for girl such a rachel ray to be out alone there have be long discussion between mother elder daughter mr ray believing implicitly in last announcement made to be full of fear for child utmost rigour of self denying propriety must have be exercised by rachel whereas conduct have be too dreadful almost to be described two three hour since mr ray have fondly promised that must trust younger daughter have let forth alone proud in seeing so comely a went idea have almost entered mind that if young man be very steady such acquaintance might perhaps be not altogether wicked everything be changed now happiness of trust be gone sweet hope be crushed heart be filled with fear face be pale with sorrow why must know where be to be dorothea have asked be not at exeter be here be with then two have sat gloomily together till rachel returned a came in there be little forced laugh upon face be late be not said oh

may be a well to say few word about firm of messrs bungall tappitt about tappitt family generally about mr luke rowan before further portion of history of evening be written why there must have be brewery at at baslehurst seeing that everybody in part of world drink cider how under such circumstance messrs bungall tappitt have managed to live upon proceeds of trade can not pretend to say

nevertheless bungall tappitt have be brewer in baslehurst for last fifty year have managed to live out of brewery be not to be supposed that be great men like mighty men of beer known of old such a barclay perkins reid co be new pink prosperous going into parliament for borough just a pleased like modern hero of bitter cask when student at oxford be asked what man have most benefited humanity when answered bass think that must not have be plucked be fair average answer student at university must have said a much for bungall tappitt without deserving utter disgrace penance outraged examiner must inflict be sour muddy stream flowed from vat beverage disagreeable to palate very cold uncomfortable to stomach who drank must never learn be to be found at respectable inn be admitted at private gentleman table farmer knew nothing of labourer drenched habitually with cider nevertheless brewery of messrs bungall tappitt be kept going large ugly square brick house in tappitt family lived be warm comfortable there be something in very name of beer make money old bungall who first established house be still remembered by senior of baslehurst have be dead more than twenty year before period of story have be short fat old man not much above five foot high very silent very hard very ignorant have understood business have established firm on solid foundation late in life have taken into

mourning be over then not till then mr tappitt have put up board with joint name of firm a at present called be believed in baslehurst that mr bungall have not bequeathed undivided interest in concern to nephew indeed people went so far a to say that have left away from mr tappitt that must leave truth in respect may a well be told at once widow have possessed third of profit of concern in lieu of right to full half share in concern must have carried with onus of full half share of work third right have left to nephew rather to great nephew luke rowan be not however in young man power to walk into brewery claim seat there a partner be not in power to do so even if such must be wish when old mr bungall died at dawlish at very advanced age of ninety seven there came to be a be natural little dispute between mr tappitt distant connection luke rowan mr tappitt suggested that luke must take thousand pound down walk forth free from contamination of malt hop luke attorney asked for ten thousand luke rowan at time be articled to lawyer in london a dinginess of chamber frequented in lincoln inn field appeared to le attractive than beautiful river of devonshire offered to go into brewery a partner be at last settled that must place there a clerk for twelve month drawing certain moderate income out of concern that if at end of year must show to be able feel to be willing to act a partner firm must be changed to tappitt rowan must be established permanently a baslehurst brewer information however beyond have already be given to reader respecting mr rowan prospect think ever will be partner rachel have said to mother because quarrel with mr tappitt have be very accurate in statement mr rowan have now be three month at baslehurst have not altogether found way of relative pleasant mr tappitt wished to treat a clerk whereas wished to be treated a partner mr tappitt have by mean found way of young man to be pleasant young rowan be not idle did lack intelligence indeed possessed more energy cleverness than in tappitt opinion be necessary to position of brewer in baslehurst be by mean willing to use good gift in manner indicated by sole existing owner of concern mr tappitt wished that rowan must learn brewing seated on stool that lesson must be purely arithmetical luke be instructed a to use of certain dull dingy disagreeable ledger informed that in lay natural work of brewer desired to learn chemical action of malt hop upon other have not be fortnight in concern before suggested to mr tappitt that by salutary process described liquor might be made le muddy let brew good beer have said then tappitt have known that must not do yes said tappitt sell for twopence pint what will cost threepence to make be what have got to look to said rowan believe can be done for money only one must learn how to do have be at life tappitt said yes mr tappitt be only now that men be beginning to appreciate that chemistry can do for if will allow will make experiment on small scale after mr tappitt have declared emphatically to wife that luke rowan must never become partner of must ruin business in world said tappitt a to conceit be true that rowan be conceited perhaps true also that must have ruined brewery have be allowed to have own way mr tappitt by mean held in such aversion a did husband be well grown good looking young man for whom friend have made comfortable provision mr tappitt have three marriageable daughter idea on subject of young men in general be by mean identical with held by mr ray be aware how frequently happened that young partner must marry daughter of senior in house seemed to that special provision for such arrangement be made in case young rowan be living in house be naturally thrown into great intimacy with girl be clear to quick eye that be of susceptible disposition fond of lady society altogether prone to pleasant pre matrimonial conversation from effect of be so difficult for inexperienced young man to make escape mr tappitt be minded to devote to augusta second of flock not so minded with obstinacy of resolution if luke must prefer martha elder cherry younger girl mr tappitt must make objection expected that must do duty by taking one of law t be so foolish said to husband when made complaint to always called husband t unless when solemnity of special occasion justified in addressing a mr tappitt to have called tom thomas must in estimation have be very vulgar be so foolish did never have to do with young man before tantrum will blow off when get into tantrum spoken of be rowan insane desire to brew good beer be of so fatal nature tappitt be determined not to submit to luke rowan must never be partner of not though have twenty daughter waiting to be married rachel have be acquainted with tappitts before young rowan have come to baslehurst have be made known to by collectively have shared mother prudence must probably not have done anything so rash rachel be better looking than of though fact perhaps might not have be known to in justice to must say that lacked mother prudence be good humoured laughing ordinary girl very much alike with long brown curl fresh complexion large mouth thick nose augusta be rather taller of three therefore in mother eye beauty girl when distant cousin have come amongst have not thought of appropriating when after first day became intimate with promised to

said oh must like because be friend of ours cherry have answered must be bit surprised if fell violently in love with mr tappitt did not hear nevertheless began to entertain dislike to rachel must not be supposed that admitted daughter augusta to participation in plan mr tappitt must scheme for child must not teach child to scheme a regarded girl must all fall out after natural pleasant everyday fashion of such thing mr tappitt considered that own natural advantage be so great that must make thing fall out a wished when be informed about fortnight after rowan arrival in baslehurst that rachel ray have be walking with party from brewery must not prevent from saying ill natured word two rachel ray be very well said be not person whom must show off to stranger a particular friend why not

not go among people know there be mr prime other daughter great friend be miss pucker suppose want to be very intimate with miss pucker brewer wife have position in baslehurst wished that daughter must maintain will now be understood in what way rachel have formed acquaintance with luke rowan think may certainly be admitted that have be guilty of great impropriety unless indeed have be wrong in saying nothing of acquaintance to mother previous to ill natured tidings brought home a to first churchyard meeting rachel have seen twice on first occasion have thought little of little of luke of acquaintance with in simple truth matter have passed from mind therefore have not spoken of when met second time luke have walked much of way home with with alone having joined to when tappitt girl went into house a rachel have afterwards described to mother in that have said have spoken absolutely truth can not be pleaded on behalf that after second meeting with mr rowan have said nothing of

martha that mr rowan have come home suppose will see anything of evening a be busy with papa rachel for few minute became silent thoughtful mind have not yet freed from effect of conversation with

must admit proffered intimacy before must see again do so hope will be friend have said to a gave hand when parted on cawston bridge then have muttered something have not quite caught a to baslehurst being altogether place to since have seen have hurried home on occasion with feeling half pleasant half painful that something out of usual course have occurred to after amounted to nothing what be there that must tell mother have special tale to tell yet must not speak of young rowan a must have spoken of chance acquaintance be not conscious that have pressed hand warmly a parted from rachel entertained much of that indefinite fear of young men so strongly pervaded mother mind a regarded sister have altogether ceased to be indefinite rachel knew that be natural enemy of special class that kind of friendship might be allowed to except friendship with of a be good girl loving mother anxious to do well guided by pure thought felt aware that mr rowan must be shunned have not be that have told that be to be in exeter must not have come out to walk with brewery girl on evening what might hereafter decide upon doing how affair might be made to arrange by mean must foresee on evening have

mother scheme after there be much talking about party conversation be chiefly kept up by tappitt girl rachel be almost sure that mother must not like to go to dance be quite sure that sister must oppose such iniquity with power therefore made promise listened a list be repeated of who be expected to come asked few question a to mr rowan daughter then at sudden turn of lane lane led back to town by route met luke rowan be cousin of tappitts therefore though relationship be not near have already assumed privilege of calling by christian name martha who be nearly thirty year old four year senior have taught to call luke with other two be a yet mr rowan greeting be of course very friendly returned with on path to rachel raised hat then offered hand have felt to be confused moment saw so confused that be not able to ask how be with ordinary composure be very angry with heartily wished that be seated with dorcas woman at miss pucker position must have be better for than in be disgracing showing that must not bear before young man a though be no more than ordinary acquaintance mind must revert to hand squeezing to muttered word to mother caution when remarked to that have come back earlier than expected must not take word a though signified nothing sudden return be momentous fact to putting out of usual quiet mode of thought said little nothing at rate did not observe

nothing party be miss rowan fond of dancing then by degree girl called mary declaring that a be cousin intended so to do luke said that ought to be called by christian name two younger girl agreed that be entitled to privilege only must ask mamma first in way be becoming very intimate rachel said little perhaps not much that be said be addressed specially to seemed to feel that be included in friendliness of gathering now then luke rowan must address voice be pleasant to ear have made effort to walk next to attempt almost too slight to be called effort have almost unconsciously frustrated by so placing that augusta must be between augusta be not quite in good humour said one two word be slightly snubbing in tendency be more than atoned for by cherry high good humour when reached brewery declared to be very much astonished on learning that be already past nine rachel surprise at rate be real must go home at once said know what mamma will think of then wishing good bye without further delay hurried on into churchyard will see safe through ghost at rate said rowan be not bit afraid of churchyard ghost said rachel moving on rowan followed have got to go into town to meet

with departing glory in few moment that stood there gazing might almost have be believed that portentous miracle have happened so deep dark yet so bright be hue of horizon seemed a though land below hill be bathed in blood elm tree interrupted view so that must only look out through space between trunk come to stile said if be to live thousand year might never again see such sunset a that must never forgive if missed just that might save three minute rachel stepped with towards stile be not solely entreaty that made do so a spoke of sun glory sharp ear caught sound of woman foot close to

huge hand stretched out from other world to take do see sound of voice be very pleasant word to young ear seemed full of poetry sweet mysterious romance spoke to a one man woman have ever spoken to before have feeling a painful a be delicious that man word be sweet with sweetness have known in dream have asked question repeated so that be driven to answer still be full of one great fact that have called rachel that must be rebuked for so calling how must rebuke man who have bid look at god beautiful work in such language a have used yes see be very grand there be finger see how be melting away arm be there still hand be gone can trace because saw when be clear must not now show to wonder whether one else saw that hand arm only must like to think that be shown to only be impossible for now to go back upon word rachel must pas by a though have not heard world might have seen have looked said perhaps not do think that eye can see alike well yes suppose so eye will see loaf of bread alike churchyard stile eye will not see cloud alike do not often find world among cloud do world said amazed at energy then bethought that be right must never have seen that hand arm have not be there to show so gazed down upon changing colour of horizon almost forgot that must not have lingered there moment yet there be strong feeling upon that be sinking sinking sinking away into iniquity ought not to have stood there instant ought not to have be there with at yet lingered now that be there hardly knew how to move away yes world among cloud continued before did so there have be silence between for minute two do never feel that look into other world beyond one in eat drink sleep have other world in dream yes such dream have known now almost thought that must remember to have seen strange form in cloud knew that henceforth must watch cloud find there looked down into flood of light beneath with full consciousness that be close to touching with full consciousness moment that lingered there be new sin with full consciousness too that beauty of fading colour seen thus in presence possessed charm sense of soft delight have never known before at last uttered long sigh why what ail said oh must go have be so wrong to stand here good bye pray pray come with will shake hand with then got hand held why must be wrong for to stand look at sunset be ogre have done anything must make afraid of hold mr rowan did not think must behave like gloom of evening be now coming on though few minute have passed since mr prime have walked through churchyard must not have be able to recognize have walked there now be getting dark must go instantly let go with then a far a bridge pray vex will not will go alone stand while say one word to why must be afraid of be not afraid of at least know what mean wonder wonder whether dislike dislike anybody good night have however again got hand will tell why ask because like so much so very much why must not be friend well there will not trouble now will not stir from here till be out of sight mind remember intend that will like be gone from fleeing away along path in run while last word be being spoken yet though be spoken in low voice heard remembered syllable what did man mean by saying that intended that must like like how must fail of liking only be not incumbent on to take step might save from ever seeing again like indeed what be meaning of word have intended to ask to love if so what answer must make how beautiful have be cloud a soon a be beyond church wall so that must look again to west gazed with eye to see if there be still remnant left of arm no have melted into monstrous shape indistinct gloomy partaking of darkness of night brightness of vision be gone bade look into cloud for new world seemed to feel that there be hidden meaning in word a looked out into coming darkness mystery crept over sense of something wonderful be out there away of something so full of mystery that must not tell whether be thinking of hidden distance of horizon of distance of own future life be still further off more closely hidden found trembling sighing almost sobbing then ran again have wrapped in influence filled full of magnetism of own being woman weakness peculiar susceptibility of nature have never before be touched have now heard first word of romance have ever reached ear have fallen upon with so great power that be overwhelmed word of romance word direct from evil one mr prime must have called in saying so must have spoken belief of many good woman many good man be good woman sincere honest hardworking denying woman woman who struggled hard to do duty a believed have be taught to a walked through churchyard having come down brewery lane with inkling that sister might be there have be struck with horror at seeing rachel standing with man what must do paused moment to ask whether must return for said to herself that sister be obstinate that scene must be occasioned that must do good so passed on word of romance indeed must not all such word be word from father of lie seeing that be word of falseness such thought passed through mind a walked home thinking of sister iniquity of sister who must be saved like brand from fire whose saving must now be effected only by sternest of discipline hour at dorcas meeting must be made longer rachel must always be there in mean time rachel hurried home with spirit tremble of immediately coming encounter with mother sister hardly thought much before reached door thought only of how beautiful be how grand how dangerous of of word how beautiful be how grand how terribly dangerous knew that be very late hurried step knew that mother must be appeased sister must be opposed to mother to sister be given depth of thought be still thinking of of man arm in cloud when opened door of cottage at bragg end chapter iv what will be done about rachel be still thinking of luke rowan of man arm when opened cottage door sight of sister face tone of sister voice soon brought back to full consciousness of immediate present position oh dolly speak with terrible voice a though world be coming to end said in answer to first note of objurgation be uttered note came afterwards be so much more terrible so much more severe that rachel found quite unable to stop by must be joking tone mr prime be desirous that mother must speak word of censure must be spoken must have preferred to remain silent knowing that must be a severe in silence a in speech if only mother must use occasion a must be used mr ray have be made to feel how great be necessity for outspoken severity when moment came dear beautiful child stood there before must not utter word with have be already prompted oh rachel said dorothea tell then stopped what have dorothea told asked rachel have told said mr prime now speaking out that saw standing alone hour since with young man in churchyard yet have said that be to have be away in exeter rachel cheek forehead be now suffused with red used to think when pretended to read face of neighbour that rising blush betrayed conscious falsehood for most part know better now have learned to decipher more accurately outward sign be given by impulse of heart unmerited accusation of untruth will ever bring blood to face of young innocent mr ray be among ignorant in matter groaned inwardly when saw child confusion oh rachel be true said be what true mamma be true that mr rowan spoke to in churchyard though did not know that dorothea be acting a spy on rachel rachel said mother be very necessary that one must act spy on said sister spy indeed think to anger by using such word will not be angered by word went there to look after fearing that there be occasion fearing hardly thinking now know that there be occasion there be occasion said rachel looking into sister face with eye of incipient strength be becoming manifest there be occasion oh mamma think there be occasion for watching why did say that young man be at exeter asked mr prime because have told that must be there have told so a be walking together came to day instead of coming to morrow what must say if questioned in way about friend then when word have passed from lip remembered that must not have called mr rowan friend have never called so in thinking of to herself have never admitted that have regard for have acknowledged to herself that must be very dangerous to entertain friendship for such a friend rachel said mr prime if look for such friendship a who can say what will come to have looked for have looked for anything people do get to know other without looking ca help then mr prime took off bonnet shawl rachel laid down hat little light summer cloak must not be supposed that war be suspended during operation mr prime be aware that great deal more must be said be very anxious that mother must say rachel also knew that much more must be said be by mean anxious that subject must be dropped if only must talk mother over to side if think right exclaimed mr prime that must be standing alone with young man after in churchyard then have done in case will say no more must tell must tell also that if be to be so can not remain at cottage longer oh dorothea said mr ray indeed mother can not if rachel be not hindered from such meeting by own sense of what be right must be hindered by authority of older than hindered hindered from what said rachel who felt that tear be coming struggled hard to retain mamma have done nothing be wrong mamma will believe will not mr ray did not know what to say strove to believe of though word of one be directly at variance with word of other do mean to claim a right said mr prime to be standing out there alone at hour of night with young man that please if so can not be sister want to be sister if think such hard thing said rachel whose tear now must no longer be restrained honi soit qui mal y pense did not at moment remember word to speak contain exactly purport of thought now having become conscious of own weakness by reason of tear must overwhelm determined that must say nothing further till pleaded cause before mother alone how must describe before sister way in interview at churchyard stile have be brought about must kneel at mother foot tell everything thought at least that must tell mother everything occupied generally same bedroom a sister on certain occasion if mother be unwell like must sleep in mother room mamma said will let sleep with to night will go now when come will tell everything good night to dolly good night rachel voice of mr prime a bade sister adieu for evening sounded a voice of raven two widow sat in silence for while waiting for other to speak then mr prime got up folded shawl very carefully carefully put bonnet glove down upon be habit to be very careful with clothes in anger have almost thrown upon little sofa will have anything before go to bed dorothea said mr ray nothing thank said mr prime voice be very like voice of raven then mr ray began to think possible that might escape away to rachel without further word be very tired said think will go dorothea mother said mr prime something must be done about yes dear will talk to to night tell will tell truth never told falsehood yet dorothea be sure did know that young man be to be here know if did come back from exeter before said must must help do mean that must help being with there alone mother what must think of other girl of whom heard thing mr ray shuddered then thought shadow perhaps of remembrance flitted across mind seemed to have effect of palliating child iniquity suppose said suppose what said mr prime sternly mr ray did not dare to go on with supposition did not dare to suggest that mr rowan might perhaps be very proper young man that two young people might be growing fond of other in proper sort of way hardly believed in such propriety knew that daughter must scout to wind suppose what said mr prime again more sternly than before if other girl left went away to brewery perhaps must not have helped said mr ray be not walking with face be not turned towards home even be standing together under tree judging from time at got home must have remained together for nearly hour afterwards with perfect stranger mother man whose name have never mentioned to till be told how miss pucker have seen together can not suppose that want to make out worse than be be child sister be bound together for weal for woe talked about going away leaving said mr ray speaking in soreness rather than in anger so did so must unless something be done must not be right must remain here seeing such thing if voice be not allowed to be heard though did go must still be sister must still share sorrow shame oh dorothea say such word must be said mother be not from such meeting shame come shame sorrow sin love dearly so do be therefore to allow to be castaway whom love must chastise have authority over a have told more than once already therefore say again that unless be stopped must leave cottage good night now mother hope will speak to in earnest then mr prime took candle went way for ten minute mother sat down thinking of condition of youngest daughter trying to think what word must use when found in daughter presence sorrow shame sin child castaway what terrible word be yet there have be nothing that must allege in answer to that comfortable idea of decent husband for child have be banished from mind almost before have be entertained then thought of rachel eye knew that must not be able to assume perfect mastery over girl when ten minute be over have made up mind to nothing then also took up candle went to room when first entered did not see rachel have silently closed door come step within chamber before child showed from behind bed mamma said put down candle may speak to whereupon mr ray put down candle rachel took hold of arm mamma believe ill of do think of thing dorothea say say that will die darling have never thought anything bad of before do think bad of now did not tell before went out that must trust have so soon forgotten trust look at mamma what have ever done that must think to be such a say think that have done anything be very young rachel young mamma be older than be when married older than dolly be be old enough to know what be wrong will tell happened evening came met in field knew before that have come back for girl have said so thought that be in exeter when left here have not believed must not have gone think must not have gone then be afraid of mamma be not afraid of say such strange thing to must not purposely have gone out to meet came to in field then returned up lane to brewery there left girl a went through churchyard came there too then sun be setting stopped to look at did stop with for few moment felt ashamed of how be to help mamma if must remember must tell word said to look of face asked to be friend mamma if will believe in will tell everything will never deceive be still holding mother arm while spoke now held very close nestled in against bosom gradually got cheek against mother cheek lip against mother neck how must mother refuse such caress a remain hard stern against such sign of love mr ray at rate be not possessed of strength to do so be vanquished put arm round girl embraced spoke soft word told rachel that be dear dear dearest darling be still awed dismayed by tidings have heard of young man still thought there be terrible danger against behoved to be on guard no longer felt divided from child have ceased to believe in necessity of terrible word mr prime have used will believe said rachel will not think that be making up story to deceive then mother assured daughter with many kiss that must believe after sat long into night discussing luke rowan have said discussion certainly took place after fashion must not have be considered satisfactory by mr prime have heard mr ray be soon led into talking about mr rowan a though be not wolf a though might possibly be wolf ravenous with native wolfish fur open wolfish greed worse than that wolf more ravenous still in sheep clothing there be word spoken of a lover rachel told mother that man have called by christian name mr ray have fully understood sign darling must let do that mamma wo went on talking so fast have not time to stop after that be not worth while project of party be also told to mr ray rachel sitting now with head upon mother lap owned that must like to go to party be not always wicked mamma said to assertion mr ray expressed undecided assent intimated decided belief that very many party be wicked there will be dancing like said mr ray yet be taught dancing at school said rachel when matter have gone so far a must be acknowledged that rachel have done much towards securing share of mastery over mother will be there of course said mr ray oh will be there said rachel why must be afraid of why must live a though be afraid to meet dolly think must be shut up close to be taken care of think of like if be minded to be bad shutting up must not keep from such argument a from rachel mouth sounded at first very terrible to mr ray yet yielded to on next morning rachel be down first be found by sister fast engaged on usual work of house a though nothing out of way have occurred on previous evening good morning dolly said then went on arranging thing on breakfast table good morning rachel said mr prime still speaking like raven there be not word said between about young man churchyard at nine o'clock mr ray came down to dressed ready for church seated ate breakfast together still not word be said be mr prime custom to go to morning service at one of church in baslehurst not at old parish church stood in churchyard near brewery at new church have be built a auxiliary to other at rev samuel prong be ministering clergyman a will have occasion to know mr prong may be a well to explain here that be not simply curate to old dr harford rector of baslehurst have separate district of own have be divided from old parish not exactly in accordance with rector good pleasure dr harford have held living for more than forty year have held for nearly forty year before division have be made have thought that parish must remain parish entire more especially a presentation to new benefice be not conceded to therefore dr harford did not love mr prong mr prime did love with sort of love devout woman bestow upon church minister of choice mr prong be energetic severe hardworking fear intolerant young man who bestowed very much laudable care upon sermon care industry be laudable not so pride with thought of result spoke much of preaching gospel be sincere beyond doubt in desire to do so allowed to be led away into belief that brother in ministry around did not preach gospel that be careless shepherd shepherd dog indifferent to wolf in way have made unpopular among clergy gentry of neighbourhood may well be understood that man coming down upon district cut out almost from centre of dr harford parish must be thorn in side of old man mr prong have circle of friend of very ardent friend among mr prime be one of most ardent for last year two have always attended morning service at church very frequently have gone there twice in day though walk be long tedious taking whole length of town of baslehurst there have be little uneasiness between mr ray mr prime on matter of church attendance mr prime have wished mother sister to have benefit of mr prong eloquence mr ray though be weak in moral be strong in determination to adhere to mr comfort of cawston have be matter of great sorrow to that daughter must leave mr comfort church have positively declined to be taken out of own parish rachel have of course stuck to mother in controversy have said sharp thing about mr prong declared that mr prong have be educated at islington sometimes forgot h when such thing be said mr prime must wax very angry must declare that one must be saved by perfection of dr harford pronunciation there be question a to dr harford justification for introduction of name into dispute mr prime however did not choose to say anything against mr comfort with whom husband have be curate who in younger day have be light to own foot mr comfort be by mean one a dr harford though two old men be friend mr comfort have be regarded a calvinist when be young a evangelical in middle life be still known a low churchman in old age therefore mr prime must spare in sneer though left ministry have become lukewarm not absolutely stone cold like old rector at baslehurst so said mr prime old men must become lukewarm therefore must pardon mr comfort dr harford have never be warm at have never be warm with warmth valued therefore scorned sneered at in return for rachel scorned mr prong sneered at though be mr prime custom to go to church at baslehurst on special sunday declared intention of accompanying mother to cawston not word have be said about young man started off on walk together in silence gloom with such thought a have in mind be impossible that must make journey pleasantly rachel have counted on walk with mother have determined that everything must be pleasant must have said word two about luke rowan must have gradually reconciled mother to name a be said nothing may be feared that mind during period of worship be not at charity with sister mr comfort preached half hour a usual then walked home dr harford never exceeded twenty minute have often be known to finish discourse within ten what might be length of sermon of mr prong man woman must foretell never spared congregation much under hour walked home gloomily to dinner ate cold mutton potato in sorrow sadness seemed a though sort of conversation be open to must not talk of usual sunday subject mind be full of one matter seemed that matter be by common consent to be banished from lip for day in evening after tea two sister again went up to cawston church leaving mother with bible hardly word be spoken between in same silence sat till bed time to mr ray to rachel have be one of saddest dreariest day that of have ever known doubt whether suffering of mr prime be so great be kept up by excitement of feeling that great crisis be at hand if rachel be not made amenable to authority must leave cottage when rachel have run with hurrying step from stile in churchyard left luke rowan still standing there watched till crossed into lane then turned again looked out upon still ruddy line of horizon blaze of light be gone there be left high up in heaven wonderful hue tinge with softly changing colour edge of cloud when brightness of glorious sunset have passed away sat on wooden rail watching till of must be over thinking with lazy half formed thought of rachel ray did not ask what meant by assuring of friendship by claiming hers declared to that be very lovely more lovely than beautiful then smiled inwardly at prettiness of perturbed spirit remembered well that have called rachel that have allowed doing so to pas by without notice understood also how why have done so knew

be guided by have told rachel that must ask clergyman advice take might be nevertheless did not find to be easy a walked home mr comfort latter teaching tended to upset conviction of life according to teaching a uttered in sanctum of own study young men be not to be regarded a ravening wolf meeting in churchyard have utterly overwhelmed dorothea by weight of iniquity even to have be very terrible be mere nothing venial accident on rachel part most natural proceeding in world on part of luke rowan that be natural enough for wolf mr ray must understand be now told that lamb might go out meet wolf without danger then question about rowan share in brewery mr comfort ready assertion that young wolf man wolf a case might be be well to do in world in fact mr ray interview with clergyman have

have not be regular full gathering mr prime have come back to tea there be hot toast clotted cream may appear selfish on part of mr ray rachel that must have kept such good thing for only little private banquet in truth such delicacy did not suit mr prime nice thing aggravated spirit made fretful liked tea to be stringy bitter liked bread to be stale a preferred also that weed must be battered old be approaching that stage of discipline at ash become pleasant eating sackcloth be grateful to skin self indulgence of saint in respect often exceed anything be done by sinner dorothea said mr ray looked down upon dark dingy fluid in cup a spoke have be up to mr comfort to day yes heard say be going there went to ask for advice oh a be in much doubt thought right to go to clergyman

that might send little note to mr tappitt signifying acceptance of lady kind invitation chapter vi preparation for mr tappitt party be disposed to think that mr butler cornbury did mr tappitt injury when with so much ready goodnature accepted invitation for party that mr tappitt be aware of before night of party arrived be put on mettle in way be disagreeable to forced into amount of submissive supplication to mr tappitt for fund be vexatious to spirit mr tappitt be good wife who never ran husband into debt kept nothing secret from in management of household nothing at least behoved to know understood privilege of position must have be possible for to have carried through party without extra household money without violent departure from usual custom of life must have snubbed husband objection comfortably have put into background for occasion without inconvenience to herself power of remonstrance from when mr butler cornbury have be gracious when fiddle horn have become fact to be accomplished when mr rowan mary began to loom large on imagination regular supper be projected then mr tappitt felt necessity of superior aid found called upon to reconcile lord work be more difficult more disagreeable to feeling because have already pooh poohed husband when asked question about party just few friend got together by girl have said leave to dear be not very often see anybody at home believe see friend a often a most people in baslehurst mr tappitt have replied indignantly suppose friend be friend so there have be little soreness made lady submission more disagreeable to butler

people will be glad to notice respectable if girl be to be made respectable by giving grand dance 'd rather not have respectable how much be whole thing to cost well very little t not much more than one of christmas dinner party there will be just music light bit of something to eat what people drink at such time come to nothing just little negus lemonade might possibly have bottle two of champagne at supper table for look of thing champagne exclaimed brewer have never yet incurred cost of bottle of champagne within own house though thought nothing of at public dinner idea be too much for mr tappitt feeling how ground lay gave that up at rate for present gave up champagne in abandoning that obtained marital sanction quasi sanction be too honourable a husband afterwards to repudiate for music eatable mr tappitt knew that have done well prepared for dinner day beef steak pie made with own hand tappitt be not altogether dull man understood little sign ah said wonder how much that pie be to cost oh t how can say such thing a if did have beef steak pie a often a be good for pie however have effect a also did exceeding boilishness of water be brought in for gin toddy night be

never stop be good doing that margaret only make worse there now have got soap blood down inside shirt mr tappitt on occasion be subjected to trouble for wound on mr tappitt cheek bone declined to be stanched at once gained object got dress for daughter be not taken by a drawback on happiness that have to make dress for be accustomed to such work necessity joined to other preparation for party made very busy till twelve at night on three evening sat with smart new thing in lap needle in hand did not begrudge a mr butler cornbury be coming to brewery be very anxious to get heavy part of work done before rowan must arrive doubting whether must become sufficiently intimate with mary to tell little domestic secret do work in presence of new friend during first day of sojourn in house so toiled like slave on wednesday thursday in order that might walk about like lady on friday saturday list of guest gave more trouble than aught else whom must get to meet mr butler cornbury at one time mr tappitt have proposed to word certain of invitation with special view to end have idea be carried out people who might not otherwise have come be to be tempted by notification that be especially asked to meet mr butler cornbury martha have said that thought must not do for dance people do do dear mr tappitt have pleaded not for dancing mamma said martha besides must be sure to hear of perhaps

harford rector daughter be fit to meet anybody in county a be good natured might probably come be old maid be never very bright in attire perhaps captain gordon lady must come mr tappitt suggested at proposition girl shook head captain gordon have lately taken villa close to baslehurst have shown averse to intercourse with townspeople mr tappitt have called on lady call have not even be returned card having be sent by post in envelope must be no good mamma said martha must only make uncomfortable if did come be always awfully stuck up in church said augusta nose be red at end said cherry

knew other a well a knew cross in butter market none of two family ever went into other house have be tacitly admitted among that fawcetts be above tappitts so matter have rested now if anything must

little dance to welcome friend from london must feel so much obliged if young lady must come mr butler cornbury have be kind enough to say that must join c c c mr tappitt augusta be in seventh heaven of happiness when mr fawcett wrote to say that three of girl must be delighted to accept invitation even discreet martha le ambitious cherry be well pleased declare think have be very fortunate said mr tappitt only miss fawcetts will get best partner said cherry be not so sure of said augusta holding up head there have be yet trouble be difficult for to get people proper to meet mr butler

have be asked before mr cornbury call have be made fear chance of coming to party must have be small there be one young griggs man very terrible in vulgarity loud rampant conspicuous with villainous jewellery odious with worst abomination of perfumery be loathsome even to tappitt girl then griggses tappitts have known other for century among ordinary acquaintance adolphus griggs might have be endured what must do when asked to be introduced to josceline fawcett of men be most unconscious of own defect have once shown symptom of admiration for cherry by whom be hated with intensity of dislike have amounted to passion have begged that might be omitted from list mr tappitt have be afraid of angering father rule also must be much in way old joshua rule be maltster living in cawston

whole mr rowan condescended to be gracious to at bragg end preparation for party required almost a much thought a did at brewery involved perhaps deeper care may be remembered that mr prime when ear be first astounded by unexpected revelation wiped crumb from out of lap walked off wounded in spirit to own room on evening rachel saw more of sister mr ray went up to daughter bedroom stayed there only minute two doe say asked rachel almost in whisper be very unhappy say that unless can be made to think better of must leave cottage told what mr comfort say only sneer at mr comfort be sure be endeavouring to do best can must do mamma to say that must manage everything otherwise be sure 'd give up party dear want to do that not after what mr comfort say mr ray have in truth gone to clergyman feeling sure that must have given word against party so strengthened must have taken course must have be offensive to of daughter have expected too that must have returned home armed with such clerical thunder against young man a must have quieted rachel have satisfied dorothea in have be may hardly say disappointed dismayed bewildered by advice very opposite to have expected be perplexing seemed to be aware that have alternative now to fight battle on rachel side have cut off from anchorage except given by mr comfort therefore behoved to cling to with absolute tenacity rachel must go to party even though dorothea must carry out threat on night nothing more be said about dorothea mr ray allowed to be gradually drawn into mild discussion about rachel dress there be nearly week left to of sort of life early on following morning mr prime left cottage saying that must dine with miss pucker betook at once to small house in back street of town behind new church in lived mr prong have a yet said that mr prong be bachelor such be fact there be not wanting in baslehurst who declared that must amend fault by marrying mr prime rumour if ever reached have effect upon world must be nothing to if be to be debarred by wickedness of loose tongue from visiting clergyman of choice went therefore in present difficulty to mr prong mr samuel prong be little man over thirty with scanty light brown hair with small rather upturned nose with eye by mean deficient in light expression with mean mouth forehead be good have not be for mouth face must have be expressive of intellect of firmness there be about lip assumption of character dignity countenance body generally failed to maintain there be something in carriage of head in occasional projection of chin be intended to add to dignity did think only make failure more palpable be devout good man not self indulgent perhaps not more self ambitious than becomes man to be sincere hard working sufficiently intelligent true in most thing to instinct of calling deficient in one vital qualification for clergyman of church of england be not gentleman may not call necessary qualification for clergyman of church be not gentleman mean to say that be thief liar do mean hereby to complain that picked teeth with fork misplaced h be by mean prepared to define what do mean thinking however that most men most woman will understand do speak of deficiency in clerical aptitude a being injurious to simply even chiefly among folk who be gentle that efficiency for clerical purpose be marred altogether among high low by misfortune in respect be not owner of good coat see admires beauty be not even who have good coat who recognize article on back of who have not good coat have keenest eye for coat of better clad neighbour a be with coat so be with call gentility be caught at word be seen at glance be appreciated unconsciously at touch by who have none of be greatest of aid to doctor lawyer member of parliament though in position man may perhaps prosper without to statesman to clergyman be vital necessity now mr prong be not gentleman mr prime told tale to mr prong a mr ray have told hers to mr comfort need not be told again here fear that made most of sister imprudence did not do so with intentional injustice declared conviction that rachel might still be made to go in straight course if only must be guided by hand sufficiently strict armed with absolute power then went on to tell mr prong how mr ray have gone off to mr comfort a have now come to be hard be not for poor rachel that story of few minute whispering under elm tree must thus be bruited about among ecclesiastical councillor of locality mr prong sat with patient face with mild demeanour while simple story of rachel conduct be being told when to be added iniquity of mr comfort advice mouth assumed must be grandeur chin came out to one le infatuated than mr prime must have be apparent that purse be not made of silk that coarser material have come to hand in manufacture what will sheep do said mr prong when shepherd slumber in fold then shook head puckered up mouth ah said mr prime be well for sheep that there be still left few who run from work even in heat of noonday sun mr prong closed eye bowed head then reassumed that peculiarly disagreeable look about mouth by thought to assert dignity intending thereby to signify that must willingly reject compliment a unnecessary be not forced to accept a being true knew to be shepherd who did not fear noonday heat be wrong in that suspected other shepherd of stinting work appeared to that sheep must nibble grass in wholesome content unless shepherd be at work at constantly with crook be for shepherd a thought to know what tuft of grass be rank in what spot herbage might be bitten down to bare ground shepherd who must allow flock to feed at large under eye merely watching fence folding ewe lamb at night be truant who feared noonday sun one have mr comfort become therefore mr prong despised in heart sheep will not endure such ardent shepherding a practised by mr prong therefore be driven to seek out for peculiar flock to be elect of baslehurst of elect mr prime be most elect now fault be not uncommon among young ardent clergyman will not repeat conversation took place between two because used holy word spoke on holy subject in doing so be sincere not a regarded language fairly subject to ridicule in judgment think be defective sustained mr prime in resolution to quit cottage unless must induce mother to put stop to great iniquity of brewery tappitts said be worldly people very worldly people utterly unfit to be associate of sister of friend a to 'young man ' thought that nothing further must be said at present that rachel must be closely watched very closely watched mr prime asked to call upon mother explain view declined to do must have be most willing so willing must not force where must be unwelcome mr prime be if necessary to quit cottage take up temporary residence with miss pucker mr prong be inclined to think knowing something of mr ray customary softness of character that if mr prime be firm thing must not be driven to pas a mr prime said that must be firm looked a though intended to keep word mr prong manner a bade adieu to favourite sheep be certainly of nature to justify rumour to allusion have be made pressed mr prime hand very closely invoked blessing on head in warm whisper such sign among such people bear meaning have in outer world people be demonstrative unctuous whereas outer world be reticent dry be perhaps too free with love fault be better than other fault of love at mr prong be little free with love mr prime took all in good part answered with equal fervour if can help dear friend still held hand in come to always never can come too often can help will come always said returning pressure with mutual warmth there be touch of earthly affection in pressure if there be in at close there have at rate be none at commencement while mr prime be thus employed rachel mother became warm upon subject of dress when younger widow returned home to cottage elder widow be actually engaged in baslehurst on purchase of trapping vanity little hoard be opened pretty piece of muslin be purchased by aid of with needful ribbon rachel might be made not fit indeed for mr butler cornbury carriage

if be to countenance by presence dancing love making in open air why worse in open air than in close little parlour in back street mr prong did not say loud revellings absence of good work rebellion

teaching near hope may hope may trust that may be brought to see true light will wrestle for will wrestle for together mr prime friend if be prepared to hear with attention have proposition to make think will acknowledge to be one of importance then suddenly sat bolt upright opened eye wide dressed mouth with solemn dignity of be master be prepared to listen to mr prime mr prime who be somewhat astonished said in low voice that be prepared to listen because must beg to hear out will fail altogether in reaching intelligence effect might possibly have upon heart unless will hear to end will hear certainly mr prong yes friend for will be necessary if must convey to mind be now passing through own without spoken word how glad must be word of men when taken at best how weak be often tell tale quite different from creature mean who us minister have felt that in addressing flock from pulpit feel sadly never felt so sadly a do now mr prime did not quite understand assured again that must give word best attention that must endeavour to gather from other meaning than seemed to be ah seemed said there be so much of seeming in deceitful world will believe of that do do a tending to strengthening of hand in ministry mr prime said that must believe so much then a looked into companion face became aware that there be something of weakness displayed in assuming mouth did not argue about within own mind fact have in way become revealed to friend said a spoke drew chair across rug so a to bring very near to on mr prime be sitting destiny in world yours mine be in many thing alike be alone of have hand full of work of work in many respect be same be devoted to same cause be not so mr prime who have be told that be to listen not to speak did not at first make answer be pressed by repetition of question be not so mr prime can never make work equal to of minister of gospel said can share work of such minister understand now let assure of in making proposition to be not self seeking be not own worldly comfort happiness to be chiefly looking ah said mr prime suppose not perhaps there be in voice slightest touch of soreness not chiefly to want assistance confidential intercourse sympathy congenial mind support when be like to faint counsel when be pressing on aid when toil be too heavy for kind word when day work be over do not desire same be not alike in must not be well that must come together mr prong a spoke have put out hand rested on table with palm upwards a though expecting that must put hers within have tilted chair so a to bring body closer to hers have dropped from face assumed look of dignity be quite in earnest being so have fallen away into natural disposition of body quite understand said mr prime did however understand perfectly thought expedient that must be required to speak little further before answered wanted time also to arrange reply a yet have not made up mind whether must say yes mr prime be offering to make wife have said nothing of love of human affection one of god creature entertains for not can assure because feel because think that must be governed in conduct by sense of duty rather than by poor creature longing of heart heart be very deceitful said mr prime be true very true heart in matter be not deceitful entertain for deep love man must feel for who be to be wife of bosom mr prong let finish before give answer have thought much of a may believe by only one consideration have be made to doubt propriety of taking step people will say that be marrying for for money in short be insinuation must give much pain have resolved within own mind that be duty to bear if motif be pure here paused moment for word two of encouragement received none if thing be good ought not to be deterred by fear of what wicked may say do not agree with in mr prime still did not answer felt that word of assent though given by to minor proposition might be taken a involving amount of assent towards major proposition mr prong have enjoyed advantage of thinking over matrimonial prospect in undisturbed solitude have a yet possessed such advantage a idea have never before presented to did not feel inclined to commit hastily a regard money continued well said mr prime looking down demurely upon ground for mr prong have not at once gone on to say what be idea about money a regard money need hardly declare that motif be pure disinterested be aware that in worldly affair be at present better off than be professional income from pew rent be about hundred thirty pound year must be admitted that be very hard work by time mr prong have withdrawn hand from table finding attempt to be hopeless have re settled chair upon four foot have commenced by requesting mr prime to hear patiently have probably not calculated that must have listened with patience so cruel unrelenting did not even speak word when communicated to amount of income be what receive here continued be probably aware have private mean of own did know said mr prime none what then oh dear money be dross who feel that more strongly than do mr prong in that be saying intended to be honest in asserting money be dross believed that spoke true mind thought also that be passing just eulogium on mr prime in declaring that be of same opinion be not quite correct in a regarded a regarded did not covet money valued very highly a for mr prime have almost unbounded satisfaction in own independence have after two hundred year out of gave very much in charity giving in charity be luxury fine raiment dainty food tempted not at nevertheless be not free from temptation did not perhaps always resist to be mistress of money to superintend gift not only of of others to be great among poor esteemed a personage in district be ambition when mr prong told that money in sight be dross merely shook head why be that wrote terribly caustic note to agent in exeter if quarterly payment be ever late by single week defend from lone widow agent used to say especially if be evangelical mr prime delighted in sight of bit of paper conveyed to possession of periodical wealth to money certainly be not dross doubt if be truly so regarded by mr prong arrangement that choose a to settlement like of must of course be made mr prong when began rather when made up mind to begin have determined that must use best power of language in pressing suit work have be so hard that fine language have got lost in struggle doubt whether made much difference with mr prime may be that have sustained propriety of word a long a such propriety be needful salutary to purpose have spoken of like of at opening of negotiation might have shocked hearer now be too deeply engaged in solid serious consideration to care much for word be used hundred thirty from pew rent said to herself a endeavoured unsuccessfully to look under bonnet into face think have said now continued if will trust into keeping will endeavour with god assistance to do duty by have said little personally of of feeling hoping that might be unnecessary oh quite so said have spoken rather of duty must undertake together in sweet companionship if will consent to to to be mr prong in short then waited for answer a sat in widow weed there be not to eye promise in of much sweet companionship old crape bonnet have be lugged battered about not out of shape a hat bonnet be sometimes battered by young lady in guise if young lady be pretty battered hat bonnet be often more becoming than ever be in proper shape so a closely to fit head almost hide face dress be so made so put on a to give to appearance of almost greater age than mother have studied to divest herself of outward show of sweet companionship perhaps be not le on account gratified to find that have not altogether succeeded have done with world world vanity care said shaking head one can have done with world a long a there be work in for to do monk nun tried that know what came to be widow yes friend have shown a such very willing to do part do not know that must be more active more useful a clergyman wife than can be a solitary woman heart be buried mr prong not so while body remains in vale of tear heart must remain with mr prime shook head in anatomical point of view mr prong be doubt strictly correct other hope will arise perhaps too other care will be source of gentle happiness mr prime understood a alluding to small family again shook head at allusion what have said may probably have taken by surprise yes have mr prong very much if so may be that must wish time for consideration before give answer perhaps will be best mr prong let be so on what day will say will friday suit if come to on friday morning perhaps miss pucker will be there yes will in afternoon will be at dorcas meeting like to trouble to come here again mr prime felt that there be difficulty hitherto have entertained objection to calling on mr prong at own house little sitting room have be a holy ground to almost a part of church have taken there without scruple thing have now be put on different footing might be that room must become own peculiar property must never again regard in simply clerical light have become a be bower of love must not take step thither with express object of assenting to proposition made to even with of dissenting from perhaps said must call at ten on saturday miss pucker will be out marketing to mr prong agreed then mr prime got up took leave how fearfully wicked must rachel have be in eye have rachel made appointment with young man at hour place in might be found alone then be so easy to trust so easy also to distrust others good morning said mr prime a went gave hand a matter of course to lover good bye said think well of if can do so if believe that will be more useful a wife than can be in present position then think must be duty to well will leave for to decide merely wish to put matter before pray understand money need be hindrance then having said that last word let go walked away very slowly did not return by most direct road to miss pucker room there be much to be considered in offer have be made to lot in life must be very lonely if separation from mother sister must become permanent have already made up mind that continued residence with miss pucker must not suit although on very morning have felt that there must be much comfort in living by now a looked forward to loneliness have for very little attraction might not be true also that must do more good a clergyman wife than must possibly come within reach a single woman have tried that life once already then have be very young a memory came upon looked back to early life thought of hope have be hers a stood at altar now so many year ago how different have be everything with then remembered sort of love have felt in heart told that there must be repetition of such love on mr prong behalf have come round in walk to very churchyard stile at have seen rachel standing with luke rowan a remembered passage in own girlish day almost felt inclined to forgive sister then on sudden drew up almost with gasp went on quickly with walk have not in day walked in darkness have not since be vouchsafed to to see light in few month of married happiness have be given to to do little of work might now be possible to then have be married in flesh now must be married in spirit must be married in spirit if must on final consideration seem good to to accept mr prong offer in light then unconsciously began to reflect on right of married woman with regard to money also on wrong be not sure a to law asked whether must be possible for to consult attorney finally thought must not be practicable to do so before giving answer to mr prong must not even ask mother a to too questioned resolved that must not so far lower under existing circumstance there be one to whom must go for advice may say of let have asked whom must must have at least be guided by own judgment if only must have obtained slight amount of legal information how useful must have be chapter x luke rowan declares plan a to brewery truth be t there be joking among young people about wine then rowan went ordered be mr tappitt explanation about champagne made to husband on night of ball before be allowed to go to sleep by mean satisfied did not choose a declared that young man must order whatever might think necessary for house then mr tappitt made worse to tell truth t think be intended a present to girl be doing great deal to make comfortable know fancy thought right to make little return must have known husband better be true that grudged cost of wine must have preferred to endure to feeling that table have be supplied by man by young man whom wished to regard a subject to who must not be subject at whom be beginning to look with very unfavourable eye present to girl tell wo have such present if be so think have be very impertinent very impertinent indeed will tell so will insist on paying for wine must say ought not to have taken oh dear t have be working so hard night do think ought to let go to sleep now instead of scolding on following morning party be of course discussed in tappitt family under various circumstance at breakfast table mr rowan with son daughter be present then song of triumph be sung everything have gone off with honour glory brewery have be immortalized for year to come mr butler cornbury praise be spoken with little drawback of sneer on because have made fuss with girl rachel ray then girl have told of partner luke have declared to have be superb when rowan back be turned tappitts be alone together others besides old tappitt have word to say in dispraise of luke mr tappitt have be much inclined to make little of husband objection to young man while hoped that might possibly become son in law might have be thorn in brewery among vat must have be flourishing young bay tree in outer world of baslehurst have however no wish to encourage growth of thorn within own premise in order that rachel ray such a might have advantage of bay tree luke rowan have behaved very badly at party not only have failed to distinguish of own girl have a mr tappitt said made so conspicuous with foolish girl that world have be remarking mr butler cornbury seemed to think right said cherry mr butler cornbury be not everybody said mr tappitt did think right can assure what be more papa did think right be going on evening a though be quite master in house said augusta be ordering musician to do that evening will find that be not master papa be going to speak to very day what about rachel asked cherry in dismay about thing in general said mr tappitt then mary rowan returned to room went back upon glory of ball think be nice said mr tappitt simpering be sure there be trouble spared yet expense knew that ought not to have uttered that last word must have refrained if have be possible to be not possible man who tell how much wine cost dozen know that be wrong while word be in mouth be in mouth can not restrain mr tappitt be not about to lecture luke rowan a to conduct in regard to rachel ray found difficulty in speaking to must be partner even on matter of business in proper tone with becoming authority a be so much senior rowan so much junior such tone of superiority be a thought indispensable have great difficulty in assuming rowan have way with be not exactly way of submission tappitt must certainly not have dared to encounter on such matter a behaviour in drawing room when time came have not even courage to allude to champagne bottle may be a well explained that rowan paid little bill at griggs without further reference to matter question of brewery management be matter vital to tappitt there among vat have reigned supreme since bungall ceased to be king for continual mastery there be worth while to make fight that be under difficulty even in fight have already begun to know must not talk luke rowan down make go about work in orderly day business like fashion luke rowan must not be talked down must be orderly not according to mr tappitt order doubt mr tappitt under circumstance must decline partnership be disposed to do have be consulting lawyer consulting paper looking into old account have reason to fear that under bungall will luke rowan must have power of exacting from much more than be inclined to give 'd better take into concern lawyer have said young head be always useful not when young head want to be master tappitt have answered if be to do that whole thing will go to dog did not exactly explain to lawyer rowan have carried infatuation so far a to be desirous of brewing good beer did make very clear that partner must in eye be anything desirable then upon word think will have to give ten thousand pound even know what demand be moderate be very bad news to tappitt suppose have got ten thousand pound now be very well known that property business be worth money lawyer suggested that rowan might take step to have whole concern sold probably might buy undertake to pay so much year suggested lawyer view of matter be not at in accordance with mr tappitt idea have be brewer in baslehurst for nearly thirty year still wished to remain so mr tappitt have be of opinion that difficulty might be overcome if only luke must fall in love with one of girl mr rowan have be invited to baslehurst specially with view to such arrangement luke rowan a seemed to now be obstinate young man who in matter of beer a well a in matter of love must not be guided by who best knew how to guide mr tappitt have watched closely at ball have now given up altogether have danced only once with augusta then have left moment dance be over must offer hundred fifty pound year out of concern if did like let lump said mr tappitt lump said mr tappitt mean going to london lawyer felt difficulty of position a prepared to speak mind to young rowan on morning after party on occasion strongest feeling be in favour of expelling intruder lot in life must be preferable to working in brewery with partner a luke rowan suppose head hardly cool enough for business said a luke came in took stool in office tappitt be sitting in customary chair with arm resting on large old fashioned leather covered table be strewed with paper have never be reduced to cleanliness order within memory of one connected with establishment have turned chair round from accustomed place so a to face rowan who have perched on stool be commonly occupied by boy whom tappitt employed in own office head not cool said rowan be a cool a cucumber be drinking last night thought might be tired with dancing then tappitt mind flew off to champagne determined that young man before be too disagreeable to be endured oh dear thing never tire be across here with men before eight morning do know be sure must save third of fuel by altering flue never saw such contrivance must have be put in by coal merchant for sake of wasting coal if please wo mind flue at present only tell be for sake much more than own if wo believe do ask newman to look at first time see in baslehurst care straw for newman be got best concern in devonshire know what be about better than man in part dare say now if please wo mind concern a have managed have done very well for for last thirty year very well may say also for uncle who understood what be doing be not very keen for so many change cost great deal of money a far a can see often lead to much profit if go on with world said world will leave behind look at new machinery be introducing everywhere people do because like to spend money be competition there be competition in beer a well a in other thing for minute two mr tappitt sat in silence collecting thought then began speech will tell what be rowan like new fangled way be very well for dare say be young perhaps may see way be old see mine among change be clear to that must not go on together a partner in same concern must expect to have own way first because have deal of experience next because share in concern must be so much greatest stop moment mr tappitt be not quite sure that must be much greatest want to say anything about now only if be to let remark pas without notice must seem have assented ah very well can only say that hope will find mistaken have be over thirty year in concern must be odd if with large family be to find only equal to who have never be in business at ai even married yet see what being married have to do with will find be way look at thing down in part be not in london here mr rowan certainly not suppose law be same be affair of capital capital said mr tappitt know that have brought in capital bungall did be here a representative 'd better let pas by just at present if can agree a to management of business wo find hard man to deal with a to relative share hereupon tappitt scratched head tried to think see how be to agree about management continued wo be led by anybody know about certainly want to improve concern ah yes so ruin whereas have be making money out of thirty year wo do together be long of short of must be putting of new wine into old bottle think suggested rowan be not saying anything about wine do think that ought to know something about beer be to understand said rowan that have definitively determined not to carry on old concern in conjunction with a partner yes think have will be a well to be sure one ca allow one self to depend upon thinking well be sure have made up mind have doubt be very clever young man be quite sure must not do together to tell truth rowan think will ever make fortune by brewing think not never be sorry for know that need be sorry will have nice income for single man to begin world with there be other business besides brewing deal better ah have made up mind to be brewer like there be opportunity for chemical experiment room for philosophical inquiry give trade charm in eye dare say seems odd to like being brewer tappitt only scratched head stared at do indeed continued rowan now man ca do anything to improve own trade a lawyer great deal will be done have made up mind that must come from outside trade want improving like trade in can do improvement from inside do understand mr tappitt mr tappitt did not understand be very far indeed from understanding with such idea a think baslehurst be ground for said tappitt very ground said rowan be just be very place want brewing a take be at lower ebb here than in other part of england at rate be not complimentary to brewer of thirty year standing than in other part of england people swill with nasty juice of apple because sound malt hop have never be brought within reach think devonshire be very county for man who mean to work hard who wish to do good in devonshire think there be more fitting town than baslehurst mr tappitt be dumbfounded did young man mean to understand that be intention to open rival establishment under nose to set up with bungall money brewery in opposition to bungall brewery must such ingratitude a be in mind of one oh said tappitt quite understand doubt what say be very fine think that be fine at mr tappitt believe that be true represent mr bungall interest here in baslehurst intend to carry on mr bungall business in town in established be mr bungall business here where be sitting be in hand use of premise depends on certainly yes name of firm in point of fact be old establishment never heard of such thing in life quite true be old establishment if must set up brewery here a think probable may will not make use of bungall name in first place must hardly be fair in next place by account brewed such very bad beer that must not be credit to if will tell what plan be then will tell mine will find that everything will be above board mr tappitt plan have got plan mean to go on here a have always done suppose intend to come to arrangement with claim be will come into establishment on equal footing with a regard share management else will look to to give sum of money to lawyer tell be entitled in fact must either take in buy out be thinking of settled income no must suit have told what be intention to carry out must either have concern of own share in concern settled income must do good two hundred year suggested tappitt psha three per cent must give three hundred ten thousand pound be out of question know very well mr tappitt ca say anything fairer than have done will suit own view much best to start alone wish to oppose if can help start alone certainly will if can not come in here on own term after there be nothing more said tappitt turned round pretending to read letter rowan descending from seat walked out into yard of brewery intention have be ever since have looked around in baslehurst to be master of place if not of to be master of other must break heart to be sending out such stuff a that life said to a watched muddy stream run out of willow cooler have resolved that must brew good beer a to ambition of putting down consumption of cider be inclined to think that habit of country must be too strong for at present moment lighted cigar sauntered about yard have now for first time spoken openly of purpose to mr tappitt having done so resolved that there must be more delay will give till saturday for answer said if be ready with one by time will manage through lawyer after that turned mind to rachel ray event of past evening have told rachel that must go out to bragg end if did not come into town be quite resolved that must do so knew

after dinner what must say to when got there what must say to mother have not even yet made up mind that must positively ask on day to be wife yet felt that if found at home must undoubtedly do so will arrange said a be walking over then threw away end of cigar wandered about for next half hour among vat tub furnace mr tappitt took into house a soon a found able to do so without being seen by young rowan took into house in order that might consult with wife a to unexpected revelation have be made to rather that might have opportunity of saying to one hard thing be now crowding upon mind with reference to outrageous young man have anything ever be known heard told equal in enormity to wickedness be to be called upon to find capital for establishment of rival in own town else be to bind in partnership with youth who knew nothing of business be nevertheless resolved to constitute chief manager of who have be so true to bungall in young day be now to be sacrificed in old age to bungall audacious representative in first glow of anger declared to wife that must pay money admit of partnership if rowan did not choose to take income a old mr bungall have taken hers might seek what redress law must give be in vain that mr tappitt suggested that must be ruined then will be ruined said tappitt hot with indignation baslehurst devonshire will know why pernicious young man must not explain must not even quite understand in what atrocity of rowan proposed scheme consisted be possessed by full conviction that be atrocious have admitted man into house be even now entertaining a guest man mother sister have allowed to have run of brewery so that have seen nakedness fat of land be to be reward if be to tell at reading room said tappitt must never be able to show again in high street mr tappitt who be anxious not enraged did not see matter quite in same light be not able to oppose husband in indignation when suggested that might be well for to raise money pay off enemy claim merely stipulating that rival brewery must not be established in baslehurst swore oath that must raise money for purpose must have dealing with so foul traitor except through lawyer honyman honyman think 'd better settle with pleaded mr t then will go to lawyer said tappitt if honyman wo stand to will go to sharpit longfite wo give way a long a there be leg to stand on for time mr tappitt let pas knew how useless must be to tell husband at present moment that sharpit longfite must be only winner in such contest a of spoke at present moment mr tappitt felt pride in anger be almost happy in fury of wrath mr tappitt be very wretched if nasty girl rachel ray have not come in way might have be well sha eat meal in house said tappitt care went on when wife pleaded that luke rowan must be admitted to table because of mr rowan mary can say what like to be welcome to stay if like welcome to go sha put foot under mahogany again on point however be brought to relent before

that mr tappitt must have conversation with mr rowan after dinner while young people be out in evening sha sleep in house to morrow said tappitt riveting assertion with very strong language mr tappitt understood that communication be to be carried on upon basis at three o'clock tappitts rowan sat down to dinner mr tappitt ate meal in absolute silence young people be full of ball elder lady be very gracious to other at such entertainment paterfamilias be simply required to find provender to carve if doe that satisfactorily silence on part be not regarded a great evil mr tappitt knew that husband mood be not happy martha may have remarked that be not right with father to others be inclined to think ill humour be matter of indifference chapter xi luke rowan take tea quite like steady young man

solemnly a passed by mr rowan going first have given loving little nod of recognition mary have pinched arm martha uttered word of thanks intended for conciliation augusta passed in silence with nose in air cherry a went by turned upon look of dismay returned cherry look with shake of head of understood that thing be going wrong think will take more wine sir said rowan do a like said tappitt be there if choose to take seems to mr tappitt that want to quarrel with said luke can form own opinion about be not bound to tell mind to everybody oh certainly not be very unpleasant going on in way in

will not disturb much longer perhaps will make apology to mr tappitt tell how much obliged be by hospitality will not trespass upon longer will get bed at dragon will write line to mother sister then luke left room took hat up from hall made way out of house have much to occupy mind at present moment felt that be being turned out of mr tappitt house must not much have regarded that if one be concerned in mr tappitt have however be on very intimate term with lady of family even for mr tappitt have felt friendship for girl especially for cherry have learned to entertain easy brotherly affection have not weighed much with a grew be not in nature to throw off without annoyance have acknowledged to a soon a found among that tappitts did not posse in way habit of life quite that must desire in dearest most intimate friend know that have thought much of have felt nevertheless have determined that must like intended to make way in life a tradesman boldly resolved that must not be above trade mother sometimes reminded with perhaps not truest pride that be gentleman in answer to have once twice begged to define word then there have be slight very slight disagreement between in end mother always gave way to son a to whom believed that sun shone with more special brilliancy for than for other of god creature now a left brewery house remembered how intimate have be with few hour since arranging matter for ball giving order about place a though have belonged to family have allowed to be at home with to be one of be by nature impulsive have thus fallen instantly into intimacy have be permitted to now be turned out of house a walked across churchyard to bespeak bed for at inn write necessary note to sister be melancholy almost unhappy felt sure that be right in view regarding business must not accuse of fault in manner of making known to mr tappitt nevertheless be ill at ease with in that have given offence with thought be mingled other thought a to rachel ray did not in least imagine that of anger felt towards at brewery have be caused by open admiration of rachel have never occurred to that mr tappitt have regarded a possible son in law that having so regarded must hold in displeasure because have failed to fall into view have never regarded a being of value a possible future husband entertained idea that be prize have taken hold in good faith of tappitt right hand have be stretched out to be now grieved that hand must be suddenly withdrawn a be impulsive so also be light hearted when have chosen bedroom written note to mary in desired to pack up belonging send to be almost at ease a regarded that matter old tappitt be a said to old as if chose to make brewery business cause of quarrel one must help mary be bidden in note to say very civil thing to mr tappitt at same time to speak out truth boldly tell said that be constrained to leave house because mr tappitt can not agree at present moment about matter of business when be done looked at watch started off on walk to bragg end have be said that rowan have not made up mind to ask rachel to be wife that have not made up mind on matter although be going to bragg end in mood must very probably bring to conclusion will fear be thought from that be light in purpose a well a light in heart be not sure that be open to special animadversion of nature be way of men to carry on such affair without complete arrangement of own plan even wish knew that admired rachel liked doubt whether have ever yet declared to that loved doubt whether have done so when started on walk thinking probable however that have persuaded of fact before reached cottage door have already a know said word to rachel must not have said unless intended to seek a wife have spoken word done thing of nature being by mean perfect in way have so spoken so acted without premeditation now be about to follow up little word little act to natural consequence also without much premeditation rachel have told mother on return from ball luke rowan have promised to call have offered to take off from cottage for whole afternoon if mother thought wrong that must see mr ray have never felt to be in greater difficulty know that ought to run away from said besides where be to go to rachel said at once that if absence be desirable must find whither to betake 'd stay upstairs in bedroom for matter of mamma 'd be sure to know said mr rowan speaking of young man a though be much to be feared a indeed be much feared by if think ought to go perhaps must be best must stay said rachel at last speaking in very

be walking among flower bed have be quite comfortable now knowledge that be there in room with a sat silent in chair be becoming alarming have be right to ask to stay for tea looked spoke like sheep then be not known to world wolf dressed often in guise so that might carry out wicked purpose have not be imprudent then there be immediate trouble of silence what be to say to to break that trouble however be soon brought to end by rowan mr ray said think daughter be nicest girl ever saw in life mr ray instantly put down tea caddy have in hand started with slight gasp in throat a though cold water have be thrown over at instant said nothing what be to say in answer to so violent proposition upon word do said luke who be too closely engaged with own thought own feeling to pay much

dainty be not said so much to taste have object in life intended to put down cider beg wo do anything of kind said mr ray for always drink at dinner then rowan explained how that be brewer that looked upon a duty to put down so poor beverage a cider people of devonshire averred knew nothing of beer be ambition to teach mr ray grew eager in defence of cider then again became comfortable happy never heard of such thing in life said mr ray be farmer to do with apple tree must be ruin of whole country suppose can be done at once said luke not even by mr rowan said rachel sat there for hour after tea mr ray have in truth become fond of when spoke to rachel did so with utmost respect seemed to be much more intimate with mother than with daughter mr ray mind be laden with burden of what have said in rachel absence with knowledge that must have to discus when rowan be gone felt to be happy while remained have begun to hope that must not go quite yet rachel also be perfectly happy said very little thought much of different meeting with of arm in cloud of promise of friendship of first dance of little fraud by have secured company at supper then of word have spoken when detained after supper in hall knew that liked well have feared that such liking might not be encouraged what must be nicer than to sit listen to in mother presence now be not afraid of now feared one eye now be

took off hat to with great composure chapter xii rachel ray think doe like luke rowan appearance at mr ray tea table a described in last chapter took place on wednesday evening may be remembered that on morning of same day mr prime have be closeted with mr prong in gentleman parlour have promised to give mr prong answer to proposal on saturday have consequently settled down steadily to think of be good might be evil in such arrangement a suggested to wished much for legal advice made up mind that be beyond reach be beyond reach a preliminary assistance knew enough of law of country to enable to be sure that though might accept offer own money must be so tied up on behalf that husband must not touch principal of wealth did not know whether thing must be so settled that might have in own hand spending of income by three o'clock on day thought that must accept mr prong if must be satisfied on head position a clergyman wife minister wife called must be unexceptionable company of miss pucker be distasteful solitude be not charming to then must not work harder a married woman than in position now held also must not so work with increased power increased perseverance at three o'clock have almost made up mind still be sadly in need of counsel information then occurred to that mother might have knowledge in matter in most respect mother be not woman of world be just possible that in difficulty mother might assist mother might at rate ask of others there be one else whom must trust to seek such information for if did thing must tell mother be true that have quarrelled with at bragg end there be affair in life will ride over family quarrel trample out unless be deeper of longer standing than between mr prime mr ray therefore be that appeared at cottage at bragg end just a luke rowan be leaving have entered upon green with something of olive branch in spirit before reached gate have determined that a far a be within power unkindness must be buried on present occasion when saw luke rowan coming out of mother door be startled out of good feeling have taught to look on rowan a personification of mischief a very mischief in regard to rachel have lifted up voice against have left home torn herself from family because be not compatible with rigour of principle that one known to must be known to also have hardly left mother house when most pernicious cause of war be admitted to freedom of family intercourse almost seemed to that mother must be hypocrite be other day that mr ray must not hear luke rowan name mentioned without wholesome horror where be that wholesome horror now on monday mr prime have left cottage on tuesday rachel have gone to ball expressly to meet young man on wednesday young man be drinking tea at bragg end cottage mr prime must have gone away without speaking word to mother sister have such retreat be possible stately solemn be recognition accorded to luke salutation then walked on into house oh dorothea said mother there be tone almost of shame in mr ray voice be so glad to see dolly said rachel in rachel voice there be tone of shame be all just a must not be did not mean to disturb while be entertaining company mr ray said nothing nothing at moment rachel took upon to answer sister must have disturbed at even if have come little sooner be not too late for tea if will have have taken tea thank two hour ago spoke a though there be much virtue in distance of time at have eaten drunk a compared with existing rakish dissipated appearance of mother tea table tea thing about at eight o'clock be of piece together be very glad to see at rate said mr ray be afraid must not have come out to at perhaps must have be better if have not come see that said rachel think be much better hate quarrelling hope be going to stay now be here rachel be not going to stay mother be impossible must see that young man walking out of house in way without speaking of although be well aware that voice here go for nothing now be mr luke rowan said mr ray know very well who be said mr prime shaking head rachel will remember that have seen before will be likely to see again if stay here dolly said rachel said out of pure mischief that sort of mischief sister rebuke be sure to engender dare say said mr prime whenever plea doubt will not see if approve of mother of course can say nothing further nothing further than approve of such thing what ail that must be very good young man say mr ray if be so that be growing fond of rachel why must if rachel be to like see why must like somebody day a well a other girl mr ray have be little put beside must hardly have said so much in rachel presence have forgotten probably that rachel have not a yet be made acquainted with nature of rowan proposal mamma talk in way there be nothing of kind said rachel believe there be said mr prime say there be then said mr ray be very ill natured in dorothea to speak think in way of sister oh very well see have better go back to baslehurst at once so be very ill natured ca bear to have sort of quarrel must speak out for believe be very good young man with nothing bad about at be welcome to come here whenever plea a for rachel believe know how to mind a well a did when be age only poor mr prime be come gone at time a for not intending came out here just because did intend only to ask permission did at first tell might because rachel be over at farm getting cream thought ought to be consulted first if be not straightforward proper be sure know what be having business of own too able to maintain wife to morrow if young man be to be allowed to ask leave to see young woman when think like for one know how young people be to get married at then mr ray sat down put apron up to eye have great cry be most eloquent speech can not say of daughter be most surprised by a to rachel must be remembered very much be communicated to of have hitherto known nothing very much indeed may say so much that be of nature to alter whole tone tenor of life young man of whom have thought so much of whom have be so much in dread fearing that many thought of be becoming dangerous young man who have interested so warmly have come out to bragg end simply to get mother leave to pay court to have done without saying word to herself there be something in infinitely sweeter to than must have be number of pretty speech from have hitherto be angry with though liking well have be angry with though almost loving have not known why be so cause have be that have seemed in intercourse together to have be deficient in respect have right to claim now that sin be washed away by such deed a a meaning of mother word sank into heart a came to understand mother declaration that luke rowan must be welcome to cottage a lover eye became full of tear spirit of animosity against sister be quenched by water of happiness mr prime be almost equally surprised be by mean equally delighted have whole thing fallen out in different way must probably have looked on marriage with luke rowan a good salutary for sister at rate seeing that world be a be that men can not be hard working minister of gospel woman wife of such assistant in godly ministration must not have taken upon to oppose marriage a be have resolved that luke rowan be black sheep that be pitch not to be touched without defilement that be in short man to be regarded by religious people a anathema thing accursed of idea be not able to divest suddenly why have young man walked about under churchyard elm at night why if be not wicked abandoned did wear that jaunty look that look be so worldly moreover went to ball tempted others to do like in word be young man manifestly of class be esteemed by mr prime more dangerous than roaring lion be not possible that must give up opinion merely because roaring lion have come out to mother with plausible story upon at moment fell necessity of forming judgment to must be necessary that must hereafter abide must either at once give in adherence to rowan alliance else if opposed must be prepared to cling to opposition be aware that such decision be now required paused for moment before declared moment only strengthened verdict against rachel lover must serious young man have taken off hat with flippancy have marked that action on part must not serious young man properly intent on matrimonial prospect have be subdued at moment to more solemn deportment mr prime verdict be still against that verdict proceeded to pronounce oh very well then of course will interfere further must have thought that rachel seeing twice in such way a too hiding under churchyard tree be hiding said rachel have business to say so tear however prevented from fighting own battle manfully with usual courage looked very much like rachel at rate must have thought that mother must have wished to have known great deal more about young man before encouraged to regard in way than can possibly know of mr rowan how be to know other dorothea if must see one said mr ray have doubt know how to dance very cleverly a rachel be being taught to live now may perhaps be chief thing necessary blow did reach poor mr ray who week two since must certainly have agreed with elder daughter in thinking that dancing be sinful into difficulty however have be brought by mr comfort advice what else can know of continued mr prime be able to maintain wife say be that be necessary to consider in choice of husband be that chief thing oh mother must think of responsibility at time a may be very pleasant for rachel to have young man a lover very pleasant while last what what what then mr prime be so much oppressed by black weight of own thought that be unable further to express do think about said mr ray think about more than anything else have concluded that in way can best secure rachel welfare oh always go to church on sunday said rachel know why be to make out so bad said with eye fixed upon mother for seemed to that mother be almost about to yield good deal might be said in excuse for mr prime be not only acting for best in accordance with own light doctrine now preached be doctrine have be held by inhabitant of cottage at bragg end fault if fault there be have be in teaching under have lived mr prime mother in desire to live in accordance with teaching have agreed to regard outer world be world except world a wicked dangerous have never conceived that in forming judgment be deficient in charity indeed be conscious that have formed such judgment in work of charity have striven to be abundant have taken simply dorcas view of virtue younger more energetic woman have become sour in temper under regime of life while elder weaker have retained own sweetness partly because of weakness who can say that of be other than good woman good according to such light a have be lit for guidance now younger be stanch to old lesson while elder be leaving elder be leaving not by force of own reason under necessity of coming in contact with world be brought upon by vitality instinct of younger child difficulty have sought to master once for ever by reference to clergyman what have be result of reference reader already know mother said mr prime very solemnly be young man one a must have chosen for rachel husband six month ago never wished to choose man for husband said mr ray think ought to talk to in way dorothea know in what other way to talk to can not be indifferent on subject a when tell that before rachel that have given young man leave to come see whenever plea never said anything of kind dorothea did not mother be sure understood so said have come to ask leave must be glad to see when did come did say anything of having told so did tell anything of kind did rachel know will come see why must if doe ca turn out took tea here quite like steady young man drank three large cup if a rachel say always go to church regularly know why be to judge say that be anything out of way have not judged mother then rachel spoke out may say that be needful that must do so offering of heart have be discussed in presence in manner have be very painful to though person discussing have be own mother own sister in truth have be so much affected by what have be said there have be so much in be first joyful then painful to that have not hitherto be able to repress emotion so a to acquire power of much speech have struggled now so far succeeded a to be able to come to mother support know mamma why anybody must judge yet a to what have said to be sure one have right to judge unkindly dolly have be very angry with because saw speaking to in churchyard have said that be hiding meant that be hiding neither of be hiding be unkind word not like sister have never have to hide from anybody a for for for liking mr rowan after such word a will not say anything about to anybody except to mamma if be to ask to be wife know what answer must make not yet will never listen to one while mamma life if wish not then turned to mother mr ray who have before be driven to doubt by mr prime word now again became strong in resolution to cherish rachel lover believe will ever do anything to make think ought to have trusted said mr ray embracing rachel speaking with own eye full of tear now seemed to mr prime that there be nothing left for to go in eagerness about sister affair have for while forgotten own now a again remembered cause have brought on present occasion to bragg end felt that must return without accomplishing object after having said so much in reprobation of sister love affair be hardly possible that must tell tale of own yet need be urgent have pledged to give mr prong answer on friday must hardly bring to accept gentleman offer without first communicating with mother on subject such communication at present moment be quite out of question perhaps must be better must go leave said if can do good certainly want to do harm wish that rachel must have taken to what think better course of life why what have done said rachel turning round sharply mean about dorcas meeting like woman there be why have gone believe to be good praiseworthy godly woman be useless to talk about now good night rachel gave hand coldly to sister good night mother wish must see alone to morrow come here for dinner said mr ray if must come to in morning must take kindly mr ray promised to do then mr prime walked back to baslehurst rachel when sister be gone felt that there be much to be said between mother mr ray be so inconsequent in mental working so shandy pated if may say so that did not occur to that entirely new view of luke rowan purpose have be exposed to rachel during visit of mr prime that anything have be said made further explanation necessary have a be authorized rachel to regard rowan a lover yet be not aware that have done so rachel have remembered word have resolved that must permit to form special intimacy with luke rowan without mother leave be also beginning to resolve that with mother leave such intimacy must be very pleasant of be quite sure within own heart that must not be abandoned at sister instigation mamma said did not know that have spoken to in way in what way rachel mr ray voice be not quite pleasant now that mr prime be gone must have be glad to have have dangerous subject abandoned for while that have asked to let come here that have said that about did then while be away at mr sturt what answer did give did give answer came back be sure be very glad that did for must have known what to say to what be that did say mamma be if think wrong to tell hardly know suppose can be wrong for young man must have spoken nicer made happy to hear so did for moment oh mamma do tell rachel kneeled down before well said be nicest girl have ever seen did mamma girl clung closer to mother a heard pleasant word ought to tell such nonsense a then said that wanted to come out here see be simply that meant to ask to be sweetheart if must let what did say mamma must say anything because came back told dolly that must be glad to see whenever might choose to come here did yes said be welcome to come whenever pleased that believed to be very good young man so do why must be anything else say that be anything else mamma well dear what will say to if doe ask that question have called by name two three time spoken to a though wanted to like if doe say anything to like what will answer if think like well enough must tell so of course yes of course must then rachel be silent for minute two have not a yet received full answer desired in such alternative a mother have suggested may say that must have known how to frame answer to young man without advice from mother there be alternative a to thought well that must have mother judgment opinion mamma think do like said rachel burying face be sure wonder at said mr ray for like very much have way with so much nicer than most of young men now then be very well off after must count for something young woman must never fall in love with man who ca earn bread not if be ever so religious steady be very good looking too good look be only skin deep know wo bring much comfort when sorrow come do own love to look on young fellow with sonsy face quick lively step mr comfort seemed to think must do very well if there be to be such thing if be not able to tell be sure know who ought to be nothing must be fairer than coming out here telling first there be so many of be sly there be nothing sly about in way with many more rambling word with many kiss also with tear rachel ray received from mother permission to regard luke rowan a lover chapter xiii mr tappitt in counting house luke rowan when left cottage walked quickly back across green towards baslehurst have sauntered out slowly on road from brewery to bragg end being in doubt a to what must do when reached destination there be longer room for doubt now have said that to rachel mother made further doubt impossible be resolved that must ask rachel to be wife have spoken to mr ray of intention in respect a though thought that such offer on part might probably be rejected in so speaking have at time spoken truth be eager sanguine confident by nature though be by mean disposed to regard a conquering hero by whom young lady must only be too happy to find beloved did not at present moment look forward to future fate with despair walked quickly home along dusty road picturing to happy prosperous future in baslehurst with rachel a wife tappitts living in neighbouring villa on income paid to old tappitt by out of proceeds of brewery be present solution of brewery difficulty tappitt be growing old might be quite a well not only for for cause of humanity in devonshire that must pas remainder of life in dignity comfortable retirement from business affords did not desire tappitt for partner more than tappitt desired nevertheless be determined to brew beer be anxious to do so if possible on spot where great uncle bungall have commenced operation in line may be well to explain here that rowan be not without good standing ground in dispute with tappitt old bungall will have somewhat confused matter a be in nature of will to do have be bungall desire that full share in brewery must go to nephew after widow death must on dying leave widow now have happened that have left widow that widow have contrived to live longer than nephew have drawn income of five hundred year from concern by agreement between lawyer tappitt lawyer tappitt when elder rowan bungall nephew died have taught to believe that affair of brewery must now remain for ever in own hand unless might choose to make other provision knew that property in concern must pas away from when old lady died have not acknowledged to that young rowan must inherit from father right old rowan must have possessed have lived luke father have gone into other walk of life have lived prosperously leaving behind money for widow money also for child tappitt when found that there be young man with claim to partnership in business have be not only much annoyed surprised also have be a have seen persuaded to hold out right hand of friendship left hand of partnership to young man have thought that might manage young man from london who knew nothing of beer wife have thought that young man might probably like to take wife a well a income out of concern a have seen have be wrong in hope luke chose to manage brewery instead of being managed have foolishly fallen in love with rachel ray instead of taking augusta tappitt to a must have done there be much certainly of harshness cruelty in idea of opposition brewery in baslehurst to be established in enmity to bungall tappitt to be so established with bungall money by bungall heir luke a walked back to baslehurst thinking now of beer now of love declared to that wanted only own let tappitt deal justly with in matter of partnership must deal even generously with tappitt concern gave income of fifteen hundred pound out of mr bungall a taking share of responsibility work have be allowed to have third be informed by lawyer that be entitled to claim one half of whole concern if tappitt must give in adhesion to villa arrangement must still have thousand year for life mr tappitt afterwards must have due provision girl must have must fairly be claimed for if villa scheme must not be carried out quite at present rowan must do two share of work allow tappitt to take two share of pay then in case must be allowed scope for improvement good beer must be brewed for people of baslehurst eye of devonshire must be opened pondering over resolving that must speak out mind openly to rachel on morrow luke rowan reached inn there be lady sir up stair a wish to speak to said waiter lady quite elderly sir said waiter intending to put end to excitement on rowan part be gentleman own mother said chambermaid in tone of reproof be in number two sitting room private so

course visit must be shortened mr tappitt be disposed to be very civil a be girl then mr rowan suggested whether there might not be reconciliation between luke brewery family mother have not quarrelled with family come to same thing luke doe not think must say something civil to mr tappitt so a to to bring round again be older than be know luke rowan perceived at once that mother be ranging on tappitt side in contest be therefore ready to fight with so much more vigour be accustomed to yield to mother in little thing mr rowan being woman who liked such yielding for time past have held own against in greater matter now again for hour so must show that be vexed admiration for be so genuine love so strong that vexation never endured luke have be taught to think that judgment be to be held supreme in joint concern yes mother be older than be know that can say anything particularly civil to be more civil than what have said civility want be surrender of right ca be so civil a luke must be last to ask to surrender of right must be sure of oh luke if what hear be true will be so unhappy what have heard mother be afraid be not about brewery altogether be about brewery altogether about about nothing else to smallest extent at know what mean luke be there young lady in case young lady in what case in case of quarrel with old tappitt whether have have difference about young lady luke know mean that what do mean be afraid that know too well be there not young lady whom have met at mr tappitt whom pretend to admire suppose there be for sake of argument what have to do with difference with mr tappitt a rowan asked question slight conception of truth flashed across mind faint idea came home to of connecting link between admiration for rachel ray mr tappitt animosity be so luke asked anxious mother care much more about than do about brewery put together nothing must make so wretched a to see make marriage be beneath think will ever make wretched in way tell that there be nothing in have heard nothing at by heaven tell such thing know what may have heard that have heard falsehood calumny guess by speaking of marriage must be beneath a think right to

binding be necessary for without being bound certainly must do so be miss ray yes be miss ray oh luke then indeed will be very wretched why so mother have heard anything against against well will not say that for wish to say anything against young woman do know who be luke who mother be be quite poor people be against not against moral character certainly be against in considering expediency of connection with must hardly wish to marry out of own station be told that mother life in little cottage quite in humble sphere that sister intend to marry mother sister rachel ray do intend to marry if will have if have be left to myself must not have told of till have found to be successful a have asked have not liked to deceive speak against if can say nothing worse of than be poor misunderstand luke hope so like to think that objection must be made by of course be objection be not one meant to make there may be many young lady whom must be quite fitting that must wish to marry even though have not got shilling must be much pleasanter of course that lady must have something though must never think of making serious objection about what must chiefly look to must be young lady position in life young lady must certainly be main thing said luke be what say young lady position in life have made inquiry yes have be almost ashamed of for doing so have doubt mr ray be very respectable sort of people who be friend be not friend most particular friend be farmer family life near how be then that mr cornbury took to party ah yes can explain mr tappitt have told how sorry be that people must have be deceived by what have occurred luke rowan brow grew black a mr tappitt name be mentioned said nothing mother continued speech girl have be very kind to miss ray inviting to walk with sort of thing because of being so much alone without companion of own oh have be have thought have farmer family out near where lived if choose to listen to luke will be obliged to if take up at word in way of course must leave then paused a luke said nothing went on with discourse be in way that came to know miss tappitts then one of youngest think asked to come to party be very indiscreet mr tappitt did not like to go back from daughter word so girl be allowed to come to make blunder pas off easily mr cornbury be induced to take mr cornbury happened to be staying with father in whose parish have lived for many year certainly be very kind of have be unfortunate mistake altogether poor girl have for moment be lifted out of proper sphere a must have seen hardly knew how to behave made mr tappitt very unhappy be more than luke rowan be able to bear anger be not against own mother against mistress of brewery be manifest that have be maligning rachel instigating mother to take up cudgel against be vexed also that mother have not perceived that rachel held be entitled to hold among woman much higher position than must be fairly accorded to mr tappitt care one straw for mr tappitt unhappiness said a to miss ray conduct at house think that there be anything in did not become know what mean least in world think must have such idea if mr tappitt have not put into head must not speak in way to mother luke must speak strongly when be defending wife a hope will be never heard of anything in life so little a woman conduct be mean paltry jealousy nothing else a mother may think better must not marry dear want to marry then will do a want may think must find one with money with grand friend with better connection be natural that must think like why must want to belittle young girl like rachel ray girl that own daughter call friend will tell why mother because rachel ray be admired be not be there anybody in baslehurst will say that be equal be not disposed to ask one in baslehurst just at present must not advise one in baslehurst to volunteer opinion to on subject intend that will be equal equal in respect if can make so will certainly ask to be wife mother a mind be positively made up on point a nothing on earth will alter hope will teach to think kindly of must be very unhappy if house must not be home when may choose to make so mr rowan much a be accustomed to yield to son must not bring to yield in matter at least not to yield with grace felt that truth wisdom lay on side in argument though knew that have lacked word in to carry on declared to herself that be not at inclined to despise anybody for living in small cottage for being poor must have be delighted to be very civil to mr ray must have patronized rachel quite a kindly though perhaps not so graciously a mr cornbury have done be different thing when son came to think of making young woman wife old mr cornbury must have be very sorry to see of son make such alliance when anything so serious a marriage be to be considered be only proper to remember that mr ray lived in cottage that farmer sturt be friend neighbour to prudence wisdom luke must not listen at at last mr rowan left in dudgeon foolish hasty a be must a felt talk better than must therefore retreated feeling that have be worsted have done duty said going away have warned of course be own master can do a please then left refusing escort in last fading light of long summer evening made way back to brewery luke first impulse be to start off instantly to cottage settle matter out of hand before have taken up hat for purpose remembered that must not very well call at bragg end on such mission at eleven o'clock at night so threw back on hotel sofa gave vent to feeling against tappitt family must make understand that be not going to master have come down there disposed to do manner of kindness to extent even of greatly improving fortune by improving brewing business have taken upon to treat a though be dependent did not tell that plot have be made to catch for one of girl accused of jealousy meanness selfishness sin abomination by plot must be engendered when about hour afterwards took off

upon in morning of bitterness have worn away last resolve overnight have be to go to brewery before breakfast at period of day mr tappitt be always to be found for hour in counting house curtly tell brewer that further negotiation between must be made by respective lawyer a be dressing reflected that mr tappitt position be certainly one of difficulty that amicable arrangement must still be best if amicable arrangement be possible that something be due to man who have for so many year be uncle partner mr tappitt moreover be not responsible for of evil thing have be said about rachel by mr tappitt therefore priding somewhat on charity entered mr tappitt office without display of anger on face brewer be standing with back to empty fireplace with hand behind tail of coat eye fixed upon

made lying on tappitt table tappitt have be considering for last five minute additional moment have added to enmity felt against rowan rowan at twenty five doubt regarded tappitt who be nearer sixty than fifty a very old man men of fifty five like to be so regarded be not anxious to be laid upon shelf by junior moreover where be tappitt to find security for thousand year a have not failed to

epistle with one of hand what letter asked rowan come now young man let have humbug trickery whatever may do if there be anything do hate be deceit rowan wrath returned upon instantly redoubled trebled in energy what do mean sir said who be trying to deceive anybody how dare speak to in such language a now look here mr rowan letter come from man in craven street a of course know very well have chosen to put business in hand of lawyer in hand of lawyer will remain have be very wrong in attempting to have dealing with must have known what sort of man be before let put foot in concern know enough of now if please will keep on other side of gate for future d 'ye hear unless wish to be turned out by men put foot inside brewery premise more tappitt face a uttered word be face very unpleasant to behold luke be so astounded that must not bethink at moment of most becoming word in to answer enemy first idea have prompted to repudiate present knowledge of lawyer letter seeing that lawyer letter have be ground of charge against of deceit having be thus kicked out kicked out a far a word must kick threatened with personal violence must word not be obeyed found unable to go back to lawyer letter must like to see one of men dare to touch said will see very soon if take off said tappitt luckily men be gone to breakfast opportunity for violence be wanting luke looked round then remembered that tappitt be probably alone in place mr tappitt said be very foolish man dare say said tappitt very foolish not to give up own bread wife child bread to adventurer like have endeavoured to treat with kindness also with honesty because differ from a of course have right to do think best to insult with billingsgate can muster if go out of counting house young man will see if ca put out tappitt in spite of fifty five year absolutely put hand down upon poker there be personal encounter in young man be so sure to come by worst a in with much older man be so surely case that ought to be considered cowardly in old man to attack young one if old man hit young man over head with walking stick what can young man do except run away to avoid second blow then old man if be wicked old man a so many be tell friend that have licked young man tappitt must certainly have acted in way if weapon in hand have be stick instead of poker tappitt when saw own poker in own hand be afraid of if woman attack man with knife man will be held to have fought fairly though will have knocked down in encounter so also with old man if take poker instead of stick world will refuse to advantage of gray hair such idea a came upon tappitt by instinct thus though still held poker refrained hand man must be mad morning said rowan standing firmly before with two hand fixed upon hip be to send for police said tappitt for mad doctor must think said rowan then tappitt turned round rang bell very violently a bell be intended to summon brewery servant who be now away at breakfast produced result have intention of staying here against wish mr tappitt whether be mad only foolish matter must of course be settled by lawyer now will not again come on to premise unless acquire legal right to do so a owner of then

roman sentiment be own will stand on right though have to go into poor house chapter xiv luke rowan pay second visit to bragg end early after breakfast on morning morning on tappitt have for moment thought of braining luke rowan with poker mr ray started from cottage on mission into baslehurst be going to see daughter mr prime at miss pucker lodging felt sure that object of visit be to be further discourse on danger of admitting that wolf rowan into sheepfold at bragg end must willingly have avoided conference have be able to do so knowing well that mr prime must get better of in word when called upon to talk without having rachel at back indeed be not happy in mind have be conceded at cottage a understood thing that rachel be to have man a lover what if after man did mean to be lover in proper sense what if so meaning must still turn out to be lover of bad sort worldly good for nothing rakish lover wonder say wicked man in play wonder man alive must ever rear daughter mr ray knew nothing of play have done so must not have repeated line hardness of task providence have allotted to struck very forcibly on morning rachel be dearer to than aught else in world for rachel happiness must have made sacrifice in rachel presence sweet smile winning caress be chief delight of existence nevertheless in day possession of rachel be hardly blessing to responsibility be so great worse than a regarded own comfort doubt be so numerous then recurred over over again a often a be settled be sure know what can have to say to mr ray a spoke be tying on bonnet rachel be standing close to with light summer shawl will be old story mamma be afraid terrible iniquity backsliding because went to ball because wo go to miss pucker will want to say that will go else be sent to bed without supper be nonsense rachel dorothea know very well that ca make go mr ray be wont to become mildly petulant when thing went against mamma want to go suppose be about miss pucker at be about other thing mean mr rowan yes dear be sure know what be for best when get to herself doe say such terrible thing to that quite put in heat to have to go to think anybody ought to say sort of thing to except clergyman person parent schoolmaster master mistress such like rachel thought so too thought that at rate daughter must not so speak to mother a be mother on subject said nothing like going to miss pucker house continued mr ray be sure want to come here must go only said must must go now if be mamma of course will go have got ready must not let go on in way be very easy said rachel how be to help ca tell to hold tongue if did must if be to go might a well start suppose there be cold lamb enough for dinner plenty must think if find poultry cheap can bring chicken home in basket ca so saying with mind full of various care mr ray walked off to baslehurst wonder when will come rachel a said thought word stood at open door of cottage looking after mother a made way across green be delicious midsummer day warm with heat of morning sun not yet oppressed with full blaze of noonday ray air be alive with note of bird flower be in brightest beauty wonder when will come none of doubt so harassed mother troubled mind other doubt there be must be possible that must like well enough to wish to make own must be that one so bright so prosperous in world so clever so much above in worldly advantage must come seek a wife take from little cottage lowly way of life when have first said that must come to bragg end declared to herself that must be well that must see in how humble way lived must not call rachel after said to herself if did must learn from that knew how to rebuke man who dared to take advantage of humility of position have come have not called rachel have come taking advantage of momentary absence have spoken of behind back a lover speaks have told love honestly to mother in rachel view of matter lover must have carried with better decorum with sweeter grace because have so done must not hold to be bound to have be carried away by feeling too rapidly have not a yet known how poor lowly be must still have opened to clear path backwards then if path backwards be not to mind then in case be not sure that rachel ever declared to herself in plain term what in such case must happen stood at door a though be minded to stand there till must appear upon green wonder when will come have watched mother figure disappear along lane have plucked flower two to piece before returned within house will not come till evening determined till evening when day work in brewery must be over then thought of quarrel between tappitt wondered what might be be quite sure that tappitt be wrong thought of at once a obstinate foolish pigheaded old man yes must come to must take care to be provided in article of cream pretended to love so well must not have to run away again how lucky on previous evening have be that necessity seeing that have given opportunity for great display of lover excellence on rowan part having settled in mind went into house be beginning to think of household work when heard man step in passage went at once out from sitting room encountered luke rowan at door how d 'ye do said be mr ray at home mamma must have met on road if have come from baslehurst must not meet on road because have come across field oh account for be away in baslehurst be be gone in to see sister mr prime rachel still standing at door of sitting room made attempt of asking rowan into parlour may come in said rachel be absolutely ignorant whether under such circumstance ought to allow to enter there be in house at rate must not turn out be afraid will have to wait long time if wait for mamma said slightly making way so that obtained admittance be not hypocrite did not know that mr ray absence must be esteemed by a great gain not loss why did thus falsely talk of waiting long time dog fight with teeth horse with heel swan with wing cat with claw so also do woman use such weapon a nature have provided for came specially to see said not what must be very glad to see mother too if come back before be gone suppose will for wo let stay so long a well now mention think will for have got ever so many thing to do dinner to get ready house to look after did by way of making acquainted with mode of life according to plan have arranged for own guidance have come into room have put down hat have got up to window so that back be turned to rachel said turning round quickly speaking almost suddenly now have called rachel again must find at moment no better way of answering than by same plaintive objection have made before must call by name in way mr rowan know must did mother tell said to yesterday asked what said yesterday yes when be away across green what said to mamma yes know told see in face be glad did so may not call rachel now a be placed table be still between so that be debarred from making outward sign of presence a lover must not take hand press stood perfectly silent looking down upon table on leaned gave answer to question may not call rachel now said repeating question hope will be understood that rachel be quite novice at piece of work now have in hand must be case very many girl be not novice young lady who have rejected first half dozen suitor who have asked for love must probably feel mistress of occasion when reject seventh will not be quite astray when accepts eighth there be moreover young lady who though may have rejected accepted none have have so wide advantage in society a to be able when moment come to have wit about rachel have known nothing of what be called society have never before known trouble joy of being loved so when question be pressed upon trembled felt that breath be failing have filled full of resolution a to what must do when moment came a to how must behave what word must utter be gone from now must only stand still tremble of course might call rachel might call what pleased to with wider experience now became manifest enough must give leave for more than rachel if must not send away wretched must let call own then moved round table towards a moved though retreated from did not retreat with step a rapid a own rachel put out hand to want to be wife allowed tip of finger to turn toward a though unable altogether to refuse greeting offered a did so turned away from bent down head have heard wanted to hear why did not go away leave to think of have named to word so sacred between man woman have said that sought for wife what need be there that must stay longer got hand in then passed arm round waist say love say rachel will be so nay will have answer from will look to if will not speak got head round over shoulder a though to look into eye oh mr rowan pray pray pull dearest say word to must say word can learn to love rachel learn to love lesson have come to very easily how be possible have once thought not to love say word to said rowan still struggling to look into face one word then will let go what word say to 'dear luke will be wife ' remained for moment quite passive in hand trying to say word must not come of course must be wife why need trouble further nay rachel will speak will stay with here till mother come will answer for if have disliked think must have said so dislike whispered do love slightly bowed head will be wife again went through same little piece of acting may call rachel now in answer to question shook free from slackened grasp escaped away across room can not forbid now come sit down by for of course have got much to say to come sit down indeed will not trouble again then went to very slowly sat with leaving hand in listening to word feeling in heart full delight of having such lover of word be then spoken very few came from lip told story of brewery quarrel be very eloquent droll in describing tappitt a brandished poker be going to hit with said rachel with eye open well did hit said luke to look at seemed mad enough to do anything then told how at present moment be living at inn how became necessary from unfortunate quarrel that must go at once to london under circumstance must have gone said pressing hand very closely without answer from ought not to think of anything like when be in such trouble ought not well do see then explained to that part of project consisted in marrying out of hand at once must go up to london for week two then coming back be married in course of next month oh mr rowan must be impossible must not call mr rowan will call miss ray indeed must be impossible why impossible indeed must can ask mamma rather have better give over thinking of have have time yet even to make up mind what be like say that love so do suppose ought not for be sure know what be like yet seems to that be very fond of having own way sir so ought added really ca have own way in nobody ever heard of such thing everybody must think be mad must care one straw for ah must great many straw sat there for two hour telling of thing appertaining to explained to that irrespective of brewery have income sufficient to support wife though not enough to make fine lady like mr cornbury said if can give bread cheese be a much a have right to expect said rachel have over four hundred year said rachel hearing thought that must indeed support wife why must man with four hundred year want to brew beer have got nothing said rachel not farthing of course not said rowan be theory that unmarried girl never ought to have anything if have ought to be considered a provided for then must have husband rather think must be better if men did have anything so that might be forced to earn bread only must want capital rachel listened to with greatest content most unalloyed happiness did not quite understand gathered from word that own poverty be not reproach in eye that under circumstance must have looked for wife with fortune happiness be unalloyed at heard from till at last spoke of mother doe dislike asked rachel with dismay be that dislike be staying with mr tappitt who be furious against because suppose be because of brewery row indeed ca understand week ago be at home there now dare show nose in house have be turned out of brewery morning with poker hope be nothing about said rachel how can be about because thought mr tappitt looked at ball a though suppose did mean anything ought to be matter of perfect indifference whether meant anything not how can be so about mother if be ever to lead to anything lead to anything what will lead to be quite settled know what mean how must become wife if mother did not wish look here rachel that be very proper for girl dare say if mother thought be not fit to be husband wo say what ought to take word in such matter be so with man will make very unhappy if mother can not be friend with wife threat of hers to effect must prevent from marrying must have effect upon be own master from nature of thing must look out for be very grand masterful on rowan part might in theory be true there be that in made rachel uneasy gave to love first shade of trouble must not be quite happy a luke promised bride if knew that must not be welcomed to place by luke mother then what right have to think probable that luke mother must give such welcome at first meeting however said little on subject have pledged to troth must not attempt to go back from pledge at first appearance of difficulty must talk to own mother perhaps mother might relent throughout there ran feeling of dismay at idea of marrying man whose mother must not willingly receive a daughter must go said at last indeed must have thing to do if have nothing be idlest man in world at present moment if turn out can only go sit at inn then must go sit at inn if stay longer mamma wo have dinner if be so of course will go will come back to tea a rachel gave positive refusal to proposition rowan took departure on understanding that might return good bye said when come evening will expect to walk with oh know said yes will will see sun set again will not run from evening a though be ogre a spoke took in arm held kissed before have time to escape from be mine altogether now said nothing can sever god bless rachel good bye luke then parted have told to go alleging household duty a ground for dismissing when be gone did not at once betake herself to work sat on seat have shared with thinking of thing have done be now betrothed to man a wife only man towards whom fancy have ever turned with slightest preference so far love for have run very smoothly from first meeting with on evening in have hardly spoken to form have filled eye word have filled mind have learned to love to see before understood what heart be doing for gradually very quickly vacant thought have be given to have become hero of life now almost before have have time to question on matter be affianced husband have be so quick so very gracious that seemed to tremble at own good fortune there be that one little cloud in sky frown on mother brow now in first glow of happiness must not bring to believe that cloud must bring storm so sat there dreaming of happiness longing for mother return that might tell that might be talked of hour after hour that luke merit might receive fitting mention mother be not woman who on occasion must stint measure of praise refuse child happiness of sympathy rachel knew that must not let whole morning pas by in idle dream happy a dream be closely a be allied to waking life after while jumped up with start declare there will be nothing done mamma will want dinner though be ever so much going to be married have not be long on foot done much in preparation of cold lamb be intended must eat day before heard mother footstep on gravel path ran out to front door full of own news though hardly knowing a yet in what word must tell of mother news of tidings there might be to tell a to interview have just taken place in baslehurst rachel did not think much nothing that dorothea must say must now be of moment so at least rachel flattered a for dorothea growling have not chiefly ended in that young man did not intend to present a husband have now done so in manner rachel felt to be so satisfactory that even dorothea criticism must be disarmed so rachel a met mother thought only of tale have to tell nothing of be to hear mr ray be so full of tale be so conscious of fact that tidings be entitled to immediate undivided attention of daughter from first greeting on gravel path be so ready with word that rachel with story of happiness be for while obliterated oh dear said mr ray have such news for so have mamma news for said rachel putting out hand to mother never be so warm in life do let get in oh dear oh dear be good looking in basket for when came away from dorothea be too full of what have just heard to think of buying anything what have heard mamma be sure hope will be happy be sure do be great venture terribly great venture what be mamma rachel though must not yet think that mother budget must be equal in importance to own felt that there be that be necessary that must hear sister be going to be married to mr prong dolly yes dear be great venture if woman can live happy with man can do so be troubled about money be marry mr prong suppose may if like oh dear ca think will ever like never spoke to yet so perhaps ought to say doe look nice man to eye what be look dear be only skin deep ought of to remember always rachel be only skin deep if a say only want to work in vineyard wo mind being so short dare say be honest at least be sure hope be must think be honest at rate must be what be there be of be so very fond of money be if that hear be true perhaps may care about let hope that doe if so be great exception however mean to have tied up a close a possible think be right where must be if be to go away fine morning leave see be got nobody belonging to own do like people who have got people belonging to feel sure in sort of way that will go on living in own house rachel immediately reflected that luke rowan have people belonging to very nice people that everybody knew who be from whence came have quite made up mind about continued mr ray when saw did say very much against be use be a though be quite respectable be clergyman know dear though never be at of regular college might be bishop just a much a if have be so tell really think that must ever have come back to cottage not unless have promised to have be ruled by in everything certainly must have done rachel a made assurance with little obstinacy in voice told that for future meant to be ruled by very different person indeed suppose not be sure must have asked because think be thing dragging people away out of own parish here there to anybody church told that though must of course go hear mr prong now then if married must leave mr comfort not a regular thing did seem to mind now much a used always to be saying about when be to be mamma on friday be to morrow to morrow be be to go tell to morrow that mean to take be to come to at miss pucker lodging be not to be wondered at when one see miss pucker really be not sure 'd not have done same if 'd be living with too only think ever must have begun think be living with miss pucker have made do do indeed dear well now have told suppose may a well go get ready for dinner will come with mamma potato be strained kitty can put thing on table mamma now be on stair have got something to tell also will leave mr ray to eat dinner rachel to tell story merely adding word to say that mother did not stint measure of praise refuse child happiness of sympathy that evening be probably happiest of rachel existence although full proportion of joy be marred by unforeseen occurrence at four o'clock note came from rowan to dearest rachel saying that have be called away by telegraph to london about horrid brewery business must write from there rachel be almost a happy without talking about a must have be in presence listening to chapter xv maternal eloquence on friday morning there be solemn conference at brewery between mr tappitt mr rowan mr rowan found to be in difficulty a to line of action ought to take alliance ought to form be passionately attached to son for mr tappitt have strong liking then be very averse to proposed marriage with rachel ray be willing for while to make treaty with mr tappitt offensive defensive a against own son if by doing so must put stop to so outrageous proceeding on part have seen before started for london have told occurrence of day have described to how tappitt have turned out of brewery poker in hand how in consequence of tappitt pig headed obstinacy be now necessary that joint affair must be set right by hand of law have then told also that there be longer room for doubt argument between a regarding rachel have gone out to bragg end that morning have made offer have be accepted mother therefore must see so surmised that a opposition on part must now be futile might a well take rachel to heart at once went so far a to propose to that must go over to rachel in absence must be very gracious if must do to morrow mother said go through little process of taking future daughter in law to heart in answer to mr rowan said very little said very little looked much dear can not move so quick a do be older be afraid however that have be rash said something a on such occasion young men do a to privilege of choosing for a to knowing what wife must suit a to contempt for money a to fact undoubted fact a declared in declaration be prepared to go hand in hand with rachel ray be lady be clear headed enough to perceive that mother did not intend to agree with when be married will come round said to then took off by night mail train to london under circumstance mr rowan felt that only chance of carrying on battle must be by mean of treaty with mr tappitt have affair of brewery stood alone mr rowan must have ranged loyally on side of son must have resented uplifting of poker shown resentment by immediate withdrawal from brewery must have said word two stately word two a to justice of son cause have carried herself daughter off to inn a thing be now visit to brewery must doubt be curtailed in duration in mean time might not blow be struck against foolish matrimonial project opportune blow by aid of mr tappitt therefore on friday morning when mr prong be listening with enraptured ear to mr prime acceptance of suit under certain pecuniary condition mr rowan mr tappitt be sitting in conference at brewery agreed together at meeting rachel ray be head front of whole offence source of evil done to be done one great sinner in matter be clear to mr rowan that rachel must have just pretension to look for such lover husband a son be equally clear to mr tappitt that must have have right to seek lover husband out of brewery if rachel ray have not be there might have gone smoothly for of mr tappitt did not perhaps argue very logically a to brewery business attempt to show either to to ally that luke rowan must have made agreeable partner if have kept free from love vagary be filled with indefinite woman idea that mischief felt have be done by rachel ray against rachel rachel pretension hand must be turned resolved therefore that must go out together call at cottage mr tappitt knew from long neighbourhood of what stuff mr ray be made very good sort of woman said to mr rowan not at headstrong perverse like daughter if find young lady there must ask mamma to see alone to proposition mr rowan assented not eagerly with slow measured dignified assent feeling that be derogating somewhat from own position in allowing to be led by one a mr tappitt be needful that on occasion must act with mr tappitt connect with tappitt interest did with air distinctly claimed for personal superiority if mr tappitt did not perceive understand be fault not mr rowan at two o'clock stepped into fly at brewery door have driven out to bragg end mamma there be carriage said rachel ca be coming here said mr ray be be fly from dragon know by man white hat oh dear there be mr rowan mr tappitt mamma will go away rachel without word escaped out into garden escaped utterly heedless of mother little weak prayer that must remain went away quickly so that not skirt of dress might be visible felt instantly by instinct that two woman have come out there especially a enemy a upsetter of happiness a opponent of one great hope in life knew that must not fight battle with face to face must not herself maintain love stoutly declare intention of keeping lover to word yet did intend to maintain love not doubting that must be true to word without effort on part mother must make very poor fight of be quite well aware must have be well if mother must have run away also a must not be mother must be left to succumb fight must be carried on afterwards a best might two lady remained at cottage for about hour during time rachel be sequestered in garden hardening heart against enemy to love if luke must only stand by must certainly stand by there be good deal of ceremony between three lady when first found together in mr ray parlour mr rowan mr tappitt be large stiff in drapery did not fit easily in among mr ray small belonging be stately in demeanour conscious that be visiting inferior conscious also that be there on friendly mission interview be commenced with show of much civility mr tappitt introduced mr rowan in due form mr rowan made little bow if with self asserting supremacy still with fitting courtesy mr ray hoped that mr tappitt young lady be quite well then there be short silence very oppressive to mr ray refreshing rather than otherwise to mr rowan gave proper business aspect to visit paved way for serious word miss rachel be out suppose said mr tappitt yes be out said mr ray be about place somewhere if want to see added in weakness not knowing how be to sustain weight of such interview alone perhaps be a well that must be away just at present said mr rowan firmly mildly quite a well said mr tappitt a firmly le mildly because wish to say few word to mr ray said mr rowan be what have brought out so early said mr tappitt be only half past two now company visiting be never done at baslehurst till after three want to say few word to mr ray about very serious matter be sure know how glad have always be to see rachel with girl have at party other night know be likely therefore must be disposed to say anything unkind about at rate not to hope said mr ray not to anybody indeed be not given to say unkind thing about people one in baslehurst must give that character fact be mr ray perhaps mr tappitt will allow said mr rowan be son oh yes certainly be if wish said mr tappitt drawing up in chair thought that perhaps a knew miss ray so well if mind mr tappitt mr rowan a again took word out of friend mouth smiled upon with smile of great efficacy oh dear certainly not said mr tappitt acknowledging by concession superiority of mr rowan nature believe be aware mr ray said mr rowan mr luke rowan be son yes be aware of be afraid must be aware also that there have be talking a be between daughter oh truth be ma'be that have offered to girl that have accepted whether be for good for bad open truth be best mr tappitt truth be truth said mr tappitt deception be not truth did think have gone anything so far a said mr rowan who at moment perhaps forgot deception be not truth in saying that have actually offered may perhaps without meaning of course be attributing more positive significance to word than have intended god forbid said mr ray very solemnly must be very sad thing for poor girl think mr rowan have better ask if say did intend of course there will be end of a far a rachel be concerned ca ask just at present said mr rowan because have gone up to london went away yesterday afternoon there be saying when may be in baslehurst again if ever said mr tappitt very solemnly perhaps have not told mr ray that partnership between mr t be over did tell that there have be word between mr tappitt word indeed said mr tappitt therefore be so easy to ask said mr rowan ignoring mr tappitt partnership of course mr ray object in matter must be same wish to see child happy respectable mr rowan a said put great emphasis on last word a to girl have fear whatever what will be respectable said mr ray with more heat than mr tappitt have thought to posse doubt doubt what be coming to be mr ray here have boy of mine be behaving foolishly to daughter a young men will do may be that have really said something to of kind suppose said something to why ma'be came out here asked permission to pay address to did answer because just at moment rachel came in from farmer sturt opposite farmer sturt said mr tappitt to mr rowan in under voice nodding head whereupon mr rowan nodded head also one of great accusation made against mr ray have be that lived on farmer sturt level not on tappitt level much le on rowan level yes from farmer sturt continued mr ray not at understanding by play so did give answer at must encourage said mr rowan know about at rate encouraged for came again next morning when be in baslehurst hope miss rachel did know be coming in absence said mr rowan must look so sly must said mr tappitt did be sly at if have known anything must have told know what girl be mr rowan can depend on mr ray courage be up be inclined to fight bravely be sadly impeded by tear now found impossible to control be sure be wish to distress said rowan doe distress very much then for anybody to say that rachel be sly said hoped be sly said mr tappitt heard what said continued mr ray see why must be speaking against rachel in way young man be son said mr tappitt indeed be not yet ai mr tappitt partner wish to be said mr rowan with toss of head be thousand pity mr ray have not wit enough about to have fanned into fire of battle ember glowed hot between two enemy have done so might probably have be made to consume other to great comfort wish to be then mr rowan paused moment mr tappitt assumed smile be intended to indicate incredulity mr ray continued mr rowan be here there luke rowan be son certainly have right to speak marriage a must be very imprudent on part very disagreeable to from way in thing have turned out be not likely that will settle at most unlikely thing in world said mr tappitt suppose will ever show in baslehurst again a for showing mr tappitt son will never be ashamed of showing anywhere wo have call to come to baslehurst mr rowan be what mean if be gentleman of word a take to be said mr ray will have great call to show never can have intended to come out here speak to in way ask to marry then never to come back see more must believe of not though own mother said say anything said mr rowan who felt that position be one of difficulty do know that in affair of kind young men do allow to go great length greater length go mr ray more particular young lady ought to be what be young lady to do how be to know whether young man be in earnest whether be only going length a call mr ray eye be still moist with tear grieve to say that though a far a immediate word be concerned be fighting rachel battle not badly still blow of enemy be taking effect upon be beginning to wish luke rowan have never be seen name heard at bragg end think be quite understood in world said mr rowan that young lady be not to take gentleman at first word oh quite said mr tappitt have of daughter said mr rowan yes of said mr tappitt be what make so fitting that must discus matter together in friendly feeling son be very good young man very good young man indeed little hasty perhaps said mr tappitt if will allow mr tappitt oh certainly mr rowan very good young man indeed think at probable that in such matter a will act in opposition to mother wish have way to make in world will never be in brewery line said mr tappitt have way to make in world continued mr rowan with much severity if marries in four five year time will be quite a soon a ought to think of doing be sure will agree with mr ray that long engagement be very bad particularly for lady wanted to be married next month said mr ray ah yes show that whole thing must come to much if there be engagement at must be very long one year must roll by from artistic manner in mr rowan allowed voice to dwell upon word signified duration of space hope of marriage between luke rachel seemed to be put off at rate to future century year must roll by know what mean lady dy of broken heart while gentleman life in bachelor room dines always at club nobody can wish state of thing a mr ray knew girl who be engaged for seven year said mr tappitt wore to thread paper so did then married housekeeper after 'd sooner see girl make up mind to be old maid than let have long engagement said mr rowan so must girl three if anybody come say to 'let papa see will know what be meaning of ' do for young girl to manage thing not what think girl have almost a much wit about a have wo mention name there be young man about here a well to do a young man in south ham cherry wo a much a look at mr rowan again tossed head felt misfortune in being burthened with colleague a mr tappitt what be want to do mr rowan asked mr ray want daughter who be sure be very nice young lady good looking too oh quite so said mr tappitt want to understand that little thing must be allowed to drop if boy have done anything foolish be here to apologize for be first have be foolish be afraid wo be last ca be believed mr ray that marriage must be run up in thoughtless sort of way in first place young people know anything of other absolutely nothing at then be sure want to insist on difference that there may be in position in life only must be aware of mr ray that marriage a must be very injurious to young man like son luke child must wish to injure anybody therefore of course wo think more about want from be that must promise that if rachel will only just say that said mr tappitt daughter will be a happy to see out walking with a ever rachel have have quite enough of such walking mr tappitt quite enough if harm have come of have be fault of girl said mr tappitt then there be pause among three lady appeared that mr rowan be waiting for mr ray answer mr ray did not know what answer must make be already disposed to regard coming of luke rowan to baslehurst a curse rather than blessing felt convinced that fate must be against hers in matter have ever be afraid of young men believing to be dangerous bringers of trouble into family roaring lion sometimes often wolf in sheep clothing since have first heard of luke rowan in connection with daughter have be trembling if must have acted in accordance with own feeling at moment must have begged that luke rowan name might never again be mentioned in presence must be better for thought to bear what have already come upon than to run further risk must not give answer to mr rowan without consulting rachel must not at least give such answer a contemplated without doing so have sanctioned rachel love must not now undertake to oppose rachel have probably be deceived must bear misfortune a question stood at present between daughter must not at once accede to mr rowan view in matter will talk to rachel said give kindest respect said mr rowan pray make understand must interfere if did think be for advantage good bye mr ray mr rowan got up good bye mr ray said mr tappitt putting out hand give love to rachel hope that will be good friend yet for have come gone mr ray must not accept mr tappitt hand must vouchsafe answer to mr tappitt amenity good bye ma'be said to mr rowan suppose mean to do best can by own child by yours too said mr rowan if so can only say that must think very badly of own son good bye ma'be then mr ray curtseyed out not without certain amount of dignity although eye be red with tear whole body trembling with dismay very little be said in fly between two lady on way back to brewery did mr rowan remain very long a visitor at mr tappitt house have found compelled by circumstance to take part inimical to mr ray felt in heart much stronger animosity to mr tappitt with mr ray must have be very friendly only for disastrous love affair with mr tappitt must not again put into pleasant relation must point out how sadly unfortunate be that mr ray have not known how to fan flame of anger to own daughter advantage well mamma said rachel returning to room a soon a heard wheel of fly in motion upon road across green found mother in tear hardly able to speak because

frightened when so confidently called upon to write to twice week nevertheless letter be genial one joyous upon whole comforting read very slowly going back over much of twice thrice so that mother became impatient before perusal be finished seems to be very long said mr ray yes mamma be long be nearly four side what can have to say so much there be good deal of be about own private affair suppose then must see oh yes mamma rachel handed letter must think of having letter from not showing to not a thing be now then mr ray took letter spent quite a much time in reading a rachel have done writes a though meant to have everything quite own way said mr ray be what doe mean think will do always be what people call imperious be bad in man be mr ray did not quite know whether be bad in man mistrusted letter not construing closely so a to discover what might really be full meaning perceiving that young man took intended to take very much into own hand that demanded that everything must be surrendered to will pleasure without guarantee on part that such surrendering must be properly acknowledged mr ray be disposed to doubt people thing be at distance from check must be kept over lover at baslehurst if perchance lover have removed only to exeter with city mr ray be personally acquainted must have believed in return must not in case have gone utterly beyond ken must put confidence in lover up in london who must say that might not marry one else to morrow that might not be promising to marry dozen be with same sort of feeling made think possible that mr prong might go to australia must have liked a lover for daughter young man fixed in business if not at baslehurst then at totnes dartmouth brixham under own eye a be young man so fixed that world of south devonshire must know of doings young man when asked girl to marry must mean what said if did not there must be escape for from punishment of neighbour eye tongue young man up in london young man who have quarrelled with natural friend in baslehurst young man who be confessedly masterful impetuous young man who called own mother goose rest of world liar in first letter to lady love be that young man in whom mr ray must place confidence a lover for pet lamb read letter very slowly then a gave back to rachel groaned for nearly hour after nothing be said in cottage about letter rachel have perceived that have not be thought satisfactory by mother then be inclined to believe that mother must have regarded no letter a satisfactory until argument have be used to prove to that be so at rate be clear must be clear to mr ray a be clear to rachel that luke have intention of shirking fulfilment of engagement after be not that one thing a to be essentially necessary that must be confident have not accepted luke telling that loved be not acknowledged by around that marriage must be good for danger feared be expectation of such marriage without accomplishment even foreboding of mr prime have shown that be evil to pointed under circumstance what better must be wished for than ready quick warm assurance on luke part that did intend that have said with rachel now a with girl under such circumstance chief immediate consideration be a to answer must be given be to write to to write what pleased might write at once felt that longed to have pen in hand yet when holding must have to think for hour before writing first word mamma said at last think be good letter know what to think dear doubt whether letter of sort be good for much of what sort mamma letter from men who call lover to young girl must be safer think that there must be very much safer if have written must have thought that have forgotten about must not have be good said that if did not write soon there must be end of everything hundred year ago there be writing between young people thing be managed better then than be now a far a can understand people must write so much then said rachel because there be railway postage stamp suppose must answer mamma to proposition mr ray made immediate answer think ought to answer mamma ca want to write at once in afternoon must do in afternoon why must be in so much hurry rachel took four five day to write to yes be down in northamptonshire on business besides have letter from to answer must like to think to think what rachel have forgotten psha did treat letter with respect wo think that must turn over in mind believe ought to ask somebody not dolly said rachel eagerly not sister will not ask if mind dear will take young man letter out to mr comfort consult never felt so much in need of somebody to advise mr comfort be old man wo mind seeing letter rachel did mind very much have mean of saving from fate did not like idea of having love letter submitted to clergyman of parish know young lady who must have liked bad a be be preferable to having letter submitted to mr prime then remembered that mr comfort have advised that might go to ball that be father to friend mr butler cornbury chapter ii electioneering now in day day immediately following departure of luke rowan from baslehurst tappitt family be constrained to work very hard at task of defaming young man who have lately be living with in house be constrained to do by necessity of position in doing so by mean showed to be such monster of iniquity a reader of story will feel inclined to call a for tappitt certainly believed that rowan be so base scoundrel that evil word against must be considered a malicious even unnecessary be not good to denounce scoundrel if rascality of rascal be specially directed against one own wife child be not duty to denounce rascal so that rascality may be known thus made of effect when tappitt declared in reading room at dragon afterwards in little room inside bar at king head again to circle of respectable farmer tradesman in corn market that young rowan have come down to brewery made way into brewery house with ready prepared plan for ruining head of firm thought that be telling truth again when spoke with horror of rowan intention of setting up opposition brewery horror be conscientious believed that must be very wicked in man to oppose bungall establishment with money left by bungall that must be wickedness than commercial rascality must be more iniquitous very soul be struck with awe at idea that anything be due in matter to consumer of beer never occurred to may also be said in tappitt favour that opinion a general opinion be backed by around neighbour must not be made to hate rowan a hated must not declare young man to be very mischief a did that idea of rival brewery be distasteful to most of knew that beer be almost too bad to be swallowed thought that tappitt have vested interest in manufacture of bad beer that a manufacturer of bad beer be fairly honest useful man looked upon change a work rather suggestion of charlatan be staffordshire said if want beer like can buy in bottle at griggs ' will soon find where will be if try to undersell said young griggs same hope will come back because have left little bill at place then to other evil report be added that special evil report that rowan have gone away without paying debt be inclined to think that mr tappitt can be almost justified in evil thought evil word can not make out quite so good case for mr tappitt two elder daughter for even martha martha just shook head in day when rowan name be mentioned something may be said even for must not be supposed that mr tappitt single grievance be disappointment a regarded augusta have there be augusta on whose behalf hope have be possible predilection of young moneyed stranger for girl a rachel ray must have be grievance to woman a mr tappitt have not be looking down on rachel ray despising for last ten year have not be wondering among friend with charitable volubility a to what that poor woman at bragg end be to do with daughter have not be regretting that young girl must be growing up so big promising to look so coarse be not natural that must be miserable when saw taken in hand by mr butler cornbury made heroine at own party to detriment of own daughter by fashionable lady in catching whom have displayed so much unfortunate ingenuity under such circumstance how must do other than hate luke rowan than believe to be very mischief than prophesying manner of bad thing for rachel assist husband tooth nail in animosity against sinner augusta be le strong in feeling than parent of course disliked man who must admire rachel ray a regard martha dislike to rather judicial disapproval be founded on social commercial impropriety understood that have threatened father about business have be scandalized in matter of champagne cherry be very brave still stood up for before mother sister even cherry did not dare to say word in favour before father mr tappitt have be driven to forget to take poker in hand a weapon of violence after let one speak word on offender behalf in tappitt house within tappitt hearing in affair of champagne rowan be most bitterly injured have ordered if not at request at least at instigation of mr tappitt have paid for when left baslehurst owed shilling to man in indeed be man by mean given to owing money to one be of spirit masterful self confident perhaps glorious be at same time honest independent that wine have be ordered in unusual way not at regular counter in same way bill for have be paid griggs when made assertion in bar room at king head have stated what believed to be truth next morning chanced to hear that account have be settled not at moment duly marked off book a far a griggs went that be end of did not again say that rowan owed money to never contradicted former assertion allowed general report to go on report have be founded on own first statement thus before rowan have be week out of place be believed over town that have left unpaid bill behind be told that young man be dreadfully in debt said mr prong to mr prime at time mr prong mr prime saw other daily be affectionate in intercourse with serious solemn affection affair be by mean settled between affection be however strong enough to induce mr prong to take decided part in opposing rowan alliance say owes money over town so miss pucker tell said mr prime doe mother know mother never know anything that other people know have gone now suppose will hear of see again have not written to dorothea not that know of must find out must not leave in danger mother be weak must give aid of strength girl be sister must not leave to grope in darkness must remember dorothea that have duty in matter dorothea did not like being told of duty in so pastoral manner resolved to be more than ever particular in protection of own pecuniary right before submitted to mr prong marital authority once for ever by miss pucker be at rate treated with great respect be allowed perhaps display of pastoral manner on own part began to be with matter of doubt whether might not be of more use in free vineyard be about to leave than in vineyard with closed door pastoral overseer be preparing to enter at rate must be careful about money in mean time did agree with mr prong that rowan proper character must be made known to mother with view went out to cottage whispered into mr ray astonished ear fact that luke be terribly in debt say so do say so mother everybody in baslehurst be talking about say that have treated mr tappitt shamefully have anything come from since went then mr ray told elder daughter of letter told also that intended to consult mr comfort oh mr comfort said mr prime signifying opinion that mother be going to very poor counsellor what sort of letter be said mr prime with not unnatural desire to see be honest letter enough very honest to thinking speaking a though everything between be quite settled be nonsense mother perhaps may be nonsense dorothea be only telling what letter said called mother goose be worst thing in can not expect that one a must honour parent mother think finest young man in world must say for that have always spoken of a though loved very dearly believe have be most excellent son must have said goose at rate in letter not to way of thinking perhaps mind thing up in london never knew young man so badly spoken of at place 'd left a be in baslehurst think right to tell if have made up mind to ask mr comfort yes have made up mind to ask mr comfort have sent to say will call day after to morrow then mr prime went back home having seen letter sister may be remembered that election be impending over town of coming necessity of have induced mr butler cornbury to grace mr tappitt ball be now nearly end of july election be to be made early in september candidate be already in field politician of neighbourhood already knew to nicety how affair must go mr hart great clothier from houndsditch regent street messrs hart jacob of from to houndsditch about a many more number in regent street must come in at top of poll with vote butler cornbury whose forefather have lived in neighbourhood for last four hundred year be returned for various place in devonshire to dozen of parliament must be left in lurch with vote petition might probably unseat jew clothier then a be well known cornbury estate must not bear expenditure of necessary five thousand pound for petition in addition to twelve hundred election be computed to cost be known thoroughly understood men in baslehurst talked about result a though matter be past doubt nevertheless there be who be ready to bet on cornbury side of question though thing be thus accurately settled though termination be foreseen by so many with so perfect certainty still canvassing went on in fact there be vote have not even yet be asked much le promised again much le purchased hart people be striving to frighten cornbury people out of field by fear of probable expenditure have not be for good courage of mr butler cornbury must probably have succeeded in doing so old squire be very fidgety about money young squire declared unwilling to lean too heavily upon father lady of household declared conviction that there be more smoke than fire more threat of bribery than intention of bribing must go on declared a word passed for much at cornbury grange battle be still to be fought among vote certainly have not a yet be promised be that of mr tappitt mr hart in person have called upon have not be quite satisfied with reception mr tappitt be man who thought much of local influence local privilege be by mean disposed to make promise of vote on easy term at moment when vote be becoming of so much importance be doubt liberal a be also mr hart in small town politics become split man be not always bound to vote for liberal candidate because be liberal mr hart have be confident in tone have not sufficiently freed from outer taint of ancient race to please mr tappitt taste be impudent low jew have said to wife a for butler cornbury

cornbury perceived knew that must lose nothing by immediate request mr tappitt said have come canvassing fact be mr cornbury say be liberal therefore have not face to ask tell that think must rather support neighbour from county even though there may be shade of difference in politics between than stranger whose trade religion can not possibly recommend whose politics if really knew must probably be quite a much unlike own a be husband little speech have be prepared beforehand be brought out quite a naturally a though mr cornbury have be accustomed to speak on leg for quarter of century mr tappitt grunted attack came upon so much by surprise that knew not what else to do to grunt if mr cornbury have come with same speech in mouth must then have sided off into general abuse of luke rowan

kindly feeling have fallen rachel have pleased eye gratified sense of feminine nicety felt that word said against rowan must be word said also against rachel therefore throwing husband over for nonce

butler cornbury wife one two others chance of election formed of course chief subject of conversation in drawing room at dinner table in talking of election came to talk of mr tappitt in talking of

then thought much of when men calling commissioner came actually upon separated off from district of own town taking away altogether from authority giving over to such inexperienced hand a chance might send thither then dr harford became violent tory reader must not conceive that be question touching pocket one might presume that pocket must be in degree benefited seeing that be saved from necessity of supplying spiritual want of certain portion of parish shilling be taken from own income indeed be by mean excessive whole parish gave barely six hundred year out of have kept always one latterly two curate be question of money in degree sooner than be invaded mutilated must have submitted to order calling upon to find third curate must power have given such order parish have be invaded clerical authority mutilated be no longer totus teres atque rotundus beauty of life be over contentment of mind be gone knew that be only left for to die spending such day a remained to in

church of england clergyman dr harford have undergone full share of suffering from such thorn have caused no more than pleasant irritation in comparison with what endured from presence of mr prong in baslehurst must sooner have entertained dissenting minister of south ham together than have put leg under same mahogany with mr prong mr prong be to evil thing anathema believed bad thing of mr prong with absolute faith without ground on such faith must have be formed thought that mr prong drank spirit that robbed parishioner dr harford must sooner have lost tongue than have used word with reference to who attended mr prong chapel that have left deserted wife on parish that be probably not in truth ordained there be nothing dr harford must not believe of mr prong now be to say least of

brewing of bad beer if demand for bad beer be so great a to enable to live by occupation on other hand luke rowan be personally known to none of be jealous that change must come among with view of teaching lesson improving condition believed thought believed that mr tappitt have be ill treated in counting house be grievous to that man with wife three daughter must have be threatened by young

clergyman rachel have have letter from young mr rowan said have begged not to answer till have shown to so mr comfort sent word down to bragg end that must call at cottage fixed hour for coming task be to be accomplished by on morning after dr harford dinner have thought much of coming conference between rachel mother while rowan character be being discussed at dr harford house on occasion have said nothing to one not even to daughter of application have be made to by mr ray at eleven o'clock presented at cottage door of course found mr ray alone rachel have taken over to mr sturt greatly amazed that kindhearted person by silence confusion why dear said mr sturt hai got word to day to throw at dog rachel acknowledged that have not then mr sturt allowed to remain in silence oh mr comfort be so good of mr ray began a soon a friend be inside parlour when went up to parsonage did think of bringing down here way did indeed mr comfort assured that thought nothing of trouble declared that owed visit then asked after rachel to tell truth then be just stept across green to mr sturt so a to be out of way be trying time to mr comfort very way go be good girl very good girl need tell that mr ray oh must there be sister think be encouraged young man too freely by by mr ray have be told that mr prime be engaged to be married have now well yes heard in baslehurst yesterday to mr prong be kept so close mr comfort did think anybody have heard be true then ca say have accepted yet have offered to there be doubt about mr comfort have said do let look sharp after money said mr comfort well be just be not bit inclined to give up to can tell ca say mr ray that connexion be one like very much in way there be reason at why eldest daughter must not marry again what can do mr comfort of course know be not just what must be be for clergyman when knew have come from of college never have fancy for going to hear of course must never have left church mr comfort not if anybody have come there if must have have way with dorothy must never have gone near never what must do mr comfort of course can go where like mr prime be gentleman christian said vicar that be mr comfort husband for young woman to be proud of be soon taken away from very soon have thought much of world since know what be thinking of now be of mr comfort not bit dorothy be very stern to give due be not be thinking of why doe want to marry then because be lonely without one to do for lonely must be lonely for mr ray because say can work in vineyard better a clergyman wife pshaw work in vineyard indeed be business of mine a say suppose ca help indeed ca 'd never think of asking hope will look after money be what be about friend rachel 'd great deal sooner hear that be going to be married if knew that man be worthy of then mr ray put hand into pocket taking out rowan letter gave to vicar to read a did so looked into face with eye full of most intense anxiety be greatly frightened by magnitude of marriage question feared enmity of mr rowan doubted firmness of luke must not keep from reflecting that young man from london be very dangerous that might probably be wolf that must not be safe in trusting one lamb into such custody nevertheless most earnestly hoped that mr comfort verdict might be in young man favour if must only say that young man be not wolf if must only take upon own clerical shoulder responsibility of trusting young man mr ray must become for moment one of happiest woman in devonshire with what beaming face with what true joy with what smile through tear must then have welcomed rachel back from farm house how must have watched a came across green beckoning to eagerly telling happy tale beforehand by sign of joy there be to be such happy tale a told on morning watched vicar face a read letter soon perceived that verdict be to be given against writer of know that mr ray be particularly quick at reading countenance of men in instance did read countenance of mr comfort of read more in face of with whom hold converse than be aware of doing of truth want of truth in word spoken to judge in great part by face of speaker by face of man woman seen by whether speak be silent form judgment in nine case out of ten judgment be true be because tenth judgment judgment have be wrong come back upon always with effect of error that teach to say that appearance can not be trusted if did not trust must be walking ever in doubt in darkness in ignorance a mr comfort read letter mr ray knew that must not be allowed to to speak word of happiness to rachel on day knew that young man be to be set down a dangerous be by mean aware that be reading vicar face with precise accuracy mr comfort have be slow in perusal weighing word of letter when have finished slowly refolded paper put back into envelope mean what say said a gave letter back to mr ray yes think mean what say can not tell how long may mean can tell a yet whether such connection must be good for rachel even if must remain stedfast in such meaning if ask mr ray do ask mr comfort then think must of know more about before allow rachel to give encouragement do indeed mr ray must not quite repress in heart slight feeling of anger against vicar remembered word so different not only in meaning in tone in be spoken in have sanctioned rachel going to ball young people get to think of other have then said speaking with good humoured cheery voice a though such thinking be worthy of encouragement have spoken then of marriage being happiest condition for men woman have inquired a to rowan mean word have then fallen from have expressed opinion that luke rowan be eligible lover now be named a though be undoubtedly wolf why have not mr comfort said then at former interview when

conscious that might probably compose letter in strain of higher dignity than mother must be likely to adopt that lover must be gone from for ever felt almost assured still must be much to that on going must so leave that respect might remain though love must be thing of past in estimation be noble being to have be loved by whom even for few day be more honour than have ever hoped to win for

went on straight to stile at have stood with luke rowan watching reflection of setting sun among cloud be spot have determined to visit have come hither hoping that might again see form in heaven might remind of have shown stile at rate be same there be tree beneath have stood there be rich field lying beneath over two have gazed together at fading light of evening there be arm in cloud now perverse sun be retiring to rest without of royal pageantry illumination with heaven be wont to deck when king go to couch rachel though have come thither to look for thing have not found hardly marked absence mind became so full of of word that required outward sign to refresh memory thought so much of look on evening of tone of voice of motion of body that soon forgot to watch cloud sat down upon stile with face turned away from field telling that must listen for footstep of stranger so that might move away if came near soon forgot also to listen sat there thinking of alone word have be spoken between on occasion have be trifling very few of small moment now seemed to to have contained destiny be there that love for have first come upon have come over with broad outspread wing like angel whether a angel of darkness of light heart have then be unable to perceive how well remembered how have taken her by hand claiming right of doing so a ordinary farewell greeting how have held looking into face till have be forced to speak word of rebuke to did not think must behave like have said yet at very moment heart be going from warm friendliness of touch firm clear brightness of eye eager tone of voice be even then subduing coy unwillingness to part with maiden love have declared to herself then that be angry with since have declared to herself that nothing must have be better finer sweeter than that have said done on evening have be right to hold if intended afterwards to claim a own like so very much have said why must not be friend have gone away from then fleeing along path bewildered ignorant a to own feeling conscious almost of sin in having listened to still filled with wondrous delight that one so good so beautiful so powerful a must have cared to ask for friendship in such pressing word during walk home have be full of fear wonder mysterious delight then have come ball in have hardly be so pleasant to because eye of many have watched there thought of moment when have first come to in mr tappitt drawing room just a be resolving that did not intend to notice further thought of repeated dance have be so dear to in repetition have frightened so grievously thought of supper during have insisted on sitting by of meeting in hall during have a be forced to remain listen to forced to stay with till in agony of fear have escaped away to friend begged that might be taken home a sat by mr cornbury in carriage afterwards a have thought of while lying in bed have declared to herself that have be very wrong since during few day of permitted love have sworn to a often that have be very right have be right said so to herself now again though word have spoken thing have done have brought upon sorrow have be right if loved be only manly proper in to tell love for seeing that have loved have not be proper womanly in to declare love what have done when at what point have gone astray that must be brought to pas a at beginning when have held hand on spot where be now sitting again when have kept prisoner in mr tappitt hall have be half conscious of sin half ashamed of own conduct that undecided fear of sin shame have be washed out everything have be made white a snow a pure a running water a bright a sunlight by permission to love man have be accorded to what have since done that must be brought to pas a in now found a thought of be bitter against world except almost bitter against own mother have said that must obey in matter of letter knew well that must in truth do a mother bade sitting there on churchyard stile hatched within mind plan of disobedience dreadful plan must not submit to usage must go away from baslehurst without knowledge of one must seek out in london home must be unmaidenly what cared now for unless indeed must care virgin modesty young maiden fear be not for that must guard for delight pride if be to see more if be to be forced to bid go from of what avail must be now to to cherish maintain unsullied brightness of woman armour if be lost to everything be lost must go to throwing at foot must swear to that life without love be no longer possible for if must then take a wife must strive to bless with that tenderness of wife must give if must refuse then must go away die in such case what to must be judgment of man woman what to must be sister scorn malignant virtue of such a miss pucker mr prong what upturned hand amazement of mr comfort must have be who have driven to how about mother when must have thus thrown overboard from ship cast away from pilotage have hitherto be guide of

to husband strives hardest to lighten weight of care by tenderness of love have not be permitted to place in position with regard to when have be permitted to love in thought recognized right of mother to have debarred from privilege of loving man if such embargo have be placed on before love have be declared have never even within own bosom assumed to herself right of such privilege without authority expressed very soul revolted against withdrawal of sanction have be given to spirit within rebelled though knew that must not carry on rebellion by word deed have be injured injured almost to death injured even to death a regarded life must give worth taking a thought of injury fierce look of have spoken came across brow must obey pastor master yes must obey must never again be soft pliable within hand obedience in matter be necessity to in spite of wild thought of throwing off maiden bond allowing female armour to be splashed sullied in gutter knew that there be that must hinder from execution of such scheme be bound by woman lot to maintain womanly purity let suffer a might there be nothing for obedience must not go forth a though be man claim right to stand fall by love have be injured in being brought to such plight a must bear injury a best might be within power be still thinking of still sitting with eye turned towards tower of church when be touched on back by light hand turned round quickly startled by touch for have heard footstep saw martha tappitt cherry be cherry who have come close upon be cherry voice that first heard penny for thought said cherry oh have so startled said rachel then suppose thought be worth more than penny perhaps be thinking of absent knight then cherry began to sing away away away love ride away poor rachel blushed be unable to speak be so foolish said martha to sister be ever so long since have seen rachel why come walk with yes indeed why said cherry whose good nature be quite a conspicuous a bad taste knew now that have vexed rachel be thoroughly sorry that have done so if other girl have quizzed about lover must not have annoyed have not understood at first that rachel ray might be different from declare have hardly seen since night of party think very ill natured in not to come to do come walk to morrow oh thank not to morrow because sister be coming out from baslehurst to spend evening with well on saturday then said cherry persistingly rachel must make promise to walk with on day felt that must henceforth be divided from tappitts have not quarrelled with mr tappitt must be fitting that must keep up friendship with family be hostile to be also aware that mr tappitt be among who be desirous of robbing of lover mr tappitt be enemy a mr tappitt be asked question a to duty of forgiving injury have done felt that be divided from from mr mr tappitt also from girl moreover in present strait wanted friend must not talk to friend about lover must not bring even to think on other subject be late said must go home a mamma will be expecting cherry have almost replied that have not be in so great hurry once before when have stood in churchyard with companion thought of rachel reproachful face when last little joke have be uttered refrained be over head ear in love said cherry to sister when rachel be gone be afraid have be very foolish said martha seriously see that have be foolish at be very nice fellow a far a can see be just a fond of a be of know what mean with young men said martha who be sufficiently serious in way of thinking to hold by doctrine a to wolf in sheep clothing in mr ray have be educated young men do marry sometimes said cherry not merely for sake of pretty face good figure believe mamma be right in think will come back again if be lover 'd have back said cherry stoutly so went away to brewery rachel on way home determined that must write letter night mother be to read when be written be understood to be agreement between there must be reason why must not be alone when wrote must word very differently thought if sat alone over in own bedroom than must do immediately under mother eye must not pause think perhaps weep over sitting at parlour table with mother in arm chair close by watching needed that must write with tear with many struggle with many baffled attempt to find word must be wanted with very heart blood must not be tender be prepared to omit tenderness must probably be short if so very shortness must be difficulty a walked along must not tell with what word must write thought that word must perhaps come to if waited long enough for in solitude of own chamber reached home by nine o'clock sat with mother for hour reading out loud book on be then engaged think will go to bed now mamma said always want to go to bed so soon said mr ray think be getting tired of reading out loud will be very sad for with eye be not mamma will go on again for hour if please thought liked going to bed at watch be consulted a be not quite ten rachel did go on for half hour then went up to bedroom sat down at open window looked out for while upon heaven summer moon be at full so that green before cottage be a clear before a in day must see over into gloom of mr sturt farmyard across have once watched rowan a came over turf towards cottage swinging stick in hand now gazed on spot where baslehurst road came in a though expected that figure might again appear looked looked thinking of till must hardly have be surprised have that figure really come forth upon road figure be to be seen after awhile withdrew from window sat down at little table be very late when undressed went to bed later still when eye red with many tear be closed in sleep letter have be written be ready for mother inspection be letter a stood after many struggle in writing of bragg end thursday dear mr rowan be much obliged to for having written letter received from other day must have answered sooner only mamma thought best to see mr comfort first a be clergyman here to ask advice hope will not be annoyed because showed letter to mamma must not receive letter from without doing so may a well tell that will read before go now have begun hardly know how to write what have to say mr comfort mamma have determined that there must be nothing fixed a engagement between that for present at least may not correspond with will be first last letter a will be so of course will not expect to write more know that will be very angry if understood feeling think that perhaps must not be very very angry know be true that when asked that question nodded head a say in letter if have sworn twenty oath of speak must not a say have bound tighter must bind to anything against mamma will thought that be very generous to come to a did oh so generous know why must have looked to one a to be wife must have done best to make happy have be able to do a suppose then wished well know that man be very different from girl of course must do a mamma wish say that a business here about brewery be so very unsettled think probable that will not have to come back to baslehurst more that a acquaintance have be so very short be not reasonable to suppose that will care much about after little while perhaps be not reasonable after will have right to be angry with if forget think will quite forget will never expect even hope to see again twice in writing letter rachel cut out latter assertion at last sobbing in despair restored word what right must have to hope that must come to after have taken upon to break that promise have be conveyed to when bent head over arm will not forget will always be friend a said must be being friend be very different to anything else nobody can say may not do will always remember what showed in cloud indeed went there very evening to see if must see arm there be nothing there have taken that a omen that will not come back to baslehurst to have be word a have first written there be tenderness in word found necessary to alter will now say good bye to for have told all have to tell mamma desire will remember to kindly may god bless protect always believe to be sincere friend rachel ray in morning took down letter in hand gave to mother mr ray read very slowly demurred over at sundry place especially demurred at word about omen even declared that ought to be expunged rachel be very stern held ground have put into letter said that have be bidden to say such word from to one who have be so dear to must be allowed to letter be not altered be taken away by postman that evening chapter vi mr ray go to exeter meet

acknowledged that not only required answer that even refused to be answered rachel have told lover that be not to correspond with that certainly must not write to again having so said have right to expect answer protested over over again that did expect none still must watch a thought unseen for postman coming heart must sink within a man must pas gate without calling have taken at word said to herself very bitterly deserve nothing else from in day be ever silent stern did that mother bade did little nothing from love there be more banquet with clotted cream brought over from mr sturt must speak word two now then to mr sturt who understood whole case perfectly such word be spoken on chance occasion for rachel now never went over to farm farmer sturt assistance have be offered to what must farmer do for in such trouble a hers during whole of six week did household duty gradually became slower in still more slow mother knew that disappointment be becoming source of permanent misery rachel never said that be ill indeed of special malady did show sign gradually became thin wan cheek assumed haggard look that aspect of brow mother feared have become habitual to mr ray observed closely in that did knew well of watching for postman be always thinking of child after while longing luke rowan might come back to with heart almost a sore with longing a be that of rachel what must do must not bring back in that have done in giving sanction to lover again in withdrawing have be guided by advice of clergyman must go again to beg to restore young man to ah no great a be trust in clergyman knew that even must not do for during week hardly word be spoken openly between mother daughter about matter chiefly occupied thought of luke rowan name be hardly mentioned between once twice allusion be made to subject of brewery for be becoming generally known that lawyer be already at work on behalf of rowan claim even on such occasion a mr ray found that speech be stopped by expression of rachel eye by two line on such occasion must mark forehead in day mr ray became afraid of younger daughter almost more so than have ever be afraid of elder one rachel indeed never spoke a mr prime must sometimes speak word of scolding ever passed mouth in that did be gentle observant there be ever on countenance that look of reproach by degree be becoming almost unendurable then word during day be so few be so anxious to sit alone in own room must still read to mother for hour in evening reading be to so manifestly task difficult distasteful may be remembered that mr prime with lover mr prong friend miss pucker have promised to call at bragg end on evening after rachel walk into baslehurst did come a have promised about hour after rachel letter to luke have be carried away by postman have come have remained at bragg end for hour eating cake drinking currant wine not having on whole what american friend call good time of that visit have be terrible to mr ray rachel have sat there cold hard speechless not only have not asked miss pucker to take off bonnet have absolutely declined to speak to lady be wonderful to mother that must thus in so short time have become wilful masterful resolved in following out own purpose not one word on occasion did speak to miss pucker mr prime observing have grown black still blacker till horror of visit have become terrible to mr ray miss pucker have grinned smiled striven gallantly poor woman to make best of have declared how glad have be to see miss rachel on previous evening how well miss rachel have looked have expressed quite voluminous hope that miss rachel must come to dorcas meeting to rachel answered not syllable now then addressed word two to sister now then spoke to mother when mr prong specially turned to asking question must answer with one two monosyllable always calling sir to miss pucker never once opened mouth mr prime became very angry very black very angry time of visit be terrible time to mr ray visit be to be noticed in story chiefly on account of few word mr prong found opportunity of saying to mr ray respecting proposed marriage mr ray knew that there be difficulty about money be disposed to believe perhaps to hope that match must be broken off on occasion mr prong be very marked in way of speaking to mr ray a though everything be settled mr ray be thoroughly convinced by that be so former belief possible hope be dispersed then mr ray be easily convinced by assertion in thus speaking to future mother in law have contrived to turn back round upon other three lady so a to throw together for time thus make position more painful must be acknowledged that rachel be capable of something great after determined resistance to miss pucker blandishment under

when tuesday morning came went with mother only a far a station mind meeting because ca be sure about train said mr ray will be back to night certainly will wait tea for said rachel then when mother

through churchyard so walked down from railway station to hamlet at bottom of hill below church from thence went up by field path to stile in order to accomplish went fully two mile out of way now sun over head be very hot what be distance heat of sun to when object be to stand for few moment in place visit however to spot be so constantly in thought did good why have be so injured why have sacrifice of be demanded from a sat for moment on stile be matter filled breast have be exalted to heaven when first heard mother speak of mr rowan a acceptable suitor have be filled with joy a though paradise have be opened to when found to be promised bride of luke rowan then have come lover letter clergyman counsel own reply after that gate of paradise have be closed against wonder whether be

of condition with gate of paradise closed against be very hard to bear who have closed gate own hand have done lover have not deserted have done for truth earnestness demanded perhaps a much a love required men be not so soft a girl argued within own breast let man be ever so true must not be expected that must stand by love after have be treated with such cold indifference a have be shown in letter must have stood by love let letter have be a cold a might then be woman love once encouraged have become necessity to man said to herself must be more proud le stanch of course must hear no more from of course gate of paradise be shut such be thought a walked home such thought over sat brooding alone throughout entire day at half past seven in evening mr ray came back home wearily

tired must under ordinary circumstance have be disposed to reckon up grievance in evening quite a accurately a rachel have reckoned hers in morning something have occurred in exeter recollection of still overcame sense of weariness mr ray felt overcame rather overtopped so that when rachel came out to at cottage door did not speak at once of own weariness looked lovingly into daughter face lovingly anxiously said little word intended to denote affection must be very tired said rachel who with many self reproach much communing within own bosom have for time vanquished own hard humour yes

examination although be made by mr goodall without allusion to rachel at rate have got money said mr goodall suppose be care about must say be rather harum scarum sort of fellow why must leave debt behind ca understand a seems to have plenty of money made mr ray task more difficult during last two three week have be wishing that have not gone to mr comfort wishing that have allowed rachel to answer rowan letter in term of warmest love that might have chosen wishing in fact that have permitted engagement to go on now began again to think that have be right if man be in truth harum scarum

fault do think that have be mine think 'd better not talk of fault ah dear do wish have never come here perhaps may be well yet rachel perhaps may in world will never be well again for in good night mamma must never think that be angry with then went up stair leaving mr ray alone with sorrow chapter vii domestic politics at brewery in mean time thing be not going on very pleasantly at brewery mr tappitt be making unpleasant in bosom of family lawsuit will sometimes make man extremely pleasant company to wife child even losing lawsuit will sometimes do so if be well backed up in pugnacity by lawyer if matter of battle be one in can take delight to fight ah man will say though spend thousand pound over will stick to like burr sha shake off at such time be almost sure to be in good humour in generous mood then let wife ask for money for dinner party daughter for new dress have taught for moment to disregard money to think that can sow five pound note broadcast without inward pang such be by mean case with mr tappitt lawyer honyman be not backing up a cool reflection came upon be afraid of trusting interest to other men sharpit longfite mr tappitt when cool reflection came on have begun to dread ruin seemed possible that terrible young man might inflict upon have learned already though mr ray have not how false have be that report have declared luke rowan to be frivolous idle in debt to be very manifest that honyman be afraid of young man honyman though might not be a keen a others be at rate honest honyman also thought that if brewery be given up to rowan thousand year have be promised must be paid regularly to solution of difficulty mr tappitt be gradually bending to submit a best untoward fate offered to honyman have declared to that mr tappitt if be well advised must admit rowan in a partner on equal term a regarded power ultimate possession with lion share of immediate concern for rowan offered knew that tappitt must not endure knew also that if be brought to endure for while must ultimately lead to terrible sorrow must be knocking other about with poker mr honyman have said where must custom be when got into newspaper if be mr tappitt must just let have own way honyman have replied that show that know tappitt have be mr tappitt rejoinder no thousand year dignified retirement in villa have recommended to mr tappitt mind must use influence to attain position if only must bring to feel assured that thousand year must be forthcoming a to tappitt be by mean so anxious to prolong battle a have be at time of rowan departure courage for fighting be not maintained by good backing have honyman clapped on shoulder bade put ready money in purse telling that must come out right eventually that rowan must be crushed must have gone about baslehurst boasting loudly must have be happy then mr t girl must have have merry time of tappitts must have come out of contest with four five hundred year for life instead of thousand now offered to nobody must have blamed anybody for result honyman have not spirit for such backing in dull slow droning way have shaken head said that thing be looking badly then tappitt have cursed have sworn have half resolved to go to sharpit longfite sharpit longfite must have clapped on back readily enough have bade put plenty of money in purse may suppose that fate did not intend ruin of tappitt seeing that did not make mad enough to seek counsel of sharpit longfite fate only made very cross unpleasant in bosom of family looking out for mode of escape from terrible enemy have come upon preferred raising of sum of money must be necessary to buy off rowan altogether rowan have demanded ten thousand pound tappitt still thought that seven at rate eight thousand must do think will take le than ten said honyman because share be really worth a much a that be very provoking who can wonder tappitt be not pleasant company in own house on day after mr ray visit to exeter tappitt a be now almost daily practice made way into mr honyman little back room sat there with hat on discussing affair find that mr rowan have bought cottage of widow ray said honyman nonsense shouted tappitt a though such purchase on rowan part be new injury done to oh have said honyman there be not doubt in life about if doe mean to build new brewery must be bad place see be out of thoroughfare of town yet a one may say within stone throw of high street will not repeat mr tappitt exclamation a listened to suggestion of lawyer be of nature to show that have not heard news with indifference see be such fellow that know where to have continued honyman be not only that mind ruining mind ruining either believe be got anything to lose ah be where be wrong have paid ready money for bit of land to begin with goodall must never have let have goodall know what be about a well a man do mean to tell that be going to put up building there at once be face a asked question must have softened heart of ordinary lawyer honyman be one whom nothing must harden nothing soften know what be going to put up mr tappitt know when know well enough that when man buy little bit of property about place show that mean to do something there if have twenty thousand pound 'd lose be very likely question be how must fare in mean time if have claim upon of course 'd let build what liked only laugh at then mr tappitt uttered exclamation pulling hat tighter on to head walked out of lawyer office returned to brewery dined at three o'clock at brewery during dinner on day father of family made very disagreeable scolded maid servant till poor girl did know spoon from fork abused cook performance till that valuable old retainer declared that if master got so rampageous might suit sooner better did care how soon 'd cooked victual for better must again snarled at daughter till perked up face came silently to mutual agreement that must not condescend to notice further while held on in present mood replied to wife

tobacco so do said tappitt turning round at sharply be best mixed bird eye a if must know difference indeed so do t know difference very well be poison to absolute poison a be very well aware filthy strong stuff that have taken to lately be enough to kill anybody have taken to filthy strong stuff said tappitt be beginning of evening conversation be inclined to think that mr tappitt have made calculation have concluded that must put forth coming observation more efficaciously by having husband in bad humour than must if succeeded in coaxing into good humour think that made above remark not solely because fume of tobacco be distasteful to because possession of grievance might give opportunity of commencing forthcoming debate with better amount of justified indignation on own side be not often that begrudged tappitt pipe made ill natured remark about gin water t said when tappitt have torn off coat in anger at allusion to filthy strong stuff t what do mean to do about lawsuit mean to do anything be nonsense t must do something know what doe mr honyman say honyman be fool nonsense t be not fool if be why have let manage affair so long believe be fool at believe know what be talking

severe heavy that poor mother hardly knew how to bear burden of fault a mr ray became more afraid of younger daughter became le afraid of elder be occasioned partly doubt by absence of mr prime from cottage when there only came a visitor visitor to house can hold such dominion there a may be held by domestic tyrant present at meal claiming ascendancy in conversation arose in part also from overwhelming solicitude filled mr ray heart from morning to night a watched poor rachel in misery bowel yearned towards child longed to give relief with excessive longing have man be very wolf indeed such be feeling at present think that must have welcomed to cottage in ordering repulse have done deed of have by mean anticipated consequence now repented in sackcloth ash of sorrow stricken spirit

beyond reach of preaching mr ray protested that rachel have be right throughout that have be wrong only when have opposed rachel wish such view of matter be altogether at variance with entertained by mr prime who be still of opinion that young people must be allowed to please who feared approach of lover who came with lute in hand with light soft loving worldly word men woman according to theory be right to marry have child thought that such marriage must be contracted not only in solemn spirit with certain dinginess of solemnity with painstaking absence of mirth must divest love of worldly alloy rachel have gone about business in different spirit may almost be said that mr prime rejoiced that have failed did not believe in broken heart did believe in efficacy of chastisement thought that on whole present state of affair must be beneficial to sister have be possessed of sufficient power must now on occasion have preached sermon again a have preached before mother passion have overcome be unable to express conviction hope that will be better soon said hope will said mr ray at moment rachel came down from own room joined in parlour came in with same look of sad composure on

find people drop into quick enough without in friendly way mr tappitt let caution not to let fine business be injured by young sharper mr tappitt found to be very kind very sensible too gave authority to sharpit on occasion to act for thought of resolving that must set shoulder firmly to wheel a soon a have carried through business of election even in matter of election everything did not go well with tappitt have appertaining to establishment certain foreman of name of wort heavy respectable useful man educated on establishment by bungall bequeathed by bungall to tappitt man by mean ambitious of good beer very ambitious of profit to firm servant indeed almost invaluable in such business tappitt have ever found deficient in that have certain objectionable pride in having be servant that a such thought absolved from necessity of subserviency to latter master once day indeed did touch cap when be done seemed to fancy that be almost equal to mr tappitt upon premise never shook in shoe if tappitt be angry affected to hasten step if tappitt be in hurry must even laugh at tappitt joke if a be too usual such joke be not mirth moving in intrinsic nature clearly be not at point good servant tappitt in hour of prosperity have ventured to think that brewery must go on without now since day in rowan treachery have first loomed upon tappitt have felt much inclined to fraternize on easier term with foreman wort when touched cap have be received with smile advice have be asked in flattering tone not demanded a belonging to establishment by right then tappitt began to talk of rowan to man to speak evil thing of a be natural expecting reciprocity of malignity from wort wort on such occasion have be ominously silent h m bea so zure o that wort have once said thus differing from master on fundamental point of tappitt strategy a opposed to rowan strategy ai said tappitt showing teeth 'd better go now look after men at cart wort have looked after men at cart have done so with

detained till nearly eleven o'clock at night be kind of work in one have to do a much after dinner a before said to wife when got back for matter of said think after dinner work be chief part of on day of election luke rowan be to be seen standing in high street talking to butler cornbury candidate rowan be not elector for cottage have not be in possession long enough to admit of obtaining from qualification to vote be declared friend of cornbury party mr butler cornbury have sent message to saying that hoped to see soon after election must be over on following day on next butler cornbury have come to in town though absent from baslehurst rowan have managed to declare opinion before time be suspected by many to have written article in baslehurst gazette advocated right of constituency to send jew to parliament if pleased proved at same time that constituency must be wrong to send jew to parliament that constituency of baslehurst must in present instance be specially wrong to send mr hart to parliament have always advocated said one of article right of absolute freedom of choice for borough county in land trust that day be far distant in elector of england will cease to look to nearest neighbour a best representative there be much in argument suited occasion added strength to rowan own cause in borough stanch protestant began to feel want of good beer question very ill natured a toward tappitt be asked in newspaper who owns spotted dog at busby porcorum who compels landlord to buy liquor at tappitt brewery there be score of question of same nature of tappitt attributed wrongly to luke rowan luke have written that article about freedom of election have not condescended to notice beer at spotted dog there be quarrel taking place in baslehurst on score of election between person with whom be connected in story mr prong have vote in borough be disposed to make use of mr prime regarding own position a mr prong affianced bride considered at liberty to question mr prong a to use proposed to make of vote to mr prime appeared that anything done in direction for benefit of jew be sin not to be forgiven to mr prong seemed to be a great sin not to do anything in power for hindrance vexation of with whom dr harford mr comfort be connected by tie of friendship mr prime who of two be more logical must not disjoin personal scriptural hatred also hated dr harford hated jew more be not disposed to support jew in baslehurst because mr comfort in doctrine have fallen away from purity of early promise idea be that just man good christian must not vote for of baslehurst candidate under present unhappy local circumstance under circumstance must christian vote for jew said in voice not so soft a must be voice of woman to betrothed dorothea said mr prong very solemnly be sitting at time in own little front parlour a to due arrangement of furniture in mr prime have already ventured to make slight alteration have not be received favourably by mr prong dorothea in matter must allow to be best judge voting for member of parliament be thing lady naturally be not called upon to understand lady can understand a well a gentleman said mr prime that curse have gone out from lord against people gentleman have more right than lady to go against will of lord be in vain that mr prong endeavoured to explain to that curse attached to people a nation did not necessarily follow unit of people who have adopted other nationality let unit become christian before go into parliament said mr prime wish must said mr prong heartily wish must mr hart if be returned will have prayer did not at suffice for mr prime who perhaps in matter of argument have best of told betrothed to face that be going to commit great sin that be tempted to sin by grievous worldly passion when so informed mr prong closed eye crossed hand meekly on breast shook head not from thee dorothea said not from thee must have come who be to speak out to if be not said mr prong sat in silence with closed eye again shook head perhaps have better part said mr prime after interval of five minute perhaps will be better for of mr prong however still shook head in silence be difficult for lady in mr prime position to read accurately meaning of such shaking under such circumstance mr prime be woman sufficiently versed in world business to be able to resolve that must have answer to question when required answer mr prong said remarked just now that perhaps have better part heard word said mr prong heard cruel word even then did not open eye remove hand from breast heard word heard other word still more cruel have better leave now may humble in prayer be very well mr prong be sure hope will situated a be of course must choose to have answer seems to that dislike that kind of interference regard a wife best privilege sweetest duty if be so will be better for to part a friend of course have accused of great sin said of great sin of great sin so in mind must be judge not lest ye be judged dorothea remember that doe mean mr prong that be not to have opinion that be not to warn be near when see walking in wrong path might a well say same to when dorothea be bounden duty be work be that to be appointed a minister if can not see difference have much mistaken character have much mistaken character do mean to say that nobody clergyman be to know what be right what be wrong must be nonsense mr prong be sorry to say anything to grieve mr prong be now shaking head again with eye most pertinaciously closed there be thing really one ca bear only shook head inward feeling be too many for so that must not at present moment bring to give reply to momentous proposition betrothed have made indeed have at moment fixed mind a to step duty wisdom combined must call upon to take in matter temper of lady be not certainly that have desired a admiring member of flock have taken ghostly counsel a infallible now seemed to a though most of word many of thought action be made subject by to bitter criticism in matter be inclined to rely much upon own strength must marry lady a be still minded to do for many reason must be to loving careful husband must also be lord master a be intended when marriage be made holy ordinance in respect did not doubt own power hard word must bear a thought after time control so thinking be not disposed to allow lady to recede from troth to simply because in anger expressed wish to do so therefore have wisely be silent have shaken head in reproach unfortunately term of compact have not be finally settled with reference to heading mr prime have promised to be wife have burdened promise with certain pecuniary condition be distasteful to be much opposed to absolute headship perfect mastery a thought must belong to husband a husband view on subject be very strong be by mean inclined to abate one jot of demand better remain single in work than accept name of husband without privilege have hoped that by mingled firmness gentle word might bring dorothea round to more womanly way of thinking have flattered that there be power of eloquence in must have prevailed over once twice thought that be on brink of success knew well that there be many point in favour woman who have spoken of herself be spoken of a being on point of marriage doe not like to recede dorothea though not specially womanly among woman be still woman moreover have law on side old law a coming from scripture must say that pecuniary arrangement a proposed by dorothea be sinful have said so a have then thought not without effect now retaliated upon with accusation of sin be manifestly in power to break away from on money detail seemed now to be wish to break away from preferred doing so on that other matter began to fear that must lose wife seeing that be resolved never to yield on money question did not choose to be entrapped into instant resignation of engagement by dorothea indignation on point of abstruse scripturo political morality dorothea have assumed indignation a cloak for pecuniary obstinacy might be that must yield must not surrender thus at sound of false summons so closed eye very pertinaciously shook head think upon whole said again that have better make up mind to part then stood up feeling that must thus employ greater power in forcing answer from must have seen motion through cranny of pertinaciously closed eye for noticed by rising from own chair with hand firmly fixed upon table still did not open eye unless might be to extent of small cranny good bye mr prong said then altered form of hand taking from table dashed together before face god bless dorothea said god bless god bless put out hand a though blessing in darkness perceiving inutility of endeavouring to shake hand with man who must open eye moved away from chair towards door purposely raising sound of motion with dress so that might know that be going in think took unnecessary precaution for cranny at corner of eye be still at disposal good bye mr prong said again a opened door for god bless dorothea said may god bless then without assistance at front door made way out into street a stepped along pavement formed resolve eloquence from mr prong must ever overcome that must remain widow for rest of day at twelve o'clock on morning of election mr hart be declared by own committee to be nine ahead be admitted to be six ahead by mr cornbury committee cornbury folk asserted confidently that in saw certain sign of success supporter be not men who must be whipped up to poll early in day whereas hart voter be more le under control have be driven up hurriedly to hustings so a to make early show of number mr hart be about everywhere speaking so be butler cornbury in matter of oratory be bound to acknowledge that jew have by much mastery over christian there be class of men rather more than class section of mankind to whom power of easy expression by mean of spoken word come naturally english country gentleman highly educated a be undaunted a usually be self confident a in truth be at bottom be clearly not in section perhaps be further removed from considering advantage have for such speaking than other class of men in england might almost say elsewhere fact for be fact that of greatest orator whom world have known have be found in class doe not in degree affect truth of proposition best grape in world be perhaps grown in england though england be not land of grape for same reason value of thing depends upon rarity value instigates effort for excellence power of vocal expression seems naturally to belong to american be to ordinary englishman very marvellous in talking man be little esteemed very wonderful power of delivery that of mr so so say englishman speaking of american guess think much of kind of

baslehurst last two three day daughter in law be somewhere with child will be here before dinner butler have that tailor fellow gone back to london yet butler told father that tailor have at least gone away from baslehurst then two younger men went out walked about ground till dinner time be mr butler cornbury who gave soul spirit to daily life at cornbury grange who found salt with bread be quickened wine with heart be made glad marvellous be power can be exercised almost unconsciously over company individual even upon crowd by one person gifted with good temper good digestion good intellect good look woman so endowed charm not only by exercise of own gift endows who be near with sudden conviction that be whose temper health talent appearance be doing so much for society mr butler cornbury be such woman a grange be popular house old squire be not found to be very dull young squire be thought to be rather clever air of house be lively bracing men woman did not find day

greeted a though be old friend conversation at moment of course have reference to election thanks be given congratulation received when old mr cornbury shook head daughter in law assured that there must be nothing to fear know what call nothing to fear dear call two thousand pound great deal to fear must wonder if hear word about said old man uttered long sigh seems to said that gentleman ought to stand for seat in parliament since people have be allowed to come up purity of election indeed make sick come along dear then gave arm to one of young lady toddled into dining room mr butler cornbury said nothing special to luke rowan on evening made hour very pleasant to half morbid idea a to social difference between host family soon vanished house be very comfortable girl be very pretty mr cornbury be very kind everything went very well on following morning be nearly ten when sat down to breakfast morning before lunch have passed away in idle chat before party bethought of what must do for day at last be agreed that must all stroll out through wood up to special reach of river there ran through ravine of rock called cornbury cleeves many in part declared that cornbury cleeves be prettiest spot in england be not prepared to bear testimony to truth of very wide assertion can only say that know prettier spot river here be rapid sparkling not rapid because driven into small compass for breadth be greater more regular in passage through cleeves than be either above below rapid from declivity of course on one side rock came sheer down to water on other there be strip of meadow rather grassy amphitheatre for wall of rock at back of be semi circular so a to enclose field on side there might be four five acre of green meadow here whole be so interspersed with old stunted oak tree thorn standing alone that space looked larger than be rock on side be covered here there with richest foliage spot might be taken to be valley from a from that of rasselas there be escape down close upon margin of water bathing house have be built from plunge must be taken into six seven foot of coolest darkest cleanest water that bather must desire in heart suppose never be here before said mr cornbury to rowan indeed have said always think grand thing that landed magnate ca keep delight to dare say have be here oftener than have during last three month be very likely seeing that be first visit summer have be here dozen time suppose will think be villanous trespasser when tell that have bathed in very house more than once then have done more than ever did yet have made thinking must do for lady water look so black ah like a long a be clear black like bathing where can see bright stone like jewel at bottom can never do in fresh water be only in nook of sea where there be sand when wind outside have died away when tide be quiet at full then one can drop gently in almost fancy that one belongs to sea a mermaid do wonder how idea of mermaid first came one saw crowd of young woman bathing then how came to have looking glass fish tail fish tail be taken a granted because be in sea looking glass because be woman said rowan one with a much reason a other by by mr rowan talking of woman fish tail looking glass other feminine attraction when did see miss ray last rowan paused before answered looking round perceived that have strayed with mr cornbury to furthest end of meadow away from companion immediately came across mind that be matter on mr cornbury wished to speak to by combative process almost resolved that must not be spoken to on matter when did see miss ray said repeating question two three day after mr tappitt party have not seen since why go see said mr cornbury now be asked in tone made necessary that must either answer question tell simply that must not answer questioner manner be so firm so eager so incisive that question must not be turned away be not sure that be prepared to tell said ah want to be prepared said rather perhaps to tell truth want to drive to answer without preparation be not true that made offer that accepted rowan thought moment then answered be true must not have asked question if have not positively known that such be case have never spoken word to about yet knew mother told father well a be so why do not go see be sure be not one of who must play such trick a upon girl with mere purpose of amusing upon girl must do so mr cornbury feel sure of therefore why do not go to walked along together for few minute under rock in silence then mr cornbury again repeated question why do not go to mr cornbury said must not be angry with if say that be matter at present moment be not willing to discus must be angry with if a rachel friend say something further about a wish to answer will ask other question at rate will be willing to listen to rachel have never spoken to on subject not word know from others who see daily that be very unhappy be grieved that must be so yes knew must be grieved how must be otherwise girl know mr rowan have not other thing to occupy mind a man have think of rachel ray that must have be a happy there at bragg end a day be long if offer of love have come in way be not girl whose head have be filled with romance who looked for such thing for very reason be le able to bear loss of when offer have come in way think perhaps hardly know depth of character strength of love think know that be constant then why do try so hardly mr cornbury have promised that must ask more question asking of question be easiest mode of saying that have to say rowan though have declared that must answer question must hardly avoid necessity of doing so may be that trial be other way know understand made write letter to be father doing will tell whole truth be father doing therefore be that think bound to speak to mother came to for advice have heard evil thing spoken of in baslehurst will see that be very frank with will take credit to myself too believed such tidings to be altogether false made inquiry proved be right father have given advice thought best know what rachel wrote to girl letter under such circumstance can hardly do more than express will of who guide be sad enough for to be forced to write letter will be sadder still if can not be brought to forgive then paused standing under gray rock looking up eagerly into face made answer gave sign heart be very tender at moment towards rachel there be that in of stubbornness of manhood must not let make sign of tenderness will not press to say anything mr rowan continued be much obliged to for having listened to have known rachel ray for many year must be excuse excuse be wanting said if say anything be not because be offended there be thing on man must not allow to speak without considering certainly come will go back to at bathing house will think have lost thus mr cornbury said word have desired to speak on rachel ray behalf when reached grange there be still two hour left before time of dressing for dinner must come during hour luke returned by to cleeves escaped from host retraced step on reaching river sat down on margin looked into cool dark running water have be severe to rachel must answer such question when asked by mr cornbury be very desirous of answering to woman at cottage have doubted mr ray daughter with perhaps that other daughter of whom have only heard have resolved that must see more hear of more till there must be further room for doubt then must show again at cottage again ask rachel to be wife there be manliness in there be also hardness in pride deserved rebuke mr cornbury word have conveyed to have be severe to rachel lying there with full length stretched upon grass acknowledged to that have thought more of own feeling than of hers while mr cornbury have be speaking must not bring to feel that be case now in solitude did acknowledge amount of sin have committed against that must be so punished by who loved took out letter from pocket found that word be loving though have not be allowed to put into that eager pressing speaking love have desired spoken ill of have said to a got up to walk back to grange well be natural too

during day two immediately subsequent to election mr tappitt found to be rather downhearted excitement of contest be over be no longer buoyed up by consoling almost triumphant assurance of success for against enemy rowan have be administered to by with whom have be acting on behalf of mr hart be alone thoughtful in counting house else subjected to pressure of wife argument in private dwelling have never yet be won over to say that must agree to proposition knew that must now form decision rowan must not even wait till lawsuit must be decided by legal mean if mr tappitt must not consent to one of three proposition made to rowan must at once commence building of new brewery be that sort of man said honyman that if put brick down nothing in world will prevent from going on of course wo said

clever un said postboy at last dinner be ready total number of party having now completed liberal elector of baslehurst prepared to enjoy bargain have be made on subject be understood by that must not be asked to pay for dinner sharpit must see to that must probably know how to put into little bill if failed in risk be own while body of liberal elector be peeping into stable drinking gin bitter mr sharpit mr tappitt be engaged in private conference if come to said sharpit of course must take up etiquette of profession allow to decline why must wish to decline said tappitt not altogether pleased by mr sharpit manner oh by mean be just sort of work like not much to be made by there be injury to be redressed justice to be done only see poor honyman have got much of practice left to want to take

anything about afterwards ah be wanted for chair mr tappitt will come sit alongside of if will allow dinner be decidedly bad company undoubtedly dull be inclined to think that individual there must have dined more comfortably at home horrid mess concocted of old gravy catsup bad wine be distributed under name of soup then there came upon table half huge hake very worst fish swim fish with devonshire be peculiarly invested hard dark brown mysterious ball be handed round on being opened with knife be found to contain sausage meat very greasy by mean cooked through even dura ilium of liberal elector of baslehurst declined to make acquaintance with dainty after came dinner consisting of piece of roast beef very raw leg of parboiled mutton absolutely blue in state of rawness when gory mess be seen displayed on first incision made into lump of meat vice president one two of friend spoke out aloud hard greasy sausage meat might have be right for anything knew to contrary soup have swallowed without complaint did know what must be state of joint of meat when brought to table therefore spoke out in anger tappitt said nothing be intended to be carried beyond waiter seeing that beer from own brewery be consumed in tap of dragon vice president be hardware dealer with whom dragon have small connection of trade sent terrible message down to landlady threatening with blue boar mitre even with nasty little pothouse chequer what be expects for three sixpence said landlady in wrath for must be understood that sharpit knew well that be dealing with one who understood value of money that did not feel quite sure of passing dinner in mr hart bill then came pie with crust inch thick nobody must eat cabinet pudding so called full of lump of suet venture to assert that liberal elector there must have got better dinner at home must have be served with greater comfort public dinner at inn be recognized relaxation of middle class englishman in province did not attend such banquet neighbour must conceive to be constrained by domestic tyranny others go to therefore go also be bored frightfully by speech to listens be driven to lowest depth of dismay by speech be called upon to make be thoroughly disgusted when be called on to make speech have point of sympathy with neighbour between whom sits wine be bad hot water be brought to cold seat be hard crowded attempt be made at pleasure of conversation be continually called upon to stand up that may pretend to drink toast in honour of person institution for care nothing for hero of evening a to whom be probably indifferent for church perhaps never enters army regard a hotbed of aristocratic insolence for queen whom revere love by reason of nature a englishman against whose fulsome praise a repeated to ad nauseam in chairman speech very soul unconsciously revolt be bore trouble ennui nastiness discomfort yet go again again because be relaxation natural to englishman frenchman who sits for three hour tilted on hind leg of little chair with back against window sill of cafe with first cup of coffee before then glass of sugar water be perhaps a much to be pitied a regard immediate misery liquid imbibes be not so injurious to mr tappitt with eleven other liberal elector of baslehurst went through ceremony of dinner in usual way drank health of queen of volunteer of county because there be present podgy little grocer who have enrolled in corp who be thus enabled to make speech then drank health of mr hart whose ultimate return for borough pledged to effect having done so much for business having thus brought to conclusion political work of evening adjourned meeting to cosy little parlour near bar then began to be happy few of number including angry vice president who sold hardware took home to wife mr tongs keep sharp enough by ear said sharpit winking to tappitt come along old fellow will get drop of something really hot tappitt winked back again shook head with affected laugh a did so thought of mr t at home terrible word have spoken to at same moment idea came across mr sharpit be very dangerous companion about dozen entered cosy little parlour there remained for couple of hour while sitting in cosy little parlour really did enjoy about nine o'clock have bit of raw beef broiled in guise be pleasant enough water be hot tobacco be grateful stiffness of evening be gone men chatted together made more speech talked of matter bore true interest to sharpit explained to how man might be assisted in own business if rich london tailor must be brought in for borough by degree came round to affair of brewery tappitt a brandy warmed spoke loudly against rowan by george said podgy grocer if anybody must offer thousand year to give up 'd take hopping then must said tappitt what be more wo brewing ai like other business there be more in than in most others of course there be said sharpit be like common trade be true too said podgy grocer man usually receives compensation for having gone through penance of chairman duty for remainder of evening be entitled to flattery of companion generally receives till become tipsy insubordinate tappitt have not character of intemperate man on occasion did exceed bound of becoming moderation room be hot tobacco smoke be thick wine have be bad brandy be strong sharpit too urged to new mixture stronger denunciation against rowan till at last at eleven o'clock when took to brewery be not in condition proper for father of such daughter for husband of such wife will see home said podgy grocer to mr sharpit tappitt with suspicious quickness of drunken man turned sharply upon podgy abashed grocer abused for insolence then made way out of inn yard along high street down brewery lane to own door knowing way a well a though have be sober passing over a quickly did fall even stumble though now again reeled slightly a went idea came strongly upon sharpit be dangerous man that perhaps at very moment tappitt be standing on brink of precipice then remembered that wife must surely be watching for a made first attempt to insert latch key into door heart became forgetful of brandy sank low within breast how affair went between mr tappitt on night will not attempt to describe that used power with generosity doubt that used with discretion be quite convinced on following morning at ten o'clock tappitt be still in bed note have be written by mr t to messrs sharpit longfite saying that projected visit have under altered circumstance become unnecessary that tappitt head be racked with pain stomach disturbed with sickness there can be doubt a little that mr t used consequent weakness of husband for purpose of feminine dominion did with discretion even with kindness only word two be said a to state in have returned home word two with simple object of putting dominion on firm basis after mr tappitt took condition a established fact administered to comfort of medicine chest teapot excused illness to girl a having be produced by fish never left bedside till have achieved purpose if ever man got tipsy to own advantage mr tappitt did so on occasion if ever man in condition be treated with forbearing kindness by wife mr tappitt be so treated then disturb t said there be nothing want doing in brewery if did what must signify in comparison with health brewery wo be much to now thank goodness be sure have have enough of thirty year of such work a must make man sick weak be sure wonder at being ill not least wonder be that have ever stood up against so long a have if will take advice will just turn round try to sleep for hour so tappitt took advice at rate so far that turned round closed eye up to time have not given way about brewery have uttered word of assent be gradually becoming aware that must have to yield before must be allowed to put on clothes now in base weak condition of head stomach yielding did not seem to to be so very bad thing after brewery be troublesome fight be harassing rowan be young strong mr sharpit be very dangerous rowan too have risen in estimation a in of others must not longer argue even to that stipulated income must not be paid did not sleep got into half drowsy state in men think of existing affair without power of active thought knew that ought to be in counting house at work half feared that world be falling away from because be not there be ashamed of sometimes almost entertained thought of rising up shaking off lethargy stomach be bad must not bring to move head be tormented pillow be soft therefore there lay wondered what be time of day did not think of looking at watch be under head heard wife step about room a shaded window from eye crept to door to give household order to one of girl outside did not speak to to did not speak to a long a lay there motionless when moved with small low groan merely offered beef tea be nearly six o'clock hour of dinner at brewery be long passed when mr tappitt sat down by bedside determined to reap fruit of victory have just raised in bed announced intention of getting up declaring a did so that must never again eat of accursed fish moment of renovation have come upon mr tappitt perceived that if escaped from now there might even yet be more trouble be only fish t said with somewhat of sternness in eye hardly drank anything said tappitt of course be there to see what took said be very bad when came home last night very bad indeed must have got in at door only for be nonsense be quite true be mercy t that of girl saw only think there will be nothing more of kind be sure when be out of horrid place must have happened now only for trouble to tappitt made answer grunted again said that thought must get up of course be settled now t that be to leave place know that at then t ought to know come now just look at common sense of thing if give up brewery what be to do there be decent respectable person in town in favour of staying here only that rascal sharpit desired morning to write tell 'd have nothing more to do with so did tappitt have not seen wife letter to lawyer have not asked to see now became aware that only possible supporter might probably have be driven away from sharpit too though dangerous a enemy be ten time more dangerous a friend of course will take young man offer will sit down write line to honyman tell to come in morning tappitt groaned again again said that must get up mr t must not let out of bed till have assented to proposition that honyman must be again invited to brewery knew well that battle be gone from have in truth known through half comatose hour of bedridden day man nation when yielding must still resist even in yielding tappitt fumed fussed under clothes protesting that sending for honyman must be useless letter be written in name sent with knowledge be perfectly understood that invitation to honyman unconditional surrender on part of mr tappitt one word mr t said a allowed husband to escape from prison amidst blanket one word by to mark that thing be done one word only suppose need leave house for about month so because must be inconvenient about furniture who be to turn out if stay for six month said tappitt thing be marked enough then mr tappitt retired in muffled triumph retired when have made thing easy for simplest ceremony of dressing just sponge face dear said put on dressing gown come down for hour so be right now said tappitt oh quite so must go to trouble of much dressing then left descended stair entered parlour among daughter when there must not abstain from one blast of trumpet of triumph well girl said be settled will be in torquay now before winter said augusta will be great change said martha in torquay before winter said cherry oh mamma how clever have be now papa be coming down must thank for what be doing for be for sake that be doing mr tappitt crept into room when have taken seat in accustomed arm chair girl went up to kissed then thanked for proposed kindness in taking out of brewery oh papa be so jolly said cherry mr tappitt did not say much in answer to luckily there be necessity that must say anything be occasion on silence be understood a giving perfect consent chapter xiii what took place at bragg end farm when mr tappitt have settled within own mind that brewery must be abandoned to rowan be by mean therefore ready to assent that rachel ray must become mistress of brewery house never have exclaimed when cherry have suggested result never augusta have echoed protestation never never will not say that must have allowed husband to remain in business in order that might thus exclude rachel from such promotion must not bring to believe that luke rowan must be so fatuous so ignorant of own interest so deluded a to marry girl from bragg end be thus that mr tappitts of world regard other woman daughter when have undergone disappointment a to own have reason for wishing well to rowan must not have cared if have taken to bosom harpy in marriage must not endure to hear of success of girl whose attraction have foiled own little plan believe that man can ever be such fool a said again to augusta when on evening of day following tappitt abdication rumour reached brewery luke rowan have be seen walking out upon cawston road mr honyman in accordance with instruction called at brewery on morning be received by mr tappitt with sullen almost savage submission mr t have endeavoured to catch first in have failed did however manage to see attorney a came out from husband be settled said honyman will see rowan before hour be over be sure be great blessing mr honyman said lady not on occasion assuming of glory to herself be only thing for said mr honyman be if did like to take young man in a acting partner must have done at said mr t then lawyer went way in mean time tappitt sat sullen wretched in counting house such moment occur in life of most of moment in real work of life be brought to end can not be sad be very well to talk of ease dignity ease of spirit come from action only world dignity be given to who do world work let man put neck from out of collar till in truth can no longer draw weight attached to tappitt have now got rid of collar sat very wretched in brewery counting house be to go sir tappitt in meditation be interrupted by word spoken not in rough voice looking up saw wort standing in counting house before wort have voted for butler cornbury whereas have voted for mr hart mr hart must have be returned upon wort a rebellious subject have received notice to quit premise now time be out came to ask whether be to leave scene of forty year of work what must be use of sending wort away even if wish to punish contumacy still remained in week wort must be brought back again in triumph must tread brewery floor with step almost of master while tappitt must tread only a stranger if be allowed to tread at can stay if like said tappitt hardly looking up at man know be going mr tappitt said man hear be going very handsome like gentlefolk such a yeu need go on working allays like uz if so be yeu be going mr tappitt hope yeu will part friendly have be together sight o ' year too great sight for uz to part unfriendly mr tappitt admitted argument shook hand with man then of course took into immediate confidence with more warmth than must have done have there be quarrel between think found comfort in walked about premise with wort telling much that be true few thing be not strictly accurate for instance said that have made up mind to leave place whereas action of decisive resolution call making up mind have perhaps be done by mr tappitt rather than by wort took assertion with air of absolute belief comforted brewer wort be very wise in discretion on day threw much oil on troubled water so tappitt when left bade god bless expressed hope that old place might still thrive for sake for your'n too master said wort for yeu will allays have best egg still young master will only be working for yeu there be comfort in thought tappitt when went into dinner be able to carry like man tidings have reached mr tappitt a to rowan having be seen on evening walking on cawston road with face towards bragg end be true on morning mr honyman have come to career in life be at once settled for mr tappitt be quite in time mr honyman have said must not have be in time day week unless have consented to pay for what work have be already done for have determined to begin at once truth be mr rowan step into uncommon good thing mr tappitt be tired of work glad to give up thus matter be arranged between before nightfall everybody in baslehurst knew that tappitt rowan have come to term tappitt be to retire upon pension there be little discrepancy a to amount of tappitt annuity liberal faction asserting that be to receive two thousand year of other side cutting down to two hundred on evening of day in cool of evening luke rowan sauntered down high street of baslehurst crossed over cawston bridge on bridge be alone stood there for moment two leaning upon parapet looking down upon little stream beneath arch during day many thing have occupied have hardly a yet made up mind definitely a to what must do what must say during hour of evening from moment in honyman have announced to tappitt intended resignation became aware that certainly must go out to bragg end before day be over have be with settled thing thing settled almost without thought ever since receipt of rachel letter that must take walk to bragg end when must have put affair at baslehurst on stable footing that must not take walk before have so done say rachel have written in letter say that a business here about brewery be so very unsettled think probable that will not have to come back to baslehurst more in have be offence have doubted stability beyond have almost doubted honesty must punish by taking at word till must be put beyond question knew well that punishment must fall on rachel whereas none of sin must have be rachel sin must not allow to be deterred by consideration be letter said to in way will answer when do go there again will understand better have be too matter of pride to that mr comfort mr butler cornbury must thus be made to understand must say nothing of own purpose to of must speak of own mean own stedfastness must prove to that be stedfast that have boasted of nothing did not posse when mr butler cornbury have spoken to down by cleeves asking of purpose struggling to do kind thing by rachel have resolved at once that must tell nothing must find out liked for loving rachel to even to rachel must say more till must show that business about brewery be no longer unsettled up to moment moment in be standing on bridge have not determined what must say to rachel to rachel mother have never relaxed in purpose of making rachel wife since first visit to cottage be one who having fixed resolve feel certain of ultimate success in achieving be now going to bragg end to claim that regarded a own have not a yet told in what term must put forward claim so stood upon bridge thinking stood upon bridge thinking thought must only go backwards must hing for a to future conduct remembered first walk with churchyard elm with setting sun hot dance in mr tappitt house remembered without much of triumph of successful lover have be very sweet very easy in so saying to by mean threw blame upon rachel thing be easy thought be almost pity that must be so a for rachel nothing must have be more honest more to taste than mode of learning to love girl who while intending to accept must yet have feigned indifference must have disgusted at once nevertheless must not wish that there have be castle for to storm in career tappitt have made poor pretence of fighting before surrendered a to rachel have not be in rachel nature to make pretence passed from bridge at last without determining what must say when reached cottage did not pas on till have be seen by scrutinizing eye of miss pucker if there ai young rowan going out to bragg end again said to herself comforting fear striving to comfort with inward assertion that be not going there for good striving to comfort not effectually for though assertion be made by to yet be not believed though declared with well pronounced mental word luke rowan be going on path for good purpose felt wretched conviction at heart core that rachel ray must be made to triumph over early suspicion by happy marriage nevertheless carried tidings up into baslehurst a repeated to grocer daughter baker wife shook head with a much apparent satisfaction a though really believed that rachel oscillated between ruined name broken heart walked on very slowly towards bragg end a though almost dreaded

torture of waking thought why need sleep now that thought be new pleasure there be moment that have ever passed with have not to be recalled there be word of have not to be re weighed remembered fancied that remembered idea of man when eye first fell upon outside form must have sworn that first glance of have conveyed to far more than have ever come to from many day casual looking at other man must almost believe that have be specially made destined for behoof blushed even while lying in bed a remembered how gait of man tone of voice have taken possession of eye ear from first day on

be weak fool in thus attempting to deceive that have loved from first at rate from that evening when have told her of beauty of cloud that from day to present hour there have be no other chance of happiness to chance have now be so wondrously decided in favour when came down to breakfast on next morning be very quiet so quiet that sister almost thought be frightened at future prospect think

with young man of whom sister have before be speaking with so much horror now be there on purpose to take with went forth with leaning lovingly on arm while yet close under sister eye think there must have be gleam of triumph in face a put hand with such confidence well round lover arm girl do triumph in lover in acknowledged permitted lover a young men triumph in love be not acknowledged perhaps permitted man triumph be for most part over when be once allowed to take place at family table a right next to betrothed begin to feel to be sacrificial victim done up very prettily with blue white ribbon round horn still ox prepared for sacrifice girl feel to be exalted for few week a conqueror to be carried along in ovation of bucolic victim tied round with blue ribbon on to horn be chief grace ornament in mood doubt rachel luke rowan went forth leaving two widow together in cottage be pretty to see so happy be now said mr ray question for moment made mr prime uncomfortable almost wretched gave opportunity in heart desired of recanting error in regard to luke rowan character wished to give in adhesion to marriage to be known to have acknowledged fitness so that must with true word of sisterly love wish sister well in rachel presence must not have first made recantation though rachel spoke triumph there be triumph in eye prevented almost possibility of such yielding on part of dorothea when thing must have be once done when must once have owned that rachel be not wrong then gradually must bring round to utterance of kindly expression pretty said yes be pretty know that anybody ever doubted prettiness be nice too dear girl doe make so happy to see light hearted again have have sad time of dorothea since made write letter to very sad time of people here mother do mostly have what call sad time of be not taught that be better for that must be so have not mother have sad time of must be sad enough if be to be end of yes just so of course know ca be wrong that

doubt about mind send cake dear by by will come see at old place be better friend than ever be chapter xv conclusion early in november mr tappitt officially announced intention of abdicating necessary form deed parchment obligation be drawn out signed sealed for giving up of brewery to luke rowan mr honyman clerk revelled in thinly covered folio sheet to great comfort profit of master while mr sharpit went about baslehurst declaring that tappitt be egregious as hinting that rowan be little better than clever swindler what said however have little effect on baslehurst have become generally understood that rowan must spend money in town employing labour struggling to go ahead baslehurst knew man be desirable a citizen parchment be prepared signature be written with necessary amount of witnessing tappitt rowan once more met other on friendly term tappitt have endeavoured to avoid pleading to honyman to wife that personal dislike to young man be a great a ever have not permitted thus to indulge wrath mr honyman pointed out to mr tappitt that such ill humour might be very detrimental to future interest tappitt have be made to give way may a well declare at once that day of tappitt domestic dominion be over a be generally case with man who retires from work allows to be placed a piece of venerable furniture in chimney corner hitherto only have known what fund must be made available out of brewery for household purpose mr tappitt have be subject at turn of life to provoking intimation of reduced profit now there be clear thousand year must demand right in accordance with sum tappitt too must never again stray away from home with mysterious hint that matter connected with malt hop must be discussed at place in beer be consumed have no longer left to excuse for deviating from regular course of life even by hair breadth before two year be over have learned to regard almost a favour to be allowed to take walk with one of own girl man must abdicate unless indeed doe so for soul advantage a to happiness in life be hardly compatible with diminished respect ever attends relinquishing of labour otium cum dignitate be dream there be such position at rate for man who have once worked may have ease may have dignity can hardly combine two truth unfortunate tappitt learned before have be three month settled in torquay villa be called upon to meet rowan on friendly term obeyed friendship be not very cordial such a be served purpose meeting took place in dining room of brewery mr tappitt be present on occasion lady received visitor with little affectation of grandeur while t standing with hand in pocket on own rug looked like whipped hound right hand be soon forced to bring forth a rowan demanded that might shake be very glad that affair have be settled between amicably said luke while still held hand of abdicating brewer yes well suppose be for best said tappitt bringing out word uncomfortably with hesitation take care mind what be about suppose will have to come back again there will be fear of think said rowan hope not said mr tappitt with tone showed that be much better able to master occasion than husband hope not be great undertaking for so young man trust feel responsibility must be disagreeable to of course to have to return to brewery after having settled pleasantly at torquay will have to do so if thing go wrong with be frightened mr tappitt will never have to come back here hope not be always well to be on one guard be sure must be aware that mr tappitt have behaved to very generously if have high principle for be willing to give credit ought to posse for management of such undertaking a brewery will be careful that daughter sha be put to inconvenience by delay in paying up income regularly be afraid about mr tappitt into bank on quarter day if please mr rowan short account make long friend a mr t wo want to be troubled with letter such like can send line to montpellier villa torquay just to say that be done oh will see to said tappitt dear a mr rowan be so young for business there will be nothing like getting to write letter saying that money be paid will keep up to mark like be sure sha mind trouble be alarmed about money mr tappitt said rowan laughing in order that may know how old shop be going on will always send at christmas sixteen gallon of best stuff be brewing will be very proper little attention mr rowan will be happy to drink success to establishment here be cake wine on table perhaps will do favour to take glass so a to bury past unkindness t love will pour out wine

much heartiness a nature of entertainment admitted be not a yet full four month since rowan have filled rachel glass with champagne in same room then have made quite at home in house a member of mr tappitt family now be going to be at home there a master of establishment a put down glass must not help looking round room suggesting to change must make a seen at present parlour of brewery be certainly dull room be very long since wainscoting have be painted longer since curtain carpet have be renewed be dark dingy then so be tappitts before rachel must be brought there must make place a bright a herself said to word about marriage a for tappitt said few word about anything mr tappitt with wish to be gracious must not bring to mention rachel ray even between daughter there be longer utterance of rachel name have once declared to augusta with irrepressible energy that man be greater fool than have ever believed possible after that have be felt that calamity must be best endured in silence when interview in dining room be over rowan saw more of mr tappitt business made needful that must be daily about brewery there occasionally met poor departing man wandering among vat empty cask like brewer ghost there be word spoken between a to business account key implement be handed over through wort rowan found in possession of whole establishment with more trouble than must have be necessary in settling in new lodging promise have half made of sending bridecake to mr sturt before christmas be not kept be broken only by little be married early in january in december mr rowan came back to baslehurst became guest of son who be then keeping bachelor house at brewery lady first visit to cottage after return be affair of great moment to rachel everything now have gone well with except question of mother in law lover have come back to better lover than ever mother petted to heart content speaking of luke a though have never suspected of lupine propensity mr comfort talked to of coming marriage a though have acted with great sagacity through whole affair addressing in tone indicating much respect differing greatly from that in have be wont to catechise when be nothing more than mr ray girl at bragg end even dolly have sent in adhesion with more le cordiality still have feared mr rowan enmity when luke told that mother be coming to baslehurst for christmas so that might also be present at marriage rachel felt that there be still cloud in heaven know mother wo like said to luke made up mind not to like when be here before luke assured that did not understand mother character asserting that mother must certainly like woman that might choose for wife a soon a must have be made to understand that choice be irrevocable rachel remembered too well report a to former visit to cottage mr rowan have made together with mr tappitt when heard that luke mother be again in parlour went down from bedroom with hesitating step uneasy heart mr rowan be seated in room with mother sister when entered therefore first word of interview have be already spoken to mr ray prospect of visit have not be pleasant for also remembered how grand distant lady have be when came to cottage on former occasion rachel observed a entered room that mother face did not wear that look of dismay be usual to when be in presence be disagreeable to dear child said mr rowan rising from seat opening arm for embrace rachel underwent embrace kissed lady by whom found to be thus enveloped kissed mr rowan must not for life of think of word to speak must be fitting for occasion own dear child said mr rowan again for know that be to be child now a well a own mamma be very kind of to say so said mr ray very kind indeed said mr prime be sure that will find rachel dutiful a daughter rachel did not feel disposed to give positive assurance on point intended to be dutiful to husband be inclined to think obedience in direction be quite enough for married woman now that luke be going to settle for life continued mr rowan be so very desirable that must be married at once think so mr ray indeed yes mr rowan always like to hear of young men getting married be when have got anything to live upon make le harum scarum like think luke be ever what call harum scarum said mr rowan mother did mean to say be said mr prime marriage certainly doe steady young man generally make much more constant at divine service luke always did go to church very regularly said mr rowan like to see young men in church said mr ray a for girl go a matter of course young men be allowed so much of own way when man be father of family becomes very different hereupon rachel blushed then be kissed again by luke mother be made subject of certain very interesting prophecy embarrassed considerably need not be repeated here after interview be never again afraid of mother in law will love mamma when know said mary rowan to rachel day two afterwards stranger acquaintance generally think that be very tremendous personage always doe what be asked by who belong to a for luke be almost slave to wo say that rachel resolved that mr rowan must be slave to also did resolve that must not be slave to mr rowan intended henceforward to serve one person one person only mr butler cornbury also called at cottage visit be very delightful to rachel not le so perhaps because mr prime be away at dorcas meeting have be at cottage pleasant allusion to transaction at ball must hardly have be made tell said mr cornbury do think must see how be going to be with eye told walter very night that be goose to suppose that must go down to supper with mr cornbury really intended only have dance be obliged to stand up with mr rowan because be engaged to doubt be engaged to dear only for dance mean only for dance of course now be engaged to for something else tell that knew be going to be so be very pretty very pleasant when mr cornbury a went away made special request that might be invited to wedding
