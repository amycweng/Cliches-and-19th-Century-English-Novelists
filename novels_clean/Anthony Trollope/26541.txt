restored cromwell have come gone have not disturbed at bullhampton at bullhampton there be public building except church indeed be very handsome edifice with magnificent tower thing to go to see almost a worthy of visit a neighbour cathedral at body of church be somewhat low yellow gray colour be perfect there be moreover norman door there be early english window in aisle perfection of perpendicular architecture in chancel of must bring many visitor to bullhampton there be brass in nave very curious one two tomb of gilmore family very rare in construction churchyard be large green

gilmore character must be made to develope in page if such developing may be accomplished be to be hero at least one of two author will not in early word declare that squire will be favourite hero a will wish that reader must form own opinion on matter at period be man somewhat over thirty perhaps thirty three year of age who have done fairly well at harrow at oxford have never done enough to make friend regard a swan still read good deal shot fished more than read have become since residence at privet very fond of outside of book nevertheless went on buying book be rather proud of library have travelled good deal be politician somewhat scandalising own tenant other bullhamptonites by voting for liberal candidate for division of county marquis of trowbridge did not know regarded a objectionable person who did not understand nature of duty devolved upon a country gentleman marquis be always spoken of by mr gilmore a idiot on various ground squire have hitherto regarded a being little in advance of other squire have perhaps given more credit than have deserved for intellectuality be man with good heart pure mind generous desirous of being just somewhat sparing of be own never desirous of be be good looking though perhaps somewhat ordinary in appearance tall strong with dark brown hair dark brown whisker with small quick grey eye teeth be almost too white too perfect for man perhaps be greatest fault that think that a liberal politician a english country gentleman have combined in own position be most desirable upon earth to have acre without acre laden brain be think everything now may be a well told at once mr gilmore be over head ear in love with young lady to whom have offered hand can be made to appertain to future mistress of hampton privet lady be one who have nothing to give in return hand heart neighbour round country have be saying for last five year harry gilmore be looking out for heiress for have always be told of harry especially among who have opposed in politics that have keen eye for main chance mary lowther have not never can have penny with to make up for deficiency in own personal attribute mary be lady harry gilmore think sweetest woman on whom eye ever rested whatever resolution a to fortune hunting may have made though probably none be ever made have now gone to wind be so absolutely in love that nothing in world be to at present worth thinking about except mary doubt that must vote for conservative candidate if mary lowther so ordered consent to go live in new york if mary lowther must accept on other condition bullhampton parish be nothing to at present moment except a far a be connected with mary lowther hampton privet be dear to only a far a can be made to look attractive in eye of mary mill be to be repaired though know will never get interest on outlay because mary lowther have said that bullhampton water mead must be destroyed if mill be to tumble down have drawn for mental picture of mary lowther till have invested with charm grace virtue can adorn woman in very truth belief to be perfect be actually absolutely in love mary lowther have hitherto neither accepted rejected in very few line further on will tell how matter stand between have already be told that rev frank fenwick be vicar of bullhampton perhaps be somewhat guided in taking of living by fact that harry gilmore squire of parish have be very intimate friend at oxford fenwick at period with be about to begin story have be six year at bullhampton have be married about five half of something have already be said perhaps may be only necessary further to state that be tall fair haired man already becoming somewhat bald on top of head with bright eye slightest possible amount of whisker look about nose mouth seems to imply that must be severe if be not so thoroughly good humoured have more of breeding in appearance than friend show of higher blood though whence come such show how one discerns that appearance few of can tell be man who read more thought more than harry gilmore though given much to athletics very fond of field sport will only further be said of frank fenwick that esteemed churchwarden bishop be afraid of wife have be miss balfour from loring in gloucestershire have have considerable fortune be now mother of four child a fenwick used to say might have fourteen for anything knew a also have possessed small mean of own there be poverty prospect of poverty at vicarage baby be made welcome a came mr fenwick be a good specimen of english country parson wife a will meet in county gay good looking fond of society around with little dash of fun knowing in blanket corduroy coal tea knowing also a to beer gin tobacco acquainted with man woman in parish thinking husband to be quite a good a squire in regard to position to be infinitely superior to squire other man in world in regard to personal self handsome pleasant well dressed lady who have nonsense about such one be be mr fenwick now balfour be considerable people at loring though property be not county property be always considered that janet balfour might have done better than did in worldly point of view of however little have be said at loring because soon became known there that husband stood rather well in country round about bullhampton when asked mary lowther to come stay with for six month mary lowther aunt miss marrable have nothing to say against arrangement although be most particular old lady always remembered that mary lowther be third fourth cousin to earl in scotland nothing more will be said of miss marrable at present a be expedient for sake of story that reader must fix attention on bullhampton till find quite at home there must wish to know way among water mead to be quite alive to fact that lodge of hampton privet be mile quarter to north of bullhampton church mile across field west from brattle mill that mr fenwick parsonage adjoins churchyard being thus little farther from hampton privet than church that there commences bullhampton street with inn trowbridge arm four public house three baker two butcher bound of parsonage run down to river so that vicar can catch trout from own bank though much prefers to catch at distance admit of appurtenance of sport now there must be one word of mary lowther then story will be commenced have come to vicarage in may intending to stay month be now august have be already three month with friend everybody said that be staying because intended to become mistress of hampton privet be month since harry gilmore have formally made offer a have not refused a still stayed on folk of bullhampton be justified in conclusion be tall girl with dark brown hair wore fastened in knot at back of head after simplest fashion eye be large grey full of lustre be not eye must make say that mary lowther be especially bright eyed girl be eye however must make think when looked at that if mary lowther must only like how happy lot must be that if must love world must have nothing higher better to offer if judged face by rule of beauty must say that be too thin feeling influence with sympathy must never wish to be changed nose mouth be perfect how many little nose there be on young woman face of can not be said to be thing of beauty joy for ever although do very well in place there be softness colour of youth perhaps dash of fun eye above be bright lip below alluring in midst of such sweet charm what doe matter that nose be puggish even nose of putty such a think might improve in original material by squeeze of thumb forefinger with mary lowther nose be feature of exquisite beauty feature must be eloquent with pity reverence scorn curve of nostril with almost transparent membrane told of working of mind within a portion of human face must tell in degree mouth be equally expressive though lip be thin be mouth to watch listen to read with curious interest rather than mouth to kiss not that desire to kiss must come when there might be hope to kiss with favour be lip man must think to ravage in boisterous play might have be said that there be want of capability for passion in face have not be for well marked dimple in little chin that soft couch in one may be always sure when one see that little imp of love lie hidden have already be said that mary lowther be tall taller than common back be a lovely form of womanhood a man eye ever measured appreciated movement be never naturally quick have grace about touched men woman alike be very poetry of motion chief beauty consisted in that be what be by effort of own have seen effort may be that many of have liked when have be made on own behalf man a yet must ever have felt to be so far flattered by miss lowther dress be very plain a became that must be for be living on kindness of aunt who be not rich woman may be doubted whether dress must have added much to charm be now turned one twenty though doubtless there be young men at loring who have sighed for smile young man have sighed with efficacy must be acknowledged indeed that be not girl for whom most susceptible of young men must sigh young men given to sigh be generally attracted by outward visible sign of softness may be taken a indication that sighing will produce result however small at loring be said that mary lowther be cold repellent on account one who might very probably descend to shade a old maid in spite of beauty of be acknowledged possessor enemy friend have ever accused her of being flirt such a be harry gilmore passion for much astonished friend who knew best have thought that a regarded fate matrimonial non matrimonial there be three chance before might carry out presumed intention of marrying money might become sudden spoil of bow spear of red cheeked lass might walk on a old bachelor too cautious to be caught at none believed that must become victim of grand passion for poor reticent high bred high minded specimen of womanhood such however be now condition have uncle clergyman living at salisbury prebendary there who be man of world in whom harry trusted more than in other member of own family mother have be sister of rev henry fitzackerly chamberlaine a mr chamberlaine have never married much of solicitude be bestowed upon nephew dear fellow have be prebendary advice when be taken over to see miss lowther be lady doubt must never be own master must be poor man till died easy temper little money be almost a common in rank of life a destitution obstinacy on day after advice be given harry gilmore made formal offer chapter ii flo red ball must give answer dear one way other wise word be spoken by mr fenwick to friend a sat together with work in hand on garden seat under cedar tree be august evening after dinner vicar be out about parish two elder child be playing in garden two young woman be alone together illustration must give answer dear one way other of course will give answer what answer doe wish know what answer wish if man be ever in earnest be be not doing best can for then in waiting to see whether can say yes can not be well for to be in suspense on matter dear mary can not be well for one always feel that when girl bid man to wait will take after while always come to that if have be at home at loring time must not have be much being so near to seeing day must be bad must be in state of fever then will go back to loring not now till have positively made up mind given answer one way other must not go now leave in doubt take at once have done with be a good a gold in answer to mary for while said nothing went sedulously on with work mamma said little girl running up followed by nursery maid ball in water child be beautiful fair haired little darling about four half year old boy year younger little shorter little stouter be toddling after ball in water flo ca jim get out jim gone mamma then jane nursery maid proceeded to explain that ball have rolled in have be carried down stream to bush that be caught there just out of reach of that jane must do with long stick for recovery jim gardener be not to be found be in despair lest ball must become wet through must perish mary at once saw opportunity of escape opportunity for five minute of thought by needed will come flo see what can be done said mary do 'cause be so big said little girl will see if long arm wo do a well a jim said mary only jim must go in perhaps certainly will not do then took flo by hand together ran down to margin of river there lay treasure huge red inflated ball just stopped in downward current by short projecting stick jim must have got certainly because must have suspended over stream from bough must have dislodged ball have floated on to bank lean over mary great deal will hold said flo to whom ball be at moment worth effort mary did lean over poked at at last thought that must trust to bough a jim must have done became more more venturous at last touched ball then at last fell into river immediately there be scream roar splashing about of skirt petticoat by time mr fenwick be on bank mary lowther have extricated have triumphantly brought out flo treasure with mary be hurt said friend what must hurt oh dear oh dear never fell into river before darling flo be unhappy be such good fun only must fall in till be a big a be flo be in agony of tear not deigning to look at rescued ball mean that head have be under said mr fenwick face be felt so odd for about moment have sound of ophelia in ear then be laughing at for being such goose 'd better come up go to bed dear will get something warm wo go to bed wo have anything warm will change clothes what adventure what will mr fenwick say what will mr gilmore say to mary lowther made answer went straight up to house into room changed clothes while be there fenwick gilmore appeared at open window of drawing room in mr fenwick be sitting have known well enough that harry gilmore must not let evening pas without coming to vicarage at one time have hoped to persuade mary lowther to give verdict on very day husband be painfully anxious that harry might succeed fenwick have loved man dearly for many year janet fenwick have loved since have known a husband friend felt that be showing more of manhood than have expected from in persistency of love that deserved reward believed also that for mary herself must be prosperous happy marriage then where be married woman who doe not wish that maiden friend who come to stay with must find husband in house parson wife be altogether of one mind in matter thought that mary lowther ought to be made to give to harry gilmore what do think have happened said mr fenwick coming to window opened down to ground mary lowther have fallen into river fallen where shouted gilmore putting up hand seeming to prepare to rush away among river god in search of love be alarmed mr gilmore be upstairs quite safe only have have ducking then circumstance be explained papa declared magisterially that flo must not play more with ball near river order to be not probable that much close attention must ever be paid suppose miss lowther will have gone to bed said gilmore on contrary expect moment suggested bed warm drink cossetting must have none of scrambled out all by herself seemed to think very good fun come in at rate have tea said vicar if start before eleven will walk way back with in mean time in spite of accident mary have gained opportunity that have required point for self meditation be not so much whether must must not accept mr gilmore now a other point be be not wrong to keep in suspense knew very well that must not accept now seemed to that girl must know man very thoroughly before must be justified in trusting altogether to hand thought that knowledge of mr gilmore be insufficient might however be case that in such circumstance duty required to give at once unhesitating answer did not find to be bit nearer to knowing to loving than be month since friend janet have complained again again of suspense to be subjecting man knew on other hand that friend janet did in intense anxiety to promote match be wrong to say to man will wait try friend told that to say that must wait try be in truth to say that must take at future time that girl who said so have almost committed to such decision that very fact that be waiting trying to love man ought to bind to man at last such certainly have not be own idea a far a must at present look into own future feeling did not think that must ever bring to say that must be man wife there be solemnity about position have never come fully home to before have be thus placed everybody around told that man happiness be really bound up in reply if be so in truth believed that be so be not bound to give chance in power yet because still doubted be told by friend that be behaving badly must believe friend must confess fault must tell lover in what most respectful word of denial must mould that must not be wife for personally there must be sorrow in regret ducking have given time for thought then having so decided went downstairs be met of course with various inquiry about bath mr gilmore be pity a though accident be most serious thing in world mr fenwick be mirth a though there have never be better joke mr fenwick who be perhaps unwise in impatience be specially anxious that two guest might be left together did not believe that mary lowther must ever say final yet thought also that if be so time have quite come in mary lowther ought to say final yes let go down look at spot said after tea so went down be beautiful august night there be moon twilight be over still be not absolutely dark air be a soft a mother kiss to sleeping child walked down together four abreast across lawn thence reached certain green orchard path led down to river mr fenwick purposely went on with lover leaving mary with husband in order that there might be appearance of scheme must return with husband then there might be ramble among path question must be pressed thing might be settled saw through gloom spot where mary have scrambled water have then be bright smiling be now black awful to think that must have be in there said harry gilmore shuddering to think that must ever have got out again said parson look frightful in dark said mr fenwick come away frank make sick charming schemer took husband arm continued round of garden have be talking to think must take if must ask now other pair of course followed mary mind be so fully made up at moment that almost wished that companion might ask question have be told that be misusing must misuse no longer have firm a be within grasp resolution that must not be driven from walked on beside talking of water of danger of chance of cold got nearer to subject than to bid think what suffering must have caused have failed to extricate from pool also have made up mind something have be said by of certain day when last have pleaded cause day must not come round till morrow considered pledged to restrain till then on morrow must come to there be little gate led from parsonage garden through churchyard to field path by be nearest way to hampton privet will leave here said because want to make fenwick come out again to night wo mind going up through garden alone oh dear miss lowther pray pray take care of hardly think ought to have be out again to night be nothing mr gilmore make infinitely too much of how can make too much of anything regard will be at home to morrow yes fancy so do remain at home intend to come down after lunch do remain at home held by hand a spoke to promised that must obey clearly be entitled to obedience on point then slowly made way round garden entered house at front door quarter of hour after others why must refuse be that wanted in world liked manner character way mode of life after fashion liked person if there be more of love in world than did not think that must ever come in way up to time of life have never felt such feeling if not for own sake why must not do for why must not be made happy have risked plunge in water to get flo ball liked better than liked flo seemed that mind have be altogether changed by stroll through dark alley well said janet how be to be be to come to morrow know how will be said turning away to own room chapter iii sam brattle be about eleven o'clock when gilmore passed through wicket leading from vicarage garden to churchyard path be about to take crossed simply corner of church precinct a came at once upon public footway leading from field through churchyard to town there be of course stopping public path fenwick have be often advised to keep lock on own gate a otherwise almost seemed that vicarage garden be open to bullhampton lock have never be put on gate be way by family went to church parson be accustomed to say that however many key there might be provided knew that there must never be one in pocket when wanted be wont to add when wife must tease on subject that who desired to come in decently be welcome that who be minded to make entrance indecently must not be debarred by such rail fence a hemmed in vicarage ground gilmore a passed through corner of churchyard clearly saw man standing near to stile leading from field indeed man be quite close to although from want of light posture of man face be invisible to knew fellow to be stranger to bullhampton dress be strange manner be strange mode of standing be strange gilmore have lived at bullhampton life without much thought on subject knew bullhampton way jacket man wore be town made jacket jacket have come farther field even than salisbury man gaiter have savour be decidedly not of wiltshire dark a be must see so much a good night friend said gilmore in sharp cheery voice man muttered something passed on a though to village there have however be something in position made gilmore think that stranger have intended to trespass on friend garden crossed stile into field however without waiting without having waited for moment immediately saw figure of second man standing down hidden a be in ditch though must discover more than cap shoulder of man through gloom be sure knew who be that owned cap shoulder did not speak again passed on quickly thinking what might best do man whom have seen recognised have latterly be talked of a discredit to family anything honour to usually respectable inhabitant of bullhampton on further side of church from town be farmyard in occupation of one of lord trowbridge tenant man who have ever be very keen at preventing inroad of trespasser to have perhaps be driven by fact that land be traversed by various public pathway now public pathway through pasture be nuisance a be impossible to induce who use to keep to one beaten track pathway through cornfield be worse for let what pain may be taken wheat bean barley will be torn down trampled under foot yet in apportioning rent landlord take into consideration farmer trumbull considered good deal be often wrathful man there be at rate right of way across farmyard here might keep a big dog a chose chained unchained harry gilmore knew dog well stood for moment leaning on gate who be there said voice of farmer be that mr trumbull be mr gilmore want to get round to front of parson house zurely zurely said farmer coming forward opening gate be there anything wrong about squire know think there be speak softly fancy there be men lying in churchyard be thinking so too squire bone be be growling just now like old bone be be

squire never fear bone be together be abeost too much for bugglars then led mr gilmore through farmyard out on to road bone be growling low growl a passed away squire hurried along high road past church in at vicarage front gate knowing place well must have made way round into garden thought better to go to front door there be light to be seen from window almost room of house looked out into garden at back knocked sharply in minute two door be opened by parson in person frank said squire halloo be that what be up now men who ought to be in bed came across two men hanging about gate in churchyard be not sure there be third be up to nothing often sit smoke there fellow be up to something man saw plainest be stranger just sort of man who wo do parishioner good to be among other be sam

garden so through to orchard down to churchyard gate hitherto have seen nothing heard nothing fenwick be sure that men have made way through churchyard to village may come back said gilmore will be about if do said parson what be one against three have better let stay fenwick laughed at saying that must be quite a rational to propose that must keep watch night hark said squire with mind evidently perturbed be alarmed about said parson if anything must happen to mary lowther that doubt be matter of anxiety to may perhaps be added trifle of additional feeling on score of janet child will do best if woman knew that be patrolling place 'd be frightened out of wit then gilmore who never liked that there must be laugh against took leave walked home across field fenwick passed up through garden when be near terrace ran along garden front of house thought that heard voice stood under shade of wall dark with ivy distinctly heard whispering on other side of a far a must tell there be voice of more than two men wished now that have kept gilmore with not that be personally afraid of trespasser for courage be of steady settled kind enables possessor to remember that men who be doing deed of darkness be ever afraid of whom be injuring have there be ally with prospect of catching one more of ruffian must have be greatly increased standing where be must probably be able to interrupt must attempt to enter house in mean time might be stripping fruit from wall be certainly at present in kitchen garden be not minded to leave there at such work a might have in hand having paused to think of crept along under wall close to house towards passage by must reach have not heard have waited among fruit when be near corner of wall one leading man came round within foot two of spot on stood before must decide on what must do second have appeared rushed forward with loaded stick in hand knowing weight remembering possibility of comparative innocence of intruder hesitated to strike blow on head must have brained man knock on arm with instrument must break bone in moment found left hand on leading man throat man foot behind heel fell a fell did strike heavily cutting upwards with weapon bringing heavy weight of lead at end of on to man shoulder stumbled rather than fell when regained footing man be gone that man be gone two others be following down towards gate at

there be first of examination of fruit a be made without taking jem gardener into confidence certain conclusion must be reached be clear however that robbery for purpose of sale have be made apricot two might have be taken perhaps assault made on unripe peach mr fenwick be nearly sure that garden spoliation be not purpose of assailant though suited to let wife entertain that idea men must hardly have come from kitchen garden up to house round corner at have met if be seeking fruit presuming to have be intention to attempt drawing room window must have expected to meet a did meet from garden vicar two lady went down to gate from thence over stile to farmer trumbull farmyard farmer have not again seen men after squire have left have heard to parson said nothing of encounter nothing of blow

of shoulder be broken man so thought doctor must not travel far on foot must hardly be able to get away to of neighbouring town unless be carried of sam brattle parson said nothing to doctor when have finished morning work about town walked on to mill in mean time two lady remained at home at parsonage excitement occasioned by event of previous night be probably little damaged by knowledge that mr gilmore be coming coming of mr gilmore on occasion be so important that even terrible idea of burglar sensation arising from use of deadly weapon have be produced at breakfast table during morning be robbed of of interest did not keep possession of mind of two lady a must have done have there be violent interrupting cause here be violent interrupting cause by time that lunch be on table sam brattle comrade be forgotten very little be said between two woman on morning respecting mr gilmore mr fenwick who have allowed to be convinced that mary must act with great impropriety if did not accept man thought that further speech might only render friend obstinate mary who knew inside of friend mind very clearly who loved respected friend must hardly fix own mind during past night have be fixed nearly fixed two different way have first determined that must refuse lover a to resolve for hour so have be very firm then that must accept a to have ever when most way inclined entertained doubt a to possibility of uttering that word yes if be that other woman love better than love wonder that ever get married at said to herself be told that be wrong to keep man in suspense believed have not be so told must have thought that further waiting must have be of three alternative best will be upstairs with bairn said mr fenwick a left dining room after lunch so that if prefer garden to drawing room will be free oh dear how solemn ceremonious make be solemn mary know how anything can be more solemn short of going to heaven other place really see why there must be doubt difficulty there be something in tone in word be said almost made mary lowther again decide against man man have home income be squire of parish therefore there need be difficulty when compared mr fenwick mr gilmore together found that liked mr fenwick best thought to be more clever higher spirited most of man of two certainly be not least in love with friend husband then be just a little in love with mr gilmore at about half past two mr gilmore made appearance standing at open window may come in said of course may come in mr fenwick be not here be in house think if want oh hope be not frightened last night have not seen frank morning hear from mr trumbull that there be something of row there be row certainly mr fenwick struck of men be afraid that hurt one of wish have broken head take there be son of one of tenant there who be about a bad a can be frank will believe now hope be not frightened here heard nothing of till morning after there be pause have told a came along that task before must not be easy pleasant to declare passion to girl love may be very pleasant work to man who feel almost sure that answer will not be against may be easy task enough even when there be doubt very possession of passion even pretence give man liberty have pleasure pride in using be case when man dash boldly at purpose without preconcerted arrangement such pleasure if ever be pleasure to such excitement at least be come gone with harry gilmore have told tale have be desired to wait now have come again at fixed hour to be informed like servant waiting for place whether be thought that must suit servant out of place however must have have advantage that must receive answer without necessity of further eloquence on own part with lover be different be evident that mary lowther must not say to have considered matter think that upon whole will do be necessary that must ask question again ask a suppliant mary said beginning with word that have fixed for a came up garden be six week think since asked to be wife now have come to ask again made immediate answer sat a though waiting for further effort of eloquence think doubt truth warmth of affection if trust in do do then know that can say anything further nothing can say now will make love have not that sort of power must compel girl to come into arm understand that kind of power how man can have with girl say that be so flatter that be so with think that must be so with man over perhaps may assure that a far a know at present future happiness must depend on answer will not kill to be refused at least suppose not will make wish that must having so spoken waited for reply believed word that said liked so well that for own sake desired that might be gratified a far a knew have desire to be harry gilmore wife position be not even one in must allow to look for consolation on one side for disappointment on other have read about love talked about love desired to be in love certainly be not in love with man have begun to doubt whether must ever be given to to love to love a friend janet loved frank fenwick janet loved husband very footstep seemed to eat with palate hear with ear see with eye be a be absolutely bone from husband rib mary thought that be sure that must never have same feeling towards henry gilmore yet might come something might come must do almost a well be likely that janet nature be softer sweeter than own more prone to adapt like ivy to strong tree for herself might be that must never become a ivy that nevertheless might be true wife of true husband if ever be to be true wife of harry gilmore must not to day say that must be so suppose must answer said very gently if tell that be not ready to do so will wait come again will never change mind may be sure of be just what may not do mr gilmore who say so own feeling tell so have right to keep in suspense will not do respect esteem most honestly have so much liking for that mind owning wish that be more mr gilmore like so much that must make great sacrifice for can not sacrifice own honesty happiness by making believe that love for few moment sat silent then there came over face look of inexpressible anguish look a though pain be almost more than must bear must not keep eye from face in woman pity almost wished that word have be different must be asked what else can say mr gilmore if must be will be to doom will not know how to bear can not live here without have thought about till have become mixed with tree cottage about place did not know of must become such slave to passion mary say that will wait again try once more must not ask for that have told that there be one else certainly there be one else then let wait again can do harm if there must come man more fortunate than be can tell will know that be over ask sacrifice from pledge give mine will not change there must be such promise mr gilmore there be promise certainly will not change when three month be over will come to again tried to think whether be bound to tell that answer must be taken a final whether might allow matter to stand a proposed with chance of result might be good for on one point be quite sure that if left now with understanding that must again renew offer after period of three month must go away from bullhampton if there be possibility that must learn to love such feeling must arise within more quickly in absence than in presence must go home to loring try to bring to accept think said that what now say have better be last of will not be last of will try again what be there can do so that may make worthy of be question of worthiness mr gilmore who can say how heart be moved why will go home to loring may be sure of if there be anything that must hear of will let know then took hand in own held for while pressed to lip left be by mean contented with to tell truth be ashamed to let friend know what have done yet how must have answered in other word might be that must teach to be contented with amount of regard entertained for might be that must persuade to be wife if so why must not have chance chance professed that be so anxious to retain have paid greatest compliment man can pay woman owed everything except be hardly sure even now that if proposition have come to by letter answer might not have be of different nature a soon a be gone went upstairs to nursery thence to mr fenwick bedroom flo be there flo be soon dismissed mary began story instantly before question must be asked janet said be going home at once why so because be best nothing more be settled than be settled before when asks whether may come again how can say that may not what can say except a far can see now can not be wife have not accepted then believe that must if have asked last night most certainly must not may doubt when be talking behind back when meet face to face can not do think have be wrong very wrong very foolish in not taking man love said mary do love be longing for know what romance grand passion something will never come will tell what want if please feeling such a have for frank be model want nothing beyond come after marriage frank be very little to till be man wife will tell same know whether did almost dislike when married oh janet certainly sort of love be thinking of come afterwards when interest of two people be same frank be very well a lover remember be child be fifteen remember how world used to change for when be coming there be ribbon wore wore for dressed in eye lived by thought be after be engaged if must accept harry gilmore must do just same must be sure that must be so be now almost sure that must not why do want to go home that may not be pestered by having near think will be better for must go be to ask again say that will in three month must tell that will be better that must not must advise to travel if be friend like leave duty pleasure house property because of face figure dear think woman be worth so much to man mary bit lip in sorrow for what have said be thinking of own speech about janet not of worth doe not astonish more than doe that man a mr gilmore must be perplexed in spirit for cause say that be perplexed of course be perplexed of course be in joke only doe seem so hard upon must like to shake till fell into arm know must be best for will go on examining own feeling doubting about heart waiting for something will never come till will have lost time be way old maid be made if married harry by time first child be born must think that be jupiter just a think that frank be mr fenwick owned however

have heard of one be man who in former day have frequented lavington burrow by name generally known a jack grinder who have be in prison in wiltshire somersetshire who have not so said constable honoured lavington for last two year till last appearance have however be seen there in company with man have evidently be in condition very unfit for work have one night at low public house have then moved on man have complained of fall from cart have declared that be black blue over seemed to be clear that have broken bone mr fenwick therefore be convinced that jack grinder be gentleman with whom have have encounter that grinder back have withstood that swinging blow from life preserver of grinder companion nothing must be learned two men have taken devizes road out of lavington beyond nothing be known of when parson mentioned sam brattle name in whisper lavington constable shook head knew about old jacob brattle very respectable party be old mr brattle in constable opinion nevertheless constable shook head when sam brattle name be mentioned having learned so much parson rode home two day after on friday fenwick be sitting after breakfast in study at work on sermon for next sunday when be told that old mr brattle be waiting to see immediately got up found own wife miller seated in hall be not often that mr brattle made way to vicarage when did so be treated with great consideration be still august weather be very hot have walked up across water mead be tired glass of wine biscuit be pressed upon be encouraged to sit say few indifferent word before be taken into study told to commence story have brought so far there be most inviting topic for conversation mill mill premise be to be put in order by landlord mr brattle affected to be rather dismayed than otherwise by coming operation mill must have lasted time thought a for a be to come after well did know a thing be now perhaps might be that after sam must have mill trouble occasioned by workman must be infinite how be to live in mean time where be to go soon appeared however that have be already arranged milling must of course be stopped for month six week indeed sir feyther say that there wo be no more grinding much before winter mill be to be repaired first then when became absolutely necessary to dismantle house be to endeavour to make shift live in big room of mill till furniture must be put back again mr fenwick with ready good nature offered to accommodate mr brattle fanny at vicarage old woman declined with many protestation of gratitude have never left old man yet must not do so now weather must be mild for awhile thought that must get through by time glass of wine have be sipped to bottom parson mindful of sermon have led visitor into study have come to tell sam at last have returned home why did bring up with mr brattle here be question to ask of old lady whose dominion over son be absolutely none sam have become so frightfully independent that hardly regarded word of father who be man pre eminently capable of maintaining authority must no more do thing because mother told than because wind whistled axed to come up not just with of mr fenwick said a how must know where to find if wanted be just what know however if be there now will go to must have be better far that must have come to told 'un so mr fenwick did indeed doe not signify will go to only can not be to day a have promised to take wife over to charlicoats will come down immediately after breakfast to morrow think will be still there be sure will mr fenwick feyther have taken on again till be beautiful to see there be none of 'em feyther ever loved like only one thereupon poor woman burst out into tear covered face with handkerchief never make half so much account of fan that never have fault belonging to if sam will stick to that will be well for be taken up extraordinary with repair mr fenwick be in about over place looking to everything feyther say know so much about b'lieves boy must do out o ' own head there be nothing feyther ever liked so much a folk to be strong clever perhaps squire tradesman wo like be mitchell going to do ai doing in way mr fenwick squire be allowing l feyther be to get done mister mitchell be to see that be done proper doubt now tell mr brattle what have sam be about time that be away be just what can not tell mr fenwick husband have asked suppose if have ai told mr fenwick care to come between with hint jealousy suspecting like fan say be be out working somewhere lavington way know a know be decent looking when came home be much amiss mr fenwick have way with that most always look decent sir have money have some'at because when be working moving big lumber a though for bare life sent one of boy for beer see 'd give boy money be sorry for wish 'd come back without penny with hunger like wolf in stomach with clothes rag so that might have have taste of suffering of vagabond life just like prodigal son mr fenwick just like prodigal son must not have come back to father have not be driven by own vice to live with swine then seeing tear coming down poor mother cheek added in kinder voice perhaps may be all well a be will hope so at least to morrow will come down see need not tell that be coming unless must ask where have be then mr brattle took leave parson finished sermon afternoon drove wife across county to visit certain friend at charlicoats going coming must not keep from talking about brattles in first place thought that gilmore be wrong not to complete work of course will see that money be spent doubt in way may get job done twenty thirty pound cheaper brattles have not interest enough in place to justify suppose old man liked best so old man must have be allowed to have way be in awful state of alarm about sam much a like at rate did like fear be going perhaps have gone to dog two men be housebreaker be a certain a that sit there can not doubt that have be with over at lavington devizes somewhere in country may perhaps never have joined in anything of kind man be known by companion must not have believed if have not found with men traced about county together see that fellow whom call grinder be certainly man struck tracked to lavington there be complaining of being sore over body wonder that be sore must be made like horse to be worse than sore well then that man sam be certainly in garden together give chance frank of course will give chance will give very best chance can must do anything to save ca help knowing what know have made very little to wife of danger of vicarage being robbed must not feel that there be danger wife have brought with among other plenishing for household considerable amount of handsome plate more than be perhaps generally to be found in country parsonage doubt fact be known at rate to sam brattle have men simply intended to rob garden must not have run risk of coming so near to house window then certainly be true that sam be not showing way parson did not quite know what to think about be clearly duty to be on guard same evening sauntered across corner of churchyard to farmer looking out warily for bone be stood leaning upon farm gate bone be be not to be seen heard therefore entered walked up to back door indeed be only door for entrance egress be ever used there be front door opening into little ragged garden be a much fixture a wall a be

interceded with old miller when sam have given offence at home have even interceded with constable when there be rumour in wind of offence something worse than then have come occasion on mr fenwick have told father unless son must change course evil must come of father son have taken amiss father have told parson to face that parson have led son astray son in revenge have brought housebreaker down upon old friend premise one have to do for thanks said mr fenwick a became little bitter while thinking of will stick to a long a can if be only for old woman sake for poor girl whom used to love

thing that have said to sam brattle spoke to miller landlord in lad favour be hard at work now at rate seemed inclined to stick to work there have be independence about parson have half liked even while have be offended at gilmore differed altogether from friend what be doing in garden what be doing hidden in trumbull hedge when see fellow hiding in ditch at night suppose that be after much good mr fenwick made lame apology even for offence sam have perhaps not really known extent of iniquity of men with whom have associated have come up garden probably with view to fruit matter be

at night fenwick walked round garden orchard with wife there be moon now night be very dark stopped for minute at wicket leading into churchyard be evident to that bone be from farmyard at other side

man be hurt in hunting field be always said that be killed if kitchen flue be on fire be always said that house be burned down something however have probably happened at farmer trumbull down went parson across garden orchard through churchyard a quick a leg must carry in farmyard found quite crowd of men including two constable three four of leading tradesman in village first thing that saw be dead body of bone be dog be stiff stark have be poisoned how mr trumbull asked of nearest by stander law parson ai ye heard said man have knocked skull open with hammer be a dead a dead hearing parson turned round made way into house there be not doubt about farmer have be murdered during night money carried off upstairs mr fenwick made way to farmer bedroom there lay body mr crittenden village

close gate when let out bone be before going to bed poor bone be have be enticed to death by piece of poisoned meat thrown to probably considerable time before attack be made who be murderer that of course be first question need hardly be said with how sad heart mr fenwick discussed matter with squire of course inquiry must be made of manner in sam brattle have passed night heaven how must be with poor family if have be concerned in such affair a then there came across parson mind remembrance agnes pope sam brattle have be seen by together on more sunday than one in anxiety with much imprudence went to girl questioned again for own sake agnes tell be sure never mentioned about money box to sam brattle girl blushed hesitated then said that be quite sure never have did think have

among there be not many at church mr fenwick made service very short must not preach sermon have prepared said few word on terrible catastrophe have occurred so near to man who be now lying within only few yard of with brain knocked out have be alive among strong in good health yesterday evening there have come into peaceful village miscreant who have be led on from self indulgence to idleness from idleness to theft from theft to murder know kind of word parson spoke thrill of attention with must be heard here be man who have be close to therefore murder came home to filled with excitement ala be not probably without feeling of pleasure sermon if sermon must be called be very short when be over parson also hurried down to mill have already be discovered that sam brattle have certainly be out during night have denied at first saying that though have be last to go to bed have gone to bed about eleven have not left mill house till late in morning sister have heard rise have seen body through gloom a passed beneath window of room in slept have not heard return when arose at six have found out that be then in house manifested anger against when gave testimony acknowledged that have be out that have wandered up to road explained former denial frankly with well assumed frankness by saying that must if possible for father be sake have concealed fact that have be away knowing that

magistrate must sit at place on tuesday squire gilmore for present committed parson remained for time with old man wife after sam be gone soon found that must be of service by doing so miller must not speak mr brattle be utterly prostrated by husband misery know what to say about said mr fenwick to wife night suspicion be very strong can not say have opinion one way other there be sermon in bullhampton church on sunday afternoon chapter xiii captain marrable father only that be generally conceived that in such history a be writer of tale must be able to make point so clear by word further assistance must be needed must be tempted here to insert properly illustrated pedigree tree of marrable family marrable family be of very old standing in england first baronet having be created by james there having be marrables a be well known by attentive reader of english history engaged in war of rose again others very conspicuous in religious persecution of child of henry viii know that always behaved with consistency held head up after fashion got talked of be people of note in country be cavalier in time of charles of cromwell a became men of blood gentleman be not recorded of that sacrificed much in cause when william iii became king submitted with good grace to new order of thing certain sir thomas marrable be member for county in reign of george george ii enjoyed lucrative confidence with walpole then there came blustering roystering sir thomas who together with fine man gambler a heir brought property to rather low ebb so that when sir gregory grandfather of miss marrable came to title in early day of george iii be not rich man two son sir gregory general marrable died long before day of be writing sir gregory in general in sir gregory be second of name second at least a mentioned in page have be miss marrable uncle general have be father father of mr mary mother third sir gregory be reigning at time of story very old gentleman with one single son fourth gregory now residence of sir gregory be at dunripple park just on border of warwickshire worcestershire in latter county property be small for country gentleman with title not much exceeding l year there be longer sitting in parliament keeping of race horse indeed season in town for present race of marrables existing sir gregory be very quiet man son only child man now about forty year of age lived mostly at home occupied with thing of antiquity be remarkably well read in history of own country have be understood for last twenty year by antiquarian archaeological other society that be projector of new theory about stonehenge that book on subject be almost ready such be two surviving member of present senior branch of family sir gregory have two brother younger of two being parson john marrable present rector of st peter lowtown occupier of house within heavy slate coloured gate where lived bachelor life a have done before cousin late rector elder being certain colonel marrable colonel marrable again have son who be captain walter marrable after confused reader will be introduced to more of marrable family enlightened reader will have by time perceived that miss mary lowther captain walter marrable be second cousin will also have perceived if have given mind fully to study that present parson john marrable have come into living after death of cousin of same generation a of lower standing in family be so by may be seen how little sir gregory of present day have be able to do for brother perhaps may also be imagined from that present clergyman at loring lowtown have be able to do very little for nevertheless be kindly hearted good sincere old man not very bright indeed peculiarly fitted for preaching gospel be much liked kept curate though income out of living be small now so happened that captain marrable walter marrable came to stay with uncle parson about same time that mary lowther returned to loring remember walter do not said miss marrable to niece not least in world remember there be walter when be at dunripple be ten year ago boy cousin girl cousin never fraternise suppose be nearly young man then be child be still at school though just leaving be seven year older than be be coming to stay with parson john say so aunt sarah what will such man a captain marrable do at loring then aunt sarah explained that knew perhaps suggested more than knew walter marrable have quarrelled with father colonel with whom indeed everybody of name of marrable have always be quarrelling who be believed by miss marrable to be very mischief be man always in debt who have broken wife heart who lived with low company disgraced family who have be more than once arrested on whose behalf family interest have be expended so that nobody else must get anything who gambled drank did wicked thing wicked old colonel living at portsmouth must do indeed hitherto miss marrable have entertained opinion hardly more charitable respecting son than have done in regard to father have disbelieved in branch of marrables altogether captain marrable have lived with father good deal at least so have understood therefore must not be bad moreover miss sarah marrable have throughout whole life be somewhat estranged from elder branch of family father walter have be so thought injured by brother sir gregory there have be law proceeding not quite amicable between brother parson present sir gregory respected sir gregory a head of family never went now to dunripple knew nothing of sir gregory heir of present parson john have thought very little before have come to loring since have be living there have found that blood be thicker than water a must say two be intimate when heard that captain marrable be coming because have quarrelled with father began to think that perhaps might be a well that must allow to meet new cousin what do think of cousin walter old clergyman said to nephew one evening after two lady who have be dining at rectory have left be first occasion on walter marrable have met mary since coming to loring remember a well a if be yesterday at dunripple be little girl then thought most beautiful little girl in world think very beautiful still so be a lovely a ever can stand doe not seem to have much to say for remember when be little girl never must speak fancy can talk when plea walter must fall in love with wo if can help in first place think be a good a engaged to fellow with very pretty property in wiltshire in next place have got one shilling there be not much danger be not inclined to trouble about girl in present mood even if have pretty property herself be engaged to anybody suppose will get over day feel just at present a though must say kind word to human being psha psha be nonsense walter take thing coolly be more likely to come right wo be so troublesome even if such be philosophy of parson john for sake of digesting captain lit cigar went out to smoke standing at one of open slate coloured gate be said in first chapter of story mr gilmore be one of hero whose deed story undertakes to narrate hint be perhaps expressed that of hero be favourite captain marrable be however hero a such word two must be said of be better looking man certainly than mr gilmore though perhaps personal appearance did not at first sight give to observer so favourable idea of character a did that of other gentleman mr gilmore be to be read at glance a honest straightforward well behaved country squire whose word might be taken for anything who might perhaps like to have own way who must hardly do cruel unfair thing be just such man to look at a prudent mother must select a one to whom might entrust daughter with safety now walter marrable countenance be of very different die have served in india naturally dark colour of face have thus become very swarthy black hair curled round head curl on brow be becoming very thin a though age be already telling on yet be four five year younger than mr gilmore eyebrow be thick heavy eye seemed to be black be eye be used without much motion when be dead set a be not unfrequently must seem a though be defying on whom looked thus made many afraid of many who be not afraid of disliked because of certain ferocity seemed to characterise face wore beard beyond heavy black moustache quite covered upper lip nose be long straight mouth large chin square doubt be handsome man looked to be tall man though in truth lacked two full inch of normal six foot be broad across chest strong on leg be altogether such man to look at few must care to quarrel with many must think that be disposed to quarrel of nature be not quarrelsome be man who certainly have received much injury need not be explained at length how money affair have gone wrong with must have inherited indeed did inherit fortune from mother family of father have contrived absolutely to rob be only within last month that have discovered that father have succeeded in laying hand on certainly bulk of money might be upon word between have be very bitter father with cigar between teeth have told son that be fortune of war that if justice have be done at marriage money must have be own that by g be very sorry must say anything more son have called father liar swindler a indeed be truth though son be doubtless wrong to say so to author of being father have threatened son with horsewhip so have parted within ten day of walter marrable return from india walter have written to two uncle asking advice a to saving wreck if anything might be saved sir gregory have written back to say that be old man that be greatly grieved at misunderstanding that messrs block curling be family lawyer parson john invited nephew to come down to loring lowtown captain marrable went to block curling who be by mean consolatory accepted uncle invitation be three day after first meeting between two cousin that be to be seen one evening walking together along bank of lurwell little river at loring sometimes take appearance of canal sometimes of natural stream be commercial having connection with kennet avon navigation long slow ponderous barge with heavy dirty sleepy bargeman rickety ill used barge horse be common in neighbourhood in part be very pretty a run under chalky down there be multiplicity of lock turf of sheep walk come up to towing path in close neighbourhood of town canal be straight uninteresting ground be level there be scattered community of small straight built light brick house be in so ugly that be incompatible with anything be pretty in landscape parson john always so called to distinguish from late parson cousin who have be rev james marrable have taken occasion on behalf of nephew to tell story of wrong to miss marrable by miss marrable have be told to mary to lady thing seemed to be so horrible idea that father must have robbed son that stern ferocity of slow moving eye be forgiven took to heart if not for love at least for pity twenty thousand pound ought to have become property of walter marrable when maternal relative have died have seemed hard that father must have none of on receipt in india of representation from colonel walter have signed certain fatal paper effect of be that father have laid hand on pretty nearly whole if not on whole of money have caused to vanish there be now question whether five thousand pound might not be saved if so walter must stay in england if not must exchange go back to india a said to devil speak of in way said worst of be said that be ashamed of for being so absolutely cut up about money man must be able to bear that kind of thing hit one round think bear very well did bear well when called father swindler did bear well when swore must put in prison for robbing bear well now when think of moment do so hate india have so absolutely made up mind never to return if have be that knew that fortune be to be mine must have saved money hand over hand ca live on pay here no answered almost a though be angry with if have be used life to strictest economy perhaps might do so men do doubt be too old to begin there be choice of two thing to blow brain out go back be not such coward a know ai sure that must be cowardice if there be anybody must injure by doing must be cowardly family suggested mary what doe sir gregory care for will show letter to day think must be cowardly at to get away from such lot be sure wo do captain marrable think what be to know that father be swindler perhaps be worst of fancy talking thinking of one family after like uncle john be very kind have offered to lend l be sure ca afford to lose be too honest to take even hardly see call misfortune have doubt must shake hand with brother to morrow so must if be really sorry mary nothing on earth will ever induce to set eye on again willingly have destroyed world for must have have half of without word when used to whine to in letter say how cruelly have be treated always made up mind that must have income for life be because must not want till came home enabled to do what have done now have robbed of cursed shilling wonder whether will ever get mind free from of course will seems now that heart be wrapped in lead a be coming home put hand upon arm asked to promise to withdraw threat why must withdraw who care for care aunt care care threat mean nothing mary people who make such threat carry out of course will go on endure worst of be that whole thing make so unmanly make beast of will try to get over mary thought that upon whole bore misfortune very well chapter xiv cousinhood mary lowther cousin have taken walk together on monday evening on next morning received following letter from mr fenwick when reached have a yet heard nothing of bullhampton tragedy vicarage monday sept dearest mary suppose will have heard before get of dreadful murder have taken place here have so startled horrified that hardly know what be doing even yet be hard to say why thing must be worse because be close certainly be so have be in next parish even further off in parish think must feel so much then knew old man so well then again make worst of of be unable to get rid of suspicion one whom knew be liked have be participator in crime seems that must have be about two o'clock on sunday morning that mr trumbull be killed be at rate between one three a far a can judge think that there must have be three men concerned remember how used to joke about poor mr trumbull dog well be poisoned first probably hour before men got into house have be discovered that foolish old man kept large sum of money by in box that always took box into bed with woman who lived in house with used to see there doubt thief have heard of frank mr gilmore think that girl agnes pope whom will remember in choir told about lived with mr trumbull thought very good girl though be too fond of young man sam brattle think that men did not mean to do murder that old man fought so hard for money that be driven to body be not in room on top of stair temple have be split open with blow of hammer hammer lay beside be one belonging to house mr gilmore say that there be great craft in using weapon did not bring with of course can not be traced by hammer got off with l in box did not touch anything else everybody feel quite sure that knew about money that when mr gilmore saw that night down at churchyard corner be prowling about with view of seeing how must get into farmer house not into vicarage frank think that when afterwards found in place sam brattle have brought in with kind of wild idea of taking fruit that men of own account have come round to reconnoitre house say that there can be doubt about men having be same then come terrible question whether sam brattle son of dear woman at mill have be one of murderer have be at home previous day working very hard at work be being done in obedience to order dear certainly be out on saturday night be very hard to get at man belief in such matter a far a can understand think that frank mr gilmore do really believe that be there frank say that will go very hard with mr gilmore have committed magistrate be to sit to morrow at heytesbury mr gilmore will be there have a may be sure behaved a well a possible have quite altered in manner to old people be at mill morning brattle must not speak to sat for hour with mr brattle fanny make almost more melancholy having rubbish building thing about yet work stopped fanny brattle have behaved so well be who told that brother have be out at night mr gilmore say that when question be asked in presence answered in own quiet simple way without moment doubt since have never ceased to assert conviction that brother have have nothing to do either with murder with robbery if have not be for mr brattle must think have sunk under load fanny say same thing constantly to father scold bid hold tongue go on think have effect even on whole place doe look such picture of ruin must break heart to see then when one look at father mother one remembers about other child be almost tempted to ask why such misery must have fallen upon parent who have be honest sober industrious can really be that man be being punished here on earth because will not believe when hinted to frank turned upon scolded told be measuring almighty god with foot rule men be punished in bible because did not believe remember baptist father never dare to go on with frank on matter be so full of affair of poor mr trumbull so anxious about sam brattle can not now write about anything else can only say that man ever behaved with greater kindness propriety than harry gilmore who have have to act a magistrate poor fanny brattle have to go to heytesbury to morrow to give evidence at first said that must take father also be to be spared for present must tell that sam declares that got to know men at place where be at work brickmaking near devizes have quarrelled with father have got job there with high wage used to be out at night with acknowledges that joined one of man named burrow in stealing brood of pea fowl poulterer wanted to buy say looked on a joke then seems have spite against trumbull dog that man burrow came over here on purpose to take dog away according to story be that know of man say that on special saturday night have not least idea burrow be at bullhampton till heard sound of certain cart on road tell a be sure will share anxiety respecting unfortunate young man because of mother sister good bye dearest frank sends ever so many love somebody else must send too if thought must be bearer try to think so well of bullhampton a to make wish to live here give kindest love to aunt sarah most affectionate friend janet fenwick mary be obliged to read letter twice before completely understood old mr trumbull murdered why have known old man well have always be in habit of speaking to when met at one gate other of farmyard have joked with about bone be have heard assert own perfect security against robber not week before night on be murdered a mr fenwick have said truth be so much more real when come from thing be near then have so often heard character of sam brattle described man who be now in prison a murderer have given lesson in singing to agnes pope who be now in sort accused of aiding thief have asked agnes whether be not foolish for to be hanging about farmyard outside master premise with sam brattle be brought very near to before day be over be telling story to captain marrable have of course told to aunt have be discussing whole morning mr gilmore name have be mentioned to captain marrable very little more than name aunt sarah however have already begun to think whether might not be prudent to tell cousin walter story of half formed engagement mary have expressed so much sympathy with cousin wrong that aunt sarah have begun to fear that sympathy might lead to tenderer feeling aunt sarah be by mean anxious that niece must fall in love with gentleman whose chief attraction be fact that have be ruined by own father even though gentleman be marrable danger might possibly be lessened if captain marrable be made acquainted with gilmore affair taught to understand how desirable such match must be for mary aunt sarah have qualm of conscience on subject doubted whether have right to tell story without leave from mary then there be in truth real engagement knew indeed that mr gilmore have made offer more than once then knew also that offer have at rate not a yet be accepted felt that on mr gilmore account a well a on mary ought to hold tongue might indeed be admissible to tell to cousin must not tell to indifferent young man nevertheless must not bring to do even with so good object believed to be wrong that evening mary be again walking on towing path beside river with cousin walter have met now about five time there be already intimacy between idea of cousinly intimacy to girl be undoubtedly very pleasant know whether be not fact that better purer be girl sweeter pleasanter be idea in america girl may form friendly intimacy with young man fancy though may not be free from little jest good humoured joking there be injury to from such intimacy be acknowledged right to enjoy after fashion to have what call good time with young men dozen such intimacy stand in way when there come real adorer who mean to marry be able to do so ride with friend walk with corresponds with go out to ball picnic with afterwards let in with latchkey while papa mamma be bed asleep with perfect security if there be much to be said against practice there be also something to be said for girl on other hand on continent of europe dream of making friendship with man cousin with be a much out of question a most perfect stranger in strict family girl be hardly allowed to go out with brother have heard of mother who thought indiscreet that father must be seen alone with daughter at theatre friendship between sex must under social code be looked forward to a post nuptial joy here in england there be something betwixt two intercourse between young men girl be free enough to enable latter to feel how pleasant be to be able to forget for awhile conventional restraint to acknowledge how joyous thing be to indulge in social intercourse in simple delight of equal mind meeting equal mind in equal talk be just enhanced by unconscious remembrance that boy girl when meet together may learn to love there be nothing more sweet in youth than nothing more natural nothing more fitting nothing indeed more essentially necessary for god purpose with creature nevertheless here with there be restriction be seldom that girl can allow full flow of friendship with man who be not old enough to be father unless be lover a well a friend cousinhood doe allow escape from hardship of rule cousin be tom jack george dick cousin probably know most of little family secret cousin perhaps have romped with scolded teased when be young cousin be almost same a brother yet may be lover there be certainly great relief in cousinhood mary lowther have brother have brother sister have since earliest infancy hardly known other relative save aunt old parson john when first have heard that walter marrable be at loring tidings gave pleasure whatever never occurred to to say to herself now will have one who may become friend be to perhaps almost brother what have hitherto heard of walter marrable have not be in favour of father have heard be bad have joined father son together in what few idea have formed respecting now after five interview walter marrable be dear cousin with whom sympathised of whom be proud whose misfortune be in degree misfortune to whom thought must very soon tell great trouble of life about mr gilmore a though be indeed brother have learned to like dark staring eye now always seemed to be fixed on with something of real regard liked better perhaps because there be in so much of real admiration though if be so mary knew nothing of such liking now at bidding called walter have addressed by christian name at first a matter of course have felt grateful to for doing so have not dared to be so bold with till have bade do so now felt that be cousin indeed captain marrable be at present waiting not with much patience for tidings from block curling must that l be saved for must again go out to india be heard of more at home in own england mary be not so impatient a captain also be intensely interested in expected letter on day however conversation chiefly ran on news mary have that morning heard from bullhampton suppose feel sure said captain that young sam brattle be one of murderer oh walter at least one of thief mr fenwick mr gilmore think that be innocent gather that from what friend say say that think that think so then be clear that be hanging about place before with very men who have committed crime that there be way in might have heard probably have heard of money then be out about very night still ca believe if knew sort of people father mother be captain marrable must not reflect that if honest gentleman might have swindler for father honest miller might have thief for son then if saw place at live have particular interest about then young man of course must be innocent laugh at walter why be place so interesting to can hardly tell why father mother be interesting people so be sister in way be so good have have great trouble very great trouble place be so cool pretty surrounded by stream old pollard willow with thatched roof

grinder on first visit to pycroft doubt mr toffy be mainly anxious to ascertain whether anything be known by old woman a to son whereabouts second third fourth visit be made rather to younger than to older woman toffy have probably learned in wide experience that man of grinder nature will generally place more reliance on young woman than on old that young woman will nevertheless be more likely to betray confidence than older partly from indiscretion partly ala from treachery if presumed mr burrow junior knew aught of grinder present doings be neither indiscreet treacherous mr toffy must get nothing from be sickly weak sullen silent did think be business to say where have be living before came to pycroft have be living with husband have got no husband that knew of if have be going to say

murderer of mr trumbull remandings of sam brattle took place in month of september during same month energy of other men of law be very keenly at work on widely different subject must messrs block curling assure captain marrable that portion of inheritance must be saved for have that graceless father of in very truth seized upon there be shadow of doubt that if aught be spared have not be spared through delicacy on part of colonel colonel have gone to work paying creditor who be clamorous against moment have got hand upon money have gone to work also gambling have made assignment of money done very best to spend whole there be question whether certain sum of l seemed to have got into hand of certain lady who protested that wanted very badly might not be saved messrs block curling thought that might be by mean certain probably might be done if captain must consent to bring matter before jury in case whole story of father iniquity must of course be proved might be that by threatening to do lady friend must relax grasp on receiving certain present out of money must offer l perhaps must take l said messrs block curling irritated captain be intensely averse to law proceeding by story must be made public wo pretend that be on father account said to uncle parson john shrugged shoulder shook head meaning to imply that certainly be bad case that a colonel marrable be marrable ought to be spared if possible be on own account continued captain partly perhaps on of family must endure anything rather than have filth of transaction flooded through newspaper must never be able to join mess again if did that then 'd better let block curling compromise get what can said parson john with indifferent provoking tone clearly indicated that must regard matter when so settled a one arranged amicably pleasantly between party uncle calmness absence of horror at thing have be done be very grievous to captain marrable poor wat parson have once said speaking of wicked brother never must keep two shilling together be ever so long since have to determine that nothing on earth must induce to let have crown must say that did not take amiss when told why must have wanted crown from be always one of thirsty sandbag swallow small drop large alike got out of poor gregory about time that be born gregory be fretting about yet what kill be disgrace of said young man must be disagreeable to have in newspaper said parson john then be such pleasant fellow so handsome always enjoyed society when once have buttoned up breech pocket yet man be clergyman preaching honesty moral conduct living fairly well up to preaching too a far a be concerned captain almost thought that earth sky must be brought together cloud clap with thunder mountain be riven in twain at very mention of father wickedness then sin committed against be so much more sinful than other sin captain have much more sympathetic listener in uphill lane not that of lady there spoke severely against father that entered more cordially into own distress if must save even l out of wreck interest on money must enable to live at home in regiment if must get l must do with l per annum said must just hold head up get along must have to give up manner of thing must never cry about then again must declare that one thing necessary for happiness be that must get whole business of money off mind if must have settled have done with said must be at ease quite right dear said old lady idea about money be that whether have much little must make arrangement so that be matter of thought to money must be just like counter at round game with child must mean nothing come to when once get thing on proper footing thus became very intimate two lady in uphill lane captain from uncle parsonage in lowtown intimacy on part be quite a strong with younger a with elder relative quite a strong doubt more pleasant walked together constantly a cousin may walk discussed turn took place in correspondence with messrs block curling captain marrable have come to uncle house for week ten day have be pressed to remain on till business must be concluded leave of absence lasted till end of november might be prolonged if intended to return to india stay here till end of november said parson john what be use of spending money at london hotel only fall in love with cousin mary so captain did stay obeying one half of uncle advice promising obedience to other half aunt sarah also have fear about falling in love spoke prudent word to mary mary dear said walter be a loving a turtle dove do like so much said mary boldly so do dear be gentleman clever upon whole bear great injury well like think people ought to fall in love when there be strong reason against certainly not if can help pshaw be missish nonsense mary know if girl be to tell fell in love because must help must tell that be worth man love what be reason aunt sarah because must suit mr gilmore be not bound to suit mr gilmore know about then too must not suit walter how must marry wife when have just be robbed of fortune have not slightest idea of falling in love with in spite of what said do hope that can help then feel to just a though be brother have got almost to know what must be to have brother in miss lowther be probably wrong have now known cousin for just month month be quite long enough to realise pleasure of new lover may be doubted whether intimacy of brother doe not take very much longer period for creation think if be said miss marrable after pause must tell about mr gilmore must aunt sarah think must if be really brother must tell be probably case that when miss marrable gave advice opinion of mr gilmore success be greater than circumstance warranted though there have be much said between aunt niece about mr gilmore offer mary have never be able quite to explain own thought feeling did not believe that must be brought to accept be now stronger in opinion than ever be to say so in language must convince aunt aunt must doubt ask why then have left man in doubt though knew that at moment in have be called upon to act have struggled to do right yet there hung over half conviction that have be weak almost selfish dearest friend wrote to spoke to a though must certainly take mr gilmore at last janet fenwick wrote of in letter a of thing almost fixed aunt sarah certainly lived a though expected yet mary be very nearly sure that must not be so must not be better that must write to mr gilmore at once not wait till expiration of weary six month have specified a time at end of might renew proposal have aunt sarah known have be aware how very near mary be to writing of such letter must not probably have suggested that niece must tell cousin anything about mr gilmore did think that telling of tale must make cousin walter understand that must not allow to become interloper tale if told a mary must tell might have very different effect nevertheless mary thought that must tell must be so nice to consult brother must be so pleasant to discus matter with one must sympathise with with one who must not wish to drive into mr gilmore arm simply because mr gilmore be excellent gentleman with snug property even from janet fenwick whom loved dearly have never succeeded in getting sort of sympathy that wanted janet be best friend in world be actuated in matter simply by desire to do good turn to two people whom loved there be sympathy between mary in matter marry said janet will adore afterwards want to adore first said mary so resolved that must tell walter marrable what be position be again down on bank of lurwell sitting together on slope have be made to support hundred yard of canal where river rippled down slightly rapid fall be seated between canal river with foot towards latter walter marrable be just lighting cigar be very easy to bring conversation round to affair of bullhampton a sam be still in prison janet letter be full of mystery shrouded murder of mr trumbull by bye said have something to tell about mr gilmore tell away said a turned cigar round in mouth to complete lighting of edge in wind ah sha unless will interest what be going to tell ought to interest have made proposal of marriage yes knew how must know nobody have told felt sure of from way in speak of thought also that have refused perhaps be wrong there no have refused yes see that there be very much of story to be told mary be so unkind walter there be story one trouble if be not so must not have proposed to tell thought that must give advice tell ought to do if have refused have done so doubt rightly without advice be too late in field to be of service must let tell own story must be good to while do so think must tell if have almost made up mind sha tell way must advise in first place though did refuse matter be still open be to ask again if plea have permission for well yes hope be wrong did so try to be right say be wrong like so much think so good do really feel that affection be so great honour to must not answer a though be quite indifferent to at rate be to come again if plea doe really love how be to say be missish untrue be sure love so that will grieve to lose know will grieve ought not to say so know will ought to tell truth a believe do love know do love if heard be going to marry girl to morrow must make very happy then ca love feel a though must think same of man who wanted to marry let go on with story everybody care for wish to take know aunt sarah feel quite sure that will at last that think ought to do so at once friend janet fenwick can not understand why must hesitate only forgives because be sure that will come right in way day mr fenwick be just same will always talk to a though be fate to live at bullhampton life be not bullhampton nice place very nice love place mr gilmore be rich be quite rich enough fancy inquiring about with just l for fortune then why in god name accept think ought answer question why do not because love a must hope to love husband after captain marrable who have be looking full in face while have be asking question turned somewhat away from a though conversation be over remained motionless be minded so to remain till must tell that be time to move that might return home have given advice presumed be to take what have passed a expression of opinion that be duty to accept offer so favourable so satisfactory to family at rate must say nothing more on subject till must address though loved dearly a cousin yet be in slight degree afraid of now be not sure that be expressing towards by anger amount of displeasure at weakness inconsistency after while turned round suddenly took by hand well mary said well walter what do mean to do after what ought to do what ought to do know what ought to do must marry man for whom have more regard than have for stick simply because be persistent in asking more than have for stick mary what sort of feeling must be when say that must willingly see married to other girl to morrow can that be love have never loved one better never will how can say seems to have got feeling that other girl have want one to love do own want to be first with one have never found one cared for have better wait till find said raising up on arm come let get up go home have asked for advice have given throw away upon man because other people ask because think might a well oblige oblige if do will soon live to repent must do if after marrying man found there be one must love think must come to walter how can tell how can prevent coming to except by loving man do marry care two straw for mr gilmore can not understand how can have courage to think of becoming wife let go home have asked advice have got if take will endeavour to forget gave of course must take did not tell so then of course must guide with how much more accuracy with how much more delicacy of feeling have understood position than have other friend have sympathised with at word spoke to sternly severely almost cruelly be thus that have longed to be spoken to by one who must care enough for must take sufficient interest in to be at trouble so to advise must trust a brother word must be sweet to be ever so severe walked together home in silence very manner be stern to might be just thus that loving brother must carry who have counselled sister wisely have not a yet be assured that counsel must be taken walter said a neared town hope have doubt about doubt about what mary be quite matter of course that will do a tell chapter xvii marquis of trowbridge by end of september have come to be pretty well understood that sam brattle must be allowed to go out of prison unless something in shape of fresh evidence must be brought up on next tuesday there have arisen very strong feeling in county on subject brattle feeling anti brattle feeling might have be called bullhampton feeling anti bullhampton feeling be not that biggest man concerned in bullhampton with certain of hanger on dependent be very clearly of opinion that sam brattle have committed murder that must be kept in prison till period for hanging might come round very big person be marquis of trowbridge under whom poor farmer trumbull have held land who now seemed to think that murder committed on one of tenant be almost a bad a insult to felt personally angry with bullhampton have idea of stopping charity to parish did resolve then there that must have nothing to do with subscription for repair of church at rate for next three year in making up mind on subject be perhaps little influenced by opinion narrative of mr puddleham methodist minister in village be not only that mr trumbull have be murdered so great wise man a lord trowbridge must no doubt know very well that in free country such a england man must not be specially protected from hand of murderer others by fact of being tenant dependent by being in sort possession of great nobleman marquis people be expected to vote for candidate must soon have ceased to be marquis people have failed to do so be constrained also in many respect by term of very short lease must not kill head of game on farm must not sell own hay off land indeed produce other than corn cattle be compelled to crop land in certain rotation must take other land than held under marquis without leave in return for became marquis people tenant shook hand with marquis perhaps once in three year twice year be allowed to get drunk at marquis expense if such be taste provided that have paid rent if duty be heavy privilege be great so marquis felt knew that mantle of security of certain thickness be spread upon shoulder of of people by reason of tenure bound together did not conceive that mantle must be proof against bullet of ordinary assassin hammer of outside ruffian here case be very different hammer have be hammer of outside ruffian to best of lordship belief in belief be supported by constabulary of whole county hammer have be wielded by man of bullhampton have be wielded against tenant by son of person who hold land under gentleman who have property in parish be thus marquis be accustomed to speak of neighbour mr gilmore who in marquis eye be man not big enough to have tenant called people that man a sam brattle must have murdered one a mr trumbull be to marquis insult rather than injury now be to be enhanced by release of man from prison that by order of bench of magistrate on mr gilmore sat there be more in even than be very well known at turnover park seat of lord trowbridge near westbury that mr gilmore gentleman who held property in lordship parish of bullhampton mr fenwick who be vicar of same be damon pythia now lady at turnover who be much devoted to low church have heard doubtless believed that friend mr fenwick be little better than infidel when first have come into county have be very anxious to make out to be high churchman story two about cross candlestick be fabricated for gratification there be at time remnant of great fight going on between trowbridge people great family in neighbourhood on subject must have suited lady stowte john augustus stowte be marquis of trowbridge to have enlisted parson among enemy of class accusation fell so plump to ground be so impossible of support that be obliged to content with knowing that mr fenwick be infidel to do marquis justice must declare that must not have troubled on score if mr fenwick must have submitted to become one of people marquis be master at home lady sophie carolina must have be proud to entertain mr fenwick by week together at turnover have be willing infidel believer to join faction never joined that faction be not only bosom friend of gentleman who owned land in parish be twice more rebellious than gentleman have contradicted marquis flat to face so marquis said when met once about business in parish again when in vicar early day in bullhampton gathering for school festival purpose be made in great home field behind farmer trumbull house mr fenwick misbehaved egregiously upon word patronised said lady sophie laughing did indeed know what be father be just common builder at loring who made money by speculation in brick mortar when lady sophie said be doubt ignorant of fact that mr balfour have be younger son of family much more ancient than own that have taken double first at oxford have be member of learned society in europe have belonged to two three of best club in london from will be seen that marquis of trowbridge must be disposed to think ill of might be done in regard to murder by gilmore fenwick party in parish then there be tale about for there be perhaps foundation that vicar murderer have be very dear friend be certainly believed at turnover that vicar sam brattle have for year past spent best part of sunday fishing together there be tale of rat killing match in have be engaged originating in undeniable fact of certain campaign against rat at mill in vicar have taken ardent part undoubtedly destruction of vermin in regard to one specie preservation for sake of destruction catching of fish shooting of bird be thing lovely in vicar eye perhaps did let pastoral dignity go little by board when sam stooped together with ferret in hand grovelling in dust to get at certain rat advantage in mill gilmore who have seen have told of understand old fellow fenwick have said to friend know very well have got to choose between two thing must be called hypocrite else must be one have doubt that a year go on with will see advantage of choosing latter there be at time frequent discussion between on same subject for be friend who must dare to discus other mode of life reader need not be troubled further now with digression position vicar held in estimation of marquis of trowbridge will probably be sufficiently well understood family at turnover park must have thought great blessing to have have clergyman at bullhampton with whom must have cordially co operated failing have taken mr puddleham methodist minister to arm from mr puddleham learned parish fact parish fable must never have reached for assistance mr fenwick be well aware of used to declare that have objection to must protest that must not see why mr puddleham must not get along in parish just a well a having meaning to keep to slight advantage of parish church vicarage house small tithe of be quite sure that mr puddleham religious teaching be better than none at be by mean convinced so said that for of parishioner mr puddleham be not better teacher than always shook hand with mr puddleham though mr puddleham must never look in face be quite determined that mr puddleham must not be thorn in side in matter of sam brattle imprisonment now intended liberation tidings from parish be doubtless conveyed by mr puddleham to turnover probably not direct still in such manner that great people at turnover knew to whom be indebted now mr gilmore have certainly from first be by mean disposed to view favourably circumstance attaching to sam brattle on saturday night when great blow fell on brattle family demeanour to be changed forgave miller contumacy have always thought that sam have be guilty parson have from first regarded question with great doubt nevertheless opinion too have at first be averse to sam even now when be so resolute that sam must be released founded demand not on sam innocence on absence of evidence against be entitled to fair play harry must say to gilmore be not getting because there be prejudice against hear what that old as sir thomas say sir thomas be very good magistrate if take care will find in trouble for keeping lad locked up without authority be there juryman in country must find guilty because be lying in old man ditch week before in way gilmore also became favourer of sam claim to be released at last came to be understood that on next tuesday must be released unless further evidence must be forthcoming then came to pas that certain very remarkable meeting took place in parish word be brought to mr gilmore on monday th october that marquis of trowbridge be to be at church farm poor trumbull farm on day at noon that lordship thought that might be expedient that mr gilmore must meet on occasion there be note message be brought by mr packer sub agent one of marquis people with whom mr gilmore be very well acquainted will walk down about time packer said mr gilmore will be very happy to see lordship now marquis never sat a magistrate at heytesbury bench have not be present on of occasion on sam have be examined have mr gilmore seen marquis since murder for matter of for last twelve month mr gilmore have just finished breakfast when news be brought to thought might a well walk down see fenwick first interview with parson ended in promise that fenwick must also look in at farm at twelve o'clock marquis be seated in old farmer arm chair in old farmer parlour house be dark gloomy never having be altogether opened since murder with marquis be packer who be standing marquis be pretending to cast eye over one two book have be brought to have be taken over house have stood looking at bed where old man lay when be attacked a though might possibly discover if looked long enough something must reveal truth have gazed awe struck at spot on body have be found have taken occasion to remark to that house be good deal out of order marquis be man nearer seventy than sixty very hale with few sign of age be short plump with hardly beard on face short grey hair of nothing must be seen when wore hat countenance must not have be bad have not weight of marquisate always be there must heart have be bad have not be similarly burdened be silly weak ignorant man whose own capacity must hardly have procured bread for in trade profession have bread not be so adequately provided for by father before mr gilmore said must be here at twelve packer yes lord be past twelve now one minute lord then peer looked again at poor old trumbull book will not wait packer lord have better tell to put horse to yes lord just a packer went out into passage for sake of giving order met mr gilmore ushered into room have mr gilmore yes be very glad to see mr gilmore marquis came forward to shake hand with visitor thought better that must meet about sad affair in parish very sad affair indeed certainly be lord trowbridge mystery make more so suppose there be real mystery mr gilmore suppose there can be doubt that unfortunate young man did did did bear hand in at least think that there be very much doubt lord do indeed think there be none not least police force be of same opinion have considerable experience of own in matter must not venture perhaps to express opinion so confidently if be not backed by police be aware mr gilmore that police be very seldom wrong must be tempted to say that be very seldom right except when circumstance be under nose must say differ from entirely mr gilmore now in case marquis be here interrupted by knock at door before summons must be answered parson entered room with parson came mr puddleham marquis have thought that parson might perhaps intrude mr puddleham be in waiting a make weight must be wanting when mr fenwick have met minister hanging about farmyard have displayed not slightest anger if mr puddleham chose to come in also make good doing so before marquis be nothing to mr fenwick great man looked up a though be very much startled somewhat offended did at last condescend to shake hand first with one clergyman then with other to ask to sit down explained that have come over to make personal inquiry into melancholy matter then proceeded with opinion respecting sam brattle from can hear see said lordship fear there can be doubt that murder have be due to malignity of near neighbour do mean poor boy be in prison lord asked parson of course do mr fenwick constabulary be of opinion know that lord trowbridge perhaps mr fenwick will allow to express own idea constabulary say be of opinion that there be manner of doubt that be one of who broke into tenant house on fatal night a be explaining to mr gilmore when did honour to join in course of long provincial experience have seldom known police to be in error why lord trowbridge if please mr fenwick will go on time here can not be long have proposition be desirous of making to mr gilmore a magistrate acting in part of county of course be not for to animadvert upon what magistrate may do at bench to morrow be sure lordship must make such animadversion said mr gilmore intend for many reason may go so far a to say that demand for young man release will be made be to be released presume a matter of course said parson marquis made allusion to went on if be done must say that think such step must be taken by bench at westbury whither will young man betake home to father of course said parson back into parish with paramour to

marquis to be forbidden to return to own home simply because lord trowbridge think guilty lord father house be own to entertain whom may please a much a be yours be to suggest to to turn out daughter

respectable have not slightest wish that must ill use if desire that family concern must be treated with reserve reticence have better learn to treat family affair of others in same way marquis by time be on foot be calling for packer be calling for carriage horse be calling on very god to send down thunder to punish such insolence a have never heard of like in experience daughter then there came across dismayed mind idea that daughter have be put upon par with young murderer sam brattle perhaps even on par with something worse than daughter be such august person old ugly be true almost dowerless in consequence of nature of family settlement family expenditure be injury insult mr fenwick must make slightest allusion to daughter to talk of in way a a though be mere ordinary human being be not to be endured marquis have hitherto have doubt now be quite sure that mr fenwick be infidel very bad sort of infidel too a said to lady carolina on return home never heard of such conduct

magistrate meeting have come off at heytesbury sam brattle have be discharged mr jones have on occasion indignantly demanded that client must be set free without bail to magistrate must not assent attorney attempted to demonstrate to that must not require bail for reappearance of accused person when accused person be discharged simply because there be evidence against to exposition of law sir thomas brother magistrate must not listen if other person must at last be taken brattle must not then be forthcoming justice must suffer said sir thomas county magistrate a rule be more conspicuous for common sense good instinct than for sound law mr jones may perhaps have be right in view of case nevertheless bail be demanded be not forthcoming without considerable trouble mr jay ironmonger at warminster declined when spoken to on subject by mr fenwick declared that feeling among gentry be so strong against brother in law that must not bring to put forward must do for sake of family when fenwick promised to make good money risk jay declared that difficulty did not lie there there be marquis sir thomas squire greenthorne parson say sir a how must be bailed at then sir if one have misfortune belonging to one one doe want to flaunt in everybody face sir there be trouble too with george brattle from fordingbridge george brattle be prudent hard headed hard working man not troubled with much sentiment caring very little what one must say of a long a rent be paid have taken into head that sam be guilty that be at rate thoroughly bad fellow who must be turned out of brattle nest that kindness be due to with farmer however mr fenwick did prevail then parson became other bondsman have be strongly advised by gilmore by gilmore uncle prebendary at salisbury by others not to put forward in position favour have shown to young man have not borne good result for young man for must be unwise so said friend to subject own name to more remark than be necessary have so far assented a to promise not to come forward if other bailsmen must be procured when difficulty came offered be of necessity accepted when sam be released be like caged animal who when liberty be first offered to doe not know how to use looked about in hall of court house did not at first seem disposed to leave constable have asked whether have mean of getting home to replied that be no more than walk dinner be offered to by constable refused then stood glaring about after while gilmore fenwick came up to squire be first to speak brattle said hope will now go home remain there working with father for present know nothing about said lad not deigning to look at squire sam pray go home at once said parson have done what must for must not oppose mr fenwick if tell to go to to to be going to mention very bad place be restrained by parson presence if tell to go anywheres will go be right then tell to go to mill know a father will let in said almost breaking into sob a spoke that will heartily do tell that have word two with here that will come up call on to morrow then put hand into pocket whispering something offered lad money sam turned away shook head walked off believe that fellow have more to do with than said fenwick know what to believe said gilmore have heard that marquis be in town greenthorne just told so then have better get out of for heytesbury be big enough for two of come have done here might a well jog home gilmore dined at vicarage that evening of course day work be discussed quarrel too have taken place at farmhouse have only yet be in part described to mr fenwick do know feel half triumphant half frightened mr fenwick said to squire know that marquis be old fool imperious conceited altogether unendurable when attempt to interfere yet have kind of feeling because be marquis because owns two thousand so many acre in parish because life at turnover park one ought to hold in awe frank did hold in awe yesterday said squire hold nothing in awe said wife wrong there janet hold in great awe lady in wiltshire more le think may say woman must hold in sort of awe too if did drive beyond by mixture of folly pride can do great deal of mischief know said mr fenwick what can do will do said parson even gave bad name doubt fancy be generous enough to in way before yesterday will now declare that be evil one people wo believe that continued persistent enmity always at work kept within moderate bound be more dangerous now day than hot fever of revengeful wrath marquis ca send out men at arm have knocked on head cast into dungeon can only throw mud at more throw at once le will reach a to sam be agreed that whether be innocent guilty old miller must be induced to regard a innocent a far a joint exertion in direction might avail be innocent before law till have be proved to be guilty said squire then of course there can be nothing wrong in telling father that be innocent said lady squire did not quite admit parson smiled a heard argument acknowledged that must be right to let be considered throughout parish that sam be to be regarded a blameless for night transaction nevertheless mr gilmore mind on subject be not changed have heard from loring squire asked mr fenwick a got up to leave vicarage oh yes constantly be quite well mr gilmore sometimes think that will go off have look at be sure aunt must be glad to see must be wise if ask be bound to say that think must not be wise if be must leave for awhile mary be a good a gold be woman like other woman more be sought more difficult will be always seems to said mr gilmore to be successful in love man must not be in love at at rate must hide then went off home alone feeling on heart that pernicious load of burden come from unrestrained longing for good thing can not be attained seemed to now that nothing in life must be worth thought if mary lowther must continue to say nay seemed to too that unless yea be said very quickly aptitude for enjoyment must be worn out of on next morning immediately after breakfast mr mr fenwick walked down to mill together went through village thence by pathway down to little foot bridge so along river side be beautiful october morning th of october fenwick talked of pheasant gilmore though be sportsman shot rabbit partridge about own property went occasionally to shooting party at distance preserved game there have be old unpleasantness about marquis pheasant have given up there must be doubt that property in parish being chiefly low lying land water mead unfit for covert be not well disposed for preserving pheasant in shooting must more likely shoot lord trowbridge bird than own be equally certain that lord trowbridge pheasant made scruple of feeding on land nevertheless have thought right to give up idea of keeping up head of game for own use in bullhampton upon word if be gilmore said parson a bird rose from ground close at foot must cease to be nice about shooting after what happened yesterday mean that must retaliate frank think must be that good parson law be very good squire law a for doctrine of non retaliation man must be very sure of own motif before submits to if man be quite certain that be really actuated by christian desire to forgive may be very well if there be admixture of base alloy in gold if allows to think that may avoid evil of pugnacity have thing go smooth for here become good christian by same process why then think be likely to fall to ground between two stool have lord trowbridge heard lordship must now have be quite sure that mr fenwick be infidel have doubted whether sam must be found at mill there be hard at work among skeleton timber when friend reached place be glad to see at home again sam said mr fenwick with something however of inner feeling that perhaps might be saluting murderer sam touched cap did not utter word look away from work passed on amidst heap in front of mill came to porch before cottage here a have be wont in idle day miller be sitting with pipe in mouth when saw lady got up ducked head then sat down again if wife be here will just step in mr brattle said mr fenwick be there ma'be said miller pointing towards kitchen window with head so mr fenwick lifted latch entered parson sat down by miller side be heartily glad mr brattle that sam be back with here once again be there at work among rest o ' 'em said miller saw a came along hope will remain here now ca say muster fenwick intends to do so ca say muster fenwick must not be well that must ask not a know on muster fenwick be manifest enough that old man have not spoken to son on subject of murder that there be confidence at least confidence have be expressed between father son one have a yet heard miller utter opinion a to sam innocence guilt of seemed to clergyman to be very terrible condition for two person who be so closely united who be to live together work together eat together have mutual interest hope mr brattle said that give sam full benefit of discharge will get vittles bed trifle of wage if work for did mean that be quite sure must see want comfortable home a long a have one to give there ai much comfort about now be speaking of own opinion of deed be done own opinion be that sam have nothing to do with be sure ca say muster fenwick must be comfort to to think that be innocent ai comfort in talking about not at 'd rayther not if be one to muster fenwick will not ask question will repeat own opinion mr brattle believe that have anything more to do with robbery murder than have hope not muster fenwick murder be terrible crime now if will tell how much be paid lawyer at heytesbury can not say a yet will be trifle need not trouble about mean to pay 'un muster fenwick can pay way a yet though be hard enough at time parson be obliged to promise mr jones bill of charge must be sent to then called wife left mill sam be still up among timber have not once come down while visitor be in cottage mr fenwick have be more successful with woman than parson have be with father have taken upon to say that thoroughly believed sam to be innocent have thanked with many protestation of gratitude did not go back by way have come went up to road crossed thence to outlying cottage be not very far from hampton privet house from cottage there be path across field back to bullhampton led by side of small wood belonging to

woman that ever lived adored man more thoroughly than adored walter marrable be sweet to to see to remember motion of body when walking by side must hardly forbear to touch with shoulder when parting from be regret to to take hand from told that have come to in course of one morning walk wondered at that heart must be thing capable of being given away so quickly have in truth be given away quickly enough though work have not be done in one morning walk have be truly honest to herself to others when said that cousin walter be must be brother to have new brother in brotherly confidence told that heart be devoted to other woman must have suffered blow though must never have confessed even to herself that suffered on that evening when reached home said very little be so tired might go to bed what at nine o'clock asked aunt sarah will stay up if wish said mary before ten be alone in own chamber sitting in own chair with arm folded feeling rather than thinking how divine thing be to be in love what must not do for what must not endure to have privilege of living with what other good fortune in life must be equal to good fortune then thought of relation with mr gilmore shuddered a remembered how near have be to accepting must have be so wrong yet did not see with be sure that be right for feel that in going to can be bit own so thought so dreamed then morning came have to go

mean that dear aunt sarah do say one word of congratulation aunt sarah did not know how to congratulate niece seemed to that congratulation must be false hypocritical to thinking must be most unfitting match seemed to that engagement have be most foolish be astonished at mary weakness be indignant with walter marrable a regarded mary though have twice uttered word two intended a caution yet have never thought possible that girl so steady in ordinary demeanour so utterly averse to flirtation so little given to weakness of feminine susceptibility must fall at once into such quagmire of indiscreet love trouble caution have be intended rather in regard to outward appearance perhaps with view of preventing possibility of slight heart scratch than with idea that danger of nature be to be dreaded a mr gilmore be there a acknowledged suitor suitor a to whose ultimate success aunt sarah have strong opinion must be well cousinly brotherly association confidence must not become so close a to create possible embarrassment such have be nature of aunt sarah caution now in course of week two when young people be in truth still stranger to other when mr gilmore be still waiting for answer mary came to told that engagement be thing completed how must utter word of congratulation mean then to say that disapprove of said mary almost sternly can not say that think wise be not speaking of

prebendary be son of country clergyman who have happened to marry wife with money have absolutely never done anything useful in whole course of life be often very curious to trace source of greatness with mr chamberlaine think came from whiteness of hand from certain knack have of looking a though must say great deal though suited better to be silent say nothing of outside deportment doubt be master mr fenwick always declared that be very fond of mr chamberlaine greatly admired be most perfect philosopher ever met fenwick must say have gone to very centre depth of contemplation in ten year

be brought prebendary shook head least shake in world smiled blandly coffee be very devil in country said harry gilmore who did not dare to say that mixture be good in opposition to uncle opinion after coffee be served in library two men sat silent together for hour gilmore be endeavouring to think what be that made uncle come to bullhampton at last before have arrived at decision on subject there came first little nod then start sweet smile then nod start without smile after soft murmuring of musical snore gradually increased in deepness till became evident that prebendary be extremely happy then occurred to gilmore perhaps mr chamberlaine might become tired of going to sleep in own house that have come to privet a must not do so with comfortable self satisfaction in house of indifferent friend for benefit of such change might perhaps be worth great man while to undergo penalty of bad cup of coffee must not too go to sleep gilmore must not fall asleep not only for few moment on occasion a altogether after akinetos fashion a explained by friend fenwick must not become immoveable one a be divine uncle of mary lowther have ever disturbed that man happiness good dinner pretty ring easy chair china tea cup might all be procured with certainty a long a money lasted here be man before superbly comfortable absolutely happy with greater suffering than what might come to from chance cup of bad coffee while harry gilmore be a miserable devil a might be found between four sea because certain young woman must come to take half of that owned if there be curative philosophy to be found why must not find world might say that philosophy be low philosophy what did matter if must take away out of breast that horrid load be more than must bear declared to that must sell heart with privilege for farthing if must find anybody to take with burden here then be man who have burden be snoring with almost harmonious cadence slowly discreetly one might say artistically quite like gentleman man who so snored must not be happy oh d n said gilmore in private whisper getting up leaving room there be more of envy than of anger in exclamation ah have be out said mr chamberlaine when nephew returned be to look at horse made up never can see use of believe great many men do suppose be excuse for smoking generally now mr chamberlaine did not smoke well did light pipe there be not slightest necessity for telling so harry let see if mr bunker tea be better than coffee then bell be rung mr chamberlaine desired that might have cup of black tea not strong made with good deal of tea poured out rapidly without much decoction if be strong harsh ca sleep wink said tea be brought sipped very leisurely there be then word two said about certain german bath from mr chamberlaine have just returned mr gilmore began to believe that must not be asked to say anything about mary lowther night fate be not so kind prebendary have arisen with intention of retiring for night be already standing before fire with bedroom candle in hand when something happiness probably of own position in life allowed to seek blessing of undivided couch brought to memory fact that nephew have spoken to about young woman young woman who have possessed not even merit of dowry by bye said what have become of flame of yours harry harry gilmore became black glum did not like to hear mary spoken of a flame be standing at moment with back to uncle so remained without answering do mean to say that did not ask after asked uncle if there be scrape harry have better let hear know what call scrape said be not going to marry thank god boy gilmore turned round uncle did not probably see face can assure continued mr chamberlaine that idea made quite uncomfortable set inquiry on foot be not sort of girl that must marry by g said gilmore 'd give acre have in world shilling friend twenty year of life if must only be allowed at moment to think possible that must ever marry good heaven

whether be returning home offering seat in gig sam declined seat said that be going straight to mill be very hard to make crooked thing straight said mr fenwick to a drove up to own hall door chapter xxvi turnover correspondence be hoped that reader will remember that marquis of trowbridge be subjected to very great insolence from mr fenwick during discussion took place in poor old farmer trumbull parlour respecting murder friend vicar did not content with personal invective made allusion to marquis daughter marquis a be driven home in carriage came to sundry conclusion about mr fenwick that man be infidel have now no matter of doubt whatever if infidel then also hypocrite liar traitor thief be not robbing parish of tithe while entrapping soul of men woman be not to be expected that with pastor there must be such a sam brattle carry brattle in parish be true that a yet full blown iniquity have spread only among comparatively small number of tenant belonging to objectionable person who unfortunately owned small number of acre in lordship parish lordship tenant have be murdered with such pastor in parish such objectionable person owning acre to back pastor might not be expected that tenant must be murdered many application have already be made to marquis for church farm a happened that applicant whom marquis intended to favour have declared that did not wish to live in house because of murder marquis felt justified in concluding that if everything about parish be not changed very shortly decent person must be found willing to live in of house now when have be talking of murderer worse than murderer a marquis said to shaking head with horror in carriage a thought of such iniquity infidel clergyman have dared to allude to lordship daughter such man have right even to think of woman so exalted existence of lady stowte must doubt be known to such men among probably allusion in way of faint guess might be made a to mode of life a men guess at king queen even at god goddess to have illustration very base illustration drawn from own daughter in own presence made with object of confuting be more than marquis must endure must not horsewhip mr fenwick must send out retainer to do so thank god there be bishop did not quite see way thought that mr fenwick might be made at least to leave parish turn daughter out of house because oh oh almost put fist through carriage window in energy of action a thought of a happened marquis of trowbridge have never sat in house of common have son who sat there now lord st george be member for county in lord trowbridge have estate be man of world father admired much trusted good deal still have idea that son hardly estimated in proper light position in world be called to fill lord st george be now at home at castle in course of evening father a matter of course consulted son considered that must be duty to write to bishop must like to hear st george idea on subject began of course by saying that did not doubt that st george must agree with must make fuss about said son what pas over yes think so do understand kind of allusion be made to sister wo hurt lord people make allusion to everything now day bishop ca do anything for aught know fenwick may be bosom friend bishop st george be most right thinking man doubt bishop believe be right thinking men be well for that be so very seldom called on to go beyond thinking doubt will think that fellow be indiscreet ca go beyond thinking will only be raising blister for raising what blister lord longer live more convinced become that man must keep own sore open there be something in tone of son conversation pained marquis much son be known to be wise prudent man one who be rising in political world marquis sighed shook head murmured something a to duty lay upon great to bear trouble incident to greatness by meant that sore blister must be kept open if exigency of rank so required ended discussion at last by declaring that must rest upon matter for forty eight hour unfortunately before forty eight hour be over lord st george have gone from turnover castle marquis be left to own light in meantime father son one two friend have be shooting over at bullhampton so that further step of warfare have be taken when mr mr fenwick met marquis on pathway on following day lordship sat in own private room thinking of grievance have thought of of little else for now nearly sixty hour suggest to to turn out daughter heaven earth daughter be well aware that though son often differed must never so safely keep out of trouble a by following son advice surely be matter per se standing altogether on own bottom very different from ordinary detail of life on son be wont to disagree daughter lady sophie carolina stowte have be suggested to to turn out of house because oh oh insult be so great that human marquis must stand longed to be writing letter to bishop be proud of letter pen paper be at hand did write right rev dear lord bishop think right to represent to lordship conduct believe may be justified in saying misconduct of reverend fenwick vicar of bullhampton knew friend christian name very well did not choose to have appear that august memory have be laden with thing so trifling may have heard that there have be most horrid murder committed in parish on one of tenant suspicion be rife that murder be committed in part by young man son of miller who life under person who owns land in parish family be very bad one of daughter being a understand prostitute other day thought right to visit parish with view of preventing if possible sojourn there among people of objectionable character when there be encountered by mr fenwick not only in most unchristian spirit in bearing so little gentlemanlike can not describe to have obtruded into presence into one of own house very house of murdered man there when be consulting with person to whom have alluded a to expediency of ridding ourselves of objectionable character met with ribaldry personal insolence when tell lordship that made insinuation about own daughter so gross that can not repeat to be sure that need go further there be present at meeting mr puddleham methodist minister mr henry gilmore landlord of person in question lordship have probably heard character in religious point of view of gentleman be not for to express opinion of motif can induce one to retain position a incumbent of parish do believe have right to ask from lordship for inquiry into scene have attempted to describe to expect protection for future for moment doubt that lordship will do what be right in matter have honour to be right reverend dear lord bishop most obedient faithful servant trowbridge read over thrice became so much in love with composition on third reading have not slightest doubt a to expediency of sending have much doubt that bishop must do something to mr fenwick must make parish too hot to hold disgrace to church of england when fenwick came home from pycroft common found letter from bishop awaiting have driven forty mile on day be rather late for dinner wife however came upstairs with in order that might hear something of story brought letter with did not open that from bishop till be half dressed then burst out into loud laughter a read what be frank asked wife through open door of own room here be such game said never mind let have dinner then will see reader however may be quite sure that mr fenwick did not wait till dinner be served before knew nature of game bishop letter to vicar be very short very rational be not that made vicar laugh inside bishop letter be that from marquis dear mr fenwick said bishop after good deal of consideration have determined to send enclosed do so because have made rule never to receive accusation against one of clergy without sending to person accused will of course perceive that alludes to matter lie outside of control right of inquiry perhaps will allow a friend to suggest to that be always well for parish clergyman to avoid controversy quarrel with neighbour that be especially expedient that must be on good term with who have influence in parish perhaps will forgive if add that spirit of pugnacity though doubt may lead to much that be good have bad tendency if not watched closely pray remember that lord trowbridge be worthy man doing duty on whole well that position though be entitled to veneration be entitled to much respect if can tell that will feel grudge against for what have taken place will be very happy will observe have be careful that letter will have official character yours very faithfully c c c letter be answered that evening before answer be written marquis of trowbridge be discussed between husband wife not in complimentary term mr fenwick on occasion be more pugnacious than husband must not forgive man who have hinted to bishop that husband held living from unworthy motif that be bad clergyman dear girl said fenwick what can expect from as ear expect downright slander from such man a marquis of trowbridge if be must tell bishop so will tell nothing of kind will write about marquis with kindliest feeling feel kindly yes do poor old idiot have nobody to keep right doe best can according to light have doubt think that be everything be horrid be not bit angry with must be a civil to to morrow a nature must allow if must only be civil to then wrote letter will complete correspondence dated for following day bullhampton vicarage oct dear lord bishop return marquis letter with many thanks can assure take in proper spirit little hint a to pugnacity of disposition will endeavour to profit by wife tell that be given to combativeness have doubt that be right a to lord trowbridge can assure lordship will not bear malice against even think ill of because of complaint probably differ in opinion about almost everything be one of who pity condition of who be so blinded a to differ from next time be thrown into company will act exactly a though such letter have be written a if such meeting have taken place a describes hope may be allowed to assure lordship without reference to motif for keeping that will be very slow to give up living in lordship diocese a letter to be unofficial thank heartily for sending in such form have ventured to reply in same strain be dear lord bishop very faithful servant francis fenwick there said a folded handed to wife will never see remainder of series must give shilling to know how bishop get out of in writing to marquis crown to see marquis rejoinder reader will be troubled with a must hardly price so high a did vicar bishop letter really contained little beyond assurance on part that mr fenwick have not meant anything wrong that matter be one with bishop have concern be worded with most complete episcopal courtesy rejoinder of marquis be long elaborate very pompous did not exactly scold bishop expressed very plainly opinion that church of england be going to dog because bishop have not power of utterly abolishing clergyman who might be guilty of offence against so distinguished person a marquis of trowbridge what be to be done about carry brattle mr fenwick when have expressed anger against marquis be quite ready to own that matter of carry position be to of much greater moment than wrath of peer how be to put out hand save brand from burning fenwick in ill considered zeal suggested that might be brought to vicarage wife at once knew that step must be dangerous in way how must live what must do must other servant think of why must other servant mind asked fenwick wife on matter must have way of own that project be soon knocked on head doubt father house be proper place for then father be so dour man upon word said vicar be only person in world of whom believe to be afraid when get at speak to a must to of course know nevertheless if anything be to be done for carry brattle seemed a though must be done by father permission assistance there can be doubt that be duty said mr fenwick will not say that a certainty said husband there be point at presume father may be justified in disowning child possession of power doubt keep others from going wrong what one want be that father must be presumed to have power that when time come must never use be comfortable doctrine be of teaching wrath abomination of sinner before sin pardon love after if be to run away from janet frank dare to speak of anything so horrible must say now probably that be to do so must never blast eye by looking at again know must run after implore to come back to must do anything of kind be proper to talk about will go to bed be very difficult to make crooked thing straight said vicar a walked about room after wife have left suppose ought to go into reformatory know must must like to ask after what said be probably case mr fenwick must have be able to do duty better have harsher feeling towards sinner be mixed with charity chapter xxvii never shamed none of something must be done about carry brattle at once vicar felt that have pledged to take step for welfare seemed to a thought of matter that there be only two step possible might intercede with father might use influence to have received into house of correction retreat in might be kept from evil disciplined for good knew that latter must be safer plan if must be brought to bear must certainly be easier for thought that have almost pledged to girl not to attempt felt sure that must not accede to in doubt went up to friend gilmore intending to obtain light of friend wisdom found squire prebendary together at once started subject will do good mr fenwick said mr chamberlaine after two younger men have be discussing matter for hour do mean ought not to try to do good mean that such effort never come to anything unfortunate creature in world then must be left to go to destruction in own way be useless think to treat special case in exceptional manner when such be done be done

prebendary subject be so full of difficulty that one must not touch rashly henry where be last quarterly never take sir ought to have remembered said mr chamberlaine smiling blandly then took up

proud of position who seek to win woman who owns preference for man miss marrable heart have now become very soft began to perceive of own knowledge that mr gilmore be at rate gentleman must take in way must get perhaps be to say might be then stopped must tell everything have strong idea that be first duty to be true to own sex to own niece be to tell man whole story must do niece harm still believed that match with captain marrable must be broken off even be done must be very long thought before mary must bring to listen with patience to suitor of course must be best for that episode in mary life must be forgotten put out of sight a soon a possible have not dangerous captain come up mary doubt so thought miss marrable must at last have complied with friend advice have accepted marriage be in respect advantageous if episode must only get forgotten put out of sight might do so still there must be delay miss marrable after waiting for minute to consider determined that must tell something doubt said captain marrable income be so small that match be one mary friend can not approve think much of money said still be essential to comfort mr gilmore what mean to say be that be last man in world to insist upon kind of thing to appear to triumph because income be larger than man miss marrable be now quite sure that mr gilmore be gentleman if match be to be broken off can not say that will be broken off may be certainly be possible there be difficulty may necessarily separate if be so feeling will be same a have always be since first knew be have got to say then told pretty nearly everything said nothing of money walter marrable must have inherited have not be for colonel marrable iniquity did tell that young people must have income except captain pay poor mary

will be broken off said that be opinion think can go on be will do for time will suffer greatly then will wait said mr gilmore will go home wait again if there be chance can live hope god grant that may not hope in vain must do best to make happy will leave now be very thankful for kindness there must be no good in seeing mary think not mr gilmore suppose not must only feel be teasing will not

objurgation made against ill fortune in assurance to others that be ruined for life indeed man must have be much more unhappy than be walter marrable in day to be added trouble did not endeavour to hide from mary that misery came to from own father before end of november sundry renewed effort be made to save portion of money lawyer descended so low a to make offer to take l might have saved humiliation for l l must have be made to be forthcoming walter marrable when time came be painfully anxious to fight somebody be told very clearly by messrs block curling that there be nobody whom must fight father that even by fighting father must never obtain penny belief said mr curling be that must put father in prison probably be not object marrable be forced to own that be not object did so in tone seemed to imply that prison be even for life must be best place for father block curling have be solicitor to marrables for ever so many year though did not personally love colonel have professional feeling that blackness of black sheep of family must not be made public at rate by family by family solicitor almost family have black sheep be especial duty of family solicitor to keep family black sheep from being dragged into front visible rank of family captain have be fatally wrong in signing paper have signed must take consequence think captain marrable that must save in way by proceeding against colonel said mr curling have not slightest intention of proceeding against said captain in great dudgeon then left office shook dust off foot a against block curling a well a against father after immediately after have one other interview with father a told uncle devil prompted to go down to portsmouth to see man to whom interest must have be dearer than to world beside who have robbed so ruthlessly there be nothing to be gained by such visit money counsel even consolation must be forthcoming from colonel marrable probably walter marrable felt in anger that must be unjust that father must escape without word to remind from son mouth of that have done for son colonel held staff office at portsmouth son came upon in lodging one evening a be dressing to go out to dinner be that walter said battered old reprobate appearing at door of bed room be very glad to see believe said son well what must have say if will only behave decently will be glad to see have given example in way sir have not decency indeed now walter if be going to talk about horrid money tell at once wo listen to be kind of sir have be unfortunate a soon a can repay part of will since have be back have done everything in power to get portion of for must have got for stupid people in bedford row after money ought to have be mine be what suppose felt when enabled to draw by heaven be cool mean to be cool be always cool cab will be here to take to dinner in very few minute hope will not think be running away from mean to go till have heard what have got to say said captain then pray say quickly upon colonel stood still faced son not exactly with look of anger assuming appearance a though be person injured be thin old man who wore padded coat painted beard eyebrow have false teeth who in spite of chronic absence of mean always be possessed of clothes apparently just new from hand of west end tailor be one of men who through long useless ill flavoured life always contrive to live well to eat drink of best to lie softly to go about in purple fine linen yet never have money among certain set colonel marrable though well known be still popular be good tempered well mannered sprightly in conversation have not scruple in world be over seventy have lived hard must have known that there be not much more of for yet have qualm fear may be doubted whether knew that be bad man than whom must find none worse though be to search country from one end to to lie to steal not out of till pocket because knew danger to cheat not at card table because have never come in way of learning lesson to indulge passion though cost to others might be ruin for life to know god own bodily sens duty that owed to god to eat produce nothing to love one to have learned nothing how to sit at table like gentleman to care not at for country even for profession to have creed party friend conscience to be troubled with nothing touched heart such have be be be to be life of colonel marrable perhaps be accounted to a merit by that did not quail at coming fate when doctor warned that must go soon unless must refrain from other so wording caution that colonel must not know did know let refrain a must must go soon resolved that must refrain thinking that charm of wretched life be sweet enough to be worth such sacrifice in other respect did caution affect never asked whether have aught even to regret before died to fear afterwards there be many colonel marrables about in world known well to be so at club in drawing room by tradesman who supply men give dinner woman smile upon best of coat boot be supplied to never lack cigar champagne have horse to ride servant to wait upon more obsequious than servant of other people men will lend money too well knowing that there be chance of repayment now then one hears horrid tale of young girl who surrender to such one absolutely for love upon whole colonel marrables be popular be hard to follow man quite to end to ascertain whether doe go out softly at last like snuff of candle just with little stink will say a quickly a can said captain can gain nothing know by staying here in company not while be so very uncivil civil indeed have to day made up mind not for sake for of family will not prosecute a criminal for gross robbery have perpetrated be nonsense walter know a well a do be going back to india in few week trust may never be called upon to see again will not if can help may be toss up of may die first will be last meeting hope may remember on death bed that have utterly ruined son in relation of life be engaged to marry girl whom loved be over because of have heard of walter really congratulate on escape ca strike do that because of age because be father suppose have heart can not make feel dear boy have appetite must go satisfy so saying colonel escaped captain allowed father to make way down stair into cab before followed though have thus spoken to father of blasted hope in regard to mary lowther have not a yet signified consent to measure by engagement be to be brought altogether to end question have come to be discussed widely among friend a be custom with such question in such circumstance mary have be told from side that be bound to give up that be bound to give up for own sake more especially for that engagement if continued must never lead to marriage that must in meantime be absolutely ruinous to to parson john came up spoke to with strength for have not hitherto given parson john credit aunt sarah be very gentle with never veered from opinion that engagement must of necessity be abandoned mr fenwick wrote to letter full of love advice mr fenwick made journey to loring to discus matter with discussion between be very long if be saying on account said mary be quite useless on what other account mr gilmore indeed indeed be not thinking of be out of mind altogether say because know be impossible that cousin must be married because such engagement be destructive to party for myself said mary can make difference will make greatest difference must wear to piece with deferred hope there be nothing so killing so terrible so much to be avoided then for how be man thrown about on world a will be to live in such condition upshot of be that mary wrote letter to cousin proposing to surrender engagement declaring that must be best for that must agree to accept surrender plan have adopted before of leaving responsibility to must not suffice have come to perceive during weary discussion that if way out of bondage be to be given to walter marrable must come from action not from have intended to be generous when left everything to be explained to both by aunt mr fenwick that generosity be of kind must not use be for to take responsibility upon be for to make move be in short for to say that engagement must be over very day that mr fenwick left wrote letter captain marrable have in pocket when went down to bid last farewell to father have be sad weary tear laden performance writing of letter have resolved that sign of tear must be on paper have rubbed moisture away from eye dozen time during work lest must fall there be little of intended pathos in there be expression of love till told at end that must always love dearly there be repining mention of own misery used argument others have used to then drew conclusion remembered that be to tell that must still be true to must in fact be asking for such pledge back from said not word of such constancy on own part be best for of that engagement must be broken off therefore broken off be must be now for ever be upshot of mary lowther letter illustration mary lowther writes to walter marrable captain marrable when received though acknowledged truth of argument loved girl far too well to feel that release gave comfort have doubtless felt that engagement be burthen on that must not have entered into have not felt sure of diminished fortune that there be fearful probability that

telling that sadness of such walk must be too much for saying to aunt with smile be once again out with on towing path there must be chance of ever coming home must not ask to turn back said when must

again in regular work sam have remained at home with fair average regularity vicar have heard nothing more of carry brattle have be unable to trace to learn where be living have taken various occasion to mention name to mother mr brattle knew nothing of believed that sam be equally ignorant with vicar found impossible to speak to sam on subject though knew that have be with sister more than once when be living at pycroft common a for miller one have mentioned carry name to since day on vicar have made attempt from day to present there have be if not ill blood at least cold blood between mr fenwick old brattle vicar have gone down to mill a often a usual having determined that what have occurred must make difference with intercourse with mr brattle fanny have be a kind on side a usual miller have kept out of way retreating from openly going from house to mill a soon a appeared never speaking to taking other notice of beyond slight touch of husband be still angry with said one day to mr brattle shook head smiled sadly said that must pas over day only that jacob be so persistent with vicar held little communication sam in day never went to church though worked at mill pretty constantly must absent from village occasionally for day two together tell one where have be strangest most important piece of business going on at time in bullhampton be building of new chapel tabernacle people called salem for mr puddleham first word a to erection reached mr fenwick ear from grime builder carpenter who meeting in bullhampton street pointed out to bit of spare ground just opposite vicarage gate morsel of green on building have ever yet stood told that marquis have given for chapel indeed said fenwick hope may be convenient large enough for same wish have be little farther from gate said in cheery tone showing thereby considerable presence of mind that building must be so placed be trial to knew at once that spot must have be selected to annoy doubtless land in question be property of marquis of trowbridge when came to think of have doubt on matter nevertheless small semi circular piece of grass immediately opposite to own swinging gate looked to world a though be appendage of vicarage cottage built there must have be offensive staring brick methodist chapel with word salem inserted in large letter over door must a be aware flout time left entered garden have always be specially careful to avoid semblance of quarrel with methodist minister have in way shown willingness to regard mr puddleham flock a being equal to own in general gift of civilisation to mr puddleham have be very civil sending fruit vegetable out of vicarage garden lending newspaper when little puddlehams be born mr fenwick always inquired after mother infant greatest possible care have be exercised at vicarage since mr fenwick coming to show that established church did not despise dissenting congregation for last three year there have be talk of new chapel mr fenwick have discussed site with mr puddleham large commodious spot of ground remote from vicarage have a believed be chosen when heard tidings saw what must be effect of building seemed to almost impossible that marquis must condescend to such revenge went at once to mr puddleham learned from that grime story be true have be in december after christmas foundation be to be begun at once said mr puddleham so that brickwork might go on a soon a frost be over mr puddleham be in high spirit expressed hope that must be in new chapel by next august when vicar asked why change of site be made being careful to show chagrin by tone of voice mr puddleham remarked that marquis agent thought that must be improvement in opinion quite coincide said mr puddleham looking very stern showing teeth a be displaying inclination for parish quarrel fenwick still prudent made objection to change dropped word of displeasure in mr puddleham hearing believe can do said mr fenwick boiling with passion can doubt said vicar do mean to say street be to do what like with street be queen highway mean that belongs to public be not street take that land in village belongs to marquis never knew of common right believe there be be meanest thing ever heard of in life said mr fenwick there agree with later in day when have be thinking of for hour again spoke to wife will write to marquis remonstrate will probably be of avail think ought to do so for sake of who come after will be able to bother good deal if can hing else added laughing feel too must quarrel with somebody wo quarrel with dear old puddleham if can help chapter xxxv mr puddleham new chapel illustration vicar devoted week to consideration of grievance about chapel then did write to marquis indeed there be time to be lost if intended to do anything a on second day after interview with mr grime grime with two men to assist began measuring on devoted spot sticking in little mark for corner of projected building turning up sod here there mr grime be staunch churchman though in way of business be very glad to have building of methodist chapel of pagan temple if such might come in way yet even though possibly might give offence to great man shadow in bullhampton be willing to postpone work for two three day at vicar request grime vicar said be not quite sure that like illustration site of mr puddleham new chapel well sir sir be thinking sir that maybe might take unkind in marquis think will write to perhaps must mind giving over for day two grime yielded at once took spade measurement away although mr puddleham fretted good deal mr puddleham have be much elated by prospect of new bethel have must be confessed received into mind idea that must be good thing to quarrel with vicar under auspex of landlord fenwick character have hitherto be too strong for have be forced into parochial quiescence religious amity almost in spite of conscience be much older man than mr fenwick having be for thirty year in ministry have always previously enjoyed privilege of being on bad term with clergyman of establishment have be glory to be poacher on man manor to filch soul a be out of keeping of pastor of higher grade than to say severe thing of short coming of endowed clergyman to obtain recognition of position by activity of operation in guise of blister vicar understanding something of have with malice towards gentleman determined to rob mr puddleham of blistering power there be doubt certain pleasure in poaching doe not belong to licit following of game man ca poach if right of shooting be accorded to mr puddleham have not be quite happy in mind amidst ease amiable relation mr fenwick enforced upon have long since begun to feel that few cabbage peach did not repay for loss of pleasant bitter thing must have be to say in daily walk from pulpit of salem have not be thus hampered confined dominated hitherto have hardly gained single soul from under mr fenwick grasp have indeed on balance lost grasp on soul be beginning to be aware that be so because of cabbage peach told that though have not hankered after flesh pot though must have preferred to be without flesh pot have submitted to be painfully conscious of guile of young man who have a be cheated out of appropriate acerbity of religion without proselyting sect can hardly maintain ground beneath shadow of endowed domineering church war be necessary to mr puddleham have come to be hardly anybody at because be at peace with vicar of parish in be established eye have be becoming gradually open to for year when have be present at bitter quarrel between vicar marquis have at once told that now be opportunity have intended to express clear opinion to mr fenwick that mr fenwick have be very wrong in speaking to marquis a have spoken a be walking out of farm house be preparing word a to respect due to in authority happened however at moment wind be taken out of sail by strange comparison vicar made to between sin of two minister of god a be sin of carry brattle mr puddleham at moment have be cowed quelled be not quite able to carry in vicar presence a though be vicar equal desire for quarrel remained when be suggested to by mr packer marquis man of business that green opposite to vicarage gate must be convenient site for chapel that marquis be ready to double before proffered subscription then saw plainly that moment have come that be fitting that must gird up loin return future cabbage to proud donor mr puddleham have eye keenly set on scene of future ministration be aware of grime default almost a soon a man with myrmidon have left ground at once went to grime with heavy denunciation with threat of marquis with urgent explanation a to necessity of instant work grime be obdurate vicar have asked to leave work for day two of course must do what vicar asked if must be allowed to do a much a for vicar of parish bullhampton must be in mr grime opinion place for anybody to live in mr puddleham argued matter out argued in vain mr grime declared that there be time enough that must have work finished by time fixed unless indeed marquis must change mind mr puddleham regarded a most improbable supposition marquis doe change mind mr grime said then walked forth from mr grime house with much offence by time bullhampton knew of quarrel knew of although mr fenwick have be so very careful to guard from quarrelling at have not spoken word in anger on subject to anyone wife in making request to grime have done so with hypocritical good humour nevertheless be aware that parish be becoming hot about when sat down to write letter to marquis be almost minded to give up idea of writing to return to grime to allow measuring sod turning to be continued why must place of worship opposite to gate be considered by a injury why must psalm singing of christian brother hurt ear a walked about garden if through infirmity of nature eye ear be hurt what be to great purport for have be sent into parish be not about to create enmity by opposition be not special duty to foster love goodwill among people after within own vicarage ground have that be intended that must posse that held very firmly poor mr puddleham have such firm holding why must quarrel with mr puddleham because ill paid preacher sought to strengthen ground on salem stood a paused however to think of there came upon conviction that in thing be to be done marquis be determined to punish personally must not resist temptation of fighting marquis then if succumbed easily in matter must not follow almost a matter of course that battle against must be carried on elsewhere if yielded now resolving to ignore altogether idea of own comfort own taste must thereby maintain that tranquillity in parish thought so desirable have already seen that in mr puddleham manner to made sure that mr puddleham be ambitious to be sword in right hand of marquis personally vicar be pugnacious few men perhaps be more so if there must be fight let come on must do best turning matter thus backwards forward in mind came at last to conclusion that there must be fight consequently wrote following letter to marquis bullhampton vicarage january lord marquis learned by chance other day in village that new chapel for use of methodist congregation of parish be to be built on little open green immediately opposite vicarage gate that special spot of ground have be selected given by lordship for purpose at know what truth there may be in except mr grime carpenter here have received order from agent about work may probably be case that site have be chosen by mr packer not by lordship a real delay to building can at time of year arise from short postponement of beginning have asked mr grime to desist till will have written to on subject can assure lordship in first place that clergyman of established church in kingdom can be le unwilling than be that who dissent from teaching in parish must have commodious place of worship if land belonged to in place must give for purpose be there no other available site than chosen must not for moment remonstrate against have heard with satisfaction from mr puddleham that spot be chosen near cross road in village on there be more space to a believe there be objection must certainly be nearer than now selected to majority of congregation of course must not be for to trouble lordship a to ground on methodist chapel must be built unless have reason to show why site now chosen be objectionable for moment question lordship right to give site there be something le than quarter of acre in patch in question though hitherto have always regarded a belonging in sort to vicarage a being part a be of entrance feel convinced that a landlord of ground must not entertain idea of bestowing for purpose without being sure of right to do so raise question on point believing that there be none to be raised respectfully submit to lordship whether such erection a contemplated by will not be lasting injury to vicarage of bullhampton whether must wish to inflict lasting gratuitous injury on vicar of parish greatest portion of belongs to yourself doubt life will be very possible to wife to succeeding vicar wife with red brick chapel built a kind of watch tower over vicarage gate so must life be possible at turnover park with similar edifice immediately before lordship hall door knowing very well that reasonable want of methodist can not make such building on spot necessary doubt must not consent to now venture to ask to put stop to building here for same reason be there no other site in parish equally commodious must not say word have honour to be lordship most obedient servant francis fenwick lord trowbridge when received letter when have only partially read have not at all digested be disposed to yield point be silly man thinking much too highly of own position believing entitled to unlimited deference from who in way came within ray of magnificence easily made angry by opposition be not naturally prone to inflict evil did in degree recognise a duty attached to splendour that must be beneficent to inferior with whom be connected great a be wrath against present vicar of bullhampton thoroughly a conceived to be expedient that so evil minded pastor must be driven out of parish nevertheless felt scruple at taking step must be injurious to parish vicar let parish vicar be who might packer be sinner who have originated new plan for punishing mr fenwick packer with assistance of mr puddleham marquis though have in sort authorised plan have in truth thought very little about when vicar spoke of lasting injury to vicarage when lord trowbridge remembered that owned two thousand two acre within parish a mr puddleham have told began to think that chapel have better be built elsewhere vicar be pestilent man to whom punishment be due punishment must be made to attach to man rather than to man office so be working marquis mind till marquis came upon horrid passage in vicar letter in be suggested that building of methodist chapel in own park immediately in front of own august hall door might under certain circumstance be expedient remark be almost a pernicious unpardonable a have be made about lordship daughter be manifest to that vicar intended to declare that marquis be more than other people that declaration be made insisted on with determination of insulting have apostate priest be capable of feeling proper appreciation of own position that of marquis must have said nothing of turnover park when marquis have read letter second time have digested perceived that whole tenour be bad that writer be evil minded that request made by must be granted even though obnoxious chapel must have to be pulled down for benefit of vicar must be put up for punishment of vicar man who want to have favour done for can hardly hope to be successful if asks for favour with insolence so heart of marquis be hardened be strengthened to do misbecame a gentleman landlord did not answer letter for time saw packer saw head agent got out map of property map of property be not very clear in matter remembered space well convinced that other place in bullhampton must be so appropriate for methodist chapel at end of week caused reply to be written to mr fenwick must not demean by writing with own hand gave order to head agent head agent

not prosecuted for being in garden nobody must be entitled to punish for offence that a have be admitted that there be evidence connecting with murder policeman must have right to confine to one parish argued matter so well that mr fenwick be left without much to say be unwilling to press own responsibility in matter of bail therefore allowed question to fall through tacitly admitting that if sam chose to leave parish there be nothing in affair of murder to hinder went back therefore to inexpediency of young man departure telling that must rush right into devil jaw may be so mr fenwick said sam be sure will never be out of 'em a long a stay here in bullhampton what be about vicar a asked question have very distinct idea in own head a to cause of quarrel be aware that sympathy be

afterwards sooner than 'd be hurt by anything 'd be doing so parted a friend rather than a enemy though vicar knew very well that young man be wrong to go leave father mother that in probability must fall at once into bad mode of living conversation about carry brattle have so softened heart to other that mr fenwick found impossible to be severe knew moreover that severity of expression must have be of avail must have stopped sam from going have preached to for hour after that building of chapel went on apace large tradesman from salisbury being quicker in work than must have be small

effect of special visit mr gilmore have made to on th of march have come to with settled purpose pointing out to that have now waited certain number of month since have heard of rupture between mary cousin naming exact period mr fenwick have bade wait before must move again in matter asking whether might not now venture to take step mr fenwick have felt to be unfair that very word must be quoted against a to three four month feeling that have said three four instead of six seven to soften matter to friend nevertheless have be induced to write to mary lowther be thinking that perhaps might ask to come to again mr gilmore have said when mr fenwick rebuked for impatience if did that thing might come on naturally must come if did ask because hate so much that will not venture to come near what nonsense be harry have nothing to do with hating if thought that even disliked must tell so believing that must be for best of course if asked here just at present must not remember that be nearest neighbour feel that be pressed to come with reference to hope therefore must not come exactly if will think of how must be otherwise wait till be in india wait at rate till summer then frank will do best to get here will wait said mr gilmore immediately took leave a though there be other subject of conversation now possible to since return from loring mr gilmore life at own house have be quite secluded even fenwicks have hardly seen though lived so near to have rarely be at church have seen company at home since uncle prebendary have left have not dined even at vicarage more than once twice have of course be frequently discussed between mr mr fenwick have made vicar very unhappy have expressed fear that friend must be driven crazy by foolish indulgence in hopeless passion have suggested that might perhaps be for best that gilmore must let place travel abroad for two three year so that in way disappointment might be forgotten mr fenwick still hoped better thing than probably thought more of mary lowther than did of harry gilmore still believed that cure for sorrow might be found if one must only be patient other must not despair mr gilmore have promised that must wait then mr fenwick have written letter to there came very quick answer in respect to trouble about chapel mary lowther be sympathetic droll a must have be have there be upon weight of love misfortune have trust said in mr quickenham who doubt must succeed in harassing enemy even though might be unable to obtain ultimate conquest then there seemed to be fair prospect that building must fall of surely must be great triumph after might not fairly be hoped that pleasantness of vicarage garden mr puddleham must see time visited chapel might be quite a galling a vexatious to a must be ugliness of methodist building to fenwicks must take comfort in reflection that side will be quite a full of thorn a own said mary perhaps there may come blessed opportunity for crushing altogether by heaping hot coal of fire on head offer use of vicarage lawn for one of school tea party must think must about finish be very well be written on purpose to show to mr fenwick that mary must still be funny in spite of trouble pith of letter a mr fenwick well understood lay in few word of last paragraph suppose dear that be going to die of broken heart mean to live to be a happy a of must let go on in own way be not at sure that being married be not more trouble than be worth be deceiving in saying mary knew well enough mr fenwick too guessed that be so nevertheless be plain enough that nothing more must be said about mr gilmore just at present ought to blow up make come to mr fenwick said to husband be very well to say that one man ca blow up a woman do men talk to other about thing concern nearly unless be about money what do talk about then about matter concern nearly game politics state of weather if be to mention mary name to must feel to be impertinence can say what please soon after gilmore came again to vicarage be careful to come when vicar must not be there sauntered into garden by little gate from churchyard showed at drawing room window without going round to front door never go to front

round though be nearly pitch dark do come in harry illustration do come in harry then mr gilmore came in seated before fire mr fenwick understood mood so well that must not say word to hurry if chose to talk about mary lowther knew very well what must say to must not herself introduce subject spoke for awhile about brattles saying that old man have suffered much since son have gone from sam have left bullhampton at end of january never having returned to mill after visit to vicar have not be heard of since gilmore however have not be to see tenant though expressed interest about brattles have manifestly come to vicarage with object of talking upon matter more closely interesting to did write to loring mr fenwick asked at last wrote to mary soon after be last here have answered yes wrote again almost at once must not write a have said so much to about chapel did not allude to anything else then ca quite say that harry have written to out of very full heart telling what thought a to future life generally just alluding to wish respecting well said just what might have be expected that for present must rather be let alone have let alone have spoken to written to doe not mean to say

need ask because be here there be saying whom may meet then chance will be gone again be that know about woman harry do think that girl whom love so dearly will take up with one man after in fashion who can say be not very long in taking up a call with captain marrable must be happier if be here even if did not see her of course must see of course must propose again of course must refuse then there be hope say that wait till summer come then if can influence will have here if find that remaining at privet alone be wearisome to of course be wearisome then go up to london abroad anywhere for change take occupation in hand stick to be so easily said mr fenwick man ever did anything by moping mope know be speaking plainly may be angry with if please be not at angry with think hardly understand do understand said mr fenwick speaking with energy must command be most anxious to do that wish can not be done in day if be to ask now must not come if came must not be for good wait till summer may be sure that harm will be done by little patience then went away declaring again that must wait with patience saying at same time that must remain at home a for going to london said must hing there when find that there be chance left then probably will go abroad be belief said vicar that evening when wife told what have occurred that will never have not because doe not like must not

whenever be funny have something to hide wife a heard wit be quite sure that have plan in head about chapel at half past six there came mr chamberlaine nephew conversation about chapel be still continued canon from salisbury be very eloquent learned also upon subject eloquence be brightest while lady be still in room learning be brought forth most manifestly after have retired be very clear in opinion that marquis have law on side in giving land for purpose in question even if must be shown that be simply lord of manor not so possessed of spot a to do what liked in for own purpose mr chamberlaine expressed opinion that although might think otherwise must be held to be for benefit of community that chapel must be built in court must injunction against building be obtained must give leave to have put on man ground said queen counsel there be question of man ground here said member of chapter be not so sure of continued mr quickenham may not be ground of one man if be ground of ten twenty be same thing then there must be lawsuit said vicar might come to said queen counsel be sure must have leg to stand upon said member of chapter see that at said gilmore if land be common to parish marquis of trowbridge can not give to part of parishioner because be lord of manor for purpose must think can said mr chamberlaine be quite sure ca said mr quickenham same may be very difficult to prove that have right in meantime there stand chapel fact accomplished if ground have be bought purchaser have wanted title think probable marquis must never have got money there can be doubt that be very ungentlemanlike said mr chamberlaine there be afraid ca help said mr quickenham good law be not defined very clearly here in england good manner have never be defined at want anyone to help on matter a said mr chamberlaine who did not altogether like mr quickenham dare say not said mr quickenham yet question may be open to argument man may do what like with own can hardly be called ungentlemanlike because give away to person happen to like illustration dare say not said mr quickenham know what think about in salisbury said mr chamberlaine be just possible that may be little hypercritical in salisbury said quickenham there be nothing else discussed nothing else thought of in vicarage first of june have be day now fixed for opening of new chapel here be already in april mr fenwick be quite of opinion that if service of mr puddleham congregation be once commenced in building must be continued there a long a thing be thing not yet accomplished might be practicable to stop

sick of grievance wished that be over a to going to law with marquis on question of common right be thing that must not think of doing living have come to from college have thought right to let bursar of saint john know what be being done be quite clear that college must not interfere spend money on matter though be parochial have reference to property in parish be not for college a patron of living to inquire whether certain land belonged to marquis of trowbridge to parish at large though vicar doubt a one of inhabitant of place might raise question at law if chose to find money must find ground on to raise old friend bursar wrote back joking letter recommending to put more fire into sermon thus to preach enemy down have become so sick of chapel vicar said to wife night wish subject might never be mentioned again in house ca be more sick of than be said wife what mean be that be sick of a subject of conversation there be let make best of a quickenham say ca expect anything like sympathy from richard know want sympathy want simply silence if will only make up mind to take for granted to put up with a have to do with frost when shrub be killed with anything be disagreeable unavoidable feeling of unhappiness about must die away at once one doe not grieve at inevitable one must be quite sure that be inevitable there stand nothing that can do can stop charlotte say that be sure richard have got something in head though will not sympathise will think contrive fight half ruin by fighting said husband fancy land may be common land not private property then of course chapel have right to be there who be to have removed if must succeed in doing so what must be said to for putting down place of worship after fashion a who must say anything against frank truth be be lord

just opposite to parson gate mr brattle replied that have heard of chapel have never a yet be up to see indeed remember bit of ground yes miller remembered ground very well man boy have known for

mr puddleham chapel mr quickenham bade farewell to miller thought that saw way to case be man very strongly given to accuracy on return to vicarage said word of conversation with miller must have be natural that fenwick must have interrogated a to morning work vicar have determined to trouble further about grievance to say nothing further respecting to man not even to allow remembrance of mr puddleham chapel to dwell in mind consequently held peace mr fenwick be curious enough on subject have made promise to husband must at least endeavour to keep if sister must tell anything unasked must

george be in truth regarded at turnover a being of person in world most august marquis be afraid of son held in extreme veneration to mind of marquis heir expectant of dignity of house of stowte be almost greater man than owner of feeling came not only from consciousness on part of father that son be bigger man than cleverer better versed in affair of world more thought of by around also to

stone to take parliamentary holiday to do little business with father not unfrequently came to pas that found necessary to repress energy of father august magnificence must go so far a to remind father that in day marquis be not very different from other people except in that perhaps might have more money marquis must fret in silence not daring to commit to argument with son must in secret lament over altered idea of age be theory of politics that old distance must be maintained that head of great family must be patriarch entitled to obedience from around be son idea that man be entitled to a much obedience a money must buy to more be very lamentable to marquis nevertheless son be coming man even must be borne be sorry about chapel at bullhampton said son to father after dinner why sorry saint george thought must have be of opinion that dissenter must have chapel certainly must if be fool enough to want to build place to pray in when have got one already built for

place what be in second place be not quite sure whether wished to tell story not engagement be broken might be question whether a regarded mary have right to tell then if did tell must not reason for doing so be apparent be not palpable that be expected to marry girl that must understand that be explaining to that did not intend to carry out general expectation of family then be sure that might not be possible for at future time to do a be desired meant to say that a be staying at loring of course met frequently be living with certain old miss marrable whom will meet day have heard of suppose ever will meet never go anywhere suppose there be such stay at home people in world a be why get sir gregory to ask here cousin be so afraid of having strange woman in house know never have anybody here coming have be quite event old mr potter seems to think that era of dissipation be to be commenced because have be called upon to open so many pot of jam to make pie for be afraid have be

died when be fourteen came here almost immediately afterwards fancy ten year at dunripple there be not tree stone know of course not face in parish be very nice be out of question that must ever become wife have thought that might explain to herself by letting know that have within last few month become engaged to have broken engagement with cousin mary lowther found that must not do in first place must understand more than meant to understand if made attempt must know that be putting on guard must take a insult then must not bring to talk about mary lowther to tell joint secret be discontented with with dunripple repented that have yielded in respect to indian service everything have gone wrong with have refused to accede to mary proposition for separation have come to dunripple a engaged man might thought have reconciled uncle at least cousin gregory to marriage with mary did not see way back to position now having be entertained at uncle house a uncle heir for so long time without having mentioned at last went off to windsor sad at heart having received from mary answer to letter felt to be very cold very discreet very unsatisfactory have merely expressed fervent wish that whether went to india whether remained in england might be prosperous happy writer evidently intended that correspondence must not be continued chapter xlv what will do with parson john marrable though said nothing in letter to dunripple about doings of nephew at loring be by mean equally reticent in speech at loring a to doings at dunripple how came by news did not say have ever so much to tell miss marrable who knew well be aware that news be not simple gossip be told with object in way parson john be crafty man who be always doing turn of business to mind be clearly inexpedient almost impracticable that nephew mary lowther must ever become man wife knew that be separated knew also that have agreed to separate on term must easily admit of being reconsidered too have heard of edith brownlow have heard that if marriage must be arranged between walter edith family trouble must be in fair way of settlement good must come to anybody from that other marriage a for mary lowther be manifestly duty to become mr gilmore therefore took trouble to let lady at uphill know that captain marrable have be received very graciously at dunripple that be making very happy there hunting shooting forgetting old trouble that be understood that be to be recognised a heir that there be young lady in case favourite of sir gregory understood world too well to say word to mary lowther about rival mary must have perceived drift expressed idea about edith confidentially to miss marrable fully alive to fact that miss marrable must know how to deal with niece be by far best thing must have happened to said parson a for going out to india again for man with prospect be very bad cousin be much older than be suggested miss marrable yes be great deal older gregory health be so bad that life be not worth year purchase poor fellow tell only care to live till have got book out truth be that if walter must make match of with edith brownlow might arrange something about property must enable to live there just a though place be own colonel must be only stumbling block after what have done must hardly refuse to agree to anything 'd have to pay said miss marrable then must be paid be brother gregory be wrapped up in girl must do anything for welfare be told that walter have taken very kindly to other already must be better for mary lowther that walter marrable must marry edith brownlow such at least be miss marrable belief must see that mary though bore bravely still did so a one who have received wound for there be remedy a man who have lost leg who nevertheless intends to enjoy life though know that never can walk again in case real bar to walking be hope in mary breast hope be still present though be not nourished that leg be not irremediably lost if captain marrable must finish that by marrying edith then so thought miss marrable in process of time cure must be made good there might be leg did not believe much in captain constancy be quite ready to listen to story about love so from day to day word be dropped into mary ear have effect must say that be glad that be not to go to india said miss marrable to niece so indeed be answered mary in first place be such excellent thing that must be on good term at dunripple must inherit property day title too to mary made reply seemed to to have be hard that real state of thing must not have be explained to before gave up lover have then regarded hope of relief from dunripple a being beyond measure distant there have be possibility be chance to prudent man woman must have looked in making preparation for life before have be idea a to dunripple prospect now seemed that on sudden walter be to be regarded a almost immediate heir did not blame did appear to be hard upon see slightest reason why must live at dunripple continued miss marrable only that must be dependent suppose doe not mean to sell out of army altogether at rate may be backwards forward see there be chance of sir gregory own son marrying so say position must be really of younger brother in similar circumstance mary paused moment before replied then spoke out dear aunt sarah what doe mean know be speaking at yet quite understand everything between captain marrable be over have possible mean of influencing life if be told to morrow that have given up army taken to living altogether at dunripple must have mean of judging whether have done well ill indeed must have right to judge must be glad that family must be united be glad now be that want to bring to think without regret of probable marriage with young lady suppose will blame if marries want to see in such light that will not make unhappy think dear aunt that have better not talk of can assure of that if must prevent from marrying by holding up little finger must not do must be ten thousand pity urged old lady that life yours must be sacrifice to little episode after only took week two in acting can only answer for said mary mean to be sacrifice there be many such conversation by degree did have effect upon mary lowther learned to believe that be probable that captain marrable must marry miss brownlow of course asked herself question a to effect marriage must have upon answered more fully than did be put to by aunt then there came to parson john paper required signature in reference to disposal of small sum of money having be one of trustee to brother marriage settlement be needed in regard to provision baronet be making for niece if read aright must rather have afforded evidence against than in favour of chance of immediate marriage be taken at loring to signify that thing be to be done that courtship be at rate in progress mary did not believe that heard there be left upon mind idea walter marrable be preparing for sudden change of affection then determined must do so must not judge to have done wrong if must settle comfortably in way why must not do so be told that edith brownlow be pretty gentle good must undoubtedly receive from sir gregory hand sir gregory must give be expedient for sake of whole family that marriage must be arranged must not stand in way of indeed how must stand in way of have not engagement with captain marrable be dissolved at own instance in most solemn manner possible let marry whom might must have ground of complaint on score be in state of mind when received captain marrable letter from dunripple when opened for moment thought that must convey to tidings respecting miss brownlow when have read told how impossible be that must have told of

seriously if walter marrable be to marry edith brownlow what sort of future life must mary lowther propose to herself be firmly resolved upon one thing that behoved to look rather to what be right than to what might simply be pleasant must be right that must consider to be a be widowed by frustration of unfortunate passion life must still be left to life a aunt lived life with exception that whereas aunt be single lady with moderate mean must be single lady with very small mean indeed question of mean did not go far with there be something so much more important that must put out of sight have told very plainly that be good thing for woman to be married that must live die unsuccessfully if lived died single woman that have desired to do better with than be proper that must now give up such ambition because have made mistake if be proper must do so then question resolved into must be right if married man without loving to marry man without esteeming without possibility of loving

mr brattle fanny two woman be in sad way poor boy wretched boy said unfortunate mother who sat sobbing with apron over face know nothing of mr gilmore must tell at once said fanny be sure must said vicar may remember mr brattle for one moment believe that sam have more to do with murder than may tell father that say so if please for saying squire rebuked a soon a have left mill think go too far in giving such assurance a that said surely must have say what think not on matter a in false encouragement may produce so much increased suffering be so prone to take own view in opposition to of others that must be specially on guard when may do so much harm feel quite sure that have nothing to do with see that have police against after most minute prolonged investigation police be ass insisted vicar just so that be prefer own opinion to theirs in regard to murder must prefer yours to theirs on question of scriptural evidence not in such affair a want to talk over wish to make careful with other people who be so closely concerned in dealing with others have right to throw over ordinary rule of evidence vicar accepted rebuke promised to be more careful repeating however own opinion about sam to declared intention of adhering in regard to own conduct let police magistrate say what might almost went so far a to declare that must do so even in opposition to verdict of jury gilmore understood that be simply natural obstinacy of man showing in natural form at moment be certainly one of gloom to parish at large of great sorrow at vicarage squire moved about with new life be evident to who saw went about farm talked about tree looked at horse have come to life again doubt many guess a to cause of be made throughout establishment of probably very near truth for fenwicks

infinite comfort squire be old friend almost only near neighbour in trouble whether inside outside of parish naturally went to gilmore although be man not very prone to walk by advice of friend still

matter have gone so vitally astray that have not be worth having have become so morose that vicar have found to be almost absolutely necessary to leave alone a far a ordinary life be concerned now squire be again on exciting topic of trumbull murder prisoner in salisbury gaol necessity for sam reappearance must talk sensibly usefully be certainly very expedient that sam must be made to reappear a soon a possible idea be general in parish that vicar knew about george brattle who have become bail for brother reappearance have given name on clear understanding that vicar must be responsible half sustained tidings of carry presence in salisbury of vicar various visit to city be current in bullhampton with be mingled idea carry sam be in league together that fenwick be chivalrous perhaps

visited young woman at salisbury how long have be with on occasion how much paid mr stiggs for accommodation gentleman who be quixotic in kindness to young woman be liable to have going coming chronicled with much exactitude if not always with accuracy interview with carry on occasion be very sad must not save from telling in part cause of inquiry have taken two men have asked with eagerness seemed to imply that possessed knowledge on matter must hardly not be guilty what two men asked looking full into face then be silent be unwilling to catch in trap to cross examine a lawyer

ready to admit that time must be allowed be case at ready against two men who be in custody indeed against evidence be so little substantial that lawyer from devizes who attended on behalf expressed

went on quietly at heytesbury before magistrate left little town there be row sir thomas charleys in speaking to brother magistrate mr gilmore about whole affair about brattles in particular have alluded to mr fenwick unfortunate connexion with carry brattle at salisbury gilmore fired up at once demanded to know meaning of sir thomas who be not wisest man in world who have idea of justice a to whom in giving due must be owned that be afraid of one after hesitation acknowledged that what have heard respecting mr fenwick have fallen from lord trowbridge have heard from lord trowbridge that vicar of bullhampton be gilmore on occasion became full of energy pressed baronet very hard sir thomas hoped that mr gilmore be not going to make mischief mr gilmore declared that must not submit to injury done to friend that must question lord trowbridge on subject did question lord trowbridge whom found waiting for carriage in parlour of bull inn sir thomas having accompanied in search marquis be quite outspoken have heard said from what did not doubt to be good authority mr fenwick be in habit of visiting alone young woman who have lived in parish whom now maintained in lodging in low alley in suburb of salisbury have said so much a in so saying have spoken truth falsehood if have said anything untrue must be first to acknowledge own error then there have come to be very hot word lord said mr gilmore insinuation be untrue word may have be in impression have made be slanderous who be sir said marquis looking at from head to foot to talk to of impression of word mr gilmore blood be up intended to convey to sir thomas charleys lord that mr fenwick visit be of disgraceful nature if word did not convey that conveyed nothing who be sir that must interpret word did more than duty in conveying to sir thomas charleys conviction well grounded conviction a to gentleman conduct what said to will say aloud to whole county be notorious that vicar of bullhampton be in habit of visiting profligate young woman in low part of city that say be disgraceful to to cloth to parish will give opinion to bishop to effect who be sir that must question word again marquis eyed squire from head to foot leaving room with majestic strut a gilmore went on to assert that allegation made with sense implied by contained wicked malicious slander then there be word much quieter than preceding between mr gilmore sir thomas in squire pledged to hardly knew what sir thomas promised to hold tongue for present a matter of course quarrel flew over little town be out of question that man a marquis of trowbridge must keep wrath confined before have left inn yard have expressed opinion very plainly to half dozen person a to immorality of vicar impudence of squire a be taken home hand be itching for pen paper in order that might write to bishop sir thomas shrugged shoulder did not tell story to more than three four confidential friend to of whom remarked that on matter of visit made to girl there never be smoke without fire gilmore voice too have be loud servant about inn have heard knew that quarrel be already public felt that have alternative to tell friend what have passed illustration who be sir that must interpret word on same evening saw vicar fenwick have returned from salisbury tired dispirited ill at ease be just going in to dress for dinner when gilmore met at own stable door told what have occurred then after wife be right be wrong said fenwick right about what gilmore asked said that lord trowbridge must spread very lie confess made mistake of believing to be gentleman of course may use information use just a please said gilmore then parted gilmore who be on horseback rode home chapter xlviii mary lowther return to bullhampton month went by after scene described in last chapter summer have come at bullhampton be now end of may with summer mary lowther have arrived during month very little progress have be made with case at heytesbury there have be two three remand now there be yet police declared that be rendered necessary by absence of sam brattle that magistrate be anxious to give reasonable time for production of man who be out upon bail that a be undoubtedly concerned in murder be determined to have who professed to understand case among whom be lawyer from devizes mr jones of heytesbury declared that real search have be made for brattle because evidence in regard to other men be hitherto inefficient remand now stood again till tuesday june th be understood that if brattle did not then appear bail must be declared to have be forfeited fenwick have written very angry letter to lord trowbridge to have got no answer lord trowbridge have written very silly letter to bishop in replying to bishop have snubbed be informed by friend mr gilmore said vicar to marquis that lordship have stated openly have made visit to young woman in salisbury be disgraceful to to cloth to parish of be incumbent believe that lordship will deny that have done so therefore call upon at once to apologise to for calumny in nature be a injurious wicked a calumny can be to promise that will not repeat offence marquis when received have not a yet written that letter to bishop on have resolved after interview with gilmore feeling perhaps qualm of conscience thinking that might be well that must consult son though with full conviction that if did so son must not allow to write to bishop at possibly with feeling that have be too hard upon enemy vicar when letter from bullhampton reached feeling of doubt caution mercy be thrown to wind tone of letter be essentially aggressive impudent be word calumny offended most idea that marquis of trowbridge must be called upon to promise not to commit offence pestilent infidel at bullhampton a called friend have not attempted to deny visit to young woman at salisbury marquis have made fresh inquiry have completely corroborated previous information have learned mr stiggs address name of trotter building detail be to mind circumstantial corroborative damnatory dim account of battle at three honest men have reached undoubted fact that carry brattle be maintained by vicar then remembered fenwick old anxiety on behalf of brother whom marquis have taught to regard a very man who have murdered tenant reminded too of murderer present escape from justice by aid of pestilent clergyman thus became convinced that in dealing with mr fenwick a be undoubted duty to do have to deal with one of very worst of human race lordship mind be one utterly incapable of sifting evidence unable even to understand evidence when came to be not bad man desired nothing be not own remitted much be feared god honoured queen loved country be not self indulgent did duty a knew be arrogant old fool who must not keep from mischief who must only be kept from mischief by aid of such master a son a soon a received vicar letter at once sat down wrote to bishop be so sure that be right that sent fenwick letter to bishop acknowledging what have said at heytesbury justifying altogether by elaborate account of vicar wickedness now lord let ask said in conclusion whether deem proper man to have care of soul in large important parish of bullhampton bishop felt to be very much bullied have doubt whatsoever about parson knew that fenwick be too strong man to be acted upon beneficially by such advice a to private conduct a bishop might give too good man to need caution a to conduct lord marquis said in reply in returning endorsed letter from mr fenwick to lordship can only say that nothing have be brought before by lordship seems to to require interference must be wrong if did not add to expression of opinion that mr fenwick be moral man doing duty in parish well example in diocese to be followed rather than stumbling block when letter reached castle lord st george be there poor old marquis be cut to quick immediately perceived so told that bishop be old woman who understood nothing be sure that st george must not look at matter in same light yet be impossible not to tell st george much a dreaded son did honestly tell everything to mentor have already told st george of fenwick letter to of letter to bishop st george have whistled now showed bishop letter to son st george read letter refolded slowly shrugged shoulder said a returned to father well lord suppose like hornet nest be uncomfortable position of thing at bullhampton about beginning of june at time mary lowther be again staying with friend mr fenwick carry brattle be still at salisbury have not be seen by vicar for more than fortnight marquis letter backed a be in part by wife counsel have much to own disgust deterred from seeing girl wife however have visited trotter building have seen carry taking to little present from mother who did not dare to go over to salisbury to see child because of word have passed between husband mr fenwick on return home have reported that carry be silent sullen idle that only speech be expression of wish that be dead mr stiggs have said that must get good of in meantime sam brattle have not yet turned up th of june be at hand mary lowther be again at vicarage of course be necessary that mr gilmore must meet other promise have be made to that advice must be pressed upon meaning of of course be that nothing must be said to urging to marry gilmore be of course understood by party concerned that mr gilmore be to be allowed to come to house indeed be understood by fenwicks to mean almost a plainly that must at least endeavour to bring to accept when did come to mary a made journey same meaning seemed to be almost inevitable a perceived told that have be wrong to leave home knew thought knew that must refuse in doing so must simply be making fresh trouble must not have be better for to have remained at loring to have put at once on par with aunt have commenced life of solitary spinsterhood dull routine then why must refuse endeavoured to argue out with in railway carriage have be told that walter marrable must certainly marry edith brownlow believed doubt be much better that must do so at rate walter be separated for ever when wrote to declaring purpose of remaining in england have said not word of renewing engagement with doubt loved about did not for moment endeavour to deceive doubt if fate in life most desired might be hers must become wife of walter marrable fate must not be hers then there arose question whether on account be unfit to be wife of other man of be quite certain must ever seem to to be duty to accept other man must first explain to clearly position in found at last whole matter resolved to be possible for to divest idea of life of romance to look for contentment satisfaction in performance of duty to others prospect of old maid life at loring be not pleasant to eye must bear that worse than that rather than do wrong be however so hard for to know what be right what be wrong supposing that be to consent to marry mr gilmore must be forsworn when at altar promised to love care must be henceforth for heart a far a must command heart certainly truth there must not be secret of mind hidden from must force to love to forget that other man must be object of idolatry must in case do very utmost to reward for constancy of affection with have regarded yet a be driven in at vicarage gate told that must have be better for to remain at loring during first evening mr gilmore name be not mentioned there be subject enough for conversation a period be one of great excitement in bullhampton what did think of chapel asked mr fenwick have idea be so big why be not going to leave single soul to go to church mr puddleham mean to make clean sweep of parish mean to say that have left well none a yet replied mr fenwick then chapel be finished marquis have not yet sent order to tenant to become dissenter expect that will do so unless can persuade bishop to turn frank out of living bishop must turn out of course must must if must bishop frank be best friend in world have nothing to do with must abuse chapel to frank just at moment subject be tabooed belief be that whole edifice will have to come down that confusion of mr puddleham marquis will be something more complete than ever be yet seen in meantime put finger to lip just look at frank whenever chapel be mentioned then there be matter of murder somewhat sad consideration of sam protracted absence will have to pay four hundred pound mr fenwick mary asked will be liable to pay if doe not appear to morrow doubt must absolutely pay if doe not turn up soon think that be one of be quite sure be not have have trouble in family got into quarrel fancy have left country police say that have be traced to liverpool will other men be convicted mr fenwick asked believe will most fervently hope so have evidence about wheel of small cart in burrow certainly believe doubt acorn also be seen to drive across pycroft common early on sunday morning part of tire have come off bit somewhat broader inch so too short have be substituted impress made by wheel in mud just round corner by farm gate be measured copied at time say that will go far to identify men that man cart be there be certain also that be in same cart at pycroft common hour two after murder doe seem clear said mary somebody suggests that sam have borrowed cart believe however that will come out only if have to pay four hundred pound will think that farmer trumbull have cost very dear on next morning gilmore came to vicarage have be arranged that must drive fenwick over to heytesbury that must call for after breakfast somewhat late hour two in afternoon have be fixed for going on with murder case a be necessary

a whole story be told of lord trowbridge new quarrel of correspondence with bishop of fenwick have learned particular from bishop chaplain in telling of story mr fenwick did not scruple to express opinion that harry gilmore have behaved well with good spirit like true friend if marquis have be anywhere near own age believe must have horsewhipped said vicar wife with partiality for corporal chastisement of enemy be certainly not uncommon to feminine mind be very well called for special remark from mary possibly might have effect gentleman returned late in evening squire dressed at vicarage great event of day have to be told before anyone be allowed to dress between four five o'clock just a magistrate be going to leave bench sam brattle have walked into court money be safe said

sister in law must not receive now about paper that policeman have handed to threatened journey to heytesbury there be uncertainty unless might possibly escape evil by running away therefore ran away straight going people of world in dealing with who go crooked be almost always unreasonable because have be bad say who be not bad to who be bad because have hitherto indulged with pleasure within reach because have never worked steadily submitted to restraint because have be drunkard gambler have lived in foul company therefore now now have got hold of can manipulate in reference to repentance future conduct will require from mode of life that in general attraction will be about equal to of hermit in desert if flinch be not only monster of ingratitude towards who be taking trouble to save be also poor wretch for whom possible hope of grace can remain when be found that young man be neglecting duty doing nothing spending night in billiard room worse place getting up at two o'clock in day usual prescription of friend be that must lock up in own dingy room drink tea spend hour in reading good book be hardly recognised that sudden change from billiards to good book requires strength

building must have brought to railway station did take led by three honest men out on to devizes road road pass across salisbury plain lead from city to many wiltshire village of bullhampton be one walked slowly walked nearly whole day nothing must be more truly tragical than utterly purposeless tenour of day of whole life have plan nothing before object even for evening night of very day in be wasting strength on devizes road be lack of object of aim in life of houseless wanderer give to most terrible element of misery think of to walk forth with say ten shilling in pocket so that there need be instant suffering from want of bread shelter have work to do friend to see place to expect duty to accomplish hope to follow bourn to can draw nigher except bourn in such circumstance traveller must surely regard a simply end of weariness there be nothing to humanity can not attune men can live upon poison can learn to endure absolute solitude can bear contumely scorn shame never show carry brattle have already become accustomed to misery a walked thought more of wretchedness of present hour of weary foot of hunger of nature of rest might purchase for at poor wayside inn than did of future life illustration carry brattle got lump of bread glass of beer in middle of day then walked on on till evening came went very slowly stopping often sitting down when road side must afford spot of green shade at eight o'clock have walked fifteen mile straight along road a knew well have passed turn must have taken by nearest way from salisbury to bullhampton have formed plan entertained hope that if continued to walk must not catch so a to take to heytesbury on morrow knew that if went on might get to pycroft common by road though there be one in whole world whom hated worse than mr burrow still at pycroft common might probably be taken in sheltered at eight reached small village remembered to have seen before of saw name written up on board knew to be six mile from

at rate for day from magistrate policeman from sight of brother from presence of other man at heytesbury whither must go when left house whether on to hated cottage at pycroft common to father house have not made up mind when tied on hat went on along road towards devizes about two mile from village came to lane turning to left with finger post on be written direction to bullhampton imber here turned short off towards parish in have be born be then four o'clock when have travelled mile further found nook under wall of little bridge there seated ate dinner of bread cheese while be there policeman on foot passed along road man did not see have seen must have taken more than policeman ordinary notice of saw in consequence did not leave hiding place for hour about nine o'clock crept on again even then mind be not made up did not even yet know where must bestow for night seemed to that there must be inexpressible pleasure to even in misery in walking round precinct of mill in gazing at window of house in standing on bridge where have so often loitered in looking once more on scene of childhood a thought of remembered darkness of stream softly gurgling rapid flow with hurried on beneath black abyss of building have often shuddered a watched indulging in luxury of causeless trepidation now be there must surely take plunge into blackness must bring to end of misery yet a went on towards old home through twilight have more definite idea than of looking once more on place have be cherished in memory through suffering a to rest for night have plan unless indeed might find

fanny however have always persisted that goodness of lord must save from such injustice to old man have hardly dared to talk about now strove to win to softness might not struggle be made to bring sam back to mill be very hard to soften miller after what be come gone lad be better away said at last did think a 'd ever raised hand again old man said shortly afterwards be kep ' company with a did be

must have be consulted fanny must leave home immediately after breakfast when miller must ask after at dinner wife must tell that daughter have gone to salisbury if further question must be asked be thought possible that further question must be asked a father must then guess errand on daughter must have gone if subject be further mooted mr brattle with such courage a might be able to assume must

zealous to save money whole morning be beyond measure sad gloomy then asked whether meant to go through with if not sooner that retreated hid disgrace for rest of life better have accepted at last because have be made to believe that by doing so must benefit because have taught to think that be duty to disregard have thought of herself till be sick of subject what did matter about a long a must be of service to one so thinking have accepted now have begun to fear that be to marry man must not be of service to when thing must be done if ever be done there must be undoing must not her life be life of sin if be to live a wife of man whom did not love while perhaps must be unable not to love man nothing of be told to vicar mr fenwick knew what be going on in friend mind spoke own very freely

own laying on one hour of frank kindness on part must dispel gloom be not gloomy by nature then mary lowther tried to achieve hour of frank kindness again failed failed be conscious of failure there came time that within three week of engagement in have made up mind to return ring have given to leave bullhampton for ever must be right that must marry man that did not love be argument with herself yet be deterred from doing a contemplated by circumstance must have have effect on argument received from aunt marrable following letter in be certainly no word capable of making think that now at last must love man whom have promised to marry yet letter so affected that told that must go on become wife of harry gilmore must struggle yet again force to succeed wagon doubt be heavily laden still with sufficient labour might perhaps be moved miss marrable have be asked to go over to dunripple when mary lowther went to bullhampton have be long since have be there have not thought ever to make such visit there came letter there be rejoinder be going on before mary departure at last be determined that miss marrable must go to dunripple pay visit to cousin did not do till long after walter marrable have left place have written to mary soon after arrival in first letter there have be no word about walter in second letter spoke very freely of walter marrable a reader will see dunripple nd july dear mary got letter on saturday can not help wishing that have be written in better spirit however doubt that will come right soon be quite sure that best thing can do be to let gilmore name early day of course never intended that there must be long engagement thing where there be possible reason for must be out of question will be much better to take advantage of fine weather than to put off till winter have nearly come fix day in august early in september be sure will be much happier married than be single will be gratified be suppose to count for something be very happy here yet long to get home at time of life one must always be strange among stranger nothing can be kinder than sir gregory in sort of fashion gregory marrable son be fear in bad way be unlike father laugh at

with mr brownlow of course can not be like old friend edith be very nice girl rather shy never talk about herself be too silent to be questioned however doubt for moment that will be walter marrable wife think likely that be not engaged a yet a in case think mr brownlow must tell many thing have be said leave on mind conviction that will be so be to be here again in august from way in mr brownlow speaks of coming there be doubt that expects that paid great attention to edith when be here before be quite sure take be only waiting till in writing so far miss marrable have intended to signify captain marrable have be slow to ask edith brownlow to be wife while be at dunripple because must not bring so soon to show indifferent to former love now must not hesitate knowing a must know that former love have bestowed elsewhere in there must have be grievous accusation against mary be therefore compelled to fill up sentence in other form till thing must have arranged little will be for best be very nice quiet lady like girl so great favourite with uncle must son die before great object in life will be welfare walter marrable a husband must live at dunripple just a though place be own indeed there must be one between property except own father arrangement must be made a to buying out life interest for indeed have taken money beforehand with vengeance then walter must be settled

fixed for marriage made mary lowther determine that must yet once more attempt to drag wagon must have withstood such entreaty a have letter gone further must probably have replied to by saying that day must be fixed at with letter there came assurance walter marrable have forgotten be about to marry edith brownlow that therefore idea of love truth sympathy joint beating of mutual heart with rest of might be thrown to wind must marry harry gilmore take care that have good dinner must give mind to flannel petticoat coal for poor of bullhampton must altogether come down from pedestal have once striven to erect for from high tottering pedestal propped up on shaft of romance poetry must come down there must remain for lower firmer standing block of duty be sole support be doubt most unreasonable that such change must come upon in consequence of aunt letter have never for moment told that walter marrable must ever be anything to since day on have by own deed liberated from troth indeed have done more than have forced to accept liberation why then must engagement with woman have effect with either in one direction in other have submitted to new engagement have done so before

across field into privet close to house met lover did not see till heard step then turned short round almost a though fearing something harry said jewel have come oh dear be not mine yet why did have sent to there be something in word yet in tone a spoke made heart leap a have never leaped before if be not yours know whom belong to said eye be bright voice almost shook with emotion be doing anything asked nothing on earth then come see so walked off at rate on occasion be happy lover for few minute perhaps for hour did allow to believe that be destined to enjoy rapture of requited affection in longing for very soul have become sick a walked back with to vicarage hand rested heavily on arm when asked question about land be able so to modulate voice a to make believe that be learning to regard interest a own stopped at gate leading into vicarage garden once more made to assurance of regard mary said if love will beget love think that must love at last will love said pressing arm still more closely even then must not bring to tell that did love chapter lv glebe land fifteenth of july be sunday have be settled for time past on day mr puddleham must preach for first time in new chapel building have be hurried on through early summer in order that might be achieved although fitting be not completed outward sign of mason labourer have not be removed although heap of mortar be still there time have not yet sufficed to have chip cleared away on sunday fifteenth of july chapel be opened great effort be made to have filled on occasion builder from salisbury came over with family not deterred by consideration whereas puddlehamites of bullhampton be primitive methodist be regular wesleyan many in parish be got to visit chapel on day of glory who have le business there than even builder from salisbury in most parish there be who think well to let parson know that be independent care for though profess to be of flock then too novelty of thing have attraction well known fact that site chosen for building have be a gall wormwood to parson family cause together brought crowd to vicarage gate on sunday morning be quite clear that new chapel must be full mr puddleham first sunday must be success chapel of course have bell bell be declared by mr fenwick to be hoarsest loudest most unmusical ill founded miscreant of bell be ever suspended over building for torture of delicate ear certainly be loud brazen bell mr fenwick expressed opinion that there be nothing amiss with when wife declared that sounded a though came from midst of shrub at own front gate reminded that own church bell sounded a though came from lower garden one sound must be held by to be musical other abominable declared to be prejudice then there be great argument about bell in mr fenwick mary lowther harry gilmore be against vicar throughout discussion be known to that there be ear in parish to bell be so really odious a be to ear of vicar in heart of heart hated chapel in spite of endeavour to contrary feeling towards mr puddleham be not christian religion requires one neighbour to bear to made struggle for week past have not said word against mr puddleham in regard to marquis thing be different marquis must have known better against marquis did say great many word began to ring bell on sunday morning before ten o'clock mr fenwick be still sitting at breakfast table with window open when sound be first heard first heard be on that morning looked at mary groaned put hand to ear vicar laughed walked about room at what time do begin said mary not till eleven said mr fenwick there want quarter to ten now mean to go on with music for hour quarter will be keeping company by by said vicar poor old church bell wo be heard through said mr fenwick mr fenwick be in habit of going to village school for hour before service on sunday morning on morning started from house according to custom at little after ten mary lowther went with a school be in village must be reached much more shortly by front gate than by path round by church two lady walked out boldly before new chapel reader may perhaps remember that mr fenwick have promised husband to withdraw outward animosity to chapel have evinced by not using vicarage entrance a went there be crowd collected found that after manner of primitive methodist in more enthusiastic day procession of worshipper have be formed in village at very moment be making way to chapel mr fenwick a stood aside to make way for declared that bell sounded a though be within bonnet when reached school found that many child be absent who must have be there mr fenwick knew that truant urchin be amusing at new building with who be not truant clang of new bell distracted terribly that attention be due to collect mr fenwick confessed afterwards that hardly knew what be teaching mr fenwick according to habit went into own study when lady went to school there according to custom also on sunday morning letter be brought to few minute before started on walk through garden to church on morning there be couple of letter for opened one be from tradesman in salisbury other be from wife brother in law mr quickenham before started read mr quickenham letter then did best to forget put out of mind till morning service must be over letter be a follows pump court june dear fenwick have found a thought must that lord trowbridge have property in right to bit of ground on enemy have be building new ebenezer spot be part of glebe a such seems to have be first abandoned by certain parson named brandon who be predecessor predecessor there can however be doubt that ground be glebe that be bound to protect a such on behalf of successor of patron of living found difficulty in getting at terrier of parish who consider to be model parson dare say have never seen have however found in duplicate clerk of board of guardian who must believe have copy of knew nothing about have never heard of such document bishop registrar be not much more learned did find in bishop chancery there be copy of also at saint john seems to imply great attention have be paid by college a patron to interest of parish priest be more than have be done by incumbent who seems to be ignorant fellow in such matter wonder how many parson there be in church who must let marquis methodist minister between build chapel on parish glebe yours ever richard quickenham if be to charge through attorney for trouble 'd have to mortgage life interest in bit of land to pay enclose draft from terrier a far a plot of ground vicarage gate be concerned here be information detestable combination of dissenting tyrannically territorial influence have be used to build methodist chapel upon land of during incumbency in parish be freehold possessor what as must have be not to know own possession how ridiculous must appear when must come forward to claim a part of glebe morsel of land to have paid no special attention since have be in parish then what must be duty to do mr quickenham have clearly stated that on behalf of college be patron of living on behalf of successor be duty to claim land be possible that must not do so after such usage a have received from lord trowbridge so meditating grieving that must be driven at moment to have mind forcibly filled with such matter still hearing chapel bell in ear drowned sound from own modest belfry altogether doubtful a to what step must take entered own church be manifest to that of poorer part of usual audience of smaller farmer one half be in attendance upon mr puddleham triumph during whole of afternoon said not word of barrister letter to one struggled to banish subject from thought failing to do that did banish from tongue letter be in pocket of coat showed to one gilmore dined at vicarage even to be silent of course conversation at dinner turned upon chapel be impossible that on day must speak of anything else even a sat at early dinner mr puddleham bell be ringing doubt there be vigour in pulling of must not be maintained when pulling of must have become thing of week there have be compact made in accordance with vicar wife be to be debarred from saying anything against chapel doubt when compact be made understanding be that must give over hating chapel have of course be found to be impossible in certain way have complied with compact noise of bell however be considered to be beyond compact on occasion be almost violent in expression of wrath husband listened to sat without rebuking silent with lawyer letter in pocket bell have be put up on own land must pull down to morrow have be put up by express agency of lord trowbridge with direct view of annoying lord trowbridge have behaved to in manner set christian charity at defiance told plainly that have desire to forgive lord trowbridge life in world a be constituted must not be compatible with such forgiveness that must not indeed desire to injure lord trowbridge otherwise than by exacting such penalty a must force such a to restrain tyranny that to forgive till must have be so forced must be weak injurious to community a to that have quite made up mind in spite of doctrine to contrary men in world must have to go naked if gave coat to robber who took cloak going naked be manifestly inexpedient office of parish priest must be lowered in world if forgave out of hand such offence a have be committed against by lord trowbridge understood clearly now might put down not only bell with bell ill conditioned peer who have caused to be put up on glebe land went through mind again again a determined that on day being sunday must think more about when monday came be necessary that must show letter to wife to wife to squire to mary lowther have idea of keeping matter secret from near friend adviser have idea that must be well that must make up mind a to what must do before asked advice started therefore for turn through parish before breakfast on monday morning resolved a to course of action on consideration must have chapel pulled down be necessary for purpose that must have triumph over marquis must have chapel have be built for good purpose must adequately serve let what might be said to by wife others must not have brick of disturbed doubt have more power to give land for present other purpose than have marquis might very probably be duty to take care that land be not appropriated to wrong purpose might be that have already neglected duty in not knowing in not having taken care to learn precise limit of glebe have be given over to for use during incumbency nevertheless there be chapel there must stand a far a be concerned if churchwarden archdeacon college bishop have power to interfere a to be altogether ignorant chose to exercise power must not help be nearly sure that own churchwarden must be guided altogether by a far a be concerned chapel must remain unmolested having thus resolved came back to breakfast read mr quickenham letter aloud to wife mary lowther glebe said vicar wife do mean that be part of own land asked mary exactly that said vicar that old thief of marquis have given away what belongs to said mr fenwick have given away what did not belong to said vicar ca admit that be thief surely ought to have known said mary a for so ought to have known suppose whole thing be one of most ridiculous mistake that ever be made have absolutely come to pas here in middle of wiltshire with map survey parish record one concerned have known to whom belonged quarter of acre of land in centre of village be just thing to write article about in newspaper ca say that one party be more to blame than other be in regard to ignorance displayed what will do frank nothing will hing frank will hing will take care to let marquis know nature of generosity fancy be bound to take on that labour must say that wo trouble much to have to write letter wo pull down frank dear must before week be over so must said mary think ought to be there of course ought not to be there said mr fenwick might a well have here in garden said mary just same said mr fenwick be not in garden a have be built will remain a far a be

custom of society a pleaded by two daughter to spend month of may june july at family mansion in grosvenor square moreover though marquis never opened mouth in house of lord be a thought imperative on to give to leader of party occasional support of personal presence vicar knowing have addressed letter to grosvenor square have thus reached destination without loss of time lord trowbridge by time knew handwriting of enemy a broke envelope there came upon idea that might be wise to refuse letter to let go back to writer unopened be beneath dignity to correspond with man to receive letter from man who must probably insult before must make up mind envelope have be opened letter have be read wrath when have read writer of simple prose narration must attempt to describe disgrace insult ignorance malice be word with marquis found pelted by pestilent abominable most improper clergyman a to gist of letter be time before understood when did begin to understand did not a yet begin to believe intelligence worked slowly whereas wrath worked quickly at last began to ask whether accusation made against must possibly be based on truth when question of giving land have be under consideration have never occurred to one concerned that must belong to glebe there have be momentary suspicion that spot might possibly have be so long used a common land a to give room for question on side one have dreamed that other claimant must arise that whole village of bullhampton belonged to marquis be notorious of course there be glebe who must think that morsel of neglected land lying on other side of road belonged to vicarage marquis did not believe now be piece of wickedness concocted by venomous brain of iniquitous vicar more abominable than other wickedness marquis did not believe walked up down room morning thinking of marquis be sure that be not true yet must not for moment get idea out of mind of course must tell st george language of letter have be sent to be so wicked that st george must at least agree with now in anger against man must nothing be done to punish man prosecution in regard to anonymous letter threatening letter begging letter passed through mind knew that punishment have be inflicted on writer of insolent letter to royalty letter have be proved to be criminal a being libellous only then must be published letter be sometimes held to form conspiracy must not quite see way to that knew that be not royal knew that vicar threatened begged aught from what if st george must tell again that vicar have right on side cast matter about in mind day then late in afternoon got into carriage have driven to chamber of messrs boothby family lawyer chapter lvii oil be to be thrown upon water illustration messrs boothby in lincoln inn have for very many year be lawyer of stowte family probably knew a much about property a of stowtes have not be consulted about giving away of bit of land for chapel purpose have be instructed to draw up deed of

letter first rage be over went at once to chamber of messrs boothby be forced to explain circumstance of case to senior partner before must show clergyman wicked epistle old mr boothby be man of same age a marquis in way quite a great only lawyer be clever old man whereas marquis be stupid old man mr boothby sat bowing head a marquis told story story be rather confused for awhile mr boothby must only understand that dissenting chapel have be built upon client land will have to set right by scrap of conveyance said lawyer vicar of parish claim said marquis claim chapel lord be most pestilent abominable man mr boothby have brought letter here mr boothby held out hand to receive letter from almost client must prefer document to oral explanation must do so especially from lordship must understand continued marquis that be quite unlike ordinary clergyman have greatest respect for church be always happy to see clergyman at own house be litigious quarrelsome fellow tell be infidel keep altogether mr boothby nothing can be worse indeed said lawyer still holding out hand for letter have taken trouble to insult continually heard how tenant of mine be murdered be murdered by young man whom clergyman screen because because be brother of of of young woman must be very bad lord be very bad know about murder be convinced doe went bail for young man used to associate with on most intimate term a to sister there be doubt about live on land of person who owns small estate in parish mr gilmore lord exactly so mr fenwick have got mr gilmore in pocket can have idea of such state of thing a now writes letter know handwriting now further communication will return marquis ceased to speak lawyer at once buried in letter be meant to be offensive said lawyer most insolent most offensive most improper yet bishop upholds if be right about bit of land lord will be rather awkward a spoke lawyer examined sketch of vicarage entrance give a copied from terrier of parish lord believe word of said marquis did look at plan of estate lord think did packer have doubt one know property in bullhampton so well a packer packer said while marquis be still speaking lawyer rose begging client pardon went to clerk in outer room did return till clerk have descended to iron chamber in basement returned from thence with certain large tin box into search be made presently mr boothby came back with weighty lump of dusty vellum document manuscript map sketch of survey of bullhampton estate have have opened while search be being made have retired to room have have little conversation with partner about weather be afraid parson be right lord said mr boothby a closed door right right in fact lord be glebe be marked so here very plainly there must have be reference to there must indeed lord packer men like really know nothing truth be in such matter nobody know anything must always have documentary evidence be glebe not doubt of lord then marquis knew that enemy have on hip laid old head down upon folded arm wept in weeping be probable that tear rolled down cheek wept inward tear tear of hatred remorse commiseration enemy have struck with scourge a far a must see at present must not return blow must submit must restore bit of land build nasty dissenter chapel elsewhere on own property have not doubt a to for moment must have escaped shame of a far a expense be concerned must have be willing to build ten chapel in doing must give triumph unalloyed triumph to man whom believed to be thoroughly bad vicar have accused marquis of spreading report marquis did not believe marquis believed at moment there be evil that must not have believed of mr fenwick while sitting there idea almost amounting to conviction have come upon that mr fenwick have be privy to murder of old trumbull what must not parson do who must take delight in insulting humiliating nobleman who owned parish in lived to lord trowbridge very fact that parson of parish regarded a own be opposed to proved sufficiently that parson be scum dreg riff raff low radical everything that parson ought not to be vicar have be wrong there marquis did believe religiously what must do said marquis a to chapel lord vicar bad a be doe not want to move must come down said marquis getting up from chair will come down do think must allow to stand when have be erected on ground through error not for day not for hour will tell what mr boothby that man have known through have known a well a do now have waited till building be complete before must tell see a plain a nose on face mr boothby lawyer be meditating how best might explain to angry client that have power whatsoever to pull down building that if vicar dissenting minister chose to agree about new building must stand in spite of marquis must stand unless churchwarden patron ecclesiastical authority generally must force vicar to have removed when clerk came in whispered word to attorney lord said mr boothby lord st george be here will come in marquis did not wish to see son exactly at minute lord st george be of course admitted meeting at lawyer chamber be altogether fortuitous father son be equally surprised so great be anger dismay general perturbation of marquis at time that must not stop to ask question st george must of course know what have happened be quite a well that must be told at once bit of ground have built chapel on at bullhampton turn out to be glebe said marquis lord st george whistled of course mr fenwick knew along said marquis must hardly think that said son read letter mr boothby

due altogether to death of distant cousin whom did not even remember be too wise also to refer to what presumed to be mary special grief at moment mary be doubtless thinking of altered circumstance of cousin walter be a well now that must speak a little a possible about cousin mr fenwick must not turn altogether to subject must if possible divert friend from present thought will go into mourning asked be only second cousin people have idea so different about thing know said mary listlessly if be must consult mr gilmore have right to be consulted if do must be very slight will go into mourning said mary suddenly remembering at moment what be walter position in household at dunripple then tear came up into eye knew not why walked off by amidst garden shrub mr fenwick watched a went must not quite understand tear have not be for second cousin who have never be known then during last few week mary in regard to herself have be prone to do anything mr gilmore must advise a though must make up by obedience for want of affection owed to now when be told that ought to consult mr gilmore flatly refused to do so mary came up garden few minute afterwards a passed towards house begged to be excused from going into lunch that day lord st george be coming up to lunch at vicarage a will be explained in next chapter chapter lx lord st george be very cunning lord st george began to throw oil upon water in reference to unfortunate chapel at bullhampton day two after interview with father in lawyer chamber father have found compelled to yield have be driven a be by fate to accord to son permission to do a son must think best there came to be so serious trouble in consequence of terrible mistake of packer that poor old marquis be unable to defend from necessity of yielding on day before left son at westminster when road lay into different council chamber of state have prayed hard that oil might not be very oily son must not bate inch of surrender be so utterly worthless marquis have said pleading hard a spoke of enemy be not quite sure lord that understand man st george have said hate doubt hate horribly ejaculated marquis intend to be a good a know how to be to people at bullhampton indeed do st george said marquis almost with tear in eye must wonder if did too look at life said marquis be always easy to look at man life be always looking at men life always making mistake bishop think be good sort of fellow bishop be man to like debauched unbelieving reckless parson who according to idea must be leading life of open shame profligacy be inclined to think there must be mistake unfortunate marquis groaned deeply a walked away to august chamber of lord such like be trouble sit heavy on man heart if search for bread meat raiment be set aside then beyond happiness misery here depends chiefly on success failure in small thing though man when turn into bed may be sure that have unlimited thousand at command though society be open to though know to be esteemed handsome clever fashionable even though digestion be good have doctor to deny tobacco champagne made dish still if be conscious of failure there where have striven to succeed even though be in humbling of already humble adversary will stretch roll pine wretched being how happy be who can get fretting done for by deputy lord st george wrote to parson few day after interview with father lord trowbridge occupied same house in london always met at breakfast nothing further be said between during remaining day in town upon subject lord st george wrote to parson father have left london for turnover before mr fenwick answer be received dear sir lord st george have said father have put into hand letter about dissenting chapel at bullhampton seems to that have made mistake that be very angry must arrange little matter without fighting there be not landlord in england more desirous of doing good to tenant than father be quite willing to believe that there be not incumbent in england more desirous of doing good to parishioner than leave london for wiltshire on th if will meet will drive over to bullhampton on monday th yours truly st george doubt will agree with in thinking internecine fighting in parish between landlord clergyman can not be for good of people thus be that lord st george began to throw oil upon water may be doubt whether must be ascribed to mr fenwick a weakness strength though be very susceptible of anger though must maintain anger at glowing heat a long a fighting continued must all evaporate leave harmless a dove at first glimpse of olive branch knew so well of that must sometimes be regret to in culmination of wrath that must not be able to maintain till hour of revenge must come on receiving lord st george letter at once sat down wrote to nobleman telling that must be happy to see at lunch on monday at two o'clock then there came rejoinder from lord st george saying that must be at vicarage at hour named mr fenwick be of course there to entertain nobleman whom have never seen before during lunch very little be said about chapel not word be said about other cause of complaint be terrible building mr fenwick lord st george have remarked be getting used to now mr fenwick have replied mr fenwick think good for purpose of mortification must see move sackcloth ash little further off said lordship then ate lunch talked about parish expressed joint hope that grinder must be hung at salisbury now let go see corpus delicti said vicar a soon a have drawn chair from table two men went out walked round chapel finding open walked into of course there be remark made by of be acknowledged that be ugly misplaced uncomfortable detestable to eye ear general feeling except in so far a might suit want of people who be not sufficiently educated to enjoy higher tone more elaborate language of church of england service be thus that spoke to other quite in aesthetic manner lord st george have said a entered chapel that must come down a matter of course vicar have suggested that there need be hurry tell that must be removed day said vicar a be not likely to leave parish nobody need start matter for year two lord st george be declaring that advantage must not be taken of such concession on mr fenwick part when third person entered building walked towards with quick step here be mr puddleham minister said mr fenwick future lord of bullhampton be introduced to present owner of pulpit under be standing lord said minister be proud indeed to have honour of meeting lordship in new chapel of expressing to lordship high sense entertained by congregation of noble father munificent liberality to in matter of land in saying mr puddleham never once turned face upon vicar presumed at present moment to be at feud with vicar in most deadly degree though vicar must occasionally accost in village always answered vicar a though two be enemy have bowed when came up chapel have bowed to stranger if vicar took of courtesy to be not fault be afraid be little too quick there said lord st george hope not lord hope not have heard rumour have inquired have inquired truth be mr puddleham that be standing on mr fenwick private ground moment be quite welcome to use of mr puddleham said vicar mr puddleham assumed look of dignity frowned must not even yet believe that friend marquis have made so fatal mistake must build chapel will be about long short of mr puddleham lord must think there must be mistake error must have crept in somewhere lord have made inquiry have be very big error said lord st george have crept into mr fenwick glebe in very palpable form there be use in discussing mr puddleham why did reverend gentleman claim ground when work be commenced demanded indignant minister turning now for first time to vicar doing so with visage full of wrath graceful uplifting of right hand reverend gentleman be very ignorant of matter with ought to have be better acquainted said mr fenwick very ignorant indeed said mr puddleham lord be inclined to think that can assert right to chapel maintain lord be of opinion that whole hierarchy of episcopal established church in england can not expel lord who will be man to move first brick from sacred edifice mr puddleham pointed up to pulpit a though knew well where brick be ever to be found when duty required presence lord must propose that nothing must be done then let see who will attempt to close chapel door against lamb of lord who come here for pasture in need lamb will have pasture will have pastor said st george laughing will move chapel to ground be own make everything a right a trivet for want to intrude be sure mr puddleham eloquence be by mean exhausted at last when have left chapel ground immediately around chapel mr puddleham must insist upon regarding a own did manage to shake off now mr fenwick said lord st george in determined purpose to throw oil upon water what be unfortunate quarrel between father have better ask that lord have asked of course of course have answer to make doubt intended to enrage when wrote that letter showed certainly did hardly see how good be to be done by angering old man who stand high in world esteem have not stood high lord must probably have passed by can understand that one man must be mark for scorn because be marquis wealthy what ca understand be that one a must think that good can come from do know what father have said of have doubt say very hard thing of other never said evil thing of behind back have not said a strongly to face said mr fenwick with much of indignation in tone do really think that mitigates injury done to father said lord st george do know that have complained of to bishop yes bishop took part thanks to father lord st george do know that have accused publicly of grossest vice that have that have that have there be nothing so bad that have said of upon word think be even with mr fenwick do indeed what have said have said to face have made accusation against come lord be willing enough to let bygone be bygone if lord trowbridge will condescend to say that will drop animosity to will forgive injury have done can not admit to have be wrong never knew man who must said lord st george if marquis will put out hand to will accept said vicar allow to do so on behalf said son thus quarrel be presumed to be healed lord st george went to inn for horse vicar a walked across to vicarage felt that have be done young lord have be very clever have treated quarrel a though on even term a if offence on side have be equal yet vicar knew very well that have be right right without single slip right from beginning to end have be clever said to will have advantage of cleverness then resolved that a far a be concerned quarrel must in

that after lapse of year can identify two men whom have never seen before who be at time being carried along road at rate of eight ten mile hour witness who have already encountered good many of question who be inclined to be rough rather than timid said that did care twopence what jury believed be simply business to tell what knew then judge looked at wicked witness who have talked in wretched jeering way about twopence looked at over spectacle shaking head a though with pity at witness wickedness cautioned a to peril of body making too marked reference to peril of soul by melancholy wagging of head then burly barrister with broad forehead looked up beseechingly to jury be right that man must be hung for offence against whom witness a be brought up to give testimony be manifest feeling of crowd in court that witness ought to be hung immediately may go down sir said burly barrister giving impression to who looked on did not understand that case be over a far a depended on man evidence burly barrister be not so sanguine knew very well that judge who have wagged head in so melancholy way at iniquity of witness who have dared to say that did care twopence must when be summing up refer to presence of two prisoner in cart a thing fairly supported by evidence amount of burly barrister achievement be simply for moment sort of sympathy be excited on behalf of prisoner by disapprobation be aroused against wicked man who have cared twopence sympathy like electricity will run so quick that man may stop if sympathy might be made to run through jury box there might perchance be man two there weak enough to entertain to prejudice of duty on day hope of burly barrister in matter did not go further than then there be man put forward who have seen neither of prisoner have seen cart pony at pycroft common have known that cart pony be for time in possession of grinder be questioned by burly barrister about rather than about evidence when have be made to own

witness various others be brought up examined before poor carry turn have come on occasion a one after be dismissed from hand of burly barrister here one crushed confounded there loud triumphant heart be almost in throat yet though so dreaded moment when must come there be sense of wretched disappointment in be kept waiting be now between four five whisper began to be rife that crown must not finish case day there be much trouble more amusement with old woman who have be trumbull housekeeper be very deaf have be discovered that there be old friendship between grinder mother that have at one time whispered fact of farmer money into ear of mr burrow of pycroft common deaf a be be made to admit mr burrow be also examined must admit nothing have never heard of money of farmer trumbull of

to perceive have be clever enough to learn that man must be enemy though have be unable to speak aloud in answering counsel for prosecution have quite understood that man be friend that be only putting to question must be asked question must answer without much difficulty when be told to attend to what other gentleman must say to then indeed poor heart failed came at once dear believe have

to mr fenwick in earl own handwriting very first fruit said vicar a went down to inspect plentiful provision thus made for vicarage larder well be certainly better to have partridge from turnover than accusation of immorality infidelity vicar so declared at once wife must not at first agree with really must have such pleasure in packing up sending back said indeed will hing of kind idea of basket

that mr mr fenwick will do honour of coming to turnover park on monday th october staying till saturday th be instalment indeed said mr fenwick now what on earth be to do vicar admitted that have become very serious must go endure terrible time of continued mr fenwick must show very plainly that will have nothing more to do with see why be to be annoyed merely because be marquis wo be because be marquis why then ca say that love old man that lady sophie carolina stowte be woman 'd have choose for companion that soapy silky humbugging lord st george be to taste be not sure about st george can be everything to everybody must make excellent bishop know like know also that will have very bad time of at turnover must shoot pheasant week yes with conviction at time that lady sophie carolina be calling infidel behind back for doing so a for feel perfectly certain must spar with be because be marquis said vicar carrying on argument after long pause if know think may say that have allurement for to tell truth have be simply marquis have be at liberty to indulge own wish must never have allowed to be talked out of righteous anger by soft tongued son of to be man of very greatest importance because owns land on people live with whom be concerned be for welfare that must be on good term together therefore if mind sacrifice think will go what for whole week frank vicar be of opinion that week might be judiciously curtailed by two day consequently mr fenwick presented compliment to lady sophie carolina stowte expressed great pleasure mr fenwick must have in going to turnover park on tuesday staying till friday so that will only be shooting two day said vicar will modify aspect of infidelity considerably went to turnover castle poor old marquis have rather bad time of for hour two previous to arrival have become acknowledged fact now in county sam brattle have have nothing to do with murder of farmer trumbull that acquaintance with murderer have sprung from desire to see unfortunate sister settled in marriage with man whom at time did not know to be disreputable there have therefore be reaction in favour of sam brattle whom county now began to regard a something of hero marquis understanding have come to be aware that have wronged vicar in matter of murder then though have be told upon very good authority no le than of daughter who have be so informed by sister of most exemplary neighbouring curate mr fenwick be man who believed just next to nothing must just a soon associate with downright pagan like old brattle a with professing christian still there be fact of bishop good opinion though marquis be self willed man to bishop be always bishop be also clear to that have be misled in charge have made against vicar in matter of poor carry brattle residence at salisbury something of truth of girl history have come to ear of marquis have be made to believe that have be wrong then there be affair of chapel in under son advice be at moment expending l in rectifying mistake have made in giving marquis due must acknowledge that cared little about money marquis though may have large property be not always in possession of number of loose hundred can throw away without feeling loss be marquis of trowbridge so circumstanced now that trouble did not gall nearly so severely a necessity be on to rectify error made by have done foolish thing under circumstance must chapel have be built on spot knew now knew that must apologise noblesse oblige old lord be very stupid very wrong headed sometimes very arrogant must not do wrong if knew nothing on earth must make tell wilful lie epithet indeed might have be omitted for lie be not lie unless be wilful lord trowbridge passed hour of tuesday morning under frightful sense of necessity for apologising yet remembered well impudence of man how have ventured to allude to lady stowte likening to to to be terrible to be thought of lordship remembered too how man have written about principal entrance to own mansion a though have be no more than entrance to other man house though thorn still rankled in own flesh have to own that have be wrong did with honesty be beyond reach of much more clever son when fenwicks arrived be taken into drawing room in be sitting lady sophie carolina with various guest already assembled at castle in minute two marquis shuffled in shook hand with two new comer then shuffled about room for minute two at last got arm through of vicar led away into own sanctum mr fenwick said think best to express regret at once for two thing have occurred illustration drawing room at turnover castle doe not signify lord doe signify to if will listen to for moment will take doing so a favour added to have conferred upon in coming here vicar must only bow listen be sorry mr fenwick must have written to bishop of diocese in reference to conduct fenwick found very difficult to hold tongue when be said imagined that marquis be going to excuse about chapel about chapel cared nothing at a to letter to bishop did feel that le said about better restrained however marquis went on thing have be told mr fenwick thought be doing duty did harm lord believe not have be misinformed apologise marquis paused vicar bowed be probable that vicar did not at know how deep at moment be suffering of marquis now a to chapel continued marquis lord be trifle that must let say that be not have not be of slightest consequence be misled a to bit of ground only wish lord that chapel must stand there be impossible land have be appropriated to other purpose though have be little in dark about own right right must be done will only add have greatest satisfaction in seeing mr fenwick at turnover that hope satisfaction may often be repeated then led way back into drawing room evil hour have passed over head upon whole thing went very well with vicar wife during visit did go out shooting one day be treated very civilly by turnover gamekeeper though be prepared with five pound note at end of day amusement when returned to house host congratulated on performance just a cordially a though have be one of laity on next day rode over with lord

with equanimity be taken to see parish school be walked into parish church in stowte family be possessed of enormous recess called pew be in truth room with fireplace in mr fenwick thought did not look very much like church a lady stowte be clearly very proud of held peace a to idea so visit to turnover park be made fenwicks be driven home after there be nothing like burying hatchet said who
