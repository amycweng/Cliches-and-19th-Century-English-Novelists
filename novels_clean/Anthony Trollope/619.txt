munificence on part of mr harding have not be unopposed mr chadwick have mildly seriously dissuaded from strong minded son in law archdeacon man of whom alone mr harding stood in awe have urgently nay

of life have not called on to be so yet can hardly be called idler since appointment to precentorship have published with possible addition of vellum typography gilding collection of ancient church music with correct dissertation on purcell crotch naris have greatly improved choir of barchester under dominion now rival that of cathedral in england have taken something more than fair share in cathedral service have played violoncello daily to such audience a must collect faute de mieux to audience at must mention one other peculiarity of mr harding a have before stated have income of eight hundred year have family one daughter yet be never quite at ease in money matter vellum gilding of harding church music cost more than one know except author publisher rev grantly who allows none of father in law extravagance to escape then be generous to daughter for whose service keep small carriage pair of pony be indeed generous to especially to twelve old men who be in peculiar manner under care doubt with income mr harding must be above world a saying be at rate be not above archdeacon theophilus grantly for be always more le in debt to son in law who have to certain extent assumed arrangement of precentor pecuniary affair chapter ii barchester reformer mr harding have be now precentor of barchester for ten year ala murmur respecting proceeds of hiram estate be again becoming audible be not that one begrudges to mr harding income enjoys comfortable place so well becomes such matter have begun to be talked of in various part of england eager pushing politician have asserted in house of common with very telling indignation that grasping priest of church of england be gorged with wealth charity of former time have left for solace of aged education of young well known case of hospital of st cross have even come before law court of country struggle of mr whiston at rochester have met with sympathy support men be beginning to say that thing must be looked into mr harding whose conscience in matter be clear who have never felt that have received pound from hiram will to be not entitled have naturally taken part of church in talking over matter with friend bishop son in law archdeacon archdeacon indeed dr grantly have be somewhat loud in matter be personal friend of dignitary of rochester chapter have written letter in public press on subject of turbulent dr whiston admirer think must well nigh set question at rest be also known at oxford that be author of pamphlet signed sacerdos on subject of earl of guildford st cross in be so clearly argued that manner of present time admit of literal adhesion to very word of founder will that interest of church for founder be so deeply concerned be best consulted in enabling bishop to reward shining light whose service have be most signally serviceable to christianity in answer to be asserted that henry de blois founder of st cross be not greatly interested in welfare of reformed church that master of st cross for many year past can not be called shining light in service of christianity be however stoutly maintained doubt felt by archdeacon friend that logic be conclusive have not in fact be answered with tower of strength to back argument conscience may be imagined that mr harding have never felt compunction a to receiving quarterly sum of two hundred pound indeed subject have never presented to mind in shape have talked not unfrequently heard very much about will of old founder income arising from estate during last year two did even at one moment feel doubt since expelled by son in law logic a to whether lord guildford be clearly entitled to receive so enormous income a doe from revenue of st cross that be overpaid with modest eight hundred pound who out of voluntarily gave up sixty two pound eleven shilling fourpence year to twelve old neighbour who for money doe precentor work a precentor have done before since barchester cathedral be built idea have never sullied quiet disturbed conscience nevertheless mr harding be becoming uneasy at rumour know to prevail in barchester on subject be aware that at rate two of old men have be heard to say that if everyone have own might have hundred pound year live like gentleman instead of beggarly one shilling sixpence day that have slender cause to be thankful for miserable dole of twopence when mr harding mr chadwick between ran away with thousand of pound good old john hiram never intended for like of be ingratitude of sting mr harding one of discontented pair abel handy be put into hospital by have be stone mason in barchester have broken thigh by fall from scaffolding while employed about cathedral mr harding have given first vacancy in hospital after occurrence although dr grantly have be very anxious to put into insufferable clerk of at plumstead episcopi who have lost teeth whom archdeacon hardly knew how to get rid of by other mean dr grantly have not forgotten to remind mr harding how well satisfied with one sixpence day old joe mutter must have be how injudicious be on part of mr harding to allow radical from town to get into concern probably dr grantly forgot at moment that charity be intended for broken down journeyman of barchester there be living at barchester young man surgeon named john bold mr harding dr grantly be well aware that to be owing pestilent rebellious feeling have shown in hospital yes renewal too of disagreeable talk about hiram estate be now again prevalent in barchester nevertheless mr harding mr bold be acquainted with other may say be friend considering great disparity in year dr grantly however have holy horror of impious demagogue a on one occasion called bold when speaking of to precentor being more prudent far seeing man than mr harding possessed of stronger head already perceives that john bold will work great trouble in barchester considers that be to be regarded a enemy think that must not be admitted into camp on anything like friendly term a john bold will occupy much of attention must endeavour to explain who be why take part of john hiram bedesman john bold be young surgeon who passed many of boyish year at barchester father be physician in city of london where made moderate fortune invested in house in city dragon of wantly inn posting house belonged to also four shop in high street moiety of new row of genteel villa so called in advertisement built outside town just beyond hiram hospital to one of dr bold retired to spend evening of life to die here son john spent holiday afterwards christmas vacation when went from school to study surgery in london hospital just a john bold be entitled to write surgeon apothecary old dr bold died leaving barchester property to son certain sum in three per cent to daughter mary who be four five year older than brother john bold determined to settle at barchester look after own property a well a bone body of such of neighbour a must call upon for assistance in trouble therefore put up large brass plate with john bold surgeon on to great disgust of nine practitioner who be already trying to get living out of bishop dean canon began house keeping with aid of sister at time be not more than twenty four year old though have now be three year in barchester have not heard that have done much harm to nine worthy practitioner indeed dread of have died away for in three year have not taken three fee nevertheless john bold be clever man must with practice be clever surgeon have got quite into line of life having enough to live on have not be forced to work for bread have declined to subject to what call drudgery of profession by believe mean general work of practising surgeon have found other employment frequently bind up bruise set limb of such of poorer class a profess way of thinking doe for love now will not say that archdeacon be strictly correct in stigmatising john bold a demagogue for hardly know how extreme must be man opinion before can be justly so called bold be strong reformer passion be reform of abuse state abuse church abuse corporation abuse have got elected town councillor of barchester have so worried three consecutive mayor that became somewhat difficult to find fourth abuse in medical practice general abuse in world at large bold be thoroughly sincere in patriotic endeavour to mend mankind there be something to be admired in energy with devotes to remedying evil stopping injustice fear that be too much imbued with idea that have special mission for reforming must be well if one so young have little more diffidence more trust in honest purpose of others if must be brought to believe that old custom need not necessarily be evil that change may possibly be dangerous bold have ardour self assurance of danton hurl anathema against time honoured practice with violence of french jacobin wonder that dr grantly must regard bold a firebrand falling a have done almost in centre of quiet ancient close of barchester cathedral dr grantly must have avoided a plague old doctor mr harding be fast friend young johnny bold used to play a boy on mr harding lawn have many time won precentor heart by listening with rapt attention to sacred strain since day to tell truth at once have nearly won heart within same wall eleanor harding have not plighted troth to john bold have perhaps owned to herself how dear to young reformer be can not endure that anyone must speak harshly of doe not dare to defend when brother in law be so loud against for like father be somewhat afraid of dr grantly be beginning greatly to dislike archdeacon persuades father that must be unjust injudicious to banish young friend because of politics care little to go to house where will not meet in fact be in love be there good reason why eleanor harding must not love john bold have quality be likely to touch girl heart be brave eager amusing well made good looking young enterprising character be in respect good have sufficient income to support wife be father friend above be in love with then why must not eleanor harding be attached to john bold dr grantly who have a many eye a argus have long seen how wind blow in direction think there be various strong reason why must not be so have not thought wise a yet to speak to father in law on subject for know how foolishly indulgent be mr harding in everything that concern daughter have discussed matter with trusted helpmate within sacred recess formed by clerical bed curtain at plumstead episcopi how much sweet solace how much valued counsel have archdeacon received within sainted enclosure 't be there alone that unbends come down from high church pedestal to level of mortal man in world dr grantly never lay aside demeanour so well becomes have dignity of ancient saint with sleekness of modern bishop be always same be always archdeacon unlike homer never nod even with father in law even with bishop dean maintains that sonorous tone lofty deportment strike awe into young heart of barchester absolutely cow whole parish of plumstead episcopi 't be only when have exchanged that ever new shovel hat for tasselled nightcap shining black habiliment for accustomed robe de nuit that dr grantly talk look think like ordinary man many of have often thought how severe trial of faith must be to wife of great church dignitary to men be personification of st paul very gait be speaking clean sombre apparel exacts from faith submission cardinal virtue seem to hover round sacred hat dean archbishop in garb of order be sure of reverence well got up bishop fill very soul with awe how can feeling be perpetuated in bosom of who see bishop without apron archdeacon even in lower state of dishabille do not know reverend sacred personage before whom tongue cease to be loud step to be elastic be once to see stretch beneath bed clothes yawn widely bury face upon pillow must chatter before a glibly a before doctor lawyer from such cause doubtless arose that archdeacon listened to counsel of wife though considered entitled to give counsel to other being whom met dear said a adjusted copious fold of nightcap there be that john bold at father again to day must say father be very imprudent be imprudent always be replied mr grantly speaking from under comfortable bed clothes there be nothing new in dear there be nothing new know at present juncture of affair such imprudence be be will tell what dear if doe not take care what be about john bold will be off with eleanor think will whether papa take care why not why not almost screamed archdeacon giving so rough pull at nightcap a almost to bring over nose why not pestilent interfering upstart john bold most vulgar young person ever met do know that be meddling with father affair in most uncalled for most being at loss for epithet sufficiently injurious finished expression of horror by muttering good heaven in manner have be found very efficacious in clerical meeting of diocese must for moment have forgotten where be a to vulgarity archdeacon mr grantly have never assumed more familiar term than in addressing husband agree with not that like mr bold be great deal too conceited for then eleanor doe must be best thing in world for papa if be to marry bold must never trouble about hiram hospital if be be son in law lady turned round under bed clothes in manner to doctor be well accustomed told a plainly a word a far a be concerned subject be over for night good heaven murmured doctor again be evidently much put beside dr grantly be by mean bad man be exactly man education a be most likely to form intellect being sufficient for place in world not sufficient to put in advance of performs with rigid constancy such of duty of parish clergyman a be to thinking above sphere of curate be a archdeacon that shine believe a general rule that bishop archdeacon have sinecure where bishop work archdeacon have little to do vice versa in diocese of barchester archdeacon of barchester doe work in capacity be diligent authoritative a friend particularly boast judicious great fault be overbearing assurance of virtue claim of order great foible be equally strong confidence in dignity of own manner eloquence of own word be moral man believing precept teach believing also that act up to though can not say that must give coat to man who took cloak that be prepared to forgive brother even seven time be severe enough in exacting due considering that laxity in respect must endanger security of church must have way must consign to darkness perdition not only individual reformer committee commission must even dare to ask question respecting appropriation of church revenue be church revenue laity admit surely church be able to administer own revenue be thus be accustomed to argue when sacrilegious doings of lord john russell others be discussed either at barchester at oxford be wonder that dr grantly did not like john bold that wife suggestion that must become closely connected with man dismayed to give due archdeacon never wanted courage be quite willing to meet enemy on field with weapon have belief in own argument that felt sure of success must only be sure of fair fight on part of adversary have idea that john bold must really prove that income of hospital be malappropriated why then must peace be sought for on such base term what bribe unbelieving enemy of church with sister in law of one dignitary daughter of with young lady whose connection with diocese chapter of barchester be so close a to give undeniable claim to husband endowed with of sacred wealth when dr grantly talk of unbelieving enemy doe not mean to imply want of belief in doctrine of church equally dangerous scepticism a to purity in money matter mr grantly be not usually deaf to claim of high order to belongs husband rarely disagree a to tone with church must be defended how singular then that in case a must be willing to succumb archdeacon again murmur good heaven a lay beside doe so in voice audible only to repeat till sleep relief from deep thought mr harding have seen reason why daughter must not love john bold have not be unobservant of feeling perhaps deepest regret at part fear bold be about to take regarding hospital arises from dread that may be separated from daughter that may be separated from man love have never spoken to eleanor about lover be last man in world to allude to subject unconsulted even with own daughter have considered that have ground to disapprove of bold must have removed forbidden house saw such ground must probably have preferred second clerical son in law for mr harding also be attached to order failing in must at rate have wished that so near connection must have thought alike with on church matter must not however reject man daughter loved because differed on such subject with hitherto bold have taken step in matter in way annoying to mr harding personally month since after severe battle cost not little money gained victory over certain old turnpike woman in neighbourhood of whose charge old woman have complained to got act of parliament relating to trust found that protegee have be wrongly taxed rode through gate paying toll then brought action against gate keeper proved that people coming up certain by lane going down certain other by lane be toll free fame of success spread widely abroad began to be looked on a upholder of right of poor of barchester not long after success heard from different quarter that hiram bedesman be treated a pauper whereas property to be in effect heir be very large be instigated by lawyer whom have employed in case of turnpike to call upon mr chadwick for statement a to fund of estate bold have often expressed indignation at malappropriation of church fund in general in hearing of friend precentor conversation have never referred to anything at barchester when finney attorney induced to interfere with affair of hospital be against mr chadwick that effort be to be directed bold soon found that if interfered with mr chadwick a steward must also interfere with mr harding a warden though regretted situation in must place be not man to flinch from undertaking from personal motif a soon a have determined to take matter in hand set about work with usual energy got copy of john hiram will of wording of made perfectly master ascertained extent of property a nearly a must value of made out schedule of what be informed be present distribution of income armed with particular called on mr chadwick having given that gentleman notice of visit asked for statement of income expenditure of hospital for last twenty five year be of course refused mr chadwick alleging that have authority for making public concern of property in managing be only paid servant who be competent to give that authority mr chadwick asked bold only who employ mr bold said steward who be mr chadwick demanded bold mr chadwick begged to say that if inquiry be made merely out of curiosity must decline answering if mr bold have ulterior proceeding in view perhaps must be desirable that necessary information must be sought for in professional way by professional man mr chadwick attorney be messrs cox cummins of lincoln inn mr bold took down address of cox cummins remarked that weather be cold for time of year wished mr chadwick good morning mr chadwick said be cold for june bowed out at once went to lawyer finney now bold be not very fond of attorney a said merely wanted man who knew form of law who must do what be told for money have idea of putting in hand of lawyer wanted law from lawyer a did coat from tailor because must not make so well thought finney fittest man in barchester for purpose in one respect at rate be right finney be humility finney advised instant letter to cox cummins mindful of six eightpence slap at at once mr bold demand categorically explicitly full statement of affair of hospital suppose be to see mr harding first suggested bold yes yes by mean said acquiescing finney though perhaps a mr harding be man of business may lead lead to little difficulty perhaps be right mr bold think seeing mr harding can do harm finney saw from expression of client face that intended to have own way chapter iii bishop of barchester bold at once repaired to hospital day be now far advanced knew that mr harding dined in summer at four that eleanor be accustomed to drive in evening that might therefore probably find mr harding alone be between seven eight when reached slight iron gate leading into precentor garden though a mr chadwick observed day have be cold for june evening be mild soft sweet little gate be open a raised latch heard note of mr harding violoncello from far end of garden advancing before house across lawn found playing not without audience musician be seated in garden chair just within summer house so a to allow violoncello held between knee to rest upon dry stone flooring before stood rough music desk on be open page of dear sacred book that much laboured much loved volume of church music have cost so many guinea around sat lay stood leaned ten of twelve old men who dwelt with beneath old john hiram roof two reformer be not there will not say that in heart be conscious of wrong done to be done to mild warden latterly have kept aloof from music be no longer to taste be amusing to see position eager listening face of well to do old men will not say that appreciated music heard be intent on appearing to do so pleased at being where be be determined a far a in lay to give pleasure in return be not unsuccessful gladdened precentor heart to think that old bedesman whom loved so well admired strain be to so full of almost ecstatic joy used to boast that such be air of hospital a to make precinct specially fit for worship of st cecilia immediately before on extreme corner of bench ran round summer house sat one old man with handkerchief smoothly lain upon knee who did enjoy moment acted enjoyment well be one on whose large frame many year for be over eighty have made small havoc be still upright burly handsome figure with open ponderous brow round clung few though very few thin gray lock coarse black gown of hospital breech buckled shoe became well a sat with hand folded on staff chin resting on hand be such listener a most musician must be glad to welcome man be certainly pride of hospital have always be custom that one must be selected a being to extent in authority over others though mr bunce for such be name so be always designated by inferior brother have greater emolument than have assumed well knew how to maintain dignity of elevation precentor delighted to call sub warden be not ashamed occasionally when other guest be there to bid sit down by same parlour fire drink full glass of port be placed near bunce never went without second glass entreaty ever made take third well well mr harding be too good much too good 'd always say a second glass be filled when be drunk half hour over bunce stood erect with benediction patron valued retired to own abode knew world too well to risk comfort of such halcyon moment by prolonging till be disagreeable mr bunce a may be imagined be most strongly opposed to innovation not even dr grantly have more holy horror of who must interfere in affair of hospital be inch churchman though be not very fond of dr grantly personally that arose from there not being room in hospital for two people so much alike a doctor rather than from dissimilarity in feeling mr bunce be inclined to think that warden must manage hospital without further assistance that though bishop be constitutional visitor a such entitled to special reverence from connected with john hiram will john hiram never intended that affair must be interfered with by archdeacon at present moment however care be off mind be looking at warden a though thought music heavenly musician hardly le so a bold walked silently over lawn mr harding did not at first perceive continued to draw bow slowly across plaintive wire soon found from audience that stranger be there looking up began to welcome young friend with frank hospitality pray mr harding pray let disturb said bold know how fond be of sacred music oh be nothing said precentor shutting up book then opening again a saw delightfully imploring look of old friend bunce oh bunce bunce bunce fear that after thou art flatterer well will just finish then be favourite little bit of bishop then mr bold will have stroll chat till eleanor come in give tea so bold sat down on soft turf to listen rather to think how after such sweet harmony might best introduce theme of so much discord to disturb peace of who be so ready to welcome kindly bold thought that performance be soon over for felt that have somewhat difficult task almost regretted final leave taking of last of old men slow a be in going through adieu bold heart be in mouth a precentor made ordinary kind remark a to friendliness of visit one evening call said be worth ten in morning be formality in morning real social talk never begin till after dinner be why dine early so a to get a much a can of quite true mr harding said other fear have reversed order of thing owe much apology for troubling on business at hour be on business have called just now mr harding looked blank annoyed there be something in tone of young man voice told that interview be intended to be disagreeable shrank back at finding kindly greeting so repulsed wish to speak to about hospital continued bold well well anything can tell will be most happy be about account then dear fellow can tell nothing for be a ignorant a child know be that pay l year go to chadwick know about account now tell will poor mary jones ever get use of limb again well think will if be careful mr harding hope wo object to discus with have to say about hospital mr harding gave deep long drawn sigh did object very strongly object to discus such subject with john bold have not business tact of mr chadwick did not know how to relieve from coming evil sighed sadly made answer have greatest regard for mr harding continued bold truest respect most sincere thank ye thank ye mr bold interjaculated precentor somewhat impatiently be much obliged never mind be a likely to be in wrong a man quite a likely mr harding must express what feel lest must think there be personal enmity in what be going to do personal enmity going to do why be not going to cut throat put into ecclesiastical court bold tried to laugh must be quite in earnest determined in course must make joke of walked on awhile in silence before recommenced attack during mr harding who have still bow in hand played rapidly on imaginary violoncello fear there be reason to think that john hiram will be not carried out to letter mr harding said young man at last have be asked to see into very well have objection on earth now need not say word about only one word more mr harding chadwick have referred to cox cummins think duty to apply to for statement about hospital in what do may appear to be interfering with hope will forgive for doing so mr bold said other stopping speaking with solemnity if act justly say nothing in matter truth use unfair weapon in carrying out purpose will have nothing to forgive presume think be not entitled to income receive from hospital that others be entitled to whatever may do will never attribute to base motif because hold opinion opposed to own adverse to interest pray do what consider to be duty can give assistance neither will offer obstacle let however suggest to that can in wise forward view mine by discussion between here come eleanor pony will go in to tea bold however felt that must not sit down at ease with mr harding daughter after what have passed therefore excused with much awkward apology merely raising hat bowing a passed eleanor pony chair left in disappointed amazement at departure mr harding demeanour certainly impressed bold with full conviction that warden felt that stood on strong ground almost made think that be about to interfere without due warrant in private affair of just honourable man mr harding be anything satisfied with own view of case in first place wished for eleanor sake to think well of bold to like yet must not feel disgusted at arrogance of conduct what right have to say that john hiram will be not fairly carried out then question must arise within heart be will fairly acted on did john hiram mean that warden of hospital must receive considerably more out of legacy than twelve old men together for whose behoof hospital be built must be possible that john bold be right that reverend warden of hospital have be for last ten year more unjust recipient of income legally equitably belonging to others what if must be proved before light of day that whose life have be so happy so quiet so respected have absorbed eight thousand pound to have title must never repay say that feared that such be really case first shade of doubt now fell across mind from evening for many long long day good kind loving warden be happy at ease thought of kind first moment of much misery oppressed mr harding a sat sipping tea absent ill at ease poor eleanor felt that be not right idea a to cause of evening discomfort did not go beyond lover sudden uncivil departure thought there must have be quarrel between bold father be half angry with though did not attempt to explain to herself why be so mr harding thought long deeply over thing before went to bed after a lay awake questioning within validity of claim to income enjoyed seemed clear at rate that however unfortunate might be at having be placed in such position one must say that ought either to have refused appointment first to have rejected income afterwards world meaning ecclesiastical world a confined to english church knew that wardenship of barchester hospital be snug sinecure one have ever be blamed for accepting to how much blame however must have be open have rejected how mad must have be thought have declared when situation be vacant offered to that have scruple a to receiving l year from john hiram property that have rather stranger must posse how must dr grantly have shaken wise head have consulted with friend in close a to decent retreat for coming insanity of poor minor canon if be right in accepting place be clear to also that must be wrong in rejecting part of income attached to patronage be valuable appanage of bishopric surely must not be duty to lessen value of preferment have be bestowed on surely be bound to stand by order somehow argument though seemed logical be not satisfactory be john hiram will fairly carried out be true question if not be not especial duty to see that be done especial duty injury might do to order however ill such duty might be received by patron friend at idea of friend mind turned unhappily to son in law knew well how strongly must be supported by dr grantly if must bring to put case into archdeacon hand to allow to fight battle knew also that must find sympathy there for doubt friendly feeling inward comfort dr grantly must be ready enough to take up cudgel against comer on behalf of church militant must do so on distasteful ground of church infallibility contest must give comfort to mr harding doubt be not so anxious to prove right a to be so have said before dr grantly be working man of diocese that father bishop be somewhat inclined to idle life so be bishop though have never be active man be one whose quality have rendered dear to who knew be very opposite to son be bland kind old man opposed by feeling to authoritative demonstration episcopal ostentation be perhaps well for in situation that son have early in life be able to do must not well do when be younger must not have done at now that be over bishop knew how to entertain clergy of diocese to talk easy small talk with rector wife put curate at ease required strong hand of archdeacon to deal with such a be refractory either in doctrine life bishop mr harding loved other warmly have grown old together have together spent many many year in clerical pursuit clerical conversation when one of be bishop other only minor canon be even then much together since child have married mr harding have become warden precentor be in to other will not say that managed diocese between spent much time in discussing man who did in forming little plan to mitigate wrath against church delinquent soften aspiration for church dominion mr harding determined to open mind confess doubt to old friend to went on morning after john bold uncourteous visit up to period rumour of cruel proceeding against hospital have reached bishop ear have doubtless heard that men existed who questioned right to present to sinecure of l year a have heard from time to time of special immorality disgraceful disturbance in usually decent quiet city of barchester did be called on to do on such occasion be to shake head to beg son great dictator to see that harm happened to church be long story that mr harding have to tell before made bishop comprehend own view of case need not follow through tale at first bishop counselled one step recommended one remedy have one medicine in whole pharmacopoeia strong enough to touch so grave disorder prescribed archdeacon refer to archdeacon repeated a mr harding spoke of bold visit archdeacon will set quite right about that kindly said when friend spoke with hesitation of justness of cause man have got up that so well a archdeacon dose though large failed to quiet patient indeed almost produced nausea bishop said did ever read john hiram will bishop thought probably have thirty five year ago when first instituted to see must not state positively however very well knew that have absolute right to present to wardenship that income of warden have be regularly settled bishop question be who have power to settle if a young man say will provides that proceeds of property be to be divided into share who have power to alter provision bishop have indistinct idea that altered by lapse of year that kind of ecclesiastical statute of limitation barred right of twelve bedesman to increase of income arising from increased value of property said something about tradition more of many learned men who by practice have confirmed present arrangement then went at length into propriety of maintaining due difference in rank income between beneficed clergyman certain poor old men who be dependent on charity concluded argument by reference to archdeacon precentor sat thoughtfully gazing at fire listening to good natured reasoning of friend what bishop said have sort of comfort in be not sustaining comfort made mr harding feel that many others indeed others of own order must think right failed to prove to that truly be so bishop said at last after have sat silent for while must deceive too if did not tell that be very unhappy about suppose can not bring to agree with dr grantly that find after inquiry that young man be right be wrong what then two old men be sitting near other so near that bishop be able to lay hand upon other knee did so with gentle pressure mr harding well knew what that pressure meant bishop have further argument to adduce must not fight for cause a son must do must not prove precentor doubt to be groundless must sympathise with friend did so mr harding felt that have received that for came there be period of silence after bishop asked with degree of irritable energy very unusual with whether pestilent intruder meaning john bold have friend in barchester mr harding have fully made up mind to tell bishop everything to speak of daughter love a well a own trouble to talk of john bold in double capacity of future son in law present enemy though felt to be sufficiently disagreeable now be time to do be very intimate at own house bishop bishop stared be not so far gone in orthodoxy church militancy a son still must not bring to understand how so declared enemy of establishment must be admitted on term of intimacy into house not only of so firm pillar a mr harding one so much injured a warden of hospital indeed like mr bold much personally continued disinterested victim to tell 'truth hesitated a brought out dreadful tidings have sometimes thought not improbable that must be second son in law bishop did not whistle believe that lose power of doing so on being consecrated that in day one might a easily meet corrupt judge a whistling bishop looked a though must have done so for apron what brother in law for archdeacon what alliance for barchester close what connection for even episcopal palace bishop in simple mind felt doubt that john bold have so much power must shut up cathedral probably parish church distribute tithe among methodist baptist other savage tribe utterly annihilate sacred bench make shovel hat lawn sleeve a illegal a cowl sandal sackcloth here be nice man to be initiated into comfortable arcanum of ecclesiastical snuggery one who doubted integrity of parson probably disbelieved trinity mr harding saw what effect communication have made almost repented openness of disclosure however did what must to moderate grief of friend patron say that there be engagement between have there be eleanor must have told know well enough to be assured that must have done so see that be fond of other a man father have have objection to urge against intimacy mr harding said bishop how be to oppose if be son in law mean to oppose be who opposes if anything be to be done in defence suppose chadwick will do suppose oh archdeacon will see to be young man twice brother in law archdeacon will never be deterred from doing what feel to be right mr harding reminded bishop that archdeacon reformer be not yet brother very probably never must be exacted from promise that eleanor name must not be mentioned in discussion between father bishop son archdeacon respecting hospital then took departure leaving poor old friend bewildered amazed confounded chapter iv hiram bedesman party most interested in movement be about to set barchester by ear be not foremost to discus merit of question a be often case when bishop archdeacon warden steward messrs cox cummins be busy with matter in own

public one noble lord have become earl par excellence in doctor estimation how silenced that fellow at rochester of course must have haphazard will tell what mr chadwick must take care to be in time other party will forestall with admiration for sir abraham doctor seemed to think not impossible that great man might be induced to lend gigantic power to side of church enemy having settled point to satisfaction doctor stepped down to hospital to learn how matter be going on there a walked across hallowed close looked up at raven who cawed with peculiar reverence a wended way thought with

presence of miss harding though rightly guessed that lady be not indifferent to name of enemy nelly dear fetch spectacle from back room said father anxious to save blush feeling eleanor brought spectacle while father be trying in ambiguous phrase to explain to too practical brother in law that might be a well not to say anything about bold before then retreated nothing have be explained to about bold hospital with woman instinct knew that thing be going wrong must soon be doing something commenced archdeacon wiping brow with large bright coloured handkerchief for have felt busy have walked quick be broiling summer day of course have heard of petition mr harding owned somewhat unwillingly that have heard of well archdeacon looked for expression of opinion none coming continued

ever pitied more than old lord whose almost fabulous wealth drawn from church preferment have become subject of so much opprobrium of such public scorn that wretched clerical octogenarian croesus whom men must not allow to die in peace whom world united to decry to abhor be to suffer fate be humble name to be bandied in men mouth a gormandiser of resource of poor a of one who have filched from charity of other age wealth have be intended to relieve old infirm be to be gibbeted in press to become byword for oppression to be named a example of greed of english church must ever be said that have robbed old men whom so truly so tenderly loved in heart of heart a slowly paced hour after hour under noble lime tree turning sad thought within became fixed in resolve that great step must be taken to relieve from risk of so terrible fate in meanwhile archdeacon with contented mind unruffled spirit went about business said word two to mr chadwick then finding a expected petition lying in father library wrote short answer to men in told that have evil to redress rather great mercy for to be thankful having seen bishop sign got into brougham returned home to mr grantly plumstead

other feeling about brother sister be sitting together when two note be brought in how odd said mary that must send two note well if mr harding becomes fashionable world be going to change brother understood immediately nature intention of peace offering be not so easy for to behave well in matter a be for mr harding be much le difficult for sufferer to be generous than for oppressor john bold felt that must not go to warden party never loved eleanor better than did now have never so strongly felt how anxious be to make wife a now when so many obstacle to doing so appeared in view yet here

danger of trouble of loss of oh papa why have told of before mr harding be not man to judge harshly of anyone much le of daughter whom now loved better than living creature still did judge wrongly at moment knew that loved john bold fully sympathised in affection day after day thought more of matter with tender care of loving father tried to arrange in own mind how matter might be so managed that daughter heart must not be made sacrifice to dispute be likely to exist between bold now when spoke to for first time on subject be natural that must think more of than of that must imagine that own care not be troubling stood silent before awhile a gazed up into face then kissing forehead placed on sofa tell nelly said only called nelly in kindest softest sweetest mood yet mood be kind sweet tell nelly do like mr bold much be quite taken aback by question will not say that have forgotten own love in thinking about john bold while conversing with mary certainly have not done so have be sick at heart to think that man of whom must not own to herself that loved of whose regard have be so proud that man must turn against father to ruin have felt vanity hurt that affection for have not kept from course have really cared for must not have risked love by such outrage main fear have be for father when spoke of danger be of danger to not to herself be taken aback by question altogether do like papa yes nelly do like why must like be poor word do love sat still in arm without answering certainly have not prepared for avowal of affection intending a have done to abuse john bold to hear father do so also come love said let make clean breast of do tell what concern will tell what concern hospital then without waiting for answer described to a best must accusation be made about hiram will claim old men put forward what considered strength what weakness of own position course bold have taken that presumed be about to take then by degree without further question presumed on fact of eleanor love spoke of love a feeling must in way disapprove apologised for bold excused what be doing nay praised for energy intention made much of good quality harped on none of foible then reminding daughter how late be comforting with much assurance hardly felt sent to room with flowing eye full heart when mr harding met daughter at breakfast next morning there be further discussion on matter be subject mentioned between for day soon after party mary bold called at hospital there be various person in drawing room at time therefore said nothing about brother on day following john

with premeditated speech sister tell that have delightful party other evening be so sorry must not be there be sorry said eleanor with dignified composure believe miss harding understand why at moment bold hesitated muttered stopped commenced explanation again again broke down eleanor must not help in least think sister explained to miss harding pray apologise mr bold father will be sure always be glad to see if like to come to house now a formerly nothing have occurred to alter feeling of own view be of course best judge father be be kind generous always be so miss harding hope will not judge harshly because mr bold said may be sure of one thing will always judge father to be right who oppose will judge to be wrong if who know oppose will have charity enough to believe that be wrong through error of judgment must see attacked by who ought to know to love revere of such will be constrained to form different opinion then curtseying low sailed on leaving lover in anything happy state of mind chapter vii jupiter though eleanor harding rode off from john bold on high horse must not be supposed that heart be so elate a demeanour in first place have natural repugnance to losing lover in next be not quite so sure that be in right a pretended to be father have told now repeatedly that bold be doing nothing unjust ungenerous why then must rebuke throw off when felt so ill able to bear loss such be human nature young lady nature especially a walked off from beneath shady elm of close look tone motion gesture of body belied heart must have given world to have taken by hand to

kindness have bold be judging of lover of lady might have understood a well a do in matter of love men see clearly in own affair say that faint heart never won fair lady be amazing to how fair lady be won so faint be often men heart be not for kindness of nature that seeing weakness of courage will occasionally descend from impregnable fortress aid in effecting own defeat too often must escape unconquered if not unscathed free of body if not of heart poor bold crept off quite crestfallen felt that a regarded eleanor harding fate be sealed unless must consent to give up task to have pledged indeed must not be easy for to give up lawyer be engaged question have to certain extent be taken up by public besides how must high spirited girl like eleanor harding really learn to love man for

best after breakfast on morning of be writing archdeacon a usual retired to study intimating that be going to be very busy that must see mr chadwick if called on entering sacred room carefully opened paper case on be wont to compose favourite sermon spread on fair sheet of paper one partly written on then placed inkstand looked at pen folded blotting paper having done so got up again from seat stood with back to fire place yawned comfortably stretching out vastly huge arm opening burly chest then walked across room locked door having so prepared threw into easy chair took from secret drawer beneath table volume of rabelais began to amuse with witty mischief of panurge so passed archdeacon morning on day be left undisturbed at study for hour two when knock came to door mr chadwick be announced rabelais retired into secret drawer easy chair seemed knowingly to betake off when archdeacon quickly undid bolt be discovered by steward working a usual for church of be so useful pillar mr chadwick have just come from london be therefore known to be bearer of important news have got sir abraham opinion at last said mr chadwick a seated well well well exclaimed archdeacon impatiently oh be a long a arm said other ca be told in word can read handed copy in heaven know how many spun out folio of opinion attorney general have managed to cram on back side of case a originally submitted to upshot be said chadwick that there be screw loose in case have better hing be proceeding against mr harding sir abraham hold that under wording of will subsequent arrangement legally sanctioned mr harding be only paid servant defendant must have be corporation of barchester possibly chapter of father w hoo said archdeacon so master bold be on wrong scent be be sir abraham opinion scent almost must be wrong scent sir abraham think that if 'd taken corporation chapter must have baffled bishop think must be surest shot even there must plead that bishop be only visitor that have never made consenting party to performance of other duty be quite clear said archdeacon not quite so clear said other see will say bey lord bishop being graciously pleased to see that due justice be done ' now may be question whether in accepting administering patronage father have not accepted also other duty assigned be doubtful however even if hit nail be far off from yet point be so nice a sir abraham say that must force into fifteen thousand pound cost before must bring to issue where be that sum of money to come from archdeacon rubbed hand with delight have never doubted justice of case have begun to have dread of unjust success on part of enemy be delightful to thus to hear that cause be surrounded with such rock shoal such cause of shipwreck unseen by landsman eye visible enough to keen eye of practical law mariner how wrong wife be to wish that bold must marry eleanor bold why if must be as enough to persevere must be beggar before knew whom be at law with be excellent chadwick be excellent told sir be man for put down on table copy of opinion patted fondly let that be seen though archdeacon who not for world said doctor people will talk know archdeacon of course of course said doctor because if get abroad must teach how to fight own battle quite true said doctor one here in barchester ought to see archdeacon certainly one else said archdeacon pleased with closeness of confidence one else will mr grantly be very interested in matter know said mr chadwick did archdeacon wink did not be inclined to think did not quite wink that without such perhaps unseemly gesture communicated to mr chadwick with corner of eye intimation deep a be mr grantly interest in matter must not procure for perusal of document at same time partly opened small drawer above spoken of deposited paper on volume of rabelais showed to mr chadwick nature of key guarded hidden treasure careful steward then expressed contented ah vain man must fasten up rabelais other thing secret with skill of bramah of chubb where must fasten up key solved mechanical mystery be probable to that content of drawer in house be unknown to mistress think moreover that be entitled to such knowledge said mr chadwick must of course tell father mr harding so much of sir abraham opinion a will satisfy that matter be doing well oh certainly yes of course said doctor have better let know that sir abraham be of opinion that there be case at rate against mr harding that a action be worded at present must fall to ground must be nonsuited if carry on have better tell mr harding that sir abraham be clearly of opinion that be only servant a such not liable if like will see mr harding oh must see to morrow father too will explain to exactly so much wo go before lunch mr chadwick well if will must for know time be precious shook hand with diocesan steward bowed out archdeacon have again recourse to drawer twice read through essence of sir abraham haphazard law enlightened law bewildered brain be very clear that to sir justice of old men claim justice of mr harding defence be idea have never presented legal victory over opposing party be service for sir abraham be a imagined to be paid that according to light have diligently laboured to achieve with probable hope of success of intense desire mr harding felt to be assured on fit authority that be wronging man that be entitled in true equity to income that might sleep at night without pang of conscience that be robber spoiler of poor that world might be openly convinced that be not man jupiter have described to be of such longing on part of mr harding sir abraham be entirely ignorant indeed must be looked on a part of business to gratify such desire such be not system on battle be fought victory gained success be object be generally successful conquered enemy by weakness rather than by own strength have be found almost impossible to make up case in sir abraham a antagonist must not find flaw archdeacon be delighted with closeness of reasoning to do justice be not selfish triumph that desired must personally lose nothing by defeat at least what might lose did not actuate be love of justice made so anxious even mainly solicitude for father in law be fighting part of never ending battle against never conquered foe of church against enemy knew mr harding must not pay expense of doings for long opinion of sir abraham cause to be pleaded speech to be made various court through case be presumed to be dragged knew that father must at least bear heavier portion of tremendous cost to do archdeacon justice did not recoil from be man fond of obtaining money greedy of large income open handed enough in expending be triumph to to foresee success of measure although might be called on to pay so dearly for chapter ix conference on following morning archdeacon be with father betimes note be sent down to warden begging attendance at palace dr grantly a cogitated on matter leaning back in brougham a journeyed into barchester felt that must be difficult to communicate own satisfaction to father father in law wanted success on own side discomfiture on of enemy bishop wanted peace on subject settled peace if possible peace at rate till short remainder of own day have spun out mr harding required not only success peace also demanded that might stand justified before world bishop however be comparatively easy to deal with before arrival of other dutiful son have persuaded father that be going on well then warden arrived be mr harding wont whenever spent morning at palace to seat immediately at bishop elbow bishop occupying huge arm chair fitted up with candle stick reading table drawer other paraphernalia position of chair be never moved summer winter when a be usual archdeacon be there also confronted two elder who thus be enabled to fight battle against together together submit to defeat for such be constant fate warden now took accustomed place having greeted son in law a entered then affectionately inquired after friend health there be gentleness about bishop to soft womanly affection of mr harding particularly endeared be quaint to see how two mild old priest pressed other hand smiled made little sign of love sir abraham opinion have come at last began archdeacon mr harding have heard so much be most anxious to know result be quite favourable said bishop pressing friend arm be so glad mr harding looked at mighty bearer of important news for confirmation of glad tidings yes said archdeacon sir abraham have given most minute attention to case indeed knew must most minute attention opinion be a to opinion on subject being correct one who know sir abraham character can doubt opinion be that hav' got leg to stand on a how archdeacon why in first place be lawyer warden

harding rose know yes yes said archdeacon impatient of poetry at time well two paid servant will say one to look after men other to look after money chadwick be two servant whether of be paid too much too little more le in fact than founder willed be a clear a daylight that one can fall foul of of for receiving allotted stipend doe seem clear said bishop who have winced visibly at word servant stipend however appeared to have caused uneasiness to archdeacon quite clear said very satisfactory in point of fact being necessary to select such servant for use of hospital pay to be given to must depend on rate of pay for such service according to market value at period in question who manage hospital must be only judge of who doe manage hospital asked warden oh let find out be question action be brought against chadwick be defence perfect full defence be now that think very satisfactory well said bishop looking inquiringly up into friend face who sat silent awhile apparently not so well satisfied conclusive continued archdeacon if press to jury wo do twelve men in england will take five minute to decide against according to said mr harding might a well have sixteen hundred year a eight if manager choose to allot to a be one of manager if not chief manager can hardly be just arrangement oh well be nothing to question question be whether intruding fellow lot of cheating attorney pestilent dissenter be to interfere with arrangement everyone know be essentially just serviceable to church pray let be splitting hair amongst there will never be end of cause cost mr harding again sat silent for while during bishop once again pressed arm looked in face to see if must catch gleam of contented eased mind there be such gleam poor warden continued playing sad dirge on invisible stringed instrument in manner of position be ruminating in mind on opinion of sir abraham looking to wearily earnestly for satisfaction finding none at last said did see opinion archdeacon archdeacon said have not be to say have be have not seen opinion have seen what have be called copy must not say whether of whole part must say that what have seen be ipsissima verba of great man what have seen contained exactly decision have announced again declared to be to mind extremely satisfactory must like to see opinion said warden be copy of well suppose can if make point of see use myself of course be essential that purport of must not be known be therefore unadvisable to multiply copy why must not be known asked warden what question for man to ask said archdeacon throwing up hand in token of surprise be like child be not more innocent than be in matter of business ca see that if tell that action will lie against that one may possibly lie against other person person that will be putting weapon into hand be teaching how to cut own throat warden again sat silent bishop again looked at wistfully only thing have now to do continued archdeacon be to remain quiet hold peace let play own game a please be not to make known then said warden that have consulted attorney general that be advised by that founder will be fully fairly carried out god bless soul said archdeacon how odd be that will not see that be to do be to hing why must say anything about founder will be in possession know that be not in position to put out surely be enough for present mr harding rose from seat paced thoughtfully up down library bishop while watching painfully at turn archdeacon continuing to pour forth conviction that affair be in state to satisfy prudent mind jupiter said warden stopping suddenly oh jupiter answered other jupiter can break bone must bear with there be much of course be bounden duty to bear can not be rose for here archdeacon looked exceedingly moral besides matter be too trivial of too little general interest to be mentioned again in jupiter unless stir up subject archdeacon again looked exceedingly knowing worldly wise warden continued walk hard stinging word of newspaper article one of have thrust thorn a be into inmost soul be fresh in memory have read more than once word by word what be worse fancied be a well known to everyone a to be to be looked on a unjust griping priest have be there described be to be pointed at a consumer of bread of poor to be allowed mean of refuting such charge of clearing begrimed name of standing innocent in world a hitherto have stood be to bear to receive a usual now hated income be known a one of greedy priest who by rapacity have brought disgrace on church why why must bear why must die for felt that must not live under weight of obloquy a paced up down room resolved in misery enthusiasm that must with pleasure if be allowed give up place abandon pleasant home leave hospital live poorly happily with unsullied name on small remainder of mean be man somewhat shy of speaking of even before who knew best whom loved most at last burst forth from with somewhat jerking eloquence declared that must not must not bear misery longer if can be proved said at last have just honest right to a god well know always deemed have if salary stipend be really due be not le anxious than to retain have well being of child to look to be too old to miss without pain comfort to have be used be a others be anxious to prove to world have be right to uphold place have held can not do at cost a can not bear must tell to do so appealed almost in tear to bishop who have left chair be now leaning on warden arm a stood on further side of table facing archdeacon must tell to sit there at ease indifferent satisfied while such thing a be said loudly of in world bishop must feel for sympathise with must not advise must only say will be asked to hing be painful will do just what heart tell to be right will do think best theophilus advise pray advise warden to do anything be painful archdeacon though must not sympathise must advise saw that time have come when behoved to do so in somewhat peremptory manner why lord said speaking to father when called father lord good old bishop shook in shoe for knew that evil time be coming why lord there be two way of giving advice there be advice may be good for present day there be advice may be good for day to come now can not bring to give former if be incompatible with other suppose not said bishop re seating shading face with hand mr harding sat down with back to further wall playing to air fitted for so calamitous occasion archdeacon said out say standing with back to empty fire place be not to be supposed that much pain will spring out of unnecessarily raised question must have foreseen that matter have in wise gone on worse than expected will be weak yes wicked also to abandon cause own ourselves wrong because inquiry be painful be not only ourselves have to look to to certain extent interest of church be in keeping must be found that one after of who hold preferment abandoned whenever might be attacked be not plain that such attack must be renewed till nothing be left that if so deserted church of england must fall to ground altogether if be true of many be true of one be accused a now be to throw up wardenship to relinquish preferment be property with vain object of proving disinterested must fail in object must inflict desperate blow on brother clergyman must encourage cantankerous dissenter in england to make similar charge against source of clerical revenue must do best to dishearten who be most anxious to defend uphold position can fancy nothing more weak more wrong be not that think that there be justice in charge that doubt own right to wardenship be convinced of own honesty yet must yield to through cowardice cowardice said bishop expostulating mr harding sat unmoved gazing on son in law well must not be cowardice must not do so because be afraid to endure evil thing will be falsely spoken of must that not be cowardice now let see extent of evil dread jupiter publishes article great many doubt will read of who understand subject how many will believe jupiter everyone know what object be have taken up case against lord guildford against dean of rochester against dozen bishop doe not everyone know that must take up case of kind right wrong false true with known justice known injustice if by doing so must further own view doe not world know of jupiter who really know will think worse of for what jupiter say why care for who know will say nothing of own comfort do say that must not be justified in throwing up in fit of passion for such must be only maintenance that eleanor have if did so if really did vacate wardenship submit to ruin what must profit if have future right to income have have past right to very fact of abandoning position must create demand for repayment of have already received spent poor warden groaned a sat perfectly still looking up at hard hearted orator who thus tormented bishop echoed sound faintly from behind hand archdeacon cared little for such sign of weakness completed exhortation let suppose office to be left vacant that own trouble concerning be over must that satisfy be only aspiration in matter confined to family know be not know be a anxious a of for church to belong what grievous blow must such act of apostasy give owe to church of be member minister to bear with affliction however severe may be owe to father who instituted to support right owe to who preceded to assert legality of position owe to who be to come after to maintain uninjured for received uninjured from others owe to unflinching assistance of perfect brotherhood in matter so that upholding one may support great cause without blushing without disgrace so archdeacon ceased stood self satisfied watching effect of spoken wisdom warden felt to certain extent stifled must have given world to get out into open air without speaking to noticing who be in room with be impossible must not leave without saying something felt confounded by archdeacon eloquence there be heavy unfeeling unanswerable truth in what have said there be so much practical odious common sense in that knew how to assent to differ if be necessary for to suffer felt that must endure without complaint without cowardice providing that be satisfied of justice of own cause what must not endure be that must be accused by others not acquitted by doubting a have begun to doubt justice of own position in hospital knew that own self confidence must not be restored because mr bold have be in error a to legal form must be satisfied to escape because through legal fiction who received greatest benefit from hospital might be considered only a one of servant archdeacon speech have silenced stupefied annihilated anything satisfied with bishop fared not much better did not discern clearly how thing be saw enough to know that battle be to be prepared for battle must destroy few remaining comfort bring with sorrow to grave warden still sat still looked at archdeacon till thought fixed wholly on mean of escape from present position felt like bird fascinated by gazing on snake hope agree with said archdeacon at last breaking dread silence lord hope agree with oh what sigh bishop gave lord hope agree with again repeated merciless tyrant yes suppose so groaned poor old man slowly warden mr harding be now stirred to action must speak move so got up took one turn before answered press for answer just at present will hing lightly in matter of do will give bishop notice so without word took leave escaping quickly through palace hall down lofty step did breathe freely till found alone under huge elm of silent close here walked long slowly thinking on case with troubled air trying in vain to confute archdeacon argument then went home resolved to bear ignominy suspense disgrace self

miserable by position must never again lift up voice boldly a have hitherto done among brother for felt that be disgraced feared even to touch bow for knew how grievous sound of wailing how piteous lamentation must produce be still sitting in same chair same posture having hardly moved limb for two hour when eleanor came back to tea succeeded in bringing with into drawing room tea seemed a comfortless a dinner though warden who have hitherto eaten nothing day devoured plateful of bread butter unconscious of what be doing eleanor have made up mind to force to talk to hardly knew how to

leave have light heart elsewhere if be let go oh papa must be happy if have only bread to eat so long a heart be light eleanor face be lighted up with enthusiasm a told father how might banish care gleam of joy shot across brow a idea of escape again presented again fancied for moment that must spurn away from income world envied that must give lie to wielder of tomahawk who have dared to write such thing of in jupiter that must leave sir abraham archdeacon bold rest of with lawsuit among wipe hand altogether of so sorrow stirring concern ah what happiness might there be in distance with eleanor in small cottage nothing left of former grandeur music yes must walk forth with music book instrument shaking dust from off foot a went leave ungrateful place never did poor clergyman sigh for warm benefice more anxiously than warden did now to be rid of give up papa said again jumping from knee standing on foot before looking boldly into face give up papa oh be sad to see how momentary

unhappy with treasure in house jewel on bosom with so sweet flower in choice garden of heart then floodgate of tongue be loosed at length with unsparing detail of circumstance told that wished that must not do repeated argument of archdeacon not agreeing in truth explaining inability to escape from how have be declared to that be bound to remain where be by interest of order by gratitude to bishop by wish of friend by sense of duty though must not understand be fain to acknowledge told how have be accused of cowardice though be not man to make much of such charge before world now in full candour of heart explained to that accusation be grievous to that did think must be unmanly to desert post merely to escape present suffering therefore must bear a best might misery be prepared for did find detail tedious oh encouraged to dilate on feeling expressed till laid bare inmost corner of heart to spoke together of archdeacon a two child might of stern unpopular still respected schoolmaster of bishop a parent kind a kind must be powerless against omnipotent pedagogue then when have discussed when father have told to child must not be le confiding than have be a john bold name be mentioned between owned how well have learned to love have loved once said must not must not do so now no even have troth be plighted to must have taken back again have sworn to love a wife must have discarded not felt forsworn when proved enemy of father warden declared that bold be enemy of encouraged love gently rebuked a kissed stern resolve have made to cast off then spoke to of happier day when trial must all be over declared that young heart must not be torn asunder to please either priest prelate dean archdeacon not if oxford be to convocate together agree a to necessity of sacrifice so greatly comforted other in what sorrow will not such mutual confidence give consolation with last expression of tender love parted went comparatively happy to room chapter xi iphigenia when eleanor laid head on pillow night mind be anxiously intent on plan by might extricate father from misery in warm hearted enthusiasm self sacrifice be decided on a mean to be adopted be not so good agamemnon worthy of iphigenia must herself personally implore john bold to desist from undertaking must explain to father sorrow cruel misery of position must tell how father must die if be thus dragged before public exposed to such unmerited ignominy must appeal to old friendship to generosity to manliness to mercy if need be must kneel to for favour must ask before did idea of love must be banished there must be bargain in matter to mercy to generosity must appeal a pure maiden hitherto even unsolicited must not appeal to love under such circumstance must allow to do so of course when so provoked must declare passion be to be expected there have be enough between to make such fact sure be equally certain that must be rejected must not be understood a saying make father free be reward there must be sacrifice in not so have jephthah daughter saved father not so must show to kindest dearest of parent how much be able to bear for good to one resolve must whole soul be bound so resolving felt that must make great request to bold with a much self assured confidence a must have done to grandfather now own have fear for heroine not a to upshot of mission not in least a to a to full success of generous scheme ultimate result of project one conversant with human nature novel can have doubt a to amount of sympathy may receive from of own sex girl below twenty old lady above sixty will do justice for in female heart soft spring of sweet romance reopen after many year again gush out with water pure a in earlier day greatly refresh path lead downwards to grave fear that majority of between two era will not approve of eleanor plan fear that unmarried lady of thirty five will declare that there can be probability of so absurd project being carried through young woman on knee before lover be sure to get kissed that must not put in position did not expect that eleanor be going to bold only because circumstance prevent bold from coming to that be certainly little fool little schemer that in probability be thinking good deal more about than father dear lady be right a to appreciation of circumstance very wrong a to miss harding character miss harding be much younger than be must not therefore know a may do to what danger such encounter might expose may get kissed think very probable that will give solemn word positive assurance that remotest idea of such catastrophe never occurred to a made great resolve now alluded to then slept then rose refreshed met father with kindest embrace most loving smile on whole breakfast be by mean so triste a have be dinner day before then making excuse to father for so soon leaving started on commencement of operation knew that john bold be in london that therefore scene must not be enacted to day also knew that be soon to be home probably on next day be necessary that little plan for meeting must be concerted with sister mary when got up to house went a usual into morning sitting room be startled by perceiving by stick greatcoat sundry parcel be lying about bold must already have returned john have come back so suddenly said mary coming into room have be travelling night then will come up again other time said eleanor about to beat retreat in sudden dismay be out now will be for next two hour said other be with horrid finney only came to see return by mail train tonight return by mail train

deed have not made up mind to do very day now felt ill at ease astray in difficulty mary began must see brother before go back oh yes of course said other know will be delighted to see tried to treat a matter of course be not le surprised for mary eleanor have daily talked over john bold conduct love mary must insist on calling eleanor sister must scold for not calling bold by christian name eleanor must half confess love like modest maiden must protest against such familiarity even with name of lover so talked hour after hour mary bold who be much elder looked forward with happy confidence to day when eleanor must not be ashamed to call sister be however fully sure that just at present eleanor must be much more likely to avoid brother than to seek mary must see brother now to day beg from great favour spoke with solemn air not at usual to then went on opened to friend plan well weighed scheme for saving father from sorrow must said if lasted bring to grave mary continued must now know cease joking about mr bold must now say no more about be not ashamed to beg favour from brother when have done so there can never be anything further between said with staid solemn air quite worthy of jephthah daughter of iphigenia be quite clear that mary bold did not follow argument eleanor harding must appeal on behalf of father to bold better feeling seemed to mary quite natural seemed quite natural that must relent overcome by such filial tear by so much beauty to thinking be at rate equally natural that having relented john must put arm round mistress waist say now having settled that let be man wife will end happily why good nature must not be rewarded when such reward must operate to disadvantage of none mary who have more sense than romance must not understand said a much eleanor however be firm made quite eloquent speech to support own view of question must not condescend said to ask favour on other term than proposed mary might perhaps think high flown have own idea must not submit to sacrifice self respect be sure love pleaded mary be sure love better than anything in world eleanor be going to make speech tear came to eye must not so pretended to blow nose walked to window made little inward call on own courage finding somewhat sustained said sententiously mary be nonsense do love said mary who have followed friend to window now spoke with arm close wound round other waist do love with heart know do defy to deny commenced eleanor turning sharply round to refute charge intended falsehood stuck in throat never came to utterance must not deny love so took plentifully to tear leant upon friend bosom sobbed there protested that love love must make difference in resolve called thousand time most cruel of girl swore to secrecy by hundred oath ended by declaring that girl who must betray friend love even to brother must be a black traitor a soldier in garrison who must open city gate to enemy while be yet discussing matter bold returned eleanor be forced into sudden action have to accomplish abandon plan having slipped into friend bedroom a gentleman closed hall door washed mark of tear from eye resolved within to go through with tell be here said coming in mind do leave so mary informed brother with somewhat sombre air miss harding be in next room be coming to speak to eleanor be certainly thinking more of father than a arranged hair before glass removed trace of sorrow from face yet must be untrue if said that be not anxious to appear well before lover why else be so sedulous with stubborn curl must rebel against

future always to wish together contrive together act together eleanor must not gainsay must not make speech say mr bold be stranger mary be always to remain so explained to that though undoubtedly proceeding against hospital have commenced solely with many others be now interested in matter of whom be much more influential than that be to alone however that lawyer looked for instruction a to doings more important still for payment of bill promised that must at once give notice that be intention to abandon cause thought said that be not probable that active step must be taken after have seceded from matter though be possible that passing allusion might still be made to hospital in daily jupiter promised however that must use best influence to prevent further personal allusion being made to mr harding then suggested that must on afternoon ride over to dr grantly inform of altered intention on subject with view postponed immediate return to london be very pleasant eleanor did

triumphant everything must run smooth now eleanor be not at all addicted to lydian school of romance by mean objected to lover because came in at door under name of absolute instead of pulling out of window under name of beverley yet felt that have be imposed upon must hardly think of mary bold with sisterly charity did think must have trusted mary said to herself over over again oh that must have dared to keep in room when tried to get out eleanor however felt that game be up that have now nothing further to do to add to budget of news be prepared for father that john bold be accepted lover

chapter xiii warden decision meeting between eleanor father be not so stormy a described in last chapter be hardly more successful on return from bold house found father in strange state be not sorrowful silent a have be on memorable day when son in law lectured a to that owed to order be in usual quiet mood when eleanor reached hospital be walking to fro upon lawn soon saw that be much excited be going to london dear said a soon a saw london papa yes dear to london will have matter settled way there be thing eleanor can not bear oh papa what be said leading by arm into house have such good news for now make fear be too late then before must let know what have caused sudden resolve must point to fatal paper lay on table told that lawsuit be over bold have commissioned to assure father in name that must be abandoned that there be further cause for misery that whole matter might be looked on a though have never be discussed did not tell with what determined vehemence have obtained concession in favour did mention price be to pay for warden did not express peculiarly gratified at intelligence eleanor though have not worked for thanks be by mean disposed to magnify own good office felt hurt at manner in news be received mr bold can act a think proper love said if mr bold think have be wrong of course will discontinue what be doing can not change purpose oh papa exclaimed cry with vexation thought must have be so happy thought must have be right now mr bold continued have set great people to work so great that doubt be now beyond control read that dear warden doubling up number of jupiter pointed to peculiar article be to read be to last of three leader be generally furnished daily for support of nation that mr harding directed attention dealt heavy blow on various clerical delinquent on family who received ten of thousand yearly for doing nothing on men who a article stated rolled in wealth have earned inherited be in fact stolen from poorer clergy named son of bishop grandson of archbishop men great in way who have redeemed disgrace in eye of many by enormity of plunder then having disposed of leviathan descended to mr harding alluded week since to instance of similar injustice though in more humble scale in warden of almshouse at barchester have become possessed of income of greater part of whole institution why almshouse must have warden can not pretend to explain can say what special need twelve old men can have for service of separate clergyman seeing that have twelve reserved seat for in barchester cathedral be a may let gentleman call warden precentor what will let be never so scrupulous in exacting religious duty from twelve dependent never so negligent a regard service of cathedral appears palpably clear that can be entitled to portion of revenue of hospital excepting founder set apart for be equally clear that founder did not intend that three fifth of charity must be so consumed case be certainly paltry one after ten of thousand with have be dealing for warden income be after poor eight hundred year eight hundred year be not magnificent preferment of warden may for anything know be worth much more to church if so let church pay out of fund justly at own disposal allude to question of barchester almshouse at present moment because understand that plea have be set up will be peculiarly revolting to mind of english churchman action have be taken against mr warden harding on behalf of almsmen by gentleman acting solely on public ground be to be argued that mr harding take nothing what received a servant of hospital that be not responsible for amount of stipend given to for work plea must doubtless be fair if anyone questioned daily wage of bricklayer employed on building fee of charwoman who clean can not envy feeling of clergyman of church of england who must allow argument to be put in mouth if plea be put forward trust mr harding will be forced a witness to state nature of employment amount of work that doe income receives source from whence obtained appointment think will receive much public sympathy to atone for annoyance of such examination a eleanor read article face flushed with indignation when have finished almost feared to look up at father well dear said what do think of be worth while to be warden at price oh papa dear papa mr bold ca un write dear mr bold ca say that sha' be read by clergyman at oxford nay by gentleman in land then walked up down room while eleanor in mute despair followed with eye will tell what dear continued speaking now very calmly in forced manner very unlike mr bold ca dispute truth of word in article have just read can eleanor stared at a though scarcely understood word be speaking can eleanor be worst of must be so if there be remedy have thought much of since be together last night came sat beside put arm round waist a have done then have thought much of what archdeacon have said of what paper say do believe have right to be here no right to be warden of hospital papa no right to be warden with eight hundred year no right to be warden with house a right to spend in luxury money be intended for charity mr bold may do a plea about suit hope will not abandon for sake poor eleanor be hard upon be for have made great resolve for have laid aside quiet demeanour taken upon rant of tragedy heroine one may work not for thanks yet feel hurt at not receiving so be with eleanor one may be disinterested in one good action yet feel discontented that be not recognised charity may be given with left hand so privily that right hand doe not know yet left hand may regret to feel that have immediate reward eleanor have have wish to burden father with weight of obligation yet have looked forward to much delight from knowledge that have freed from sorrow now such hope be entirely over that have done be of avail have humbled to bold in vain evil be utterly beyond power to cure have thought also how gently must whisper to father that lover have said to about herself how impossible have found to reject then have anticipated father kindly kiss close embrace a gave sanction to love ala must say nothing of now in speaking of mr bold father put aside a one whose thought saying act must be of moment gentle reader did ever feel snubbed did ever when thinking much of own importance find suddenly reduced to nonentity such be eleanor feeling now will not put forward plea on behalf continued warden may be truth of matter at rate be not true man who wrote that article be right in saying that plea be revolting to honest mind will go up to london dear see lawyer if better excuse can be made for than hospital will part archdeacon papa ca help dear there be thing man can not bear can not bear that put hand upon newspaper will archdeacon go with to tell truth mr harding have made up mind to steal march upon archdeacon be aware that must take step without informing dread son in law have resolved that must send out note to plumstead episcopi detailing plan that messenger must not leave barchester till have started for london so that might be day before doctor who have doubt must follow in day if have might arrange might explain to sir abraham a warden must have nothing further to do with defence about to be set up might send in official resignation to friend bishop so make public whole transaction even doctor must not be able to undo what have done knew too well doctor strength own weakness to suppose must do if reached london together indeed must never be able to get to london if doctor knew of intended journey in time to prevent think not said think will start before archdeacon must be ready will go early to morrow morning will be best papa said eleanor showing that father ruse be appreciated why yes love fact be wish to do before archdeacon can can interfere there be great deal of truth in say argues very well ca always answer there be old saying nelly 'everyone know where own shoe pinch will say that want moral courage strength of character power of endurance be true be sure ought not to remain here if have nothing better to put forward than quibble so nelly will have to leave pretty place eleanor face brightened up a assured father how cordially agreed with true love said now again quite happy at ease in manner what good to be place money if be to be ill spoken of oh papa be so glad darling child did cost pang at first nelly to think that must lose pretty drawing room pony garden garden will be worst of there be garden at crabtree very pretty garden crabtree parva be name of small living mr harding have held a minor canon still belonged to be only worth eighty pound year small house glebe of be now handed over to mr harding curate be to crabtree

villa on lake of como be so well known to elite of english traveller whose collection of lombard butterfly be supposed to be unique yes said warden musing there be very pretty garden at crabtree will be sorry to disturb poor smith smith be curate of crabtree gentleman who be maintaining wife dozen child on income arising from profession eleanor assured father that a far a be concerned must leave house pony without single regret be only so happy that be going going where must escape dreadful turmoil will take music dear so went on planning future happiness plotting how must arrange without interposition of archdeacon at last again became confidential then warden did thank for what have done eleanor lying on father shoulder did find opportunity to tell secret father gave blessing to child said that man whom loved be honest good kind hearted right thinking in main one who wanted only good wife to put quite upright man love ended by saying to whom firmly believe that can trust treasure with safety what will dr grantly say well dear ca be helped will be out at crabtree then eleanor ran upstairs to prepare father clothes for journey warden returned to garden to make last

under such circumstance must not if must help consult anyone further till advice must be useless must archdeacon catch indeed there must be much advice much consultation of kind not to be avoided hoped better thing a felt that must not now converse on indifferent subject resolved to see one till after interview with attorney general determined to take sanctuary in westminster abbey so again went thither in omnibus finding that door be not open for morning service paid twopence went in a sightseer occurred to that have definite place of rest for day that must be absolutely worn out before

finding there have be sitting unmolested about twenty minute when verger asked whether must like to walk round mr harding did want to walk anywhere declined merely observing that be waiting for morning service verger seeing that be clergyman told that door of choir be now open showed into seat be great point gained archdeacon must certainly not come to morning service at westminster abbey even though be in london here warden must rest quietly when time came duly say prayer longed to get up from seat examine music book of chorister copy of litany from service be chanted to see how far little detail at westminster corresponded with at barchester whether thought own voice must fill church well from westminster precentor seat there must however be impropriety in such meddling sat perfectly still looking up at noble roof guarding against coming fatigue of day by degree two three people entered very same damp old woman who have nearly obliterated in omnibus other just like couple of young lady with veil down gilt cross conspicuous on prayer book old man on crutch party who be seeing abbey thought might a well hear service for twopence a opportunity served young woman with prayer book done up in handkerchief who rushed in late in hurried entry tumbled over one of form made noise that everyone even officiating minor canon be startled be so frightened by echo of own catastrophe that be nearly thrown into fit by panic mr harding be not much edified by manner of service minor canon in question hurried in somewhat late in surplice not in neatest order be followed by dozen chorister who be also not a trim a might have be jostled into place with quick hurried step service be soon commenced soon commenced soon over for there be music time be not unnecessarily lost in chanting on whole mr harding be of opinion that thing be managed better at barchester though even there knew that there be room for improvement appears to question whether clergyman can go through church service with decorum morning after morning in immense building surrounded by not more than dozen listener best actor can not act well before empty bench though there be of course higher motive in one case than other still even best of clergyman can not be influenced by audience to expect that duty must be well done under such circumstance must be to require from human nature more than human power when two lady with gilt cross old man with crutch still palpitating housemaid be going mr harding found obliged to go too verger stood in way looked at looked at door so went returned again in few minute re entered with twopence there be other sanctuary so good for a walked slowly down nave then up one aisle then again down nave up other aisle tried to think gravely of step be about to take

no merit positive disgrace in giving up wardenship if be not prepared to meet world without yes must from time forward bound human wish for daughter to poor extent of so limited income knew have not thought sufficiently of that have be carried away by enthusiasm have hitherto not brought home to full reality of position thought most about daughter naturally be true that be engaged knew enough of

bold in emergency brought on a have be by doing did not like saying to bold have turned out of house income therefore must relieve of daughter preferred reckoning on eleanor a companion of poverty exile a sharer of small income modest provision for daughter have be long since made life be insured for three thousand pound sum be to go to eleanor archdeacon for year past have paid premium have secured by immediate possession of small property be to have gone to mr grantly after father death matter therefore have be taken out of warden hand long since a indeed have business transaction of

parva true crabtree church be not quite mile half from cathedral must not be in two place at once crabtree be small village afternoon service might suffice still went against conscience be not right that parishioner must be robbed of of privilege on account of poverty might to be sure make arrangement for doing week day service at cathedral have chanted litany at barchester so long have conscious feeling that did so well that be unwilling to give up duty thinking of such thing turning over in own mind together small desire grave duty never hesitating for moment a to necessity of leaving

mr harding found retreat well chosen about four o'clock comfort be disturbed by enemy in shape of hunger be necessary that must dine be clear that must not dine in abbey so left sanctuary not willingly betook to neighbourhood of strand to look for food eye have become so accustomed to gloom of church that be dazed when got out into full light of day felt confused ashamed of a though people be staring at hurried along still in dread of archdeacon till came to charing cross then remembered that in one of passage through strand have seen word chop steak on placard in shop window remembered shop distinctly be next door to trunk seller there be cigar shop on other side must go to hotel for dinner to hitherto be only known mode of dining in london at own expense therefore must get steak at shop in strand archdeacon grantly must certainly not come to place for dinner found house easily just a have observed between trunk cigar be rather daunted by huge quantity of fish saw in window there be barrel of oyster hecatomb of lobster few tremendous looking crab tub full of pickled salmon not however being aware of connection between shell fish iniquity entered modestly asked slatternly woman who be picking oyster out of great watery reservoir whether must have mutton chop potato woman looked somewhat surprised answered in affirmative slipshod girl ushered into long back room filled with

rough dirty disreputable cloth put before be abominable knife fork be bruised hacked filthy everything be impregnated with fish have one comfort however be quite alone there be one there to look on dismay be probable that anyone must come to do so be london supper house about one o'clock at night place must be lively enough at present time seclusion be a deep a have be in abbey in about hour untidy girl not yet dressed for evening labour brought chop potato mr harding begged for pint of sherry be impressed with idea be generally prevalent few year since be not yet wholly removed from mind of men to order dinner at kind of inn without also ordering pint of wine for benefit of landlord be kind of fraud not punishable indeed by law not le abominable on account mr harding remembered coming poverty must willingly have saved half crown thought have alternative be soon put in possession of horrid mixture procured from neighbouring public house chop potato however be eatable having got over a best might disgust created by knife fork contrived to swallow dinner be not much disturbed one young man with pale face watery fishlike eye wearing hat ominously on one side did come in stare at ask girl audibly enough who that old cock be annoyance went further warden be left seated on wooden bench in peace endeavouring to distinguish different scent arising from lobster oyster salmon unknowing a mr harding be in way of london felt that have somehow selected ineligible dining house that have better leave be hardly five o'clock how be to pas time till ten five miserable hour be already tired be impossible that must continue walking so long thought of getting into omnibus going out to fulham for sake of coming back in however must be weary work a paid bill to woman in shop asked if there be place near where must get cup of coffee though did keep shellfish supper house be very civil directed to cigar divan on other side of street mr harding have not much correcter notion of cigar divan than have of london dinner house be desperately in want of rest went a be directed thought must have made mistake when found in cigar shop man behind counter saw immediately that be stranger understood what wanted one shilling sir thank ye sir cigar sir ticket for coffee sir will only have to call waiter up stair if please sir better take cigar sir can always give to friend know well sir thank ye sir a be so good will smoke so mr harding ascended to divan with ticket for coffee cigar place seemed much more suitable to requirement than room in have dined there be to be sure strong

old waiter came up to with couple of magazine evening paper be ever anything so civil must have cup of coffee must prefer sherbet sherbet be absolutely in eastern divan with slight addition of london

chess though chess player be not equal to so declined putting up weary leg on sofa leisurely sipped coffee turned over page of blackwood might have be so engaged for about hour for old waiter enticed to second cup of coffee when musical clock began to play mr harding then closed magazine keeping place with finger lay listening with closed eye to clock soon clock seemed to turn into violoncello with piano accompaniment mr harding began to fancy old waiter be bishop of barchester be inexpressibly shocked that bishop must have brought coffee with own hand then dr grantly came in with basket full of lobster must not be induced to leave downstairs in kitchen then warden must quite understand why so many people must smoke in bishop drawing room so fell fast asleep dream wandered away to

explained to lawyer that knew nothing of although have heard in roundabout way that intention have be talked of also at length succeeded in making sir abraham understand that even did not satisfy attorney general stood up put hand into breech pocket raised eyebrow a mr harding proceeded to detail grievance from now wished to rid know have right to trouble personally with matter a be of most vital importance to a happiness be concerned in thought might venture to seek advice sir abraham bowed declared client be entitled to best advice must give particularly client so respectable in way a

there be further ground for question see that have power of raising can resign said mr harding slowly playing away with right hand a though bow be beneath chair in be sitting what throw up altogether said attorney general gazing with utter astonishment at client did see article in jupiter said mr harding piteously appealing to sympathy of lawyer sir abraham said have seen poor little clergyman

eighty pound year also that meant to fall back upon own little living of crabtree be eighty pound that to be sure duty of two be hardly compatible perhaps might effect exchange then recollecting that attorney general must hardly care to hear how service of cathedral church be divided among minor canon stopped short in explanation sir abraham listened in pitying wonder really think mr harding have better wait for archdeacon be most serious step one for in opinion there be not slightest necessity a have done honour of asking advice must implore to hing without approval of friend man be never best judge of own position man be best judge of what feel 'd sooner beg bread till death than read such article a two have appeared feel a do that writer have truth on side have not daughter mr

impertinent surely be must be prudent on behalf be young doe not know meaning of living on income of hundred sixty pound year on account give up idea believe be sheer quixotism warden walked away to window then back to chair then irresolute what to say took turn to window attorney general be really extremely patient be beginning to think that interview have be long enough if income be not justly mine what if have to beg said warden at last sharply in voice so different from that have hitherto used that sir abraham be startled if so must be better to beg dear sir nobody now question justness yes sir abraham one doe question most important of witness against question god know whether love daughter must sooner that must beg than must live in comfort on money be truly property of poor may seem strange to sir abraham be strange to myself must have be ten year in happy home not have thought of thing till be so roughly dinned into ear can not boast of conscience when required violence of

allowed to stand thus erect with finger of left hand stopped with preternatural velocity multitude of string ranged from top of collar to bottom of lappet of coat sir abraham listened looked in wonder a have never before seen mr harding meaning of wild gesticulation be lost upon perceived that gentleman who have few minute since be so subdued a to be unable to speak without hesitation be now impassioned nay almost violent will sleep on mr harding to morrow have done more than sleep upon said warden have lain awake upon that night after night found must not sleep upon now hope to do so attorney general have answer to make to so expressed quiet hope that settlement be finally made must be satisfactory mr harding withdrew thanking great man for kind attention mr harding be sufficiently satisfied with interview to feel glow of comfort a descended into small old square of lincoln inn be calm bright beautiful night by light of moon even chapel of lincoln inn sombre row of chamber surround quadrangle looked well stood still moment to collect thought reflect on what have done be about to do knew that attorney general regarded a little better than fool that did not mind attorney general have not much in common between knew also that others whom did care about must think so too eleanor be sure must exult in what have done bishop trusted must sympathise with in meantime have to meet archdeacon so walked slowly down chancery lane along fleet street feeling sure that work for night be not yet over when reached hotel rang bell quietly with palpitating heart almost longed to escape round corner delay coming storm by further walk round st paul churchyard heard slow creaking shoe of old waiter approaching stood ground manfully chapter xviii warden be very obstinate dr grantly be here sir greeted ear before door be well open mr grantly have sitting room above be waiting up for there be something in tone of man voice seemed to indicate that even looked upon warden a runaway schoolboy just recaptured by guardian that pitied culprit though must not be horrified at crime warden endeavoured to appear unconcerned a said oh indeed will go upstairs at once failed signally there be perhaps ray of comfort in presence of married daughter be to say of comparative comfort seeing that son in law be there how much must have preferred that must have be safe at plumstead episcopi however upstairs went waiter slowly preceding on door being opened archdeacon be discovered standing in middle of room erect indeed a usual oh how sorrowful on dingy sofa behind reclined patient wife papa thought be never coming back said lady be twelve o'clock yes dear said warden attorney general named ten for meeting to be sure ten be late what must do know great men will have own way gave daughter kiss shook hand with doctor again tried to look unconcerned have absolutely be with attorney general asked archdeacon mr harding signified that have good heaven how unfortunate archdeacon raised huge hand in manner in friend be so accustomed to see express disapprobation astonishment what will sir abraham think of did not know that be not customary for client to go direct to counsel be asked warden innocently well at rate have done now sir abraham did seem to think so very strange archdeacon gave sigh must have moved man of war papa what did say to sir abraham asked lady asked dear to explain john hiram will to must explain in only way must have satisfied so resigned wardenship resigned said archdeacon in solemn voice sad low yet sufficiently audible sort of whisper that macready must have envied gallery have applauded with couple of round resigned good heaven dignitary of church sank back horrified into horsehair arm chair at least told sir abraham must resign of course must now do so not at said archdeacon catching ray of hope nothing that say in such way to own counsel can be in way binding on of course be there to ask advice be sure sir abraham did not advise such step mr harding must not say that have be sure disadvised from continued reverend cross examiner mr harding must not deny be sure sir abraham must have advised to consult friend to proposition also mr harding be obliged to assent then threat of resignation amount to nothing be just where be before mr harding be now standing on rug moving uneasily from one foot to other made distinct answer to archdeacon last proposition for mind be chiefly engaged on thinking how must escape to bed that resignation be thing finally fixed on fact completed be not in mind matter of doubt knew own weakness knew how prone be to be led be not weak enough to give way now to go back from position to conscience have driven after having purposely come to london to declare determination did not in least doubt resolution greatly doubted power of defending against son in law must be very tired susan said must like to go to bed susan did want to go till husband went have idea that papa might be bullied if be away be tired at at least said so archdeacon be pacing room expressing by certain nod of head opinion of utter fatuity of father in law why at last said angel might have blushed at rebuke expressed in tone emphasis why did go off from barchester so suddenly why did take step without giving notice after what have passed at palace warden hung head made reply must not condescend to say that have not intended to give son in law slip a have not courage to avow said nothing papa have be too much for said lady archdeacon took turn again ejaculated good heaven time in very low whisper still audible think will go to bed said warden taking up side candle at rate will promise to take further step without consultation said archdeacon mr harding made answer slowly proceeded to light candle of course continued other such declaration a that made to sir abraham mean nothing come warden promise whole affair see be already settled that with very little trouble expense bold have be compelled to abandon action have to do be to remain quiet at hospital mr harding still made reply looked meekly into son in law face archdeacon thought knew father in law be mistaken thought that have already talked over vacillating man to resign promise come said promise susan to give up idea of resigning wardenship warden looked at daughter thinking probably at moment that if eleanor be contented with need not so much regard other child said be sure susan will not ask to break word to do what know to be wrong papa said must be madness in to throw up preferment what be to live on god feed young raven will take care of also said mr harding with smile a though afraid of giving offence by making reference to scripture too solemn pish said archdeacon turning away rapidly if raven persisted in refusing food prepared for must be fed clergyman generally dislike to be met in argument by scriptural quotation feel a affronted a doctor doe when recommended by old woman to take favourite dose a lawyer when unprofessional man attempt to put down by quibble will have living of crabtree modestly suggested warden eighty pound year sneered archdeacon precentorship said father in law go with wardenship said son in law mr harding be prepared to argue point began to do so dr grantly stopped dear warden said be nonsense eighty pound hundred sixty make very little difference ca live on ca ruin eleanor prospect for ever in point of fact ca resign bishop must accept whole thing be settled what now want to do be to prevent inconvenient tittle tattle more newspaper article be what want too said warden to prevent continued other must let talk of resignation get abroad will resign said warden very very meekly good heaven susan dear what can say to papa said mr grantly getting up putting arm through of father what be eleanor to do if throw away income hot tear stood in of warden eye a looked round upon married daughter why must one sister who be so rich predict poverty for such idea a be on mind gave utterance to then thought of pelican feeding young with blood from own breast gave utterance to then of eleanor waiting for at home waiting to congratulate on end of trouble think of eleanor papa said mr grantly do think of said father will not do rash thing lady be really moved beyond usual calm composure can never be rash to do right said will certainly resign wardenship then mr harding there be nothing before ruin said archdeacon now moved beyond endurance ruin for eleanor how do mean to pay monstrous expense of action mr grantly suggested that a action be abandoned cost must not be heavy indeed will dear continued one can not have attorney general up at twelve o'clock at night for nothing of course father have not thought of will sell furniture said warden furniture ejaculated other with most powerful sneer come archdeacon said lady need mind at present know never expected papa to pay cost such absurdity be enough to provoke job said archdeacon marching quickly up down room father be like child eight hundred pound year eight hundred eighty with house with nothing to do very place for to throw up because scoundrel writes article in newspaper well have done duty if chooses to ruin child can not help stood still at fire place looked at in dingy mirror stood on chimney piece there be pause for about minute then warden finding that nothing else be coming lighted candle quietly said good night good night papa said lady so warden retired a closed door behind heard well known ejaculation slower lower more solemn more ponderous than ever good heaven chapter xix warden resigns party met next morning at breakfast very sombre affair be very unlike breakfast at plumstead episcopi there be three thin small dry bit of bacon inch long served up under huge old plated cover there be four three cornered bit of dry toast four square bit of buttered toast there be loaf of bread oily looking butter on sideboard there be remains of cold shoulder of mutton archdeacon however have not come up from rectory to st paul churchyard to enjoy therefore nothing be said of scanty fare guest be a sorry a viand hardly anything be said over breakfast table archdeacon munched toast in ominous silence turning over bitter thought in deep mind warden tried to talk to daughter tried to answer failed there be feeling at present in common between warden be thinking only of getting back to barchester calculating whether archdeacon must expect to wait for mr grantly be preparing for grand attack be to make on father a agreed upon between herself husband during curtain confabulation of morning when waiter have creaked out of room with last of teacup archdeacon got up went to window a though to admire view room looked out on narrow passage run from st paul churchyard to paternoster row dr grantly patiently perused name of three shopkeeper whose door be in view warden still kept seat at table examined pattern of tablecloth mr grantly seating on sofa began to knit after while warden pulled bradshaw out of pocket began laboriously to consult there be train for barchester at be be out of question for be nearly ten already at pm night mail train at pm three o'clock train must take home to tea must suit very well dear said think will go back home at three o'clock to day will get home at half past eight think there be anything to keep in archdeacon return by early train to morrow papa wo wait go back with why eleanor will expect tonight have so much to do much to do said archdeacon sotto voce warden heard 'd better wait for papa thank ye dear think will go afternoon tamest animal will turn when driven too hard even mr harding be beginning to fight for own way suppose wo be back before three said lady addressing husband must leave at two said warden quite out of question said archdeacon answering wife still reading shopkeeper name suppose will be back till five there be long pause during mr harding continued to study bradshaw must go to cox cummins said archdeacon at last oh to cox cummins said warden be quite matter of indifference to where son in law went name of cox cummins have now no interest in ear what have to do with cox cummins further having already have suit finally adjudicated upon in court of conscience judgment without power of appeal fully registered matter settled so that lawyer in london must not disturb archdeacon must go to cox cummins must remain there day in anxious discussion what might be said there be longer matter of interest to who be so soon to lay aside name of warden of barchester hospital archdeacon took up shining new clerical hat put on black new clerical glove looked heavy respectable decorous opulent decided clergyman of church of england inch of suppose will see at day after to morrow said warden supposed must must once more beseech to take further step till see father if owe nothing archdeacon looked a though thought great deal be due to at least owe so much to father without waiting for reply dr grantly wended way to cox cummins mr grantly waited till last fall of husband foot be heard a turned out of court into st paul churchyard then commenced task of talking father over papa began be most serious business indeed be said warden ringing bell greatly feel distress of mind must have endured be sure do dear ordered waiter to bring pen ink paper be going to write papa yes dear be going to write resignation to bishop pray pray papa put off till return pray put off till have seen bishop dear papa for sake for eleanor be for sake eleanor do hope at least that child may never have to be ashamed of father how can talk about shame papa stopped while waiter creaked in with paper then slowly creaked out again how can talk about shame know what friend think about question warden spread paper on table placing on meagre blotting book hotel afforded sat down to write wo refuse one request papa continued daughter wo refuse to delay letter for two short day two day can make possible difference dear said naively if waited till got to barchester might perhaps be prevented surely must not wish to offend bishop said god forbid bishop be not apt to take offence know too well to take in bad part anything may be called on to do papa susan said mind on subject be made up be not without much repugnance act in opposition to advice of such men a sir abraham haphazard archdeacon in matter can take advice can not alter resolution to have come two day papa can delay may add to present unhappiness by pressing can not change purpose will be comfort to if will let matter rest dipping pen into inkstand fixed eye intently on paper there be something in manner taught daughter to perceive that be in earnest have at one time ruled supreme in father house knew that there be moment when mild meek a be must have way present be occasion of sort returned therefore to knitting very shortly after left room warden be now at liberty to compose letter a be characteristic of man will be given at full length official letter when written seemed to to be too formally cold to be sent alone to so dear friend be accompanied by private note be here inserted letter of resignation ran a follows chapter hotel st paul london august lord bishop be with greatest pain that feel constrained to resign into lordship hand wardenship of hospital at barchester so kindly conferred upon now nearly twelve year since need not explain circumstance have made step appear necessary to be aware that question have arisen a to right of warden to income have be allotted to wardenship have seemed to that right be not well made out hesitate to incur risk of taking income to legal claim appears doubtful office of precentor of cathedral be a lordship be aware joined to of warden be to say precentor have for many year be warden of hospital there be however nothing to make junction of two office necessary unless dean chapter object to arrangement must wish to keep precentorship income of office will now be necessary to indeed know why must be ashamed to say must have difficulty in supporting without lordship such others a may please to consult on matter will at once see that resignation of wardenship need offer not slightest bar to occupation by person be thought in wrong by whom have consulted in matter have very little inward unguided conviction of own to bring to step will indeed be hurt to find that slur be thrown on preferment kindness bestowed on by resignation of at rate for one will look on successor whom may appoint a enjoying clerical situation of highest respectability one to lordship nomination give indefeasible right can not finish official letter without again thanking lordship for great kindness beg to subscribe lordship most obedient servant septimus harding warden of barchester hospital precentor of cathedral then wrote following private note dear bishop can not send accompanying official letter without warmer expression of thanks for kindness than must befit document may to certain degree be made public know will understand feeling perhaps pity weakness make resign hospital be not made of calibre strong enough to withstand public attack be convinced that stood on ground perfectly firm be certainly justified in taking eight hundred year under hiram will must feel bound by duty to retain position however unendurable might be nature of assault a feel conviction can not believe that will think wrong in what be doing have at one time idea of keeping only moderate portion of income perhaps three hundred year of remitting remainder to trustee occurred to think with reason by so doing must place successor in invidious position greatly damage patronage dear friend let have line from to say that blame for what be doing that officiating vicar of crabtree parva will be same to a warden of hospital be very anxious about precentorship archdeacon think must go with wardenship think not that having can not be ousted will however be guided by dean other duty will suit so well come so much within power of adequate performance thank from heart for preferment be now giving up for kindness be dear bishop now a always yours most sincerely septimus harding london august having written letter made copy of former one for benefit of archdeacon mr harding whom must now cease to call warden having designated so for last time found that be nearly two o'clock that must prepare for journey yes from time never again admitted name by have be so familiarly known in to tell truth have rejoiced love of title be common to men vicar fellow be a pleased at becoming mr archdeacon mr provost a lieutenant at getting captaincy city tallow chandler in becoming sir john on occasion of queen visit to new bridge warden be no longer name of precentor though office be to so dear confers in sufficient distinction friend therefore again became mr harding mr grantly have gone out have therefore one to delay by further entreaty to postpone journey have soon arranged bag paid bill leaving note for daughter in put copy of official letter got into cab drove away to station with something of triumph in heart have not cause for triumph have not be supremely successful have not for first time in life held own purpose against of son in law manfully combated against great odds against archdeacon wife a well a archdeacon have not gained great victory be not fit that must step into cab with triumph have not told eleanor when must return be on look out for by train by must arrive pony carriage be at barchester station when train drew up at platform dear said sitting beside a steered little vessel to one side of road to make room for clattering omnibus a passed from station into town hope will be able to feel proper degree of respect for vicar of crabtree dear papa said be so glad there be great comfort in returning home to pleasant house though be to leave so soon in discussing with daughter that have done that have to do must take time to get out of one house into curate at crabtree must not be abolished under six month be unless other provision must be made for then furniture most of must be sold to pay sir abraham haphazard for sitting up till twelve at night mr harding be strangely ignorant a to lawyer bill have idea from twenty pound to two thousand a to sum in be indebted for legal assistance true have called in lawyer true have be no consenting party to employment of cox cummins sir abraham have never be consulted on such matter archdeacon have managed never for moment suspecting that mr harding must take upon to end matter in way of own have lawyer bill be ten thousand pound mr harding must not have helped be not on account disposed to dispute own liability question never occurred to did occur to that have very little money at banker that must receive nothing further from hospital that sale of furniture be only resource not papa said eleanor pleadingly not quite dear said be if can help must have little at crabtree can only be little must put bold front on nelly be easy to come down from affluence to poverty so planned future mode of life father taking comfort from reflection that daughter must soon be freed from resolving that father must soon have in own house ready mean of escape from solitude of crabtree vicarage when archdeacon left wife father in law at chapter coffee house to go to messrs cox cummins have very defined idea of what have to do when got there gentleman when at law in way engaged in matter requiring legal assistance be very apt to go to lawyer without much absolute necessity gentleman when doing so be apt to describe such attendance a quite compulsory very disagreeable lawyer on other hand at see necessity though quite agree a to disagreeable nature of visit gentleman when so engaged be usually somewhat gravelled at finding nothing to say to learned friend generally talk little politics little weather ask few foolish question about suit then withdraw having passed hour in small dingy waiting room in company with junior assistant clerk ten minute with member of firm business be then over for gentleman have come up to london probably distance of hundred fifty mile to be sure go to play dines at friend club have bachelor liberty bachelor recreation for three four day must not probably plead desire of such gratification a reason to wife for trip to london married lady when husband find be positively obliged to attend legal adviser nature of duty to be performed be generally of description archdeacon must not have dreamt of leaving london without going to cox cummins yet have nothing to say to game be up plainly saw that mr harding in matter be not to be moved only remaining business on head be to pay bill have done with think may be taken for granted that cause may be that take gentleman to lawyer chamber never go there to pay bill dr grantly however in eye of messrs cox cummins represented spirituality of diocese of barchester a mr chadwick did temporality be therefore too great man to undergo half hour in clerk room will not be necessary that must listen to note of sorrow in archdeacon bewailed to mr cox weakness of father in law end of hope of triumph need repeat various exclamation of surprise with mournful intelligence be received tragedy occurred though mr cox short somewhat bull necked man be very near fit of apoplexy when first attempted to ejaculate that fatal word resign over over again did mr cox attempt to enforce on archdeacon propriety of urging on mr warden madness of deed be about to do eight hundred year said mr cox nothing whatever to do said mr cummins who have joined conference private fortune believe said mr cox not shilling said mr cummins in very low voice shaking head never heard of such case in experience said mr cox eight hundred year a nice house a gentleman must wish to hang up hat in said mr cummins unmarried daughter believe said mr cox with much moral seriousness in tone archdeacon only sighed a separate wail be uttered shook head signifying that fatuity of people be past belief will tell what might do said mr cummins brightening up will tell how might save let exchange exchange where said archdeacon exchange for living there be quiverful of puddingdale have twelve child must be delighted to get hospital to be sure puddingdale be only four hundred must be saving something out of fire mr harding must have curate still keep three hundred three hundred fifty archdeacon opened ear listened really thought scheme might do newspaper continued mr cummins might hammer away at quiverful day for next six month without minding archdeacon took up hat returned to hotel thinking matter over deeply at rate must sound quiverful man with twelve child must do much to double income chapter xx farewell on morning after mr harding return home received note from bishop full of affection condolence praise pray come to at once wrote bishop that may see what have better be done a to hospital will not say word to dissuade like going to crabtree at rate come to at once mr harding did go to at once long confidential be consultation between two old friend there sat together whole long day plotting to get better of archdeacon to carry out little scheme of own knew must be opposed by whole weight of authority bishop first idea be that mr harding if left to must certainly starve not in figurative sense in so many of lady gentleman do starve on income from one to five hundred year not that must be starved a regarded dress coat port wine pocket money that must positively perish of inanition for want of bread how be man to live when give up income said bishop to then good natured little man began to consider how friend might be best rescued from death so horrid painful first proposition to mr harding be that must live together at palace bishop positively assured mr harding that wanted resident chaplain not young working chaplain steady middle aged chaplain one who must dine drink glass of wine with talk about archdeacon poke fire bishop did not positively name duty gave mr harding to understand such must be nature of service required be not without much difficulty that mr harding made friend see that must not suit that must not throw up bishop preferment then come hang on at bishop table that must not allow people to say of that be easy matter to abandon own income a be able to sponge on of person succeeded however in explaining that plan must not do then bishop brought forward have in sleeve bishop have in will left certain money to mr harding two daughter imagining that mr harding must want such assistance during own lifetime legacy amounted to three thousand pound duty free now pressed a gift on friend girl know said will have just same when be gone wo want sooner a for interest during lifetime be worth talking about have more than enough with much difficulty heartfelt sorrow mr harding refused also offer wish be to support however poorly not to be supported on charity of anyone be hard to make bishop understand be hard to make comprehend that only real favour must confer be continuation of independent friendship at last even be done at rate thought bishop will come dine with from time to time if be absolutely starving will see touching precentorship bishop be clearly of opinion that must be held without other situation opinion from one differed be therefore soon settled among party concerned that mr harding must still be precentor of cathedral on day following mr harding return archdeacon reached plumstead full of mr cummins scheme regarding puddingdale mr quiverful on very next morning drove over to puddingdale obtained full consent of wretched clerical priam who be endeavouring to feed poor hecuba dozen of hector on small proceeds of ecclesiastical kingdom mr quiverful have doubt a to legal right of warden conscience must be quite clear a to accepting income a to jupiter begged to assure archdeacon that be quite indifferent to emanation from profane portion of periodical press having so far succeeded next sounded bishop here be astonished by most unexpected resistance bishop did not think must do why not seeing that father be not shaken repeated question in severer form why not do lord lordship looked very unhappy shuffled about in chair still did give way thought puddingdale must do for mr harding be too far from barchester oh of course will have curate bishop also thought that mr quiverful must do for hospital exchange must look well at time when pressed harder declared did think mr harding must accept of puddingdale under circumstance how be to live demanded archdeacon bishop with tear in eye declared that have not slightest conception how life be to be sustained within at archdeacon then left father went down to hospital mr harding must listen at to puddingdale scheme to eye have attraction savoured of simony be likely to bring down upon harder more deserved stricture than have yet received positively declined to become vicar of puddingdale under circumstance archdeacon waxed wroth talked big looked bigger said something about dependence beggary spoke of duty man be under to earn bread made passing allusion to folly of youth waywardness of age a though mr harding be afflicted by ended by declaring that have done felt that have left no stone unturned to arrange matter on best easiest footing that have in fact so arranged that have so managed that there be further need of anxiety in matter how have be paid advice have be systematically rejected have be not only slighted distrusted avoided measure have be utterly thrown over a have be sir abraham who have reason to know be much pained at what have occurred now found be useless to interfere further must retire if further assistance be required from must probably be called on must be again happy to come forward so left hospital have not since entered from day to here must take leave of archdeacon grantly fear that be represented in page a being worse than be have have to do with foible not with virtue have seen only weak side of man have lacked opportunity of bringing forward on strong ground that be man somewhat too fond of own way not sufficiently scrupulous in manner of achieving best friend can not deny that be bigoted in favour not so much of doctrine a of cloth be also true be true that possession of large income be desire that sits near heart nevertheless archdeacon be gentleman man of conscience spends money liberally doe work have to do with best of ability improves tone of society of among whom life aspiration be of healthy if not of highest kind though never austere man upholds propriety of conduct by example precept be generous to poor hospitable to rich in matter of religion be sincere yet pharisee be in earnest yet fanatic on whole archdeacon of barchester be man doing more good than harm man to be furthered supported though perhaps also to be controlled be matter of regret to that course of narrative have required that must see more of weakness than strength mr harding allowed rest till everything be prepared for departure from hospital may be a well to mention that be not driven to stern necessity of selling furniture have be quite in earnest in intention to do so be soon made known to that claim of messrs cox cummins made such step obligatory archdeacon have
